	<brief_summary>STIMO is a First-in-Man (FIM) study to confirm the safety and feasibility of a closed-loop Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) in combination with overground robot assisted rehabilitation training for patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Patients will participate during 9-11 months, during which there will be - Pre-implant evaluations (6-8 weeks) - Device implantation and stimulation optimization (6-8 weeks) - Overground rehabilitation training with EES (5-6 months) In the period after implantation, participants need to be present for testing and training, 4 days per week at the CHUV University Hospital in Lausanne (lodging can be provided). At the end of the protocol, the study aims to make the patients walk better and faster, however, as this is the first study of its kind, success is not guaranteed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STIMO: Epidural Electrical Simulation (EES) With Robot-assisted Rehabilitation in Patients With Spinal Cord Injury.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STIMO is a First-in-Man (FIM) study with the objective to confirm the safety and feasibility of a closed-loop Epidural Electrical Stimulation (EES) in combination with overground robot assisted rehabilitation training for patients with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), as it was previously demonstrated successfully in animals. The study lasts about 9-11 months for each individual participant, from signing informed consent to the final test in the study. The period can be divided in 3 distinct phases: - Pre-implant: about 6-8 weeks from informed consent to implant. During this phase, patient will participate during a total of 6 distinct days of evaluations, of which 5 days in Lausanne and 1 day at the assessment center in Zurich. - Implant and stimulation optimization: about 6-8 weeks, including the implantation of the epidural lead and the neurostimulator. In this phase, the optimal stimulation parameters will be determined for the flexing and stretching of both legs. During this period, participants need to be present 4-5 days per week at the CHUV University Hospital in Lausanne (lodging can be provided). â€¢ Rehabilitation training and final evaluation: 4 days per week of rehabilitation training during a period of 5 months, followed by a final evaluation lasting 4 days in Lausanne and 1 day in Zurich. In this phase, the patients receive intensive overground rehabilitation training using a body weight support device in combination with EES, with the aim of improving the walking capabilities of the patient significantly. During this period, participants need to be present 4 days per week at the CHUV University Hospital in Lausanne (lodging can be provided). At the end of the protocol, the study aims to make the patients walk better and faster, as is quantified through the pre-defined measures which are assessed prior to implant and at the end of the study. As this is the first study of its kind, success is not guaranteed, but the potential benefits outweigh over the potential risks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1865 (women or men) Incomplete SCI graded as AIS C &amp; D Level of lesion: T10 and above, based on AIS level determination by the PI, with preservation of conus function The intact distance between the cone and the lesion must be at least 60mm Focal spinal cord disorder caused by either trauma or epidural, subdural or intramedullary bleeding Minimum 12 months postinjury Completed inpatient rehabilitation program Able to stand with walker or 2 crutches Stable medical and physical condition as considered by Investigators Adequate caregiver support and access to appropriate medical care in patient's home community Agree to comply in good faith with all conditions of the study and to attend all required study training and visits Must participate in two training sessions before enrolment Must provide and sign Informed Consent prior to any study related procedures Limitation of walking function based on accompanying (CNS) disorders (systemic malignant disorders, cardiovascular disorders restricting physical training, peripheral nerve disorders) History of significant autonomic dysreflexia Cognitive/brain damage Epilepsy Patient who uses an intrathecal Baclofen pump. Patient who has any active implanted cardiac device such as pacemaker or defibrillator. Patient who has any indication that would require diathermy. Patient who has any indication that would require MRI. Patient that have an increased risk for defibrillation Severe joint contractures disabling or restricting lower limb movements. Haematological disorders with increased risk for surgical interventions (increased risk of haemorrhagic events). Participation in another locomotor training study. Congenital or acquired lower limb abnormalities (affection of joints and bone). Women who are pregnant (pregnancy test obligatory for woman of childbearing potential) or breast feeding or not willing to take contraception. Known or suspected noncompliance, drug or alcohol abuse. Spinal cord lesion due to either a neurodegenerative disease or a tumour. Patient has other anatomic or comorbid conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could limit the patient's ability to participate in the study or to comply with followup requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the study results. Patient is unlikely to survive the protocol followup period of 12 months.</criteria>
