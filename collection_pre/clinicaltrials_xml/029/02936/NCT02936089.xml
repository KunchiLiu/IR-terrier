	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) /AML1-ETO-positive (AE AML) is a heterogeneous disease entailing different prognoses.There were significant differences in the therapeutic effect between different subgroups of AE AML. For example, patients with c-kit mutation had higher relapse rate and lower overall survival, compared with those without c-kit mutation. Therefore, risk stratification-directed therapy is very necessary for AE AML. The purpose of this study is to establish risk stratification-directed therapy for AE AML.</detailed_description>
