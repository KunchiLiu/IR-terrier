	<brief_summary>The etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia remains unclear. Immune dysfunction hypothesis for schizophrenia has attracted increasing attention of the researchers, substantial evidences suggested the levels of C-reaction protein and cytokine such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α markedly elevated in patients with schizophrenia which may be particularly relevant for the cognitive impairment and metabolic disturbance of schizophrenia. In recent years, it has been demonstrated the beneficial effects of berberine on regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, reducing the proinflammatory status and improving cognition. As the investigators known, the report of berberine being used in schizophrenia is rare. This protocol is aim to evaluate berberine, as an adjunctive therapy, on inflammatory markers, lipid and glucose metabolism, cognition in patients with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
