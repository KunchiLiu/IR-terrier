	<brief_summary>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is increasingly effective to treat Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries. This trial will examine modern dissection and re-entry approaches to treat more complex CTO lesions with the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DISsection RE-entry Evaluation With Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds in CTO.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study, with the aim of hypothesis generation. This research aims to establish the feasibility and safety of treating chronic total occlusions using dissection and re-entry techniques in combination with everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (Absorb BVS). Primary aims of the study are: - To demonstrate a low rate of Target Vessel Failure (stent thrombosis, restenosis or late closure) at 12 and 24 months after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVS - To demonstrate a high degree of endothelial stent strut coverage at 12 and 24 moths after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVSThe primary outcome measure is</detailed_description>
