	<brief_title>Brain Morphometry in OA Patients Treated With Duloxetine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, all the participants will be receiving placebo. However this study will be single blinded in that participants will be told that they will be given a pill that may or may not help with their pain. The researcher, however, will know that all participants are receiving placebo At the initial visit, participants will undergo screening to determine that they meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will sign consent and then complete pain assessment instruments as well as one high resolution anatomical scan (T1) and one functional scan (a resting scar) in a 3 Tesla magnet. A single scanning session comprised of a 10 minute functional scan (a resting scan) will be done two weeks from the first scan and pain assessment instruments will be completed at this visit as well. After finishing this second scan (done two weeks after the initial scan), the participants will have completed the study.</detailed_description>
