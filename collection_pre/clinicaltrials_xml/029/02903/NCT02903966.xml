	<brief_summary>This study is the first experience with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase inhibitor, in subjects with active ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary objective will be to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 60 mg or placebo twice daily for 42 days (Part A) followed by open label with GSK298772 60 mg twice daily for 42 days (Part B). In addition to pharmacokinetics (PK), a number of experimental and clinical endpoints will be employed to obtain information on the pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy in subjects with active UC. Although no formal hypothesis will be tested, these endpoints will enable a broader understanding of the mechanism of action and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK2982772 in UC. Within 30 Days of screening visit, subjects will be randomized to receive either GSK2982772 60 mg or placebo orally twice daily for 42 Days (6 weeks) in a 2:1 ratio in Part A study. Subjects who complete the Part A study will move to open label Part B study to receive GSK2982772 60 mg twice daily for an additional 42 Days (6 weeks). After the open label (Part B) treatment period, subject will enter the Follow-up period which lasts for 28 Days (+/- 3 Days) post the last administration of study medication. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 20 Weeks from screening to the last study visit.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Subjects that do not have any medical conditions, other than active UC, that in the opinion of the Investigator put the subject at unacceptable risk or interfere with study assessments or integrity of the data. These medical conditions should be stable at the time of screening and are expected to remain stable for the duration of the study. Subject has had a confirmed diagnosis of active UC, as documented by complete diagnostic colonoscopy to the terminal ileum with biopsy at least 3 months prior to screening. A Complete Mayo Score of &gt;=3 points and endoscopy sub score of 2 to 3 at screening, despite concurrent treatment with at least 1 of the following (oral corticosteroids or any oral 5aminosalicylates (5ASA) or purine analogues or all as defined): Oral 5ASA at a stable dose (equivalent to &gt;=2.4 grams per day (g/day) of Asacol) for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose. Must remain on a stable dose until end of treatment; Purine analogues (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thiopurines) or methotrexate for at least 12 weeks prior to first dose. Must remain on a stable dose until end of treatment; Stable low dose oral corticosteroid (up to 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent) for 2 weeks prior to sigmoidoscopy. Must remain on a stable dose until end of treatment. If on rectal 5ASA or corticosteroids, must remain on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose. Must remain on stable dose until the end of treatment. Subject is naive to any biological therapies for UC. OR Subject may have had previous exposure to a single antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agent which was discontinued for reasons other than primary nonresponse more than 8 weeks (or 5 half lives whichever is longer) prior to first dose. Note: Exposure to a single antiTNF is not required in addition to inclusion criteria listed above (number fourth and fifth on the list). A body mass index (BMI) within range of 18.5 to 35 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive) at screening. Male and Female subjects: Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the contraception requirements. Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Nonreproductive potential; Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until at least 2 days after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and protocol. Subject with diagnosis of indeterminate colitis, Crohn's Disease, infectious colitis, or ischemic colitis. Subject with fulminant UC, or UC limited to the rectum (disease extent &lt;15 centimeters (cm) from the anal verge). Subject with previous small bowel or colonic surgery, histological evidence of colonic dysplasia or bowel stricture. Subject with colostomy, fistulae or known symptomatic stenosis of the intestine. Subject with toxic megacolon. Subject with positive Clostridium difficile toxin test or active/previous colonic cytomegalo virus (CMV) infection. Subject with current history of suicidal ideation behavior (SIB) as measures using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) or history of attempted suicide. An active infection, or a history of infections as follows: Hospitalization for treatment of infection within 60 days before first dose (Day 1). Currently on any suppressive therapy for a chronic infection (such as pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster and atypical mycobacteria). Use of parenteral (intravenous (IV) or intramuscular) antibiotics (antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, or antiparasitic agents) for an infection within 60 days before first dose. A history of opportunistic infections within 1 year of screening (example: pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV pnemonitis, aspergillosis).

Recurrent or chronic infection or other active infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator might cause this study to be detrimental to the patient. History of tuberculosis (TB), irrespective of treatment status. A positive diagnostic TB test at screening defined as a positive QuantiFERONTB Gold test or Tspot test. In cases where the QuantiFERON or Tspot test is indeterminate, the subject may have the test repeated once, but they will not be eligible for the study unless the second test is negative. In cases where the QuantiFERON or Tspot test is positive, but a followup chest xray, locally read by a radiologist, shows no evidence of current or previous pulmonary tuberculosis, the subject may be eligible for the study at the discretion of the Investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor.
