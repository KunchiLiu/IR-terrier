	<brief_summary>Given the high incidence of Pompe's Disease in French Guiana (100 times higher than in mainland France) the aim is to determine the prevalence of heterozygotes among women having just delivered in French Guiana who accepted that their newborn child enters the depipomp1 study. In these women the specific mutations p.Gly648Ser and p.Arg854X will be sought using PCR in order to calculate the prevalence of these mutations and estimate the risk factors associated with them in order to improve genetic counselling.</brief_summary>
