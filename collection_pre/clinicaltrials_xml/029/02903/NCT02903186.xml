	<brief_title>Multi-site Trial Using SMS to Improve Infant Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this multi-site clinical trial are to pilot test weekly SMS sent to parents/caregivers of infants to improve feeding practices and decrease excessive weight gain in infants who are participants of the WIC program in two distinct locations, Puerto Rico and Hawaii; to assess acceptability and practicality of the intervention; and to assess acceptability of collecting blood spots in future studies. The investigators will recruit a convenience sample of parent/caregivers of infants 0-2 months participating in the WIC program in Puerto Rico and Hawaii to send weekly SMS for 4 months. The weekly messages will focus on reinforcing the breastfeeding messages provided by WIC, preventing overfeeding, delaying introduction of solid foods, and delaying and reducing baby juice consumption, which are key issues in low-income populations. Participants will complete validated questionnaires and anthropometry before and after the trial and results will be compared to the control group (no messages). Participants will also answer short questions by SMS at different points and an interview at the end of the trial to assess the SMS. The investigators will assess how many participants agree to collect blood spots in their infants in future studies.</detailed_description>
