	<brief_summary>Malaria is still endemic in the interior of French Guiana. mixed infections by 2 or more different malaria parasites lead to complex and potentially harmfull therapeutic problems. The aim of the study was to look at malaria smears between 2000 and 2008 and determine using PCR the frequency of mixed infections, and their distribution in the terrtory of French Guiana. Overall 10.75% of 400 smears showed mixed infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax. The Maroni river where Duffy negative populations live was largely devoid of vivax infections. These results suggest that mixed infections are frequent in french guiana except on the Maroni river which leads to practical implications for clinicians facing a patient with clinical malaria.</brief_summary>
