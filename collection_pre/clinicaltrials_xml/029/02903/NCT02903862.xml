	<detailed_description>This study will track the mental status and cognition of caregivers with and without the Mindoula and DANA intervention and use subject feedback to aid in designing future interventions for caregivers. This is a remotely administered, virtual study targeting dementia caregivers who are mild to moderately depressed. Screening calls for online administration of four surveys to determine inclusion in the study arms. These surveys will be taken on the Health-eBrain website, both at baseline/screening and throughout participation. All other participation will be completed on the participant's mobile phone, and all psychological and cognitive tests will be self-administered. This study has a between-group design. Participants will be screened for eligibility and then randomized into each arm. The intervention arm will receive the Mindoula plus DANA intervention. The wait list control arm will take the psychological surveys at regular intervals then, after 12 weeks, be enrolled in the DANA-only observation group. The DANA-only group will take DANA and a usability questionnaire.</detailed_description>
