	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where circulating immune cells destroy the beta-cells in the pancreas that make insulin, resulting in a degree of insulin deficiency, whereby blood glucose levels rise and diabetes develops. When there is severe insulin deficiency, life-threatening ketoacidosis can develop. Treatment is lifelong insulin replacement therapy; dietary intervention is a also cornerstone of glucose management. The Optimise Diet is a multi-pronged diet based on "best health" principles: to minimise blood glucose rises after eating, reduce the immune cells involved in destruction of the insulin-secreting beta-cells, and improve the gut microbiome and systemic inflammation. In this study, its effects will be compared to the Standard Diabetes Diet that is currently recommended in Australia and internationally.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale for this study is to determine whether a diet based on recent scientific advances in diet-induced inflammation, will improve diabetes care in people with type 1 diabetes.</detailed_description>
