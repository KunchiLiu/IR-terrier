	<brief_summary>Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a frequently diagnosis in emergency departments. Although new drugs and endoscopic techniques were easily applied in various settings in this condition, the role of local administered therapies such as antifibrinolytic agents remain unclear. The investigators aimed to compare standard therapy (proton pump inhibitors, endoscopic treatments etc.) and standard therapy + local administered tranexamic acid in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a double-blind, randomized trial.</brief_summary>
