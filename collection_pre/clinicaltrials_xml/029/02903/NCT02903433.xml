	<brief_summary>Avocados are an excellent source of fiber, potassium, magnesium, and poly- and mono-unsaturated fats. They can be a nutrient dense component of healthful dietary patterns and have the potential to improve the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles of families in the United States (US). The proposed research plan will focus on the contribution of avocado intake to the reduction in CVD risk of US families, by examining the effects of avocado intake on the overall nutritional status of families. Of particular interest is establishing these effects in ethnic populations such as Hispanics/Latinos. On average, Hispanic/Latinos are at increased risk for metabolic diseases that predispose to CVD. This 6-month cluster randomized trial in Hispanic/Latino Americans aims to accurately determine the impact of avocados on the overall dietary pattern of their families. Future research will extend the results of the current trial to a larger sample of ethnically diverse families in order to evaluate whether sustained changes occur in nutritional, cardiovascular and metabolic health status.</brief_summary>
