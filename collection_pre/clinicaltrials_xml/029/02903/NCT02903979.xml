	<brief_summary>In front of a lack of evidence to determine the best treatment for deep cavitated carious lesions, the search for an effective restorative technique, which results in a least possible discomfort to patients, and reduce the time needed for the restorative treatment, if becomes relevant. The objective of this randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of high viscosity glass ionomer cement restorations (HVGIC) compared to indirect pulp capping with calcium hydroxide cement associated with high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC) for treatment of deep lesions in primary molars, as well as the impact of treatment on quality of life, cost of procedures, the perception of parents / carers, patients and operators, and satisfaction with the techniques evaluated. Children with 4 to 8 years will be selected randomly at the Clinic for Children at the University Ibirapuera of Dentistry. 166 teeth will be randomized into two groups: (1) indirect pulp capping performed with calcium hydroxide cement, followed by restoration with HVGIC and (2) HVGIC restoration. The restorations will be evaluated after 6, 12 and 24 months by two trained examiners blinded to the treatments. The efficacy of each treatment is measured by four main outcomes, which are: (1) criteria related to the effectiveness of the restorative treatment with HVGIC compared to indirect pulp capping with calcium hydroxide cement, (2) criteria focused on the patient, (3) cost-effectiveness, (4) perception of parents and operators about the treatments. For comparison between the two groups will be used the Kaplan-Meier survival and the long-rank test. Cox regression is performed the assessment of the influence of some other variable results. For all analyzes, the significance level is set at 5%.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Children will be included that have at least one primary molar with deep cavitated carious lesions in occlusal surface. Patients will be excluded with special needs, using orthodontics devices and / or systemic diseases which may affect the oral cavity. Also, teeth with pulp exposure, spontaneous pain, mobility, presence of abscess or fistula next to the tooth, teeth with restorations, sealants or enamel formation defects will also be excluded.</criteria>
