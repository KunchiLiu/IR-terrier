	<brief_title>Analyze the Relationship Between the Density of Fat Tissue and Cellulite With the Lumbar Lordosis Degree</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two types of abdominal fat: subcutaneous adipose tissue which is more superficial, lying above the abdominal muscle wall and visceral adipose tissue, corresponding to the intra-abdominal fat witch is more harmful to health. The accumulation of fat tissue differs between genders and age. Men have a huge propensity for developing central fat and women accumulate more subcutaneous fat tissue on the gluteal-femoral region. Some authors suggest that the accumulation of fat tissue increases with age. Several studies have concluded that there is a relationship between the abdominal fat storage and the degree of lumbar curvature. In addition, some authors also suggest that there is a relationship between the degree of lumbar lordosis and cellulite, which is related to circulatory changes. However these relationships are not yet clarified in the literature.</detailed_description>
