	<brief_title>Irisin Hormone Levels in Endometrial Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of two groups. The first group was formed of the patients diagnosed endometrial hyperplasia histopathologically , and the controls were healthy women admitted to the clinic just for annual examination without any complain and symptoms. Patients in the 35-50 age range in both groups were included in the study. The histopathologic diagnosis of patients was established for Kayseri Education and Research Hospital Pathology clinics. Demographic parameters such as age, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), body weight and known familial cancer story were registered. Pregnancy, liver function disorders, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, central nerves system disease, immunosuppressive drug use, another known malignancy and excessive exercises in among one month were all exclusion criteria for the patients. 3 cc peripheral venous blood samples were taken in the patients' diagnosed endometrial hyperplasia in the course of evaluation the biopsy results and in controls during their examinations just for only once. Blood samples were centrifuged in 3200 rpm speed for 10 minutes, and stored in -80 'C until the analysis. Blood samples were evaluated on the same day after four mounts for stored first blood sample. Serum Irisin levels were evaluated with enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays kit (Catalog number: K4761-100 Biovision USA) in Kayseri Research and Education Hospital Biochemical Clinics.</detailed_description>
