	<brief_summary>The etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal contraceptive implant (ENG implant) is a highly effective method of preventing pregnancy, but it has bleeding side effects that make it unappealing for many women. The only study to demonstrate a sustained reduction in bleeding lasting for two months was the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen in users of the levonogestrel (LNG) contraceptive implant. Based on the investigators encouraging preliminary data of tamoxifen and ENG implant users, the investigators plan to perform additional studies on the impact of tamoxifen on the breakthrough bleeding experience by ENG implant users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Unfavorable Bleeding Patterns in Contraceptive Implant Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will perform a 2 phase trial for treatment of women experiencing frequent or prolonged bleeding while using the ENG contraceptive implant. The first phase will consist of a randomized, controlled, double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial over a 90-day reference period and the second phase will allow both study arms to receive open-label treatment over an additional 90-day reference period. The primary outcome of the study will be the total number of consecutive bleeding-free days in first 30 days from Day 1 of first treatment (TX1).</detailed_description>
