	<detailed_description>To determine whether the surgical implantation of a human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigmented epithelium (hESC-RPE) monolayer seeded onto a polymeric versus hESC-RPE injections into the sub retinal space is a safe procedure. 6 Patients will receive hESC-RPE cell injections (100000 cells) in the sub retinal space (2 Dry Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 2 Wet AMD with disciform scar and 2 with Stargardt's disease). Also 5 patients Dry AMD, 5 patients with Wet AMD with disciform scar and 5 patients with Stargardt's disease with receive a subretinal implantation of the hESC-RPE seeded in a monolayer in a polymeric substrate. Patients will be enrolled sequentially, and after the procedure the patients will be followed for 1 year.</detailed_description>
