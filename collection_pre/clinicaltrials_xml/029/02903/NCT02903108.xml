	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy of 0.75% Boric Acid Gel in Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The purpose of this double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of subgingival delivery of boric acid gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) on clinical and radiographic parameters and compare this method with SRP plus placebo gel alone in with chronic periodontitis (CP) patients. Methods: Thirty nine systemically healthy patients with CP are included in this study. They were divided into two groups: 1) SRP + 0.75% Boric acid gel (BA group); 2) SRP + Placebo gel (Placebo group). At baseline, 3 month, and 6 months after treatment, clinical measurements, including plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and radiographic parameters intrabony defect depth (IBD), percentage change in radiographic defect depth reduction (DDR%) were assessed.</detailed_description>
