	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a multiplexed low coherence interferometry (mLCI) endoscopic probe for mapping the epithelial types of the cervix. This vaginal mLCI probe will obtain optical measurements from the cervix. These measurements can be used to create a map of the surface cells that distinguishes ectocervical epithelia, endocervical epithelia, and the squamocolumnar junction (t-zone), which is the region where cervical dysplasia is most likely to occur.</brief_summary>
