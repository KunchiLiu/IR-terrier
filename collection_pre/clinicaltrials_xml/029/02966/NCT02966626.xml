	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is creating a health pandemic globally. Management of type 2 diabetes involves combination of lifestyle intervention and drug intervention, which includes sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin (ForxigaÂ®) was approved by the Malaysian Drug Authority for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2014. This study will describe the characteristics of patients who are prescribed dapagliflozin by diabetologists/endocrinologists in a tertiary referral center and describe their glycaemic control, weight, and renal function at baseline and during use of dapagliflozin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes among adults &gt;18 years old is 17.5% in Malaysia, where half of them are undiagnosed. Diabetes also accounts for 14.5% of all-cause mortality worldwide, with close to half of the deaths are in subjects &lt;60 years old. These highlight the importance of early diagnosis of disease, timely intervention with appropriate therapy, and treating type 2 diabetes patients to goal to prevent the development of complications. Asian type 2 diabetes phenotypes are different than Caucasians, i.e. significant pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, higher visceral adiposity, more vulnerable to cardio-renal complications. Although clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors have been published, real-world data on the use of this new class of antidiabetic medication is still lacking, in particularly among Asians.</detailed_description>
