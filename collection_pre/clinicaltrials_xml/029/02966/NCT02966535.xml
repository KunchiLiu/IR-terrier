	<brief_summary>Gas exchange disturbance frequently occurs in steep Trendelenburg position during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or cystectomy. Due to increased intrathoracic pressure and absorbed carbon dioxide (CO2) gas insufflated into abdominal cavity, hypercapnia as well as hypoxia may occur. Inverse ratio ventilation or prolonged inspiratory time during mechanical ventilation has been reported to be improve gas exchange in adult respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators attempt to test the hypothesis that prolonged inspiratory time may improve the gas exchange during robot-assisted laparoscopic urologic surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gas exchange disturbance frequently occurs in steep Trendelenburg position during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or cystectomy. Due to increased intrathoracic pressure and absorbed CO2 gas insufflated into abdominal cavity, hypercapnia as well as hypoxia may occur. Inverse ratio ventilation or prolonged inspiratory time during mechanical ventilation has been reported to be improve gas exchange in adult respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators attempt to test the hypothesis that prolonged inspiratory time (I:E ratio = 1:1) may improve the gas exchange during robot-assisted laparoscopic urologic surgery.</detailed_description>
