	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Mild Hypoxia Preconditioning in Patients Undergoing Interventional Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic cerebrovascular disease accounts for 70%-80% of all cerebrovascular diseases, the mortality rate and disability rate is high. Mild hypoxia preconditioning is currently widely used in the high altitude acclimatization, athletes, aerospace, diving and other fields. Mild hypoxia preconditioning refers to the body after one or more short, non lethal hypoxia, tolerance to subsequent longer or more severe hypoxic damage to the body. The animal model of mild hypoxia preconditioning has confirmed that mild hypoxic preconditioning can reduce the brain damage, and has a protective effect on the permeability of blood brain barrier, which can effectively improve the prognosis of animals with brain injury. The hypothesis of this protocol is that mild hypoxia preconditioning could reduces injury induced by interventional treatment for ischemic cerebrovascular disease. In this study, patients will treated with oxygen inhalation (mild hypoxia or sham preconditioning) ×7 days before surgery (Note: In mild hypoxia preconditioning group, the oxygen concentration decreased from 20% to 18%, and keeping at 18%). The volume (mm3) of new lesions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI, DWI and FLAIR) and serum s-100β protein (s-100β), Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE), Erythropietin (EPO), Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (VEGF), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) concentration will be measured before and at 3, 7 days after oxygen inhalation, and at 1,3 and 7days after surgery. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in all the cases will be evaluated before and at 1, 3, 7 days after oxygen inhalation and at 1, 3, 7 days after surgery. Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) will be evaluated at 1, 3, 7 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
