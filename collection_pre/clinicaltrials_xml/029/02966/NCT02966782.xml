	<criteria>Participant must have documented diagnosis and classification of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) with application of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) as Higher Risk (HR) MDS at the time of first diagnosis with IPSS risk categories Int2 or High (IPSS overall score greater than or equal to 1.5). Participants must have presence of greater than or equal to 5% and less than 30% bone marrow blasts per bone marrow biopsy/aspirate at screening. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of less than or equal to 2. Participant must have failure of prior therapy with Hypomethylating Agent (HMA) (azacitidine or decitabine) as firstline MDS treatment. Participant must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Participant had lowerrisk MDS with IPSS risk categories Low or Int1 (overall IPSS score &lt; 1.5) at the time of first diagnosis. Participant has therapyrelated MDS (tMDS). Participant has MDS evolving from a preexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Participant has MDS/MPN including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and unclassifiable MDS/MPN. Participant has received more than 1 prior therapy. Participant has received therapy other than azacitidine or decitabine for the treatment of MDS. Participant has received prior therapy with a BH3 mimetic. Participant has received hematopoietic growth factors, agents intended to improve blood counts (e.g., erythropoietin, eltrombopag), or corticosteroids within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.</criteria>
