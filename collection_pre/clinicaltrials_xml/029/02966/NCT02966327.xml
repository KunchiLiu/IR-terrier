	<brief_summary>Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effect of early compression therapy with individualized exercise on the incidence of lower limb lymphedema at 12 months post-operatively in patients treated for gynecological cancer who are at risk of developing lymphedema; 2) To evaluate the effect of early compression therapy with individualized exercise on lower limb volume, quality of life and incidence of cellulitis infections at 12 months post-operatively in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Early Compression and Exercise on Lymphedema Incidence in Patients With Gynecological Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design and setting: A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted on 50 patients with gynecological cancer recruited from the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) Royal Victoria Hospital and the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) Segal Cancer Centre in Montreal, Quebec. The data collection and interventions will be conducted at the MUHC Lymphedema Support Centre. Intervention: At 4-6 weeks post-operatively, each participant in the experimental group will be prescribed Jobst Elvarex compression class 1 (18 to 21 mmHg) standard or custom-made stockings for both lower limbs with or without panty. The participants will be recommended to wear the garments for 12 to 16 hours daily for at least 6 months post-operatively. At this time, the participants will also receive individualized education on exercise, self-lymphatic drainage and skin care by an unblinded lymphedema therapist. Control: At 4-6 weeks post-operatively (T2), both groups will receive standard education on lymphedema risk reduction along with printed materials from the Lymphedema Association of Quebec.</detailed_description>
