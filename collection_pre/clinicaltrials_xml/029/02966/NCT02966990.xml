	<brief_summary>The orthotics are auxiliary therapeutic resources indicated for the relief of pain, improves functional standard or correction of deformities. There is a lack of studies that analyze the biomechanical changes promoted by the Orthotics in functional pattern of the upper limb. The objective of this proposal is to analyse biomechanical changes in the functional upper limb pattern with the use of orthoses for patients with dysfunctions arising from musculoskeletal system trauma or burns, aiming to contribute with scientific evidence to clinical practice. The project will analyze the changes in the pattern of the upper limb functional through the use of dynamic and static Orthotics by means of kinematic and electromyographic analysis while conducting a functional task. These comparisons will be carried out with and without the use of functional Orthotics, and the controls are the patients themselves. Methods: 25 patients will be included over 18 years with malfunctions resulting from orthopaedic trauma and Burns of the upper limb with indication and Orthotics for improving functional pattern. For characterization of the sample will be performed: esthesiometric , hand and the (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) DASH Questionnaire. Biomechanical assessment will be used for the analysis and electromyographic kinematics. For statistical analysis will be applied the method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures, and when necessary, the post hoc Bonferroni test. Will be adopted as significance level p â‰¤ 0.05.</brief_summary>
