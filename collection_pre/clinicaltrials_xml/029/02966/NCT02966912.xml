	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate whether nutritional supplementation with magnesium can improve cardiovascular structure and function in participants with obesity - with a long-term goal of preventing clinical heart failure. Specifically, in a randomized open-label pilot study, we will assess whether dietary Magnesium (Mg) supplementation (versus no supplementation) for 24 weeks in obese patients will improve left ventricular (LV) mass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnesium Supplementation for Primary Prevention of Heart Failure in Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a 24-week therapeutic trial involving 40 participants with obesity from the Providence VA Medical Center without clinical heart failure. 20 participants will be treated with 400 mg of Magnesium Oxide twice daily, while 20 participants will receive no treatment. The trial tests the hypothesis that oral Mg supplementation will improve: LV structure (by LV mass, steatosis, and ECV), LV function (systolic and diastolic), vascular health (systolic blood pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity) and visceral adiposity.</detailed_description>
