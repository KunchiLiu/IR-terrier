	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to elucidate the relationship between myocardial right ventricular triglyceride content (steatosis) and right ventricular dysfunction in participants with pulmonary hypertension, and investigate reversibility of this phenotype with omega-3 fatty acid treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversal of Right Ventricular Steatosis in Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to treat 30 participants that are identified as having elevated myocardial triglyceride content (defined as greater than 0.50%) on cardiac MRI with 4 grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily for six months with a primary end point of reducing right ventricular steatosis and a secondary endpoint of improving RV systolic function. The investigators hypothesize that right ventricular steatosis by cardiac MRI will be associated with the degree of right ventricular systolic function by cardiac MRI. In the subset of participants with elevated baseline steatosis who are treated with a lipoprotective strategy, the investigators hypothesize that six months of therapy with omega-3 fatty acids will reduce myocardial steatosis and improve right ventricular systolic function.</detailed_description>
