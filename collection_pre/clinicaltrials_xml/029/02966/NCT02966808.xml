	<brief_title>Retrospective Observational Study About Long-term Effect of Fampridine in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism of action of fampridine has a direct effect on mobility and itÂ´s based on voltage-dependent potassium channels functioning, causing an improvement of conductivity of action-potential in neurons. This is why nowadays is the only approved drug to treat walking and mobility problems in MS. Results obtained after Phase III randomized clinical trials proved improvement in walking ability measured using the Timed 25 Walking Feet test (T25WF). There are few studies regarding fampridine effects on symptoms different from mobility. The ENABLE Phase VI study found the first data related with the long-term impact of this treatment in physical and psychological function in patients according to their own perception. Results from this study indicated that, after one year of treatment, patients perceived a sustained benefit in their health, both physical and psychologically.</detailed_description>
