	<brief_summary>The STAR-study (STay Active after Rehabilitation) investigates in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the additional effect of a pedometer-based behavior change intervention (BCI) during in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on objectively measured physical activity (PA) 6-weeks and 6-months post PR. The BCI uses the behaviour change techniques a) instruction on how, where and when to perform the behavior, b) prompt goal setting for physical activity, c) prompt self-monitoring of behavior and d) feedback on behavior. The primary outcome of PA will be measured using an accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X) for a time period of seven days, firstly two weeks before rehabilitation begins (T0 = study phase I) as well as six weeks and six months (T3 and T4) after PR. Additionally to predict PA progression after PR, a complex personal diagnostic, including questionnaires as well as functional assessments, is to be carried out at the start (T1 = start of study phase II) and end of PR (T2). This diagnostic is based on the main ideas of the PA-related health competence model (PARC-model) and especially incorporates physical and psychological personal determinants of PA.</brief_summary>
