The diagnostic method of VisioCyt® device is based on the analysis by transmission and fluorescence, of urinary cytology slides prepared according to the protocol VisioCyt.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of VisioCyt® Test, in Case of Suspicion of Urothelial Bladder Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is divided into two main phases: I. The first one involves the construction of better image processing algorithm from a learning sample. The learning sample will include 600 virtual slides made from the urine sample of the first 600 patients enrolled. II. The second one, will evaluate from an evaluation sample, the diagnostic performance of the test VisioCyt, to identify patients with versus without bladder tumors, using as comparator the results of the examination of reference: histology. The evaluation sample will include 400 slides, made from the urine sample of the last 400 patients enrolled.</detailed_description>
