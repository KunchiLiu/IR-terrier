Subject presents with a history of acute illness within 14 days prior to checkin to the study site and throughout the duration of the study. Subject has an electrocardiogram (ECG) parameter (confirmed by repeat evaluation) outside the following limits: PR ≥ 210 ms, QRS ≥ 120 ms, QT ≥ 500 ms; QT interval corrected for heart rate incorporating Bazett's formula (QTcB) ≥ 450 ms.
