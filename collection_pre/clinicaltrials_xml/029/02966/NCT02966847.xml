	<brief_summary>In the coming years, an increase in lung nodule resection is expected, particularly in Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). In some situations, it is necessary to use a device for locating these nodules. Meanwhile, the Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a tool whose use is constantly spreading.</brief_summary>
