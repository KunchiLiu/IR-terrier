	<brief_title>Thalidomide/Dexamethasone Treatment And PET Evaluation In Organ Involvemenet of Cardiac Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considering that dismal prognosis of amyloidosis is attributable to organ dysfunction, primary aim of amyloidosis treatment should be an organ reversal. However, due to various reasons, not much is known about organ reversal in amyloidosis. Almost all of the clinical trials evaluated hematologic response in amyloidosis. Meanwhile, besides autologous stem cell transplantation with high-dose melphalan conditioning, hematologic response rate of various agents such as bortezomib, melphalan, thalidomide and lenalidomide are similar for amyloidosis. However, organ reversing potential of these agents is not known. If there is a difference in organ reversing potential despite of similar hematologic response rate, drug with effective organ reversing potential should be a standard treatment for amyloidosis. The investigators assume that thalidomide could make organ reversal in cardiac amyloidosis due to its specific mechanism of action. To prove this concept, the investigators propose a clinical trial that evaluates organ reversing potential of thalidomide in cardiac amyloidosis.</detailed_description>
