	<brief_summary>A Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir (ABT-493)/pibrentasvir (ABT-530) for an 8- or 12-week treatment duration in participants with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve or treatment experienced with interferon (IFN) or pegylated interferon (pegIFN) with or without ribavirin (RBV) (defined as P/R treatment-experienced) or sofosbuvir (SOF) plus RBV with or without pegIFN (defined as SOF plus RBV treatment-experienced).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Screening laboratory result indicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) GT5 or 6 infection. Participant has a positive antiHCV antibody (Ab) and plasma HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) greater than or equal to 1000 IU/mL at Screening Visit. Participant must be HCV treatmentnaïve (i.e., has never received a single dose of any approved or investigational antiHCV medication) or treatmentexperienced (i.e., has failed prior interferon [IFN] or pegylated interferon [pegIFN] with or without ribavirin [RBV], or sofosbuvir [SOF] plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy). Prior HCV treatment with any other approved or investigational medications is not allowed. Previous HCV treatment must have been completed greater than or equal to 2 months prior to screening. Participant must be documented as having no cirrhosis or compensated cirrhosis. Female participant who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or is considering becoming pregnant during the study or for approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator. Positive test result at screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). HCV genotype performed during screening indicating coinfection with more than one HCV genotype. History of severe, lifethreatening or other significant sensitivity to any excipients of the study drug.</criteria>
