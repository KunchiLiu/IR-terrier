	<brief_title>Hand Grip Strength as a Marker of Frailty in Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frailty is associated with worse outcomes. Current screening surveys are cumbersome, most containing multiple components. For frail patients particularly, it can be difficult to ascertain all the information requested. There is a need for a simple, one step, objective screening measure of frailty. There is some evidence in the medicine patients that grip strength may be related to frailty, but no such information is available for surgical patients.</detailed_description>
