	<brief_summary>Placenta previa and accreta both could potentially cause serious postpartum hemorrhage and even maternal death. Interventional radiological techniques have been developed to limit massive hemorrhage during caesarean section. This study investigated the efficacy of prophylactic internal iliac artery balloon catheterization in management for placenta previa and accreta.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Prophylactic Internal Iliac Artery Balloon Catheterization in the Management of Placenta Previa and Accreta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Placenta previa and accreta both could potentially cause serious postpartum hemorrhage and even maternal death. Interventional radiological techniques have been developed to limit massive hemorrhage during caesarean section. This study investigated the efficacy of prophylactic internal iliac artery balloon catheterization in management for placenta previa and accreta. Between June 2015 and August 2016,patients were personally recruited and managed by the authors,and assigned to either balloon group or control group by their willingness to catheterization or not. Both groups benefitted similar management protocol with the exception of interventional radiology operation. Intraoperative blood loss, transfusion volume, radiation dose, exposure time, surgical duration, procedure complications and neonatal outcomes were analyzed.</detailed_description>
