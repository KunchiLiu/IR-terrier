	<brief_summary>The objective of this multicenter retrospective study is to compare overall survival in patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant treatment and surgery versus definitive chemoradiation. Secondary objectives are to analyze disease-free survival, median survival, locoregional and distant relapses as well as mortality and toxicity related to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2 Lung Cancer Project: Neoadjuvant Treatment Followed Surgery Versus Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on data published by the Intergroup 0139 trial, induction therapy followed by surgery in patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC can increase overall survival compared to exclusive radical chemoradiation treatment. The major handicap of all studies addressing the role of surgery in IIIA-N2 NSCLC is the difficulty of recruiting patients. Therefore, multicenter studies are necessary to confirm the hypothesis generated by the INT 0139.</detailed_description>
