	<brief_title>Study of Sulfatinib as Second-line Treatment in Patients With Biliary Tract Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study adopt Simon's two-stage designs method based on the primary endpoint of 16-week PFS rates. In the first stage, 16 patients will be accrued. If there are 3 or fewer patients without progression or death in these 16 patients at week 16, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 16 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 32 evaluable patients. Sulfatinib will be orally administered within 1 hour after breakfast once a day (QD) for every 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other protocol specified end-of-treatment criteria is met (which comes first).</detailed_description>
