The following variables will be prospectively studied: age, sex, height, weight, respiratory function indicators, arterial blood gas analysis results, biochemical data, nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002) score, short-term and long-term prognostic outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess whether NRS 2002 is a useful prognosis predictor in COPD patients with respiratory failure.</brief_summary>
