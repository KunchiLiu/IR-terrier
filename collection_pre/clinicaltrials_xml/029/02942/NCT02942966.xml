	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-blinded study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the Tack Endovascular System in the Mid/Distal Popliteal, Tibial, and Peroneal Arteries ranging in diameter from 1.5mm to 4.5mm for the treatment of post percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) dissection(s) requiring repair.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males or nonpregnant females ≥ 18 years of age at the time of consent Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to treatment and must use some form of contraception (abstinence is acceptable) through the duration of the study Subject has been informed of and understands the nature of the study and provides signed informed consent to participate in the study. If the subject possesses the ability to understand and provide informed consent but due to physical inability, the subject cannot sign the informed consent form (ICF), an impartial witness may sign on behalf of the subject Willing to comply with all required followup visits Rutherford Classification 3, 4 or 5. Rutherford 5 subjects may not exceed the following WIfI scores: Wound 0, 1 or modified 2, Ischemia 03, Infection 01. To further specify, the "modified 2" Wound Grade permits a deeper ulcer without exposed bone, joint or tendon; or shallow or superficial heel ulcer, without deep tissue involvement or exposed calcaneus. It also permits gangrenous changes limited to digits. Estimated life expectancy ≥1 year Is pregnant or refuses to use contraception through the duration of the study Previous infrainguinal bypass graft in the target limb Acute limb ischemia, defined as symptom onset occurring less than 14 days prior to the index procedure Prior or planned aboveankle amputation to the target limb, including transmetatarsal amputation and full thickness heel gangrene (this does not apply to digital amputations or ulcer debridements) Infection that exceeds WIfI grade 0 or 1. This includes any systemic infection or immunocompromised state. Patients with an ascending infection/deep foot infection or abscess/white blood count (WBC)≥12,000/or febrile state are excluded from participation Endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures or planned digit amputation/wound debridement) to the target limb less than 30 days prior to or planned for less than 30 days after the index procedure Existing stent implant in the target vessel and/or instent restenosis of target lesion Endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures) to the nontarget limb less than 14 days prior to the index procedure or planned procedure less than 30 days after the index procedure Any other endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures) less than 14 days prior to the index procedure or planned procedure less than 30 days after the index procedure Use of atherectomy, cryoplasty, cutting/scoring/contoured balloon angioplasty, stenting or any other treatment (with the exception of a crossing device) of the target lesion other than plain balloon angioplasty PTA during the index procedure Known coagulopathy, hypercoagulable state, bleeding diathesis, other blood disorder, or a platelet count less than 80,000/microliter or greater than 500,000/microliter Wound(s) that exceed WIfI grade 0, 1, or Modified 2. The "Modified 2" grade permits a deeper ulcer without exposed bone, joint or tendon; or shallow or superficial heel ulcer, without deep tissue involvement or exposed calcaneus. It also permits gangrenous changes limited to digits. Any subject in which antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated Myocardial infarction, thrombolysis or angina less than 30 days prior to the Index Procedure History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) less than 90 days prior to the Index Procedure Currently on dialysis Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to nickeltitanium alloy (Nitinol) Participating in another ongoing investigational clinical trial that has not completed its primary endpoint Has other comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude them from receiving this treatment and/or participating in studyrequired followup assessments Known hypersensitivity or allergy to contrast agents that cannot be medically managed</criteria>
