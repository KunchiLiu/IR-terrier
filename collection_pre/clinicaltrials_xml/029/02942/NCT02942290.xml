	<criteria>Participant must have documented diagnosis of de novo MDS with: International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk categories Int2 or High (IPSS overall score ≥ 1.5) and Presence of greater than or equal to 5% and less than 30% bone marrow blasts per bone marrow Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of less than or equal to 2. Participant received no prior therapy for MDS. NOTE: Participants who only received supportive care for MDS (e.g., transfusions, growth factors) are eligible to enrol in the study. Participant is not a candidate to undergo intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Participant has therapyrelated MDS (tMDS). Participant has MDS evolving from a preexisting myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) Participant has MDS/MPN including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and unclassifiable MDS/MPN. Participant has received prior therapy with a BH3 mimetic. Participant has received allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplantation.</criteria>
