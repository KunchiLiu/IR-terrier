	<brief_summary>To develop an intervention specifically targeted for these clients who have the frailty syndrome. The Investigators propose to develop an exercise intervention that can reduce frailty in older adults to facilitate their ability to age-in-place. The long-term objective of this work is to develop a package of interventions that can be administered within the existing Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs. The specific goal of this proposal is to develop a resistance exercise intervention to reduce frailty in older adults receiving long term care services in their home through the Illinois Community Care Program, a HCBS Waiver Program.</brief_summary>
