	<brief_title>Music Therapy Towards Schizophrenia, Negative Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia includes 1 % of the Population in Denmark (DK) and often ends up to be chronically. Negative Symptoms are difficult to reduce by Medication and Psychosocial Treatment Possibilities are searched for. Two Cochrane Reviews (2005, 2011) have been conducted concerning Music Therapy and Schizophrenia with Positive Results. This RCT, double-blinded Study aims at verifying, if these Results can be Recognized in the Danish Health System. It also aims at being similar to Biomedical Study Designs as much as possible to strengthen the Evidence of the Study. A Power Calculation showed, that a minimum of 44,5 Participants in each Arm should be available, but as drop out can be anticipated with this Population, 60 Participants in each Arm were recommended. The screening Procedure is Comprehensive as it aims at securing, that the negative Symptoms are part of the Illness Schizophrenia and not side Effects from Medication or simultaneous Depression. The same Raters do the screening Process all over the Country. (See the Inclusion- and Exclusion criteria). The Measurement Tools are as follows: At Baseline, after 25 Sessions and at Termination: - The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), - Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS), - Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref), - Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), - Board of Clinical Examinations (Danish Questionnaire) (UKU) - Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) 4 Weeks after Termination GAF is repeated as Follow Up Interview. In the Arm of Music Therapy Audio Recording of Music Interventions are done in Session 1 , 15 and 25. - Helping Alliance Questionnaire, patient version, (Haq-II) This last questionnaire is filled out after 5 sessions and after 15 Sessions and at Termination together with a Research Assistant in both Arms.</detailed_description>
