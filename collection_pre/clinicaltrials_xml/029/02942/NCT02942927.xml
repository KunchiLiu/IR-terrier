	<brief_summary>In an aging population, most seniors suffer from multiple chronic conditions. When the number of medications taken is ≥5 (polypharmacy), the burden of taking multiple concurrent medications can do more harm than good. Seniors take an average of 7 regular medications and studies link polypharmacy with adverse effects on morbidity, function and health service use. However, it is not clear to what extent these are reversible if medication burden is reduced. This trial will test the effects on medication numbers and patient health outcomes of an intervention to polypharmacy. This study will test a program focused on medication reduction number and dose. Prioritizing medications according to the patient's preference as reducing the dose also reduces the risk of drug side effects. Patients, aged over 69 years taking ≥5 medications, will randomly receive the program immediately or at 6 months. The program involves information gathering from the patient, including systematically seeking patients priorities and preferences medication review with the pharmacist and then a consultation with the family doctor. The intervention is focused on discontinuing/reducing the dose of medications where possible using a 'pause and monitor' framework to assess the need for restart. An electronic program that detects drug adverse effects and flags potentially inappropriate medications will be integrated into an electronic clinical pathway incorporating monitoring and follow up systems. This study will examine effects on patient and health relevant outcome measures as well as qualitative research exploring patients' and clinicians' experiences of reducing medication burden. The results will be used to determine whether this system can be implemented as part of routine preventative care in primary care for older adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive the intervention at study start or delayed appointment 6 months later. Initial baseline data collection from the patient include data on demographics, medications, and illness characteristics. The patient will then attend an appointment with a pharmacist to review medications appropriate for discontinuation/dose reduction, after which the patient will meet with his/her family physician to discuss patient preferences for discontinuation/dose reduction. Both health care providers will have access to TAPERMD, a web based program linked to evidence and tools to support reduction in polypharamcy. Follow up research assessments will take place at one week, 3 months and 6 months (study end). Outcome assessments and a semi-structured interview will take place at the 6 month appointment.</detailed_description>
