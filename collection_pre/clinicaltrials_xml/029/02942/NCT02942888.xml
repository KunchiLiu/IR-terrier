	<brief_title>The Effects of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) on Brain Function and Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Niagen is a patented formula which is the first and only commercially available form of Nicotinamide Riboside (NR). It has been proven in basic science studies as a highly effective NAD booster, but it also works as a vitamin B3 supplement. NAD helps pass energy from glucose to other pathways in the cell. Niagen (Nicotinamide Riboside, vitamin B3) is one of the most effective NAD+ precursors to support cellular health. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Niagen (nicotinamide riboside, vitamin B3), on NAD levels, brain function including cognition and blood flow in people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</detailed_description>
