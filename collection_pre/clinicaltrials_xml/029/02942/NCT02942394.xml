	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of the stents (sinus-Obliquus stent for the common iliac vein, the sinus-XL Flex stent or sinus-Venous stent for the external iliac and common femoral veins) by evaluating different gradations of patency rates, patient's rating of disease severity and quality of life in patients with post-thrombotic syndrome and concomitant common iliac vein compression. Secondary objective: To assess long-term safety of venous stenting</brief_summary>
