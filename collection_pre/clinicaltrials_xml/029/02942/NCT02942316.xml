	<brief_title>Pupillary Dilation Reflex (PDR) Evaluation in the Prediction of Pain During General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An infrared camera of the video pupillometer measures the pupillary dilation reflex (PDR) in response of a nociceptive stimulus. This autonomic reflex, parasympathetic mediated in sedated patients, can be generated by various pain stimuli (built in standardized protocol, surgical incision, â€¦) The PDR is a robust reflex, even in patients under general anesthesia, and provides a potential evaluation of the autonomous circuit within the nociceptive evaluation based on pupil dilation upon A-delta and C fibers in both electrical or mechanic stimulation. This mono-centric project involving American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-II patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia are recruited. Enrolled patients perioperative undergo PDR measurements at four different standardized times.</detailed_description>
