	<brief_summary>There are insufficient data on the safety and efficacy of edoxaban therapy in subjects with AF following catheter ablation. This phase 3b study is designed to evaluate the safety and to explore the efficacy of an edoxaban-based antithrombotic regimen versus a VKA-based antithrombotic regimen in subjects with AF following catheter ablation. Bleeding is a central safety outcome in cardiovascular clinical trials, especially for antithrombotic strategies and invasive procedures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female at least 18 years of age with documented history of paroxysmal (lasting ≤7 days), persistent (lasting &gt;7 days but ≤12 months) or longstanding [longlasting] persistent (&gt;12 months) nonvalvular AF. Duration of AF can be confirmed by any electrical tracing or a recording in the subject's medical records (e.g., medical chart, hospital discharge summary). Subject is eligible and is scheduled for either radio frequency (RF) or cryoballoon catheter ablation (both first and repeated procedure included). Signed informed consent form (ICF). AF considered to be of a transient or reversible nature (such as in myocarditis, postsurgery, ionic disturbances, thyrotoxicosis, pneumonia, severe anemia etc.). Subject post stroke, or with a systemic thromboembolic event within the past 6 months prior to randomization. Subject has a thrombus in the left atrial appendage (LAA), left atrium (LA), left ventricle (LV), or aorta, or an intracardial mass. Subject had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the 2 months prior to randomization or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within 3 months prior to the randomization. Subject has signs of bleeding, history of clinicallyrelevant bleeding according to ISTH, or conditions associated with high risk of bleeding Subjects with any contraindication for anticoagulant agents.</criteria>
