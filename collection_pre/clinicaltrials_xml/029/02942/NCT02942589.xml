	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether food intake in response to large portion sizes differs between women who have received portion-control training and women who have not received such training. In a crossover design, women come to the laboratory on four occasions to eat a lunch of seven foods varying in energy density. Across meals, all foods are varied in portion size (100%, 125%, 150%, or 175% of baseline amounts). Food and energy intake is determined for each meal. Participants are from two groups: women who completed a one-year weight-loss trial in which they were trained in portion-control strategies, and women who had not received such training (community controls).</brief_summary>
