	<brief_title>Position Of The Tip Of The Inner Catheter And Air Bubbles As Predictors Of Pregnancy During ICSI Cycles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the position of the tip of the inner catheter, the position of the air bubbles (at time , 5 min ,10 min )after embryo transfer and pregnancy rate outcome in ICSI cycles. Most IVF teams consider not touching the endometrium and the uterine fundus with replacement of the embryos in the lumen of the endometrial cavity the most important factors for successful embryo transfer, it is highly recommended to use agents that can facilitate a smooth embryo transfer and reduce unintended stimulation of the fundus, for example the application of soft-tipped catheters, which can improve pregnancy rate. The advantage of using the air and liquid content for catheter loading is to prevent the embryo from adhering to the wall of the catheter at the time of injection.The presence of two air bubbles on both sides of the medium that contains the embryo prevents the transfer of the embryo within the catheter and beside, in the transfer under ultrasonographic guidance, the air bubbles are often considered a marker for the embryo's position in the uterus.</detailed_description>
