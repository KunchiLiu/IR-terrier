	<brief_summary>Attentional symptoms characterize both ADHD and other mental conditions in children. The diagnosis is based on clinical psychiatric evaluation. With the expanding knowledge regarding the neurobiological basis in ADHD the investigators have learned that attention is not a general property of the whole brain, but involves several coordinated networks. This knowledge promoted the scientific community to the stage in which scientists can recognize different types of attention domains. in the current study, the investigators use computerized battery to separate between the different attention abilities and provide specific attentional profile. in this study the investigators aim to characterize different attentional profiles in children who are diagnosed with ADHD versus children who diagnosed with other mental condition (which are common differential diagnoses of ADHD)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differences in Attentional Profile of Children Diagnosed With ADHD Versus Children Diagnosed With Other Mental Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attentional symptoms characterize both ADHD and other mental conditions in children. The diagnosis of ADHD is based on clinical psychiatric evaluation in different clinical situations the differential diagnosis is not straight forward and the clinician considers a common co-morbid conditions and common differential diagnoses. With the expanding knowledge regarding the neurobiological basis in ADHD the scientific community have learned that attention is not a general property of the whole brain, but involves several coordinated networks. This knowledge promoted us to the stage in which scientists can recognize different types of attention domains. this knowledge raises the question - can the clinician use this knowledge to make the correct diagnosis based on specific attentional profile? In the current study, the investigators use computerized battery in order to separate between the different attention abilities and provide specific attentional profile. in this study the investigators aim to characterize different attentional profiles in children who are diagnosed with ADHD versus children who diagnosed with other mental condition (which are common differential diagnoses of ADHD)</detailed_description>
