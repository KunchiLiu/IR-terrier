The study will be conducted in healthy people to investigate how quickly and how much LY900014 is absorbed and the effect of different doses of LY900014 on blood sugar levels. Side effects and tolerability will be documented. The study will last about 6 to 7 weeks for each participant, including screening and follow up. Screening is required within 28 days prior to entering the study.</brief_summary>
