	<brief_title>Memory and MRI Changes With Hippocampus Avoidance Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation(HA-PCI) for Small Cell Lung Cancer(SCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis is rather high in small cell lung cancer patients. Prophylactic cranial irradiation(PCI) is the standardized treatment. However, cognitive dysfunction like memory damage is observed in quite a number of patients after brain irradiation, which may due to the hippocampus being irradiated. Thus, the investigators conduct the study by reducing the dose to the hippocampal neural stem-cell compartment (HAZ) during PCI. Patient Population: Age: 18-65y; small cell lung cancer undergoing PCI; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score: 0-1. The patients are randomized to 2 arms: Arm Routine PCI: PTV(planning target volume) 25Gy/10F. Arm Hippocampus avoidance PCI(HA-PCI): PTV 25Gray(Gy)/10Fraction(F), HAZ Dmin&lt;9Gy Dmax&lt;16Gy). Measurements: Hopkins verbal learning test(HVLT) and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging.</detailed_description>
