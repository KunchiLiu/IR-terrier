	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 3 study in approximately 15 subjects ≥12 and ≤50 years of age with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT), also known as β-thalassemia major, who do not have a β0 mutation at both alleles of the hemoglobin β (HBB) gene. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using LentiGlobin BB305 Drug Product.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects between 12 and 50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent or assent (as applicable), and able to provide written consent or assent. Diagnosis of TDT with a history of at least 100 mL/kg/year of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) or ≥8 transfusions of pRBCs per year for the prior 2 years. Clinically stable and eligible to undergo hematopoietic stem cell therapy (HSCT). Treated and followed for at least the past 2 years in a specialized center that maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history. Presence of a mutation characterized as β0 mutation at both alleles of the HBB gene. Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV1 and HIV2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV). A white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3×10^9/L, and/or platelet count &lt;100×10^9/L not related to hypersplenism. Uncorrected bleeding disorder. Any prior or current malignancy. Prior HSCT. Advanced liver disease. A cardiac T2* &lt;10 ms by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Any other evidence of severe iron overload that, in the Investigator's opinion, warrants exclusion. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug within 30 days of Screening. Any other condition that would render the subject ineligible for HSCT, as determined by the attending transplant physician or investigator. Prior receipt of gene therapy. Pregnancy or breastfeeding in a postpartum female or absence of adequate contraception for fertile subjects. A known and available HLAmatched family donor.</criteria>
