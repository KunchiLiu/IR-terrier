	<detailed_description>This was a cross sectional study using consecutive sampling methodology for participant recruitment. It was carried out at the specialized diabetic, renal, and general outpatient clinics in the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Serum 25(OH)D levels were determined by using direct chemiluminesent immunoassay (ADVIA Centaur XP; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, New York, USA). Serum HbA1c levels were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography (Variant™ II Turbo; Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). Data collected will be analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS version 23.0 for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA).</detailed_description>
