	<brief_summary>The gut immune barrier is not fully restored in HIV-1-infected subjects despite they were receiving antiretroviral treatment. This leaky gut leads to microbial translocation from the gut lumen into the bloodstream that fuels deleterious systemic inflammation. The chemotaxis axes that allow T lymphocytes to migrate from the blood to the gut mucosa in order to reconstitute the mucosal immune barrier seems altered in treated HIV-1-infected subjects.This study aims at better understanding the mechanisms involved in this lack of mucosal immune restoration.</brief_summary>
