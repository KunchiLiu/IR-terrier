	<brief_summary>Proximal hamstring rupture is a rare injury, which may be immediately diagnosed. In 1996, Sallay showed that functional results of surgical repair were better than those of conservative treatment. Surgery is now the rule. The main aim of this study is to obtain a more detailed and quantified description of the postoperative outcomes.</brief_summary>
