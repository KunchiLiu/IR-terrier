	<brief_summary>Best priming for cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery is unknown. Efficacy and toxicity of Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 used in this context are uncertain. The aim of this pilot study is to determine if Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 is more effective than Sodium Chloride 0.9% in short term hemodynamic purpose without side renal or hemostatic effect.</brief_summary>
