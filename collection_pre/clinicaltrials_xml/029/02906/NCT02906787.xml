	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to better understand (1) why people gain weight when they quit smoking and (2) whether certain types of smoking cessation (i.e. quit smoking) counseling combined with the nicotine patch help people quit smoking and gain less weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation and the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of a behavioral activation intervention to smoking cessation and to post-cessation weight gain (BAS+) plus transdermal nicotine (TN) compared to standard smoking cessation counseling (SC) plus TN in treatment-seeking smokers. After completing an Intake Visit (~week -3), eligible smokers will be randomized (stratified by nicotine dependence, BMI and gender) to participate in 8 individual sessions of BAS+ or SC over a 10-week treatment period with two sessions prior to the target quit date (weeks -2, -1) and six sessions post-target quit date (TQD [week 0] and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). Standard, 8-week; open-label TN will begin on the TQD. Moderators will be assessed pre-treatment. Mediating mechanisms will be assessed before, during, and at the end of treatment (EOT, week 8). Smoking will be assessed by self-report and biochemically confirmed (Carbon Monoxide [CO] &lt; 5) at all in-center visits after quitting, at EOT (week 8), and at the 12- and 26-week follow-ups. Weight will be assessed at these same time points. Food intake will be measured by three consecutive days of 24-hour food recalls at Baseline [week -2] and 4-, 8-, and 12- and 26-weeks post-TQD. Smoking cessation and post-cessation weight gain (PCWG) are the primary outcomes and food intake is a secondary outcome at 26-weeks post-TQD. Consistent with intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the investigators will measure smoking cessation and weight gain in the full sample at the 26-week follow-up, evaluating a smoking status by treatment interaction for the PCWG analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female treatmentseeking smokers who are between 18 and 65 years of age and selfreport smoking at least 5 cigarettes (menthol and/or nonmenthol) per day for at least the last 6 months.

Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the combined consent and HIPAA form. Smokers who wish to make a permanent quit attempt in the next 12 months (treatmentseeking), because our prior work suggests that motivated subjects are more sensitive to medication effects on smoking behavior. Able to communicate fluently in English (i.e. speaking, writing, and reading). Provide a Carbon Monoxide (CO) breath test reading greater than or equal to 8 parts per million (ppm) at the Intake Visit. Smoking Behavior. Regular use of nicotine containing products other than cigarettes (e.g. chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, cigars, ecigs, etc.). Participants agreeing to abstain from using nicotine containing products other than cigarettes and the studyprovided TN for the duration of trial will be considered eligible. Current enrollment or plans to enroll in another research and/or smoking cessation program over the duration of the study (i.e. ~30 weeks/8 months). Anticipated use (within the next ~30 weeks/8 months) of any nicotine substitutes and/or smoking cessation treatments/medications unless provided through the study. Provide a CO breath test reading less than 8 ppm at Intake Visit. Alcohol and Drug. History of substance abuse (other than nicotine) in the past 12 months and/or currently receiving medical treatment for substance abuse. Counseling and support groups (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous) will not be considered medical treatment for the purposes of this protocol. Current alcohol consumption that exceeds 25 standard drinks/week. Breath alcohol reading (BrAC) greater than .000 at the Intake Visit.

Eligibility will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by the Study Physician. Active hepatitis or poorly controlled kidney and/or liver disease. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] greater than 159 and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] greater than 99 History of abnormal heart rhythms, tachycardia, and/or cardiovascular disease (e.g. stroke, angina, heart attack) may result in ineligibility. These conditions will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by the Study Physician. History of epilepsy or seizures. Eligibility will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by the Study Physician. Serious or unstable disease within the past 6 months. Notable diseases will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by the Principal Investigator and/or the Study Physician. Any impairment including, but not limited to, visual, physical, and/or neurological impairments preventing proper completion of the study procedures. Notable impairments will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by the Principal Investigator and/or the Study Physician.
