	<brief_summary>This study evaluates behavioral interventions to increase adolescent's motivation for self performed periodontal infection control, by means of adequate oral hygiene. Study subjects will be allocated to test and control group where the test will be subjected to an individually tailored oral health education program, based on cognitive- behavioral theory and principles, and the control to standard educational intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention Study of Oral Health Education Programs Directed to Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of chronic periodontitis is about 40% among the Swedish adult population. The key-factor for the prevention of periodontal disease progression is the establishment of periodontal infection control, by means of adequate daily oral hygiene. Hence, a main task for dental professionals is to educate and motivate the patient to such beneficial behavior. A hypothesis for the current study is that patient centered health promotion programs based on cognitive behavioral theory and principles and with a directive communicative approach, i.e. motivational interviewing techniques, add positive and lasting effects to standard educational interventions on self-performed periodontal infection control. This randomized clinical field study involves 30 professionals (dental hygienists) and about 450 adolescent patients at 16 dental clinics in the Västra Götaland Region, Sweden. The approach in the evaluation is on patient-centered outcomes and health economics.</detailed_description>
