	<brief_summary>There has been increasing evidence for different rates of natural aging in humans and one of the best organs to study human aging is skin. Studies have demonstrated anti-aging effects of topical agents (such as creams, gels, lotions, or ointments) and one of them, retinol or vitamin A, was shown to decrease fine wrinkling in skin of older individuals. Additionally, studies of retinol in humans have largely occurred in white populations and so this study aims to focus on skin aging in individuals of East Asian descent as they represent a majority of the world population. This study aims to better characterize the molecular basis of rejuvenation effects and to potentially discover new topical agents with similar and/or more effective preservation of skin youthfulness.</brief_summary>
