	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to implement a brief geriatric oncology assessment (GOA) in a community-based oncology clinic, the Scotland Cancer Treatment Center - a clinic within the Duke Cancer Network, located in the rural, low resource Scotland County community of North Carolina. Secondly, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the brief GOA by comparing historical and post-GOA service referral patterns and adherence to planned cancer therapy. For this study, the investigators will prospectively enroll up to 60 patients who have been diagnosed and/or treated for cancer to complete the brief GOA. In addition to these 60 patients, the investigators will also conduct retrospective chart reviews on 120 patients that would be eligible for this study to evaluate past referral patterns. Eligible and consented patients will complete the brief GOA at the Scotland Cancer Treatment Center alongside their normal clinic appointment. The investigators will assess impact on the healthcare system by evaluating referral patterns (i.e., how many, what type of services) using the brief GOA data and EHR data. The study value includes the possibility for recognition and access to additional health care referrals if needed.</brief_summary>
