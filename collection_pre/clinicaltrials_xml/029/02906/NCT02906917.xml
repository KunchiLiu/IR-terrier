	<criteria>Informed consent obtained before any trialrelated activities. Trialrelated activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial, including activities to determine suitability for the trial Male or female, age at least 18 years at the time of signing informed consent Algeria: Male or female, age at least 19 years at the time of signing informed consent Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus Treated with any basal insulin for at least 90 days prior to the day of screening Subject not on any OAD(s) prior to trial participation OR subjects on stable daily dose(s) of OAD(s) for at least 90 days prior to screening visit (V1). The OAD(s) include any of the following antidiabetic drug s)/regimen: a. Biguanides (metformin at least 1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose documented in the subject medical record) b. Other OADs (at least half of the maximum approved dose according to local label or maximum tolerated dose as documented in subject medical record): i. Insulin secretagogues (SU and glinides) ii. Dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors iii. Î±glucosidase inhibitors iv. Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors v. Oral combination products (of the allowed individual OADs above) HbA1c 7.010.0% (5386 mmol/mol) (both inclusive) by central laboratory analysis Body mass index (BMI) equal to or below 45.0 kg/m^2 Participation in any clinical trial of an approved or nonapproved investigational medicinal product within four weeks prior to the day of screening (V1) Any chronic disorder or severe disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise subject's safety or compliance with the protocol Acute decompensation of glycaemic control requiring immediate intensification of treatment to prevent severe metabolic dysregulation (e.g. diabetes ketoacidosis) equal or below 90 days prior to the day of the screening and between screening and randomisation Any of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack within the past 180 days prior to the day of screening and between screening and randomisation Renal impairment measured as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) value of below 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 as defined by KDIGO 2012 classification using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) for serum creatinine measured at screening Impaired liver function, defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) equal to or above 2.5 times upper normal limit (UNL) at screening. Subjects presently classified as being in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation known on the day of screening Treatment with any medication for the indication of diabetes or obesity other than stated in the inclusion criteria in a period of 90 days before the day of screening Anticipated initiation or change in concomitant medications (for more than 14 consecutive days) known to affect weight or glucose metabolism (e.g. treatment with orlistat, thyroid hormones, or corticosteroids)</criteria>
