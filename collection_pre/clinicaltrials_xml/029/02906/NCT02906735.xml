	<brief_summary>Knee reconstructive surgery (knee prosthesis, osteotomies) often results in changes of alignment of the lower limb axis. This affects also biomechanics of the hindfoot. There is a lack of understanding what changes of alignment of the lower limb causes to the ankle. The investigators want to evaluate the effects of knee surgeries onto the plantar foot pressure investigated by means of static and dynamic pedography.</brief_summary>
