	<brief_summary>Background: The investigators assessed the use of a colonoscopy instructional video to improve both bowel preparation and education prior to procedure. Preceding studies have been vague, pinning patient education via diagrams and text as both pivotal and useless for compliance in bowel preparations. These studies however lacked assessment of comprehension prior to procedure. Methodology: This is a prospective study of diverse, inner city outpatient university center, first time colonoscopy patients given 1 of 2 on-site videos and written/verbal instruction. Experimentals saw a 5 min video on the purpose of colonoscopy, bowel preparation, pre-colonoscopy diet, and proper laxative use. Controls saw a 5 min video from the same spokesperson on upper endoscopy; which was trivial. Both groups were given a quiz within 30 days of the colonoscopy on demographics, and 14 test questions about colonoscopy and preparation. Subsequently, endoscopists used the additive Ottawa scale to rate quality of preparation (range 0-14) via: fluid (0=sm,1=mod, 2=lg) and cleanliness in each the right, mid and rectosigmoid colon, (0=excellent, 1=good, 2=fair, 3=poor, 4=inadequate).</brief_summary>
