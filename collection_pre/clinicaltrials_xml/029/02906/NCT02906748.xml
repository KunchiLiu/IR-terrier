	<brief_summary>The functional parathyroid auto-transplantation (PA) could release parathyroid hormone (PTH) into the circulatory system of the body through the capillaries. But when parathyroid glands were auto-grafted in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, it would be inconvenient to detect PTH to examine whether the graft functions. So the investigators took the forearm as the aim place for auto-transplantation, either subcutaneous or brachioradialis, with its relatively fixed - antecubital vein blood test which is simple. The survival criteria is assumed as the PTH gradient of 1.5 times or greater through comparing the bilateral PTH value in grafted and not-grafted forearm.</brief_summary>
