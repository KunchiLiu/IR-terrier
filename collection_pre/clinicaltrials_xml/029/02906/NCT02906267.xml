	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the occurrence of gastric insufflation and the critical volume of the stomach after three different modes of positive pressure ventilation during induction (Manual-controlled, volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasonographic Comparison of Gastric Volume After Three Modes of Positive Facemask During Induction of Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspiration of gastric contents can be a serious perioperative complication, which can be related to facemask positive pressure ventilation with unprotected airway. Even with low peak airway pressure (&lt;15 cm H2O) gastric insufflation may occur. Since gastric content and volume assessment is a new point-of-care ultrasound recommended application, the cross-sectional antra area will be measured using ultrasonography before, continuously during facemask ventilation and after intubation.</detailed_description>
