	<brief_summary>The purpose of this retrospective chart review pilot study is to research the results and scores of the QOL questionnaire implemented across Allina Health clinics. This study will investigate average QOL scores by clinical population and demographic group, the change in scores over time, and the effect of clinical interventions on QOL scores. The results will provide insight into QOL trends within different patient populations and provide guidance regarding optimal treatment plans so that Allina caregivers can positively impact patients' QOL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Results From a Health System-wide Implementation of a Quality of Life Questionnaire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quality measures, including quality of life (QOL), have become an increasingly important area of interest for health systems across the country. Systematic approaches to collect patient QOL data are needed to properly understand and act on this information. At Allina Health, the process of systematically collecting this information began in July, 2012. The information is not only collected by providers, but used to enhance the patient experience and provide patients with an active voice in their care. By considering QOL as another vital sign, Allina caregivers have an instantaneous understanding of the patient's health status and can utilize the data in real time. Additionally, by collecting this information at each visit, providers also have a longitudinal perspective of the patient's QOL and the health of the population of individuals under their care. Consequently, they can provide patients with resources and support that can have a positive impact on their health and well-being. The purpose of this retrospective chart review pilot study is to research the results and scores of the QOL questionnaire implemented across Allina Health clinics. This study will investigate average QOL scores by clinical population and demographic group, the change in scores over time, and the effect of clinical interventions on QOL scores. The results will provide insight into QOL trends within different patient populations and provide guidance regarding optimal treatment plans so that Allina caregivers can positively impact patients' QOL.</detailed_description>
