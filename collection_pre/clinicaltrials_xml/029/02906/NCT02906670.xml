	<brief_title>Sym013 (Pan-HER) in Patients With Advanced Epithelial Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multicenter trial composed of 2 parts in which Pan-HER will be evaluated when administered by the intravenous (IV) route on a weekly schedule in patients with advanced epithelial malignancies without available therapeutic options. Four (4) doses of Pan-HER administered weekly constitute 1 cycle. Part 1 is a Phase 1a dose-escalation designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 2 is a Phase 2a dose-expansion at the RP2D. Two tumor types to be evaluated in this part of the trial will be selected based upon findings from Part 1, additional preclinical data, and additional clinical data available at that time from other agents inhibiting these targets. Patients will be entered, depending upon their underlying malignancy, to one of two corresponding expansion cohorts: Cohort A or Cohort B.</detailed_description>
