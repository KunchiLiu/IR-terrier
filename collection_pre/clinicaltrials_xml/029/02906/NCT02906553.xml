	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the role of the Nitric Oxide system in cognition in patients with schizophrenia. Participants will be randomised to 2 equal groups and receive either the Nitric Oxide donor molecule glyceryl trinitrate, or a placebo. Performance on several cognitive tasks will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Nitric Oxide in Cognition in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide [NO] is a gaseous neurotransmitter substance found in the brain. Nitric oxide is integrated with the glutamate system. Glutamate has received considerable attention as an important factor in the cognitive distortions and cognitive impairments that underlie schizophrenia. Deficits in glutamate in schizophrenia may impact upon cognition via the NO system, as glutamate receptors signal by way of NO. Here we aim to extend our knowledge of glutamate-NO systems by directly examining the role of NO in cognition in patients with schizophrenia. We aim to assess the role of the NO system in cognition, downstream of glutamate and before patients are started on any anti-psychotic medication which perturb brain neurochemistry. The primary outcome measure is change in a particular style of cognition referred to as 'jumping to conclusions' following the administration of a potent Nitric Oxide donor molecule [glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)], under placebo-controlled, double-blind conditions. This will shed light on the direct role of NO in cognition in schizophrenia, beyond the glutamate system.</detailed_description>
