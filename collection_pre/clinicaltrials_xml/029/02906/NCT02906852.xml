	<brief_title>Concordance of Inivata Liquid Biopsy With Standard of Care Tissue Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of Inivata liquid biopsy analysis compared with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detection of genomic alterations in patients with advanced lung cancer. Once selected for the study and with full informed consent, patients will have a blood draw to allow the detection of cancer-related genomic alterations that are detectable within the blood sample. These results will be compared to results obtained from genomic profiling via standard tissue biopsy taken as part of routine care to help determine whether such 'liquid biopsies' can be used to guide treatments in future patients. The results of the liquid biopsy will not be used to guide treatment decisions in study participants. In addition there is data-collection of treatments received for non small cell lung cancer and the response to these treatments during the first 6 months post tissue and blood analysis, though no additional visits or procedures are required for the patient beyond the initial blood draw.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written, signed and dated informed consent to participate in the study must be given by the patient in accordance with 21 CFR Part 312, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6, and applicable regulations, before completing any studyrelated procedures. Male and female patients aged 18 years and over diagnosed with stage IIIb/IV nonsquamous NSCLC. Patients intended to initiate firstline treatment according to standard guidelines, or having recently progressed on firstline EGFR or ALK directed therapy and being considered for further therapy. If enrolled in a treatment clinical trial, patients may enroll in this study if all eligibility criteria are met. Patients who plan to have or have had a recent tumor tissue biopsy taken for molecular profiling as part of their standard of care. Patient must understand and be able, willing and likely to fully comply with all study procedures and restrictions. Patients who have received any approved or experimental cancer therapy since their most recent NSCLC tissue biopsy. Patients who have any other prior metastatic or current second primary cancer. Patient who has a severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
