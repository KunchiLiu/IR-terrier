	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria. All patients with nonMRI conditional pacemakers and ICDs between the ages of 1885 will be eligible to participate. Medical records will be reviewed to confirm the date and make/model of device implanted. Ordering physician discusses the MRI request with radiologist, documenting that there is no appropriate alternate imaging test. Patient must have an appointment with a cardiologist/electrophysiologist prior to MRI. Banner Health policy for standard of care guidelines involving patients receiving MRI's will be followed. Exclusion Criteria. Patients will be excluded from MRI based on the Department of Radiology protocol. Additional exclusion criteria include: ICD and pacemaker dependent, Pacemaker inserted before 2002, Epicardial leads, fractured leads, abandoned leads, or temporary pacemakers (postcoronary artery bypass graft temporary epicardial pacing wires are acceptable), Patient not awake or unable communicate, Battery voltage at elective replacement interval, implanted nonMRI conditional device (other than pacemaker/ICD).</criteria>
