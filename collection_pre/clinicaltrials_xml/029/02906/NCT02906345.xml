	<detailed_description>Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) should used for patients with septic shock in a controlled, prospective study.

All treated patients should treated two (minimal) to five times by TPE, depending on the need of norephinephrine for the therapy. For each session 40 ml/kg body weight plasma should be exchange. Fluid resuscitation will be done with fresh frozen plasma.
