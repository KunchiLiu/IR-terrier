	<brief_summary>Throughout the last 10 years Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) has evolved as one of the most effective, culturally sensitive trauma interventions. In the present study the effectiveness of NET delivered by trained health personnel in a sample of survivors of sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) who suffer from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will be assessed. Structured baseline, 3 and 6 month follow up interviews will be administered to assess the main outcome measures PTSD and shame. The trial will take place in Goma, DR Congo, where SGBV and its sequelae has been a major problem.</brief_summary>
