	<brief_summary>Esophageal outflow obstruction is characterized by failure to relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), resulting in impaired flow of ingested food into the stomach. The subsequent stasis of ingested food leads to symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. The core objective of the treatment of esophageal outflow obstruction is to disrupt the LES and reduce its pressure to allow esophageal emptying. Therapeutic options include pharmacologic therapy, Botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic balloon dilation, and surgical myotomy with partial fundoplication. In addition, peroral endoscopy myotomy (POEM) has recently been introduced as a minimally invasive treatment, but there have a few studies regarding long-term outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of POEM for esophageal outflow obstruction.</brief_summary>
