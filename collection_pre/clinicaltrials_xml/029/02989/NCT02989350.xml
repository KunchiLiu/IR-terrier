	<brief_summary>Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is one of the most common diseases among children. Oral rehydration therapy is the key treatment. According to the 2014 guidelines developed by the ESPGHAN probiotics may be considered in the management of children with AGE in addition to rehydration therapy. Considering that evidence on L reuteri remains limited, the investigators aim to assess the efficacy of L reuteri DSM 17938 for the treatment of AGE in children. Children vaccinated and not vaccinated against rotavirus will be evaluated separately. Two independent reports (rotavirus-vaccinated and non-vaccinated children) are planned.</brief_summary>
