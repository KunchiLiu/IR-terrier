	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug, atezolizumab, when combined with the standard chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and cisplatin (or GC). This study will help researchers begin to understand whether combining GC with atezolizumab is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach of using GC alone.</brief_summary>

Patients with &lt; 30 slides may be enrolled after discussion with the principal investigator. Primary or metastatic specimens may be submitted. Subject must agree to undergo two researchdirected biopsies during treatment. The patient must have more than one site of measurable disease amenable to biopsy and, in the opinion of the investigator and/or interventional radiologist, likely to yield acceptable tumor sample for a core biopsy per the above pathology criteria. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced (T4b, any N; any T, N23), or metastatic (M1) urothelial carcinoma (confirmed at the enrolling institution) of the bladder, ureter, urethra, or renal pelvis.
