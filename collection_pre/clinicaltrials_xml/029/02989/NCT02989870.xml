	<brief_summary>This study involves a course of radiation to up to 5 tumors in the participant's liver followed by systemic therapy. (Treatment using substances that travel through the bloodstream, reaching and affecting cells all over the body.) The type of radiation is called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of SBRT given along with the systemic therapies, sorafenib and bavituximab. The researchers want to see which dose of radiation will work best in stimulating the immune response and provide local control to the participant's liver. The usual treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma that is unresectable can be transarterial therapy, sorafenib alone and/or clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (unsuitable for resection, transplant or ablation) Age â‰¥ 18 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 Must have normal organ and marrow function ChildsPugh score of A or B7 Must have measurable/evaluable disease as per RECIST 1.1 criteria Females of childbearing potential must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. For both males and females, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for four months following the last dose. Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels. Must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed consent form No more than 10 lesions in the liver Have received radiation therapy, major surgery, other locoregional therapy, within 4 weeks prior to the first date of SBRT Prior radiotherapy to the region of the liver that would result in excessive doses to normal tissues due to overlap of radiation therapy fields Prior selective internal radiotherapy/hepatic arterial Yttrium therapy, at any time Any one hepatocellular carcinoma &gt; 15 cm Total maximal sum of hepatocellular carcinomas or a single conglomerate HCC &gt; 20 cm Direct tumor extension into the stomach, duodenum, small bowel or large bowel Measureable common or main branch biliary duct involvement with HCC Extrahepatic metastases or malignant nodes (that enhance with typical features of HCC) &gt; 3.0 cm, in sum of maximal diameters (e.g., presence of one 3.4 cm metastatic lymph node or two 2 cm lung lesions). Note that benign nonenhancing periportal lymphadenopathy is not unusual in the presence of hepatitis and is permitted, even if the sum of enlarged nodes is &gt; 2.0 cm. Use of regular phenytoin, carbamazepine, hypericum perforatum [also known as St. John's wort] or rifampin Have received sorafenib or other systemic therapies for treatment of HCC in the past. Active autoimmune disease; Patients with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism requiring only hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or vitiligo are permitted for enrollment. No active malignancy except for nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer. Patients surviving a cancer that was curatively treated and without evidence of disease for more than 3 years before the trial are allowed. Myocardial infarction within past 6 months, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, active cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular arrhythmia Congenital long QT syndrome Previous stroke within past 12 months Anticoagulant therapy, bleeding or clotting disorder Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors Presence of a nonhealing wound, nonhealing ulcer, or bone fracture History of organ allograft (including corneal transplant) Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, study drug classes, or excipients of the formulations given during the course of this trial Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable for trial participation</criteria>
