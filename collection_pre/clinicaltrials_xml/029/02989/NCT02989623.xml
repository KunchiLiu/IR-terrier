	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial studies how well copper Cu 64 TP3805 positron emission tomography (PET) works in detecting prostate cancer in patients with persistently elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA). The copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET scan uses copper Cu 64 TP3805, a compound made of a radioactive agent attached to a molecule that looks like a hormone that binds to cancer cells to detect prostate cancer during PET scans. Copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET may be able to see tumors at an earlier stage than the standard of care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 (copper Cu 64 TP3805) to detect prostate cancer (PC), or absence thereof, within the prostate gland.</detailed_description>
