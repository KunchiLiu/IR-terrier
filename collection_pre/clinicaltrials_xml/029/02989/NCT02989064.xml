	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell therapy in subjects who have the appropriate HLA-A2 tissue marker and whose melanoma or bladder or head and neck tumor has the MAGE-A10 protein expressed. This study will take a subject's T cells and give them a T cell receptor protein that recognizes and attacks the tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T for Urothelial Cancer, Melanoma or Head and Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 study is designed as a cell dose escalation trial evaluating the safety of MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell therapy in subjects with inoperable or metastatic urothelial cancer, melanoma or head and neck cancers. Anti-tumor activity and other exploratory objectives will be assessed. Subjects enter from a Screening Protocol (ADP-0000-001) and are positive for HLA-A2*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06, negative for HLA-A*02:05, HLA-B*15:01 or HLA-B*46:0 and have tumors that express MAGE-A10. The study will enroll subjects using a modified 3+3 cell dose escalation design to evaluate dose limiting toxicities and determine the target cell dose range. Following the dose escalation phase additional subjects will be enrolled until 10 subjects are treated at the target cell dose range to further characterize safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity. Leukapheresis is performed to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells. Leukapheresis should be performed as soon as possible after the subject is determined to be eligible for study participation. When the manufactured MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by infusion of MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T on Day 1. Safety and tolerability as well as anti-tumor activity and biomarker assessments to be conducted at multiple visits outlined in the Schedule of Procedures. Anti-tumor activity will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria at week 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and every 3 months up to year 2 and every 6 months from year 2-5. In accordance with FDA requirements for gene therapy clinical trials, long term monitoring of subjects for gene therapy related delayed adverse events (Long term follow-up, LTFU) continues for 15 years after the T cell infusion. Subjects in this study will enroll in a long term follow up study for these safety assessments. All subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the LTFU phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: 1. Subject (or legally authorized representative) has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent (and assent as applicable) in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable local regulations. 2. Subject has agreed to abide by all protocol required procedures including study related assessments, and management by the treating institution for the duration of the study and long term followup. 3. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the study informed consent. 4. Subject has histologically confirmed diagnosis of any one of the following cancers: (A) urothelial cancer (transitional cell cancer of the bladder, ureter or renal pelvis), (B) melanoma, or (C) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 5. Subject has measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria on study entry. 6. Subject has the following disease specific requirements for their tumor type: Inoperable or metastatic (advanced) urothelial cancer Has received a platinum containing regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting or is ineligible for, or has refused platinum as part of the prior chemotherapy regimen; may have received prior immunotherapy. Inoperable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma Has received a PD1 inhibitor and/or a CTLA4 inhibitor. Has received BRAF inhibitor or the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors for BRAFv600 mutant melanoma. Inoperable or metastatic (advanced) squamous cell head and neck cancer May have received a platinum containing chemotherapy for treatment of primary tumor in adjuvant or metastatic setting or refused such treatment. May have received prior immunotherapy. 7. Subject is HLAA*02:01 and/or HLAA*02:06 positive. (This determination will be made under screening protocol ADP0000001). 8. Subject's tumor (either an archival specimen or a fresh biopsy) shows positive MAGEA10 expression. The threshold requirement for MAGEA10 expression by IHC is defined in the Study Procedures Manual. All samples must have been pathologically reviewed by an Adaptimmune designated central laboratory confirming expression. (This determination will be made under screening protocol ADP0000001). 9. Subject has anticipated life expectancy &gt;3 months 10. Subject has an ECOG Performance Status 01. 11. Subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%. 12. Subject is fit for leukapheresis and has adequate venous access for the cell collection. 13. Female subject of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. NOTE: FCBP is defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized. FCBP must agree to use maximally effective birth control or to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study, starting at the first dose of chemotherapy for 12 months after receiving the investigational product, or 4 months after there is no evidence of persistence/gene modified cells in the subject's blood, whichever is longer. Adequate contraceptive methods for females include: intrauterine device, injectable hormonal contraception, oral contraception, or 2 adequate barrier methods (e.g. diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or female condom with spermicide spermicides alone are not an adequate method of contraception). Or Male subject must be surgically sterile or agree to use a double barrier contraception method or abstain from heterosexual activity with a female of childbearing potential starting at the first dose of chemotherapy and for 4 months thereafter. Subject must have adequate organ function as indicated by the laboratory values in the table below: Absolute Neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x10⁹/L (without GCSF support) Platelets ≥ 75 x10⁹/L Hemoglobin&gt; 80 g/L (without transfusion support within 7 days prior to leukapheresis) Prothrombin Time or INR ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.
