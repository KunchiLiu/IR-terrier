	<brief_summary>Some women experience the pain of miscarriage on numerous occasions. Studies show that these women experience feelings of anxiety and distress during the early stages of a new pregnancy as they worry another miscarriage will occur. This study will investigate whether a coping strategy, developed for a similar group of women, would be acceptable and useful to women suffering recurrent miscarriage, and reduce the anxiety and worry they experience. A secondary aim of the study is to develop a deeper understanding of the experiences and feelings of women in the early stages of a new pregnancy, following multiple miscarriages.</brief_summary>
