	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Resticutis Compared to Platelet-Rich Plasma for Treating Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Grade II and III (According to Wagner's classification system of Ulcer severity) are considered to be of the most common complications associated with Diabetes, which are mostly hard to heal using the conventional treatment methods which by consequence severely affects the quality and lifestyle of the diabetes patient. It's thought that the application of Autologous activated platelets "Resticutis" which secretes huge amounts of growth factors is capable of giving better results of which are: the stimulation of the healing process that includes contraction, granulation, tissue formation and epithelialization of the diabetic foot ulcer. Resticutis is obtained from an autologous 20 mL peripheral blood withdrawn in tubes containing 3.8% Sodium Citrate. Blood is then centrifuged to obtain Platelet-Rich Plasma -PRP- as per established method. PRP is then activated in a closed system by physical methods to obtain a final product of 5 mL of Resticutis which is injected intra-lesional at ulcer margins per each session of therapy. It's hypothesized that a total of six injections throughout the period of the treatment are enough to achieve full closure of the DFU. The injections are given on days: 0,14,28,42,56, and 70 of the treatment period. The total number of consenting patients to be studied will be calculated using standard statistical design and the patients will be randomized into 3 groups: One group will be given Resticutis, the second one Platelet-Rich Plasma PRP, and the third Platelet-Poor Plasma PPP. If patients in PRP and PPP groups didn't achieve full healing after six injections, they're given a two weeks rest after which they are given Resticutis instead. AutoCAD Program will be used to measure the ulcer area and to scale it and the data will be analyzed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>People with Type II Diabetes mellitus between the ages of 18 and 70 with an ulcer with at least 4 weeks duration. Hb1c of less than 12 %. Index foot ulcer located on the plantar, medial, or lateral aspect of the foot (including all toe surfaces), and wound area (length*width) measurement between 0.5 cm^2 and 20 cm^2, inclusive. Wounds located under a Charcot deformity has to be free of acute changes and went through appropriate structural consolidation. Wagner Grade II or III ulcer. The protocol requires that postdebridement, the ulcer would be free of necrotic debris, foreign bodies, or sinus tracts. Non invasive vascular testing Ankle Brachial Index (ABI). Physical examination (Including a SemmesWeinstein monofilament test for neuropathy). Blood tests to be obtained (CBC, Hb1c) Approved, informed, signed consent to be obtained from each patient. Patient currently enrolled in another investigative device or drug trial or previously enrolled (within the last 30 days) in an investigative research of a device or a pharmaceutical agent. Ulcer area decreased &gt; 50% during the sevenday screening period. Ulcer is due to a nondiabetic etiology. Evidence of gangrene in ulcer or on any part of the foot. Patient is currently receiving or has received radiation or chemotherapy within the last 3 months of randomization. Patient has received growth factor therapy within 7 days of randomization. Screening platelets count &lt; 100* 10^9/L. Patient is undergoing renal dialysis, or has a known immune insufficiency, known abnormal platelets activation disorder (i.e. Grey Platelet Syndrome, Liver Disease, Active Cancer), eating/nutritional, hematologic, collagen vascular disease, rheumatic disease, or bleeding disorder. History of peripheral vascular repair within 30 days of randomization. Patient is known to have a physiological, developmental, physical, emotional, or social disorder, or any other situation that may interfere with their compliance with the study requirements and/or the healing of the ulcer. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the last year prior to randomization. Patient has inadequate venous access for blood withdraw.</criteria>
