	<brief_summary>Brief Summary: The investigators are registering all PD patients at recruited hospitals and developing a PD database in China. Patients will be followed up every 3 months, and both baseline and follow-up information will be collected and input into the registration system. The patient survival, technical survival, peritonitis rate, longitudinal changes of residual renal function and peritoneum function, and quality of life for PD patients, etc, will be compared using the PD database.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peritoneal Dialysis Registration System (PERSIST)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: The investigators are registering all end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, and developing a PD database in China. Patients' demographic characteristics (including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, smoking, drinking, and education, etc), clinical characteristics (primary cause of ESRD, dialysis prescription, patient's condition and lab measurements of serum, urine, and dialysate), drug information, complications and scores of quality of life at the baseline will be collected. Patients will be followed up every 3 months. Demographic and clinical characteristics, complications, drug information of patients will be collected at each visit. The patients' clinical outcomes, such as mortality (including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality), technical survival, kidney transplantation, transfer to hemodialysis, hospitalization, occurrence of peritonitis, etc. were also followed up till the end of the study. The data of patient survival, technical survival, peritonitis rate, hospitalization rate, clinical lab parameters, longitudinal changes of residual renal function and peritoneum function, peritonitis rate, hospitalization rate, clinical lab parameters and quality of life for PD patients will be analyzed using the PD database.</detailed_description>
