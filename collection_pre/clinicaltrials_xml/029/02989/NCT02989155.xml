	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid Use and Blood Loss in Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A review of the medical record between January 01 2013 to July 1st 2015 will be used to determine if the hypothesis that patients receiving tranexamic acid will have a lower need for blood transfusion and there are changes in the levels of the proteins essential for healthy oxygen transport throughout the body is correct. Tranexamic acid is a medication which may help wounds to stop bleeding more quickly. Participants are not expected to receive any direct benefits from participating in this study. Only a small risk of private patient medical information being exposed is anticipated. The results of this study will help surgeons and the medical community to better understand the uses of this type of drug and its possible role in benefiting hip replacement patients during and following surgery.</detailed_description>
