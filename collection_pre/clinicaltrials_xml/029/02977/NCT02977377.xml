	<brief_title>The Effects Of Whole Body Vibration On Postural Control In Patients With Ataxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, group 1 will take only exercise therapy, group 2 will take exercise therapy and whole body vibration together. After 1 week wash-out period, patients assigned other therapy period. All assessments will be repeated before and after each therapy period. Exercise therapy will consist of selected balance, coordination and walking exercises according to the individual needs of patients. Whole body vibration (20-30 Hz, minimum amplitude) will be applied to cases in the form of 4 sets (1 min application and 1min rest.) Cases will take the treatment 1-hour, 3 days in a week for 8 weeks. The evaluation parameters consists of demographic information, Computerized Dynamic Posturography, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, Trunk Impairment Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Barthel Index and Goal Assessment Scale.</detailed_description>
