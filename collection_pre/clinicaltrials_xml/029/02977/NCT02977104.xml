	<brief_title>Maestro Handheld Cardiac Monitor Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if Maestro can be used to detect heart arrhythmias, specifically atrial fibrillation in humans. Maestro will be used to measure heart rate and rhythm at the same time that patients are being monitored with a standard 3, 5, or 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in a clinical setting. The recorded Maestro results will be compared to the ECG results to assess Maestro's accuracy. Data will be analyzed by a pass/fail criterial. The data will be downloaded and printed for the investigators' interpretation who will first review and code the data from Meastro, blinded to the ECG findings. Then the investigators will interpret the ECG findings and the 2 sets of data will be compared. The ECG result is the true value with which to compare the Maestro result.</detailed_description>
