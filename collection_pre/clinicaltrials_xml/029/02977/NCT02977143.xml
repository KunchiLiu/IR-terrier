	<brief_summary>In urologic robotic surgery with steep Trendelenburg position, maintenance of cardiac preload and cardiac output is important for clinical prognosis. Previous studies reported the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced increase in central venous pressure (CVP) could be a accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients. The authors attempt to evaluate the predictability of PEEP-induced increase in CVP as well as stroke volume variation in urologic robotic surgery with Steep Trendelenburg position.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In urologic robotic surgery with steep Trendelenburg position, maintenance of cardiac preload and cardiac output is important for clinical prognosis. As a preload index, the predictability of central venous pressure, pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variations may be impaired due to the impaired hemodynamics that result from the effect of increased abdominal pressure and decreased venous return. Previous studies reported the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced increase in central venous pressure (CVP) could be a accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in cardiac surgical patients. Therefore, the authors attempt to evaluate the predictability of PEEP-induced increase in CVP as well as stroke volume variation in urologic robotic surgery with Steep Trendelenburg position.</detailed_description>
