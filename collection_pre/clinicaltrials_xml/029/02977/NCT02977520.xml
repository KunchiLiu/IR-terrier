	<brief_summary>Cerebral aneurysm is one of the main diseases that seriously affect human health. The most important treatment method is surgical clipping and endovascular embolization. Not complete occlusion of the aneurysm is a main risk of recurrence and rebleeding after treatment. This study is focused on the 3D model of cerebral aneurysms and preoperative evaluation. Combined with the 3D model, the neurosurgeon can complete the discussion of preoperative prediction of aneurysms and recognize the adjacent bone, blood vessels, aneurysm directions and so on. In addition, the model can also be used to the young doctor's training, and the patient and their families can be convenient and intuitive understanding of the disease, so as to form a good communication between doctors and patients.</brief_summary>
