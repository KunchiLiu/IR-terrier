	<brief_title>Lacto-fermented Sauerkraut in the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects around 11% of the population globally. Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS, including psychological stress, gastrointestinal motility, and diet . More recently, it has become clear that the gastrointestinal microbiota may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of this functional GI condition. Several studies have shown that an altered gut microbiota profile is present in at least some subgroups of IBS patients. This may, in part, explain why a proportion of IBS patients have elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in systemic circulation. Gut microbiome manipulation, for example through the use of probiotic and prebiotic supplements, has shown some promise in the treatment of IBS. However, the research in this area is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear what type of intervention that is the preferred choice in cases of IBS. Several studies have investigated how the use of probiotic supplements containing Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli affect the clinical outcome of patients with IBS. However, to date, no studies have assessed whether fermented vegetables, a "natural" source of probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum, are useful in the treatment of IBS.</detailed_description>
