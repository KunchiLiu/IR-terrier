	<brief_summary>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of generic imatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in Jordan. It was a multicenter, non-interventional, open-label, prospective study combined with retrospective data collection from files of patients with a diagnosis of Ph+ CML, treated with Cemivil (imatinib), where no visits or intervention(s) additional to the daily practice were performed</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cemivil® (Imatinib) in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients in Jordan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objectives Measure the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML patients in CP treated with Cemivil who achieve optimal response : - Complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months; - Minor cytogenetic response (mCyR) at 3 months (Ph+ ≤65%); partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 6 months (Ph+ ≤35%), and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months (No Ph+ metaphases); - Major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months of Cemivil therapy [a ratio of BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 ≤0.1% on the International Scale]; Assess the safety and tolerability of Cemivil after one year of treatment, based on: - Incidence, severity, and relationship of adverse events (AEs) to the study medication; - Serious AEs; - AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation; - Clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests (according to laboratory reference ranges). Number of Subjects evaluated: 91 (N=33 received generic imatinib as first-line therapy "first-line patients". N=58 switched from patented imatinib to generic imatinib "switched patients")</detailed_description>
