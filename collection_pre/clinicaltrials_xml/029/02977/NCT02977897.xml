	<brief_summary>Prospective, observational pilot study of ten post-transplant patients presenting with diarrhea while taking Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). These patients will undergo a standard workup to confirm MMF induced diarrhea. A stool fecal calprotectin will be measured to determine if it may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of MMF associated diarrhea. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patients will then be treated with a short course of subcutaneous Octreotide which has been shown to cure this type of diarrhea.</brief_summary>
