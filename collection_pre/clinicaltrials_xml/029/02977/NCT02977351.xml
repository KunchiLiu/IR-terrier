	<brief_summary>Determine the relationship between the systemic indications of atherosclerosis by means of the change in the ratio of periodontopathogenic microorganisms following periodontal treatment of individuals who have been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis-atherosclerosis and for individuals who have been diagnosed with systemically healthy-chronic periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining the Relationship Between the Atherosclerosis and Periodontopathogenic Microorganisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been aimed in this study to compare 1) the change in periodontal status; 2) the change of the periodontopathogen microorganisms (A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, P. intermedia, P. micros, F. nucleatum/periodonticum, C. rectus, E. nodatum, E. corrodens, and C. gingivalis/ochracea/sputigena) in dental plaque samples, 3) the changes of the amounts of HDL, LDL, hs-CRP white blood cell levels (WBC), platelet levels (PLT), creatinine, and fibrinogen in serum samples; and 4) the correlation between periodontopathogen microorganisms (A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola, P. intermedia, P. micros, F. nucleatum/periodonticum, C. rectus, E. nodatum, E. corrodens, and C. gingivalis/ochracea/sputigena) and HDL, LDL, hs-CRP WBC, PLT, creatinine, and fibrinogen in patients that have been diagnosed with atherosclerosis-chronic periodontitis and systemic healthy patients and patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis, following non surgical periodontal treatment.</detailed_description>
