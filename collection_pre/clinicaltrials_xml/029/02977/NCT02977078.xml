	<brief_summary>This study will use inhaler technology to observe and feedback overall patterns of medication use. We will look at whether this improves preventer inhaler use and reduces reliever inhaler overuse. We will also assess whether inhaler technology is patient-friendly and cost effective, whether it helps with treatment decisions in asthma and whether it can help us to predict and prevent asthma attacks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The SmartTouch™ range of electronic casings will record the use of metered dose inhalers (MDI) by participants in the study. The actuation data can be remotely viewed and analyzed by the investigators. The hypothesis is that employing such technology to measure medication patterns and to help provide patient feedback improves inhaler adherence and potentially clinical outcomes (asthma control and exacerbations) in asthma patients with recent asthma attacks in a practical, real-world setting. We will assess whether electronic inhaler data capture can identify patients requiring more frequent reviews or treatment change and enable proactive self- management. Using qualitative methods, we will explore participants' attitudes to their asthma management, whether the use of inhaler technology has had an impact on this and whether they found its use acceptable.</detailed_description>
