	<brief_title>Relations Between Atherogenic Index of Plasma-Glucose Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a relatively new index and a predictor of cardiovascular risk. AIP has been shown to be associated with impaired glucose metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between AIP and parameters of glucose metabolism. Methods: This observational study involved 448 healthy individuals who were at risk for diabetes. They were sent to hospital for diabetes check. According to the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test participants were categorized into the three groups; non-diabetic, prediabetic, and diabetic based on the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The association between the diabetes group, AIP and parameters of glucose metabolism was analyzed. The accuracy of registry data compatible with medical records. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Windows version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics for each variable were determined. Normality of the data distribution was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For continuous variables, non-parametric statistics (Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis), and parametric statistics (t-test, ANOVA analysis) were used as appropriate. Statistically significant differences between the groups were determined by the chi-square test for categorical variables. Associations between the variables were explored using the Pearson correlation and Spearman's rho (for data that was not normally distributed). Linear regression analysis with backward elimination was also performed to define variables associated with AIP.</detailed_description>
