	<brief_summary>To investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of C-met Kinase Inhibitor HS-10241 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours that are not eligible for conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of HS-10241 will be escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HS-10241 in advanced cancer patients. At the same time, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of HS-10241 will be observed in advanced cancer patients. To determine the recommended dosage regimen for phase II.</brief_summary>

Acceptable renal function defined below: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN or calculated creatinine clearance (by the CockcroftGault formula) ≥ 60 mL/minutes 11. Acceptable coagulation status defined below: Prothrombin time &lt; 1.5 times ULN Partial thrombin time &lt; 1.5 times UL 12. HIV Ag/Ab(). 13. HCV Ab();or HCV Ab(+) but HCV RNA(). 14. HBsAg（）and HBcAb（）in dose escalation phase；HBV DNA&lt;1×103copies/ml if HBsAg（+）or HBcAb（+）in dose expansion phase. 15. Ability to understand the purposes and risks of the trial and his/her informed consent using the human research ethics committee (HREC) approved informed consent form was obtained before the entering the trial. 1. Treatment with other cMET TKI( specific target or multitarget)； 2. Anticancer treatment with radiation therapy（not including non target lesions receiving palliative radiotherapy）, chemotherapy,hormonotherapy or surgery（small surgery, including the implantation of external equipment or fine needle aspiration, at least 7 days; diagnostic or palliative surgery, at least 14 days） within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C)prior to trial entry. 3. Medical history of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic gastrointestinal disease, or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption of the tested product 4. Cardiac disease with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the trial entry, unstable arrhythmia, or symptomatic peripheral arterial vascular disease. 5. Symptomatic brain metastases or unstable brain metastases (notes: Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases previously treated for the study, but must be kept stable for at least 4 weeks and receive a stable dose of the drug) 6. Obvious neurological and mental disorder. 7. Other previous or concomitant tumors (except for the effective treatment of melanoma, cervical carcinoma in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ or malignant tumor after effective treatment, remission 3 years and considered to have been cured). 8. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy. 9. Recent venous thrombosis (including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 0.5 year of trial entry) 10. History of organ allograft, autologous stem cell transplantation, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 11. Participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 4 weeks prior to the trial entry. 12. Anticancer treatment with radiation therapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C) prior to trial entry. 13. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to the trial entry, without complete recovery 14. Taking a medication that is a moderate or strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP2C9; taking a medication that prolongs QT interval and has a risk of Torsades de Pointes . 15. Pregnant (positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [βHCG] test at Screening) or is currently breastfeeding, their partner anticipates becoming pregnant/impregnating during the trial or within 6 months after receiving the last dose of trial treatment. 16. Known drug abuse or alcohol abuse. 17. Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the trial, or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in this trial.</criteria>
