	<brief_summary>Objectives - To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program based on tele-rehabilitation in stroke survivors. The aim of the intervention is to improve the transition from rehabilitation units to community dwelling and facilitate involvement in life roles in the community. Working hypothesis - The tele-rehabilitation based program for stroke survivors will be effective in: 1. Improving function in activities of daily living, participation in occupations and health related quality of life. 2. Reducing the need for outpatient clinic and rehabilitation services. 3. The intervention achievements will be maintained in 6 months follow-up Methodology - Participants: Stroke survivors will be selected from patients who are referred to the outpatient or home-based rehabilitation unit of Maccabi health services. The participants will be randomly assigned into two groups: The treatment group (N=30) will receive the intervention program in addition to standard care, and control group- standard care only. Outcome measures: 1. Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4) 2. Stroke impact Scale (SIS) 3. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) 4. A 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) 5. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale short version Procedure: The intervention program includes 20 video chat sessions over 10 weeks between an occupational therapist and the participant, in the presence of the primary care giver. The virtual meetings will be conducted using The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance approach. The meetings will focus on problem solving for daily life situations and on the ability to implement the discussed strategies for a variety of activities. Participants will be evaluated at baseline, after the intervention, and after 6 months.</brief_summary>
