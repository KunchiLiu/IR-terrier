	<brief_summary>Iron sucrose infusion is an iron replacement used to treat iron deficiency anemia (not enough iron in the body to make hemoglobin). Iron is a mineral that the body needs to produce hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. When the body does not get enough iron, it cannot produce enough hemoglobin and you become anemic. The research study is looking at the side effects of using a higher dose and faster rate of iron sucrose infusion than what is used in standard of care. The purpose of this study is to see if infusion with 500 mg of iron sucrose over a one hour time period can be done safely. If this can be done safely, it may reduce the total number of infusions required and the time for each infusion. This may be less costly and less burdensome to patients.</brief_summary>
