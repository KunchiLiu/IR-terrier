	<brief_title>Evaluation of Pcv-aCO2 in the Fluid Treatment of Abdominal Tumor Patients After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Confirmed that Pcv-aCO2 is suitable for the guidance of early fluid therapy and the evaluation of the prognosis of patients with abnormal hemodynamics after abdominal tumor surgery, and is expected to be a new monitoring index to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this kind of patients. 2. Pcv-aCO2 effectively reflected the improvement of tissue and organ microcirculation disorder through the individual goal target treatment to guide the fluid resuscitation in the hemodynamic instability patients. 3. Research of the correlation between Pcv-aCO2 and the organ function in patients with abnormal hemodynamics after operation.</detailed_description>
