	<brief_summary>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect approximately 1.1% of late adolescents and young adults, making it one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. Comorbid anxiety disorders affect many higher-functioning adolescents and young adults with ASD, causing substantial distress and impairment over and above that caused by an ASD diagnosis alone. While cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders among typically developing late adolescents, and work by the investigative team supports its utility in children with ASD and comorbid anxiety, very few evidence-based treatment approaches exist for late adolescents with ASD and comorbid anxiety. Accordingly, the investigators are proposing to develop a CBT protocol for clinical anxiety that is personalized to the unique clinical characteristics of late adolescents (ages 16-21 years) with ASD namely, the Treatment of Anxiety in Late Adolescents with Autism (TALAA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect approximately 1.1% of late adolescents and young adults, making it one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. Comorbid anxiety disorders affect many higher-functioning adolescents and young adults with ASD, causing substantial distress and impairment over and above that caused by an ASD diagnosis alone. While cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders among typically developing late adolescents, and work by the investigative team supports its utility in children with ASD and comorbid anxiety, very few evidence-based treatment approaches exist for late adolescents with ASD and comorbid anxiety. Accordingly, the investigators are proposing to develop a CBT protocol for clinical anxiety that is personalized to the unique clinical characteristics of late adolescents (ages 16-21 years) with ASD namely, the Treatment of Anxiety in Late Adolescents with Autism (TALAA). Initial TALAA development efforts will focus on adapting relevant treatment elements from an efficacious CBT program for early adolescents with ASD and comorbid anxiety to the characteristics and clinical needs of the age group. Developmentally appropriate, novel treatment components will be added, including those focusing on fostering successful transitions to adulthood (e.g., work readiness). In response to the NIH Roadmap Initiative, attention will be paid to protocol adaptability with varying clinical presentations. Measures of treatment integrity and competence will be developed. Thereafter, protocol and measure development will be refined through our experiences treating 8 young adults (ages 16-21 years) with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s) as well as through clinician, patient, and expert feedback. The feasibility of implementing TALAA will then be examined in the context of a pilot study incorporating all the features of the planned future efficacy trial comparing TALAA to treatment as usual, but with a limited sample size (N=44).</detailed_description>
