	<brief_summary>Questionnaires are often irreplaceable tools of collection of information in research and in the clinical practice. Coupled with other measures, they can be simple complementary tools, but questionnaires are sometimes the only way to collect data, such as self-service efficacy. The objective of this study is a validation of the French translation of the ASES. To guarantee the comparability between the original version and the translated version, the translation of a questionnaire supposes two essential stages: a literal translation and an adaptation to the cultural context, to the habits of life and to the idioms of the target population. This new version will afterward be validated with patient's troop.</brief_summary>

This questionnaire was already translated into Swedish, Dutch and Turkish. Translation of the ASES and cultural adaptation : The translation of the ASES in French followed the recommendations of the literature, which recommend a double translation, then a double back - translation with synthesis of the data in every stage. A final commission deliberate then a final translation, culturally adapted. Patients' cohort and procedure of validation : The prospective validation will be made with patients affected by degenerative osteoarthritis who fill the questionnaire ASES. These patients arose from cures of three thermal establishments of Auvergne. One group participated in therapeutic programs centered on the physical activity; the other one followed exclusively the water cure and received at the end of the cure an explanatory notebook on the degenerative osteoarthritis with physical exercises centered on the muscular strengthening of lower limbs.
