	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of hysteroscopic tubal application of Iso Amyl-2-cyanoacrylate in occluding uterine tubes of infertile women with hydrosalpinx, which would make it an easy approach for occluding tubes with hydrosalpinx prior to IVF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hysteroscopic Tubal Occlusion Using Iso-Amyl 2-Cyano Acrylate (Amcrylate) in Patients With Hydrosalpinx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted according to the guidelines on human experimentation of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. For all patients after taking signed informed consent , transcervical hysteroscopic cannulation of the proximal one centimeter of fallopian tubes with hydrosalpinx, will be done using a 4 Fr, 42cm long, polyethylene ureteric catheter, where 0.5 ml of Iso Amyl-2-cyanoacrylate (AMCRYLATEÂ®) will be injected. All the surgical procedures will be performed without anesthesia, only premedication with an NSAID (e.g. NaproxenR) is given orally one hour before the procedure. Each patient will be under close observation for the first 24 hours postprocedure for any signs of inflammation as abdominal pain, tenderness or fever and for the vital data. Hysterosalpingography will be done for all patients 0ne and 3 months postinjection to confirm tubal occlusion prior to IVF.</detailed_description>
