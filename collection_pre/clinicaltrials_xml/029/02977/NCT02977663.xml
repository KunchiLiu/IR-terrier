	<brief_summary>1. To build an imaging biobank of 200 patients with lungcancer, including pathologic and molecular characteristics of the tumor (mutational status, circulating DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) from serum biobankâ€¦), staging of the cancer (according to the new 2016 Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) status, the table that classify non-small cell lungcancer) and follow-up informations (Response to first-line treatment (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)), disease-free survival, 1-3 years survival). 2. To propose a simple severity scoring system based on tumor features such as size, doubling time (if available), location, amount of enhancement and necrosis. Such approach has been proposed for glioma evaluation (Visually Accessible Rembrandt Images (VASARI)) but is not available for the lung. The objective is to do better than the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) staging. 3. To develop and evaluate an IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) protocol for lungcancer evaluation.</brief_summary>
