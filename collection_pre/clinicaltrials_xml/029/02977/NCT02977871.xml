	<brief_summary>Cesarean section is the most common surgical procedure performed on women. Over the years minor variations of each surgical step have been introduced, and cesarean sections are not standardized and many different techniques are employed during surgery. Creation of a bladder flap has been an integral surgical step of the cesarean section for many years. The role of the bladder flap and its usefulness in cesarean section is not known well. Further, in some cases the bladder flap is omitted during cesarean section. The aim of the current study is to compare operating time and postoperative urinary symptoms in cesarean sections using either bladder flap or omission of flap.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bladder Flap Versus Omission of Flap During Cesarean Section of Primiparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean section is the most common surgical procedure performed on women. The main aspects of the surgical approach to low-transverse cesarean delivery have not changed much since1926. Over the years minor variations of each surgical step have been introduced, and cesarean sections are not standardized and many different techniques are employed during surgery. Creation of a bladder flap has been an integral surgical step of the cesarean section for many years. The evidence on the role of the bladder flap and its usefulness in cesarean section is very limited. In emergent cesarean sections where rapid delivery is the main goal, the bladder flap is usually omitted. Literature about the usefulness of a bladder flap is limited and more randomized studies are needed. Most of the study outcomes were focusing operating time however, the investigator in the current study additional focused on postoperative urinary symptoms and dynamics. The aim of the current study is to compare operating time and postoperative urinary symptoms in cesarean sections using either bladder flap or omission of flap.</detailed_description>
