	<brief_title>Short-term Effects of a Carob Snack on Postprandial Glycemic Responses and Energy Intake and Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aimed at 1. firstly determine the glycemic index (GI) of a carob snack compared with an isoenergetic, equal weight chocolate cookie and 2. test the hypothesis that a carob preload consumed as snack before a meal, compared to chocolate cookie would: (a) have greater short-term effect on satiety measured by subsequent ad libitum meal intake, (b) induce greater satiety as assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS), and (c) reduce postprandial glycemic response.</detailed_description>
