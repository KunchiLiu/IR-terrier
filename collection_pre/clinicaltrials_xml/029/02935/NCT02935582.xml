	<brief_summary>Multinational real-life study of current psoriasis treatment strategies, topical treatment patterns and treatment outcomes of these treatments, including the newly introduced calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate aerosol foam fixed combination product Enstilar® (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PSOREAL - Managing PSOriasis in the REAL World</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multinational study aims to describe current treatment patterns and outcomes in the diversity of the real life setting: local differences in access to drugs and current treatment practices, and regional cultural differences, covering adult patients of all backgrounds, sex, socio-economic standing, health background, comorbidity and co-medication. A total of around 1200 real-life prescribers in 15-20 countries around the globe are expected to participate over the years, with each country contributing data to the study for around 2 years, starting data collection within the first year after local market introduction of Enstilar®. The real-life prescribing and utilization patterns of topical prescription products approved for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in the individual participating countries will be mapped and performance of the products in real life will be investigated based primarily on baseline data from investigators and patient reported data contributed by the individual patient for 1 year. Patients are expected to enter data on their electronic device at baseline and at times of treatment changes and other key events, and investigators are expected to contribute data after each contact with the patient. Patients will be approached for informed consent to participate in the study after their individual treatment plan has been decided. The study aims to include two patients on other topical treatment for every patient planned to receive Enstilar® in order to ensure a sufficient sample of Enstilar® treated patients to capture the diversity of real-life prescription patterns in patients not on Enstilar®, and to allow for sufficiently powered comparisons between Enstilar® and other real-world treatment strategies. A systematic approach will be used to select eligible patients to be approached for study participation in order to minimize selection bias and control seasonal variations.</detailed_description>
