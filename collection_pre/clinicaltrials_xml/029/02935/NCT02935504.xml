	<brief_title>PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM): A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder continues to be the leading cause of disability among women of reproductive age and major public health concern. Upwards of 1 in 5 women suffer from depression during pregnancy or within a year after giving birth. It has negative effects on birth outcomes, infant attachment, behavior and development. Maternal suicide causes 20% of postpartum deaths in depressed women. Although the majority of women are amenable to depression screening, screening alone does not improve treatment entry or outcome. Despite the availability of effective evidence-based treatments and frequent contact with obstetric providers, less than one-third of women who screen positive for depression receive treatment. Ob/Gyn practices need supports in place to adequately address depression in their patient populations. Thus, the Investigators developed a program called "PRogram In Support of Moms" (PRISM) that aims to leverage existing roles and resources to target patient, provider, and system level barriers to perinatal depression treatment. PRISM aims to improve perinatal depression treatment and treatment response rates through: (1) access to psychiatric telephone consultation for Ob/Gyn providers; (2) clinic-specific implementation of stepped care, including training support and toolkits; and, (3) proactive treatment engagement, patient monitoring, and stepped treatment response to depression screening/assessment. Four practices were randomly assigned to PRISM versus an active comparison group called MCPAP for Moms which is a state-wide telephonic perinatal psychiatry program. The Investigators will compare the effectiveness of PRISM vs. MCPAP for Moms to improve depression severity and treatment participation in pregnancy through 3 months postpartum among patients.</detailed_description>
