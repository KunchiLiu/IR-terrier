	<brief_summary>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) indications are progressing rapidly as an alternative to conventional surgery for aortic stenosis cure. Despite a high rate of procedural success, some patients do not benefit from the procedure. The investigators hypothesis is that aortic stiffness may be of major prognostic significance after stenosis relief. The aim of this study is to test the prognostic impact of aortic stiffness estimated by the volume of calcifications of the thoracic aorta on the CT-scan performed systematically before the procedure. This prognostic value will be assessed in 4 independent cohorts issued from 4 french cities (Lyon, Rouen, Paris, Clermont-Ferrand).</brief_summary>
