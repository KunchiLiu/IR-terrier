	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of various antimicrobial treatments on the intestinal microbiome of small children. The participating children with acute otitis media are treated wither with amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate or without antibiotics. The children with allergy to amoxicillin receive a course of macrolide and they will be monitored as a separate group. The main outcomes of this trial are the changes in the intestinal microbiome after the treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Antimicrobial Treatment of Acute Otitis Media on the Intestinal Microbiome in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media has been proven efficacious in children. It has been suggested that antimicrobial treatment makes a lot of harm to intestinal microbiome and may thus have effects on the child's health and wellbeing. However, data on these changes and their magnitude is scanty. This is a randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of various antimicrobial treatments on the intestinal microbiome of small children. The participating children with acute otitis media are treated wither with amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate or without antibiotics. The children with allergy to amoxicillin receive a course of macrolide and they will be monitored as a separate group. The main outcomes of this trial are the changes in the intestinal microbiome after the treatment.</detailed_description>
