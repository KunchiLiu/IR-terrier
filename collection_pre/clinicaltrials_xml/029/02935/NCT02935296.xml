	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a future trial that will assess whether an integrated intervention combining psychosocial counseling and supported referrals for antiretroviral therapy (ART) at any CD4 cell count and substance use treatment for HIV-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) will reduce HIV transmission to HIV-uninfected injection partners, as compared to routine care dictated by national guidelines for HIV-infected PWID.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multi-site, two-arm, randomized, vanguard study. Network units will consist of an HIV-infected index participant and his/her HIV-uninfected network injection partner(s). Network units will be randomized to the intervention or standard of care arms in a 1:3 ratio, stratified by site. To assess feasibility of the intervention, additional interviews will be conducted with study staff (systems navigators and counselors) and clinic-based stakeholders at each study site. Approximately 500 Index participants and their partners will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
