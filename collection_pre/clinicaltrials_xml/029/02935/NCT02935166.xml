	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle weakness and fatigue are related to clinical deterioration in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Respiratory muscle training (RMT) is a key therapeutic strategy in these patients. It is necessary therefore to increase its dissemination on a large scale, improve patientÂ´s adherence and optimize the control of the implementation of training. The aim of this project was to design a RMT device including light and sound incentives, digital registration application and analysis of the training sessions, and studying the effectiveness of a new shortened RMT scheme of high intensity that could provide added value to enhance the implementation of training in patients with COPD. From an operational point of view, researches were organized into three packages of complementary work focused on the design of a new portable dual valve with electronic lighting and auditory incentives components. The conceptualization and design of a software to analyze the performance and individual continuous use of the valve, and the evaluation of the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a shortened schedule of respiratory muscle training in adult patients with COPD were realized.</brief_summary>
