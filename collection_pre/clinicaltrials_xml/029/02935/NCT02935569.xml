	<brief_title>Compression Headband Use to Prevent Hair Loss During Whole Brain Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot feasibility study. The primary objective of this study is to seek preliminary information to answer the following question: 1. Does a compression headband, placed only at the time of irradiation, reduce the incidence of significant hair loss after whole brain radiation, as compared to historical controls? This study will also seek to answer these secondary questions: 2. Is a temporary compression headband well tolerated in patients undergoing whole brain radiation? 3. If a portion of patients do have significant hair loss after radiation in spite of compression banding, what is the timing of hair regrowth? 4. In normal volunteers, does a compression headband cause acute hypoxia in the scalp, as measured by a transcutaneous oxygen pressure monitor, and, if so, to what degree?</detailed_description>
