	<brief_summary>With markedly increased antibiotic resistance and unsatisfactory efficacies of common empiric eradication regimens in the mainland of China, tailored therapy may be the best choice to achieve good efficacy. This study compared the eradication rates, safety, and compliance of antibiotic sensitivity-based tailored therapy compared with empiric bismuth quadruple therapy in the naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.</brief_summary>
