	<brief_summary>This study will recruit women with post partum pre-eclampsia and match them to controls without postpartum pre-eclampsia to identify an epigenetic signature that is specific to women with post partum pre-eclampsia to help characterize the underlying pathophysiology of post partum pre-eclampsia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization and Epigenetics of Post-Partum Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia (PEC) is a heterogeneous disease that complicates 5-8% of pregnancies. Approximately 10% of PEC patients will present with post-partum PEC without having developed the syndrome during the pregnancy (PP-PEC). Management of post-partum preeclampsia (PP-PEC) is challenging because many women do not seek care until neurologic symptoms result from severe-range elevated blood pressure. The pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of PP-PEC are understudied and poorly understood. Identifying clinical risk factors and biomarkers of PP-PEC would help to identify women at risk.</detailed_description>
