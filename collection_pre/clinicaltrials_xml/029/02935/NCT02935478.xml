	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant liver tumor and has a grave prognosis. Obesity is an epidemic in the US.Patients with HCC and obesity are not candidates for liver transplantation, depriving them of the best option for cure from HCC. Recent studies have shown that blocking blood vessels to a particular portion of the stomach (bariatric or left gastric artery embolization) can temporarily decrease levels of the appetite inducing hormone ghrelin, and result in weight loss.The purpose of this study is to determine if Left gastric artery embolization (LGAE) in patients with cirrhosis and HCC who are not transplant candidates due to morbid obesity, leads to clinically significant weight loss with eligibility for liver transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity:In adults, obesity is defined as a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m2. It is estimated that, by the year 2030, 38% of the world's adult population will be overweight and another 20% obese .An expert panel convened by the NIH stated that for the first time in history, the steadily improving worldwide life expectancy could level off or even decline, as the result of increasing obesity. Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and HCC: The problem: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant liver tumor seen in the setting of cirrhosis, which itself can be of varying etiology. NASH as cause for liver cirrhosis and HCC has been growing in last decade. Although Hepatitis C is currently the most common indication for liver transplant, longitudinal trends show that NASH has a trajectory to become the most common. Current options in management: Patients who develop HCC in the context of underlying chronic liver disease complicated by portal hypertension are not candidates for resection therapy; rather, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) offers the best option for cure and long-term survival. Most transplant centers have strict criteria for OLT; one of the most common is a BMI &lt; 35 kg/m2. Most NASH patients with HCC will have a high BMI. Unfortunately in presence of HCC these patients have a very limited time to lose enough weight to qualify to be listed. Lifestyle modification and medical therapies are relatively ineffective. Bariatric surgery is contraindicated in patients with portal hypertension due to significant increase in post-operative mortality, more relevant in patient listed to liver transplantation. Thus a safe and effective minimally invasive option is needed. Based on currently available data, Left gastric artery embolization (LGAE) appears effective in inducing weight loss of about 10.5% in 3-6 months, with a high safety profile. In patients who have cirrhosis and portal hypertension with HCC and who are not transplant candidates due to morbid obesity , appropriate and timely weight loss of 10.5% in 3-6 months by performing LGAE may allow them to be listed and transplanted before their cirrhosis and tumor reaches an inoperable stage( within Milan criteria). In patients with HCC, the procedure can be performed concurrently with the procedure of Trans arterial chemoembolization which is commonly used in down staging HCC to Milan criteria.</detailed_description>
