	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to establish that transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islet cells into the anterior chamber of a severely visual impaired diabetic human eye is safe and does not cause ophthalmic or systemic complications. Furthermore, the change in insulin production, glucose control and hypoglycaemia awareness will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pancreatic Islet Transplantation in the Anterior Chamber of the Human Eye - a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators intend to transplant 4 Type 1 Diabetes mellitus patients with compromised vision in one or both eyes due to diabetic or other complications, and who have already received kidney transplantation (i.e., already on immunosuppression). Transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic human islets will be performed into the anterior chamber of a single eye with compromised vision. Since the recipients are already immunosuppressed due to maintenance therapy for the kidney graft, investigators will only use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Only in case of uncontrolled reaction, steroid should be used under guidance of the ophthalmologists. Investigators will neither inject local immunosuppressive drugs nor change ongoing immunosuppressive medication in the pilot study. The overall objective is to establish that transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islet cells into the anterior chamber of a severely visual impaired diabetic human eye is safe and does not cause ophthalmic or systemic complications. Furthermore, the change in insulin production, glucose control and hypoglycaemia awareness will be assessed. In this pilot study investigators aim to gain experience in the technique, to obtain preliminary data on the amount of insulin that can be expected per transplanted islet equivalent (IEQ) and observe possible local reactions. These data will help to design a future larger study in patients without visual impairment.</detailed_description>
