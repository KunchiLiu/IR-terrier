	<brief_summary>Major psychotic symptoms such as auditory hallucination (AH) are main features of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, resulting in severe social and clinical dysfunction. However, these symptoms are sufficiently unresponsive to antipsychotic medications in a substantial portion of patients. Neuroimaging studies suggest that aberrant activities at specific brain regions such as frontal areas, sensory areas and language-related areas are related to these symptoms. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means for altering brain electrical neural activity. TMS has been used in a wide range of clinical research especially in neurology and psychiatry. There are preliminary treatments of psychosis and AH using TMS but results are inconsistent. The high inter-subject variability limits the efficacy of TMS treatment for schizophrenia patients. The investigators aim to develop a TMS treatment method with a functional MRI-defined treatment target area, where the TMS target is individually identified to maximize the TMS effects. If the current target-identification successfully identified effective TMS target individually, the treatment efficacy could be significant improved and more patients will benefit from TMS treatment.</brief_summary>
