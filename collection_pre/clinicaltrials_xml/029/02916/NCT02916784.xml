	<brief_summary>1. Were there differences in functional ability between ambulatory individuals with SCI who passed and failed the independent sit-to-stand (iSTS) task? 2. Did the ability of iSTS relate to ability of walking as determined using a type of AAD used? 3. What were factors associated with the ability of iSTS?</brief_summary>
