	<brief_summary>This project aims to reduce the frequency of duplicate, false and clinically insignificant alarms in hospital units, and subsequent alarm fatigue resulting from excessive alarm frequency. The investigators will implement evidence-based guidelines for alarm optimization according to patient-population specific parameters, and evaluate alarm frequency and staff perception of alarm fatigue at baseline and 60 days after implementation of this quality improvement initiative.</brief_summary>
