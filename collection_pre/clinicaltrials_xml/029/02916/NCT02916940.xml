	<brief_summary>There is currently no real consensus on the optimal management of acute sprains of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the long fingers. The aim of this study is to assess the beneficial effect of an injection of corticosteroids for the treatment of this type of sprain (one single sub-cutaneous injection, in the acute phase). This treatment, if effective, might become the treatment of choice for these types of injuries, instead of a prolonged immobilization or a careful early mobilization.</brief_summary>
