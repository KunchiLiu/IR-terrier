	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to implement a computational model that can predict and optimize training and cross-language generalization patterns for bilingual persons with aphasia (BPA). The proposed work will determine the best possible treatment program for each individual patient even before they are rehabilitated. In addition, the computational model allows specification of variables such as age of acquisition, language exposure/proficiency, impairment and their systematic influence on a range of language rehabilitation outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of aphasia with naming deficits and concurrent lexical/semantic impairment At least 6 months postonset of single, lefthemisphere stroke Bilingual: speaking both Spanish and English (or Chinese and English) Visual and auditory acuity sufficient for experimental tasks The ability to understand study procedures and comply with them for the entire length of the study Diagnosed with medical disease that could compromise participation (e.g., cancer undergoing acute treatment, unstable diabetes, renal or hepatic insufficiency, fluctuating systemic immunological disease such as systemic lupus erythematosis, etc.) Diagnosed with mental illness other than active depression Neurological condition other than that which resulted in aphasia Currently taking medications that are known to exert significant effects on cognitive processes, such as neuroleptics, steroids, anticholinesterase inhibitors, etc. Overt, behaviorally noticeable, attentional limitations that interfere with completing the experimental tasks Current drug or alcohol use or dependence that would interfere with adherence to study requirements, in the opinion of the principal investigator Proficient in more than just Spanish and English (or Chinese and English) Premorbid history of speech/language disorder</criteria>
