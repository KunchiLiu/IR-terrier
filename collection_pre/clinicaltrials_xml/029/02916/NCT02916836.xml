	<brief_summary>The drug iatrogenesis represents an important public health problem. In the Iatromed project, we want to to assess a specific therapeutic drug conciliation sheet (TDC). This multicenter observational study is focus on 750 patients aged over 75 year old with polymedication. The main objective will be to determine if the use of the TDC, at the discharge of hospital, allows to reduce the number of use in emergency care within the two month after their hospital discharge</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of the Use of a Therapeutic Conciliation Document at the Outlet of Hospital, on the Emergency Use of Hospital Care in Patient Aged Over 75 Years Old.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug iatrogenesis represents an important public health problem with 5-10% of the grounds of hospitalization after age 65, and more than 20% after 80 years. Based on this observation, the health authority has proposed in 2011 the realization of therapeutic drug conciliation particularly in the elderly with multiple pathologies and multiple drugs. Taking into account the central role of the family practitioner in prescriptions, and the importance of coordination information such as output of hospitalization (vector of many malfunctions), we have achieved a therapeutic drug conciliation sheet (TDC) based primarily on the information needs by family practitioner after hospitalization of their patients. The issue of this study is to assess the interest for the use of a such TDC on the decrease in the rate of rehospitalization in the target population. To do this, we are proposing a multicenter observational study. Randomization would be across the centres. The study would focus on 750 patients more of 75 with polymedication. The follow-up will last 6 months. The main objective will be to determine if the use of the TDC, at the discharge of hospital, allows to reduce the number of use in emergency care within the two month after their hospital discharge. The first secondary objective will be identical to the main objective but rated at 6 months and the second secondary objective will be to assess the impact of the use of the TDC on overall mortality at 6 months.</detailed_description>
