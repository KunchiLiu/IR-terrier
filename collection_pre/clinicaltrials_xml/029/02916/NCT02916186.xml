	<brief_summary>The goal of the present study is to compare the amount of root coverage resulting from subepithelial connective tissue graft and acellular dermal matrix associated with tunnel technique among patients suffering from multiple gingival recession.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft Versus Acellular Dermal Matrix With Tunnel Technique in Treatment of Multiple Gingival Recessions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acellular dermal matrix with Tunnel technique will offers great advantages for patients with multiple gingival recession as regards decrease surgical time, Post-Operative pain and root coverage, clinical attachment level, width of Keratinized gingiva, gingival biotype compared to subepithelial connective tissue graft with Tunnel technique.</detailed_description>

Current and former smokers. Pregnant females. Subjects received any periodontal therapy for minimum of 6 months prior to the study. Subjects taking drugs known to interfere with wound healing.
