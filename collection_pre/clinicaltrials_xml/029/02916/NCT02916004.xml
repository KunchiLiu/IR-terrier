	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to describe the feasibility of the nociception flexion reflex and the pupillary dilatation reflex as objective pain assessment tools in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Furthermore to describe the relationship between the responses and the standard of care pain evaluation in the critically ill sedated patients. Patients were under propofol / remifentanil or propofol / sufentanil sedation protocol during measurements in a stair-case increasing intensity model of standardized stimulations. (Stimulation intensity are similar to the stimulations of neuromuscular blocking agents monitoring.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Nociception Flexion Reflex and Pupillary Dilatation Reflex in ICU Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pupillary dilatation reflex: tetanic stimulations at the nervus medianus were performed starting form 10 milliamperes (mA) up to 60mA. Pupillary diameter was measured before, during and after stimulation. Nociception flexion reflex: tetanic stimulations at the nervus suralis were performed starting form 0.5mA in increasing steps via an automated RIII (NFR) threshold tracking model.</detailed_description>
