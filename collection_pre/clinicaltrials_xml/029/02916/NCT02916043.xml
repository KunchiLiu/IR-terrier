	<brief_summary>Cell-count related risk factors for acute kidney injury after cardiovascular surgery have been reported. The authors attempted to investigate whether the perioperative cell counts of neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet are associated with the postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term mortality after cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neutrophil, Lymphocyte and Platelet as a Predictor for AKI and Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiovascular surgery remains a serious complication associated with increased mortality for up to 10 years. The incidence of AKI after cardiovascular surgery is as high as 55% and the incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) to be up to 8 %. Cell-count related risk factors for acute kidney injury after cardiovascular surgery have been reported. The authors attempted to investigate whether the perioperative cell counts of neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet are associated with the postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term mortality after cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.</detailed_description>
