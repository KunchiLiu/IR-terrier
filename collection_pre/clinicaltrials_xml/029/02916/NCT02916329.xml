	<brief_summary>The investigators developed [68Ga]-labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule as a targeted molecular imaging agent for noninvasive and repeatable detecting EGFR-ECD expression status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo EGFR-ECD Molecular Imaging Using [68Ga]- Labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of investigators are to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor EGFR-ECD expression status and classify EGFR-ECD benefit NSCLC patients. The investigators want to evaluated the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule in lung cancer imaging in adult NSCLC patients with different EGFR-ECD expression status of primary and metastatic cancers.</detailed_description>
