	<brief_summary>The Zika (ZIKV) epidemic has spread into the three French Overseas Departments in the Caribbean (DFAs). It is therefore urgent to set up tools to collect clinical and paraclinical data for the evaluation of potential complications due to having ZIKV infection during pregnancy. This study is meant to collect, within usual care practices, clinical and paraclinical information which will allow the precise description of the consequences of ZIKV infection occurring during pregnancy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational, non-interventional study that has been integrated into the usual standard of care practices. All information and biological samples collected during the course of this project will be done through the new medical standard of care which has been put in place during the ZIKV epidemic in the DFAs; this new standard of care is a result of existing recommendations from medical professionals and/or public health authorities. Outside of these recommendations, no invasive procedure will be done simply to satisfy an objective of this study.</detailed_description>
