	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into two groups of 15, "Routine Care" group, which will serve as the control group, and "Octreotide" group. The amount of bronchial secretions is routinely measured in all mechanically ventilated patients. Once the Primary Team identifies a patient as a candidate for the study (based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and an informed consent has been obtained, the baseline volume of bronchial secretions per 12-hour period will be recorded and a security envelope containing group assignment will be opened by the ICU attending. Both groups will continue to receive treatments that have already been initiated to manage bronchial secretions. In addition, "Octreotide" group will receive parenteral octreotide, while "Routine Care" group will receive care as deemed necessary by the Primary Team. The rate of bronchial secretions will be measured and recorded daily; the changes, relative to the baseline measurements, will be compared between the groups. These interventions will be continued for 72 hours or until extubation or withdrawal from the study, whichever occurs earlier. Subsequently, the standard of care management, as determined by the Primary Team, will be resumed.</brief_summary>
