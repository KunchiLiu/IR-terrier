	<brief_summary>The investigators developed [68Ga]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule as a targeted molecular imaging agent for noninvasive and repeatable detecting IGF-1R expression status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo IGF-1R Molecular Imaging Using [68Ga]- Labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of investigators are to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor IGF-1R expression status. The investigators want to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule in IGF-1R expression cancer imaging in adult cancer patients （colon cancer 、NSCLC、gliomas cancer patients）with different IGF-1R expression status.</detailed_description>
