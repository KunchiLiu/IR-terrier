	<brief_summary>Depression is often the most prevalent mental health problem among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide, and if not adequately treated, it may impair response to antiretroviral treatment (ART) and the ability of individuals to adhere to medications and healthy behavior. Most patients with depression receiving ART in the poorest countries of the world are left untreated because no systematic approach or expertise is available. This study adapts an evidence-based model of depression care (Measurement-Based Care - MBC) using auxiliary HIV clinic staff, and tests feasibility and assesses costs among HIV positive patients beginning ART in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement-based Care for Depression in Resource-Poor Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This developmental and exploratory study develops and tests a scalable model for the diagnosis and treatment of depression among HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-poor settings. The investigators conduct a pilot test of the measurement-based care (MBC) approach to intervening, task shifting, and managing depression, which was adapted for use with auxiliary personnel who support HIV physicians in algorithm-guided antidepressant treatment. This intervention is based on the MBC approach developed by Pence, and conducted in HIV clinical sites in the US and Africa. The investigators adapted and tested an auxiliary-driven model, MBC-Aux, which is the first study of this approach with auxiliary personnel in a resource- poor country and its ART system. The study was conducted at the GHESKIO Centers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, which is responsible for 50% of the ART population in Haiti. The investigators conducted a formative study of psychosocial factors related to depression and antidepressant medication in Aim 1, adapted the MBC depression medication and monitoring algorithm for use by auxiliary personnel at GHESKIO in Aim 2 and conducted a pre-test of procedures, and piloted the resulting MBC-Aux adaptation in Aim 3 compared to Enhanced Usual Care. The investigators also evaluated feasibility and cost. Although they are very safe medications, use of antidepressants in MBC-Aux, like use of all pharmacologic agents, incurs some measurable risk of mild, moderate and rare but severe side effects. Risks were explained to participants receiving antidepressant treatment and MBC-Aux includes systematic monitoring of participants taking these medications. This R21 developmental and exploratory study will produce the first systematic formative work of psychosocial factors related to depression in Haiti, and is the first to apply and test the MBC approach with auxiliary personnel.</detailed_description>
