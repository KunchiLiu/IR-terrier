	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of different vegetables on cardiovascular function in subjects with moderately increased blood pressure. Specifically we are comparing the effects of vegetables with a high natural content of inorganic nitrate with those of vegetables with a low nitrate content.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Nitrate in Vegetables on Blood Pressure in Subjects With Prehypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies indicate that dietary-derived inorganic nitrate can affect blood pressure in humans by converting into nitric oxide bioactivity. Here we will study if vegetables that naturally contain high amounts of nitrate (green leafy vegetables) can lower blood pressure and whether any effect is attributed to the nitrate anion. High nitrate vegetables are compared with vegetables low in nitrate (e.g. tomatoes, sweet pepper). After a 2 week run in period where all subjects receive vegetables low in nitrate, the participants are randomized to one of three interventions. One third of the patients receive high-nitrate vegetables + a placebo pill (KCl), one third receives low-nitrate vegetables + placebo and the third group receives low-nitrate vegetables + a nitrate pill (KNO3). The nitrate content in the pill is precisely matched to the nitrate content in the high-nitrate vegetable group.</detailed_description>
