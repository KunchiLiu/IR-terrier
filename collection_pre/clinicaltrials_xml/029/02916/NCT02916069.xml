	<brief_summary>Multimodal brain monitoring is feasible and can be used in formulating therapeutic strategies during cardiac surgery. Such monitoring may help to improve patient outcome and to reduce costs after cardiac surgery with CPB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi Modal Brain Monitoring and Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to use a combination of brain monitoring {Nearinfrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), Transcranial Doppler (TCD), bispectral index (BIS)} to formulate therapeutic strategies based on these monitors and to evaluate the impact on patient outcome.</detailed_description>
