	<brief_summary>The follicular phase of the menstrual cycle involves the hourly release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which binds to receptors on the gonadotropes. This results in the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in hourly pulses that regulate follicular growth. At midcycle, rapidly rising estradiol from the dominant follicle and a small rise in progesterone lead to a gonadotrophic surge. An increase in the amplitude of Luteinizing hormone and Follicle stimulating hormone pulses initiates oocyte maturity and triggers ovulation approximately</brief_summary>
