	<brief_summary>All patients enrolled in the study will have to be treated with a chemo immunotherapy scheme R-CHOP with doxorubicin, with doxorubicin analogue or non pegylated liposomal anthracycline (R-COMP; Sec. 648 DM) administered every 21 days for 6 cycles. In unfavourable patients (stage II-IV) are allowed 2 additional cycles of rituximab at the end of the 6 cycles of R-CHOP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigating the Cardiotoxicity of Anthracyclines in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was designed as a prospective observational multicenter study to evaluate the role of possible early markers of cardiotoxicity estimating an overall maximum risk equal to 20% of patients. The sample size, required to obtain an estimate of conventional anthracycline cardiotoxicity in the population, has been calculated with a confidence interval of 95% and a maximum acceptable error of ± 0.075. According to the conditions described above, the sample size of patients treated with conventional anthracycline results to be 124 patients. Considering a 10-15% of not evaluable patients, the sample size is fixed at 150 patients treated with R-CHOP. The duration of the enrollment phase is defined in 2 years. With this sample size should be possible to assess the risk of cardiotoxicity related to predictors with a worst group frequency at least of 10%.</detailed_description>
