	<brief_summary>This study aim to observe and compare the change of alarmins such as high mobility group nucleosome-binding protein-1 (HMGN1), high mobility group proteins b1 (HMGb1), Interleukin (IL)-33 and their soluble receptors including soluble toll like receptor 4 (sTLR4) and soluble ST2 (sST2) during pulmonary lobectomy for cancer patients receiving volatile anesthesia or intravenous anesthesia under one-lung ventilation (OLV). By which, this study will preliminarily evaluate the correlation of alarmins and prognosis as well as the effect of inhalational and intravenous anesthesia on the prognosis of surgical patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Different Anesthetics on the Change of Alarmins in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Pulmonary Lobectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During pulmonary lobectomy, as a result of OLV and surgical operation, patients can suffer from alveolar and systemic inflammatory response. Alarmin is endogenous peptide released by white blood cells and epithelial cells when the body undergo danger signal stimulation which can enhance immune response and has a double effect on tumor. Some alarmins and their soluble receptors such as HMGN1, HMGb1, IL-33 and their soluble receptors including sTLR4 and sST2 can be used as biomarkers for tumor progression. Previous studies have shown that sevoflurane anesthesia can reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Meanwhile, the latest retrospective study indicated that the mortality of cancer patients receiving volatile anesthesia was significantly higher than that of intravenous anesthesia. At this stage, no study aimed to investigate the change of alarmins in broncho-alveoli and serum during OLV lung surgery and the possible effect of different anesthetics on them. Therefore, the investigators plan to enroll 40 patients with lung cancer receiving pulmonary lobectomy. Patients are randomly divided into sevoflurane volatile anesthesia group and propofol intravenous anesthesia group (n=20). Perioperative serum and bronchoalveolar lavage from ventilated lung are obtained, using ELISA method, to assay and compare the changes of alarmins such as HMGN1, HMGb1, IL-33 and their soluble receptors including sTLR4 and sST2 between two groups. All the patients will be followed up for 12 months. The correlation of alarmins and prognosis as well as the effect of volatile and intravenous anesthesia on the prognosis of patients will be preliminarily evaluated.</detailed_description>
