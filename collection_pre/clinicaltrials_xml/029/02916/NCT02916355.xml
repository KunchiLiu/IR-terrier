	<brief_summary>Role of IL-1 in postprandial fatigue - The Chäschüechli 2 Study It is a randomized, single dose, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over, proof-of-concept study. 16 healthy young men will be included in this study. The objective of this study is to evaluate if severity of postprandial fatigue is driven by IL-1. Since fatigue is associated with increased cytokine levels, and since fatigue in chronic inflammatory settings, such as type 2 diabetes, can be reduced by inhibition of IL-1β, postprandial fatigue might also respond to anti-inflammatory intervention with IL-1 inhibition. The aim of the study is to investigate whether postprandial fatigue is, at least in part, driven by the IL-1 system.</brief_summary>
