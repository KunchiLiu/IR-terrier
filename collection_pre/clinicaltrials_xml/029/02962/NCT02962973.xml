	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Carmat Total Artificial Heart (TAH) in patients suffering from advanced heart failure and requiring biventricular support. Each subject receiving the Carmat TAH is followed to the primary and secondary endpoints at 6 months, with a subsequent follow-up period extending to 2 years post implant. The results of the study will be used to support a CE mark application.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient age: 18 to 75 years 2. Inotrope dependent or cardiac Index (CI) &lt; 2.2 L/min/m2 while not on inotropes 3. On Optimal Medical Management as judged by the investigator based on current Heart Failure practice guidelines (ESC/AHA) 4. Eligible to biventricular Mechanical Circulatory Support according to ISHLT guidelines for mechanical circulatory support: 1. Biventricular failure with at least two of the following hemodynamic/ echocardiographic measurements implying right heart failure: RVEF ≤ 30% RVSWI ≤ 0.25 mmHg/mL/m2 TAPSE ≤ 14mm RVtoLV enddiastolic diameter ratio &gt; 0.72 CVP &gt; 15 CVPtoPCWP ratio &gt; 0.63 Tricuspid insufficiency grade 4 2. Treatmentrefractory recurrent and sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in the presence of untreatable arrhythmogenic pathologic substrate 3. Heart failure due to restrictive or constrictive physiology (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis / senile or other infiltrative heart disease) 5. Not eligible for transplant or eligible and age 55 year or older with an expected waiting time for heart transplant exceeding 12 months as estimated by physician. 6. Anatomic compatibility confirmed using 3D imaging (CTscan) 7. Patient's affiliation to health care insurance 8. Signed informed consent obtained 1. Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 15 or &gt; 47 2. Existence of any ongoing nontemporary mechanical circulatory support 3. Existence of any temporary mechanical circulatory support other than IABP 4. History of cardiac or other organ transplant 5. Patients who have required cardiopulmonary resuscitation for &gt; 30 minutes within 14 days prior to implant 6. Known intolerance to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies 7. Coagulopathy defined by platelets &lt; 100k/µl or INR ≥ 1.5 not due to anticoagulant therapy 8. Cerebrovascular accident &lt; 3 months or symptomatic or a known &gt; 80% carotid stenosis 9. Known abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm &gt; 5 cm 10. Endorgan dysfunction as per investigator judgment and following but not limited criteria: 1. Total bilirubin &gt; 100 µmol/L (5,8 mg/dl) or cirrhosis evidenced by ultrasound, CTscan or positive biopsy 2. GFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m2 11. History of severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or severe restrictive lung disease 12. Recent blood stream infection (&lt;= 7 days) 13. Documented amyloid lightchain (AL amyloidosis) 14. Hemodynamically significant peripheral vascular disease accompanied by rest pain or extremity ulceration 15. Illness, other than heart disease, that would limit survival to less than 1 year 16. Irreversible cognitive dysfunction, psychosocial issues or psychiatric disease, likely to impair compliance with the study protocol and TAH management 17. Participation in any other clinical investigation that is likely to confound study results or affect the study 18. Pregnancy or breast feeding (woman in age of childbearing will have to show negative pregnancy test)</criteria>
