	<brief_title>RAS Peptide Profiles in Patients With Treatment-resistant Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selective quantification of RAS peptides in human plasma triggered investigations evaluating whether RAS peptides could be used as clinical biomarkers in patients receiving antihypertensive treatment. Drug-specific RAS profiles first characterized in healthy normotensive subjects (EKBB 255/12; ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01771783) are presently investigated in patients with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension (EKNZ 2015-081; clinicaltrials.gov identifier (ID) NCT02449811). With this observational study RAS peptide profiles will be characterized in patients with treatment resistant hypertension. Data generated by this study will show whether RAS peptide profiles merit further evaluation as clinical biomarkers in this complex patient group.</detailed_description>
