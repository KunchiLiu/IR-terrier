	<brief_summary>Limited interventional human studies suggest that probiotic supplementation may be a beneficial strategy for promoting weight loss when added to a nutritional intervention via their effects on lipid absorption and metabolic signaling molecules. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of addition of a probiotic supplementation to a weight loss intervention on body weight, body composition and overall health in overweight adults.</brief_summary>
