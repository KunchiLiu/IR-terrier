	<brief_title>Treatment of Post-dural Puncture Headache in Postpartum Patients: Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block to Epidural Blood Patch.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of a sphenopalatine ganglion block to an epidural blood patch for post-dural puncture headache relief in randomized postpartum parturients over a 48 hour period. A known dural puncture is defined as free flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) during neuraxial placement. An unknown dural puncture is defined as neuraxial placement where free flow of CSF is not appreciated, however the patient is diagnosed with a post-dural puncture headache as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders.</detailed_description>
