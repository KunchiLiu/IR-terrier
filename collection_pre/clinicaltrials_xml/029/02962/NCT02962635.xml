	<brief_summary>A precise volume status assessment is critical to improve outcome of patients on dialysis. Yet, accurate assessment of fluid status remains a challenge. Currently, this is performed by clinical evaluation and regular weight measurements before and after dialysis, which is not always accurate. Moreover, bioimpedance technology is used in some centers for quantitative assessment of total body water. This approach has been validated for the assessment of volume status in dialysis patients, but requires the acquisition of specific tools and is time consuming. So far, no biomarker has been validated to quantify volume status in dialysis patients. Application of biomarkers might contribute to a better dialysis prescription and therefore to outcome improvement in dialysis. The investigators aim to investigate the role of a novel biomarkers (sCD146) to assess volume status in dialysis patients</brief_summary>
