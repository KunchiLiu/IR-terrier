	<brief_summary>A randomized, clinical trial to provide the first comprehensive investigation of the role of fatty acid desaturate (FADS) genetic determinants on PUFA biosynthesis and metabolism as well as levels of inflammatory markers in a controlled dietary environment using two (low and high linoleic acid) parallel diets.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be provided (weekly) with food items containing most of (&gt;90%) the daily dietary fat (25-30% of daily calories) to be consumed. All study-supplied foods will be prepared by or acquired by the Wake Forest University Health Sciences (WFUHS) Clinical Research Unit (CRU) Metabolic Kitchen and distributed by the same. These foods will include smoothies (containing flaxseed oil common to both arms), and arm-dependent oil-based condiments (salad dressing, mayonnaise, and margarine) and prepared snack foods, each made with the arm-specific oil, as well as several packaged snacks and food items. Participants will be provided meal plans and recipes for home preparation of meals that will allow them to adhere to the target fatty acid contents of the two dietary arms. The goal of the dietary intervention is to provide participants with the daily fat content of their diet (25-30% of the daily calories) and to educate the participant to select and consume the balance of nutrients (60-75% of daily calories) derived from non-fat/low-fat containing foods.</detailed_description>
