	<brief_title>An Extension Trial to Assess the Safety of Re-dosing of Iron Isomaltoside (Monofer®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among the various formulations of parenteral iron available on the market, iron isomaltoside may allow flexibility in terms of high and rapid dosing. The use of parenteral iron, especially in high doses, may result in better compliance, fewer visits to the medical practitioner, and overall improvement in QoL. Most trials with IV iron have been 4-12 weeks trials and long-term trials are warranted to fol-low-up on long-term safety. This trial is a 6-months extension trial where the aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV iron isomaltoside re-dosing.</detailed_description>
