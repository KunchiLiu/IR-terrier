	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted to characterize pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of anifrolumab given via the subcutaneous (SC) route of administration in adult Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) subjects with a type I Interferon (IFN) test high result and active skin manifestations while receiving Standard of Care (SOC) treatment. In addition, the efficacy of anifrolumab on SLE skin manifestations will be characterized.</brief_summary>
