	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center extension study to evaluate safety in patients with mCRPC of YONSA 500 mg (4 x 125 mg qd) with methylprednisolone (4 mg bid). Patients will have successfully completed an 84-day treatment with abiraterone acetate in a previous trial. Results from the final visit of the previous study will be used to determine patient's eligibility for this study. Patients in this study will be eligible to receive open-label YONSA with methylprednisolone for up to 12 months. Pharmacodynamic parameters of serum testosterone and PSA levels will be monitored. Disease progression will be assessed by PCWG2 criteria.</brief_summary>
