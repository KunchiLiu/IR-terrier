	<brief_summary>Distal radius (Colle's) fractures in adult patients are commonly reduced in the emergency department before casting. Standard of care currently requires that x-rays be performed before and after fracture reduction, and inadequate reductions may be subject to repeat attempts and are at a higher risk to require surgery. This study will assess the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in addition to standard care as a tool to decrease the angulation at the fracture site after a reduction is performed. If this angulation is decreased, it would suggest that POCUS for distal radius fracture reduction could decrease the number of failed reduction attempts and therefore the number of repeated reduction attempts.</brief_summary>
