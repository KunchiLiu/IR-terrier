	<brief_title>Effect of Feeding Positions of Preterm Infants on Some Physiological Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Semielevated supine position (ESU) is a position frequently used in neonatal intensive care units. In this position, infant is laid and fed on its back and the head is elevated to an angle of 45-60° in order to reduce the respiratory load of lungs. The ESL position, head of the infant is elevated to an angle of 45-60° and the infant is fed in the side-lying position. Since this position mimics the breast-feeding position, very preterm infants are supported to utilize the advantages of breast-feeding. A randomization was provided in the sample group consisting of totally 80 infants and while 38 infants were included in the ESL (experimental) group, 42 infants were included in the ESU (control) group.In the power analysis repeated at the end of the study, the power of the study was determined as 87% at a reliability of 95%.</detailed_description>
