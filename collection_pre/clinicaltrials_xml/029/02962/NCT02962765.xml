	<brief_summary>Prospective, multinational, non-interventional post-authorisation study to collect additional clinical data and to ensure consistency in the long-term between the outcome from pre-authorisation clinical studies (in 135 previously treated paediatric and adult patients) and routine clinical practice. Besides aspects such as general product safety and efficacy, there will be a focus on immunogenicity, particularly on inhibitor development. The diagnosis of FVIII inhibitor will be based on clinical observations and confirmed by FVIII inhibitor testing in the laboratory.</brief_summary>
