	<brief_summary>Although the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) is well settled in the literature regarding occlusal-proximal cavities, the longevity of these restorations is still lower when compared to occlusal ones. This factor is often associated with low mechanical properties of glass ionomer cements (GIC). The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of two different materials: an encapsulated GIC - Equia (GC Corp), compared with Giomer (Beautifill Bulk Restorative - Shofu) used as restoratives materials in occlusal-proximal ART restorations of primary molars. Children aged between 4 and 6 years, will be selected in schools in the city of Barueri, SÃ£o Paulo. All restorations will be held following the precepts of the ART and the manufacturer's instructions. The restorations will be evaluated after 1, 6, 12 and 24 months according to Roeleveld et al. (2006) criteria. To verify the survival of the restorations will be used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log rank test. To evaluate the association between the clinical variables, Cox regression test will be applied. For the cost analysis will be used analysis of variance. The level of significance for all tests will be considered to 5%.</brief_summary>
