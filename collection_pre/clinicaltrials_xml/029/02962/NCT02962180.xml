	<brief_summary>Actually the methods for melanocyte delivery are invasive and often sophisticated. The dermarolling system with needles causing tiny microinjuries in the epidermis could offer a minimally invasive and painless method of melanocyte transplantation. The purpose of the study is to develop a new and simple method for transepidermally delivering keratinocytes and melanocytes into vitiligo skin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transplantation of Basal Cell Layer Suspension Using Derma-rolling System in Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Condition: stable lesion of non segmental and segmental vitiligo of adults. Background: The best method to transepidermally deliver isolated cells (melanocytes) is not yet defined. Microneedle treatment of the " ex vivo " human skin caused many thin vertical epidermodermal fissures and a variable depth of injury into the dermis regarding the length of the needles. This kind of treatment could be able to create small epidermal defects which allows to deliver melanocytes to an epidermal site. An approach to replenish melanocytes by injection of dissociated epidermal cell suspension with a syringe was recently successfully used. So, we hypothesize that the use of dermaroller with 0.2mm needle length which causes tiny microinjuries strictly in the epidermis could offer a simple, minimally invasive and painless method of melanocyte transplantation. Main objective: To demonstrate the efficacy and the interest of dermaroller use with 0.2mm needle length in the transplantation of basal cell layer suspension in the epidermis of depigmented vitiligo skin. Secondary objectives 1. To assess as control the effect of the use of dermaroller alone on the vitiligo lesion. 2. If transplantation is successful, to assess the duration needed to obtain a good coalescence and a complete repigmentation of the vitiligo lesion.</detailed_description>
