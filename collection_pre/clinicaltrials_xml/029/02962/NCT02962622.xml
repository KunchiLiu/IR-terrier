	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the association between soluble insulin receptor dysfunction, cardiorespiratory fitness, and HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Those who volunteer to participate in the study will have two evaluations at study entry that include a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry, anthropometry, neurocognitive testing, blood and urine samples for metabolic testing, and a cardiorespiratory fitness testing. DEXA will be conducted in the Endocrinology Unit at the University Hospital, Medical Center (letter of support included). The cardiorespiratory fitness testing will be conducted in the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (ACTU) project, University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, and the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium. Then, participants will be invited to participate in a 6-week, 3 days/week individualized exercise program. The exercise program will be conducted at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. After completion of the exercise program, study entry evaluations will be repeated. The duration of the study will take approximately 10 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to determine the effect of a low volume high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise intervention on cardio-respiratory fitness (CR-fitness), insulin resistance, and cognitive function among normally active but physically untrained HIV+ Hispanic women. The primary hypotheses are that HIIT will improve: 1) CR-fitness in all groups (HIV+ and HIV-), 2) insulin sensitivity in both groups of HIV+ women, and 3) cognitive function as determined by hippocampal function in HIV+ women with HAND. Participants will receive 2 weeks, 6 sessions of 8 x 60 seconds cycling bouts eliciting approximately 80% of maximal heart rate with 60 second rest between bouts after which they will receive 4 week, 12 sessions of 10 x 60 seconds cycling bouts eliciting approximately 90% of maximal heart rate with 60 second rest between bouts. Then, participants will be evaluated with a CR-fitness, insulin resistance, anthropometry, and neurocognitive function tests. Participants will undergo an intervention (described above) designed for normally active but physically untrained HIV+ Hispanic women, one with (n=15) and other without (n=15) neurocognitive impairment &amp; HIV- controls (n=15). After the HIIT intervention, measurements of CR-fitness, insulin resistance, and cognitive function including hippocampal function using the memory island test will be obtained, as well as CR-fitness, anthropometry, DEXA densitometry, and blood and urine samples for metabolic testing. The ultimate goal is to improve the understanding of mechanisms by which exercise influence neurocognitive function; thus, providing a potential non-pharmacological alternative to prevent, control or reduce chronic incapacitating diseases in HIV+ Hispanic adults.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. HIVseropositive women ≥21 years with lymphocytes differentiated cells 4 (CD4) cell count or nadir in the last year ≤500 cells/mm3, or viral load ≥1,000 copies/mL despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). 2. Education level ≥9th grade, since is the minimum required for some of the neuropsychological (NP) tests. All HIVseropositive and HIVseronegative participants will be tested for vocabulary and reading premorbid cognitive function as described below. 3. Nondrug abusers; defined as those with &lt;5 exposures in a lifetime to drugs (opiates/heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine/crack, speed ball). For the purpose of this study neither tobacco nor nicotine use will be considered a drug. 4. No diagnosis of diabetes or the use of hypoglycemic agents. 1. HIV+ women and men &lt;21 years old with CD4 cell count &gt;500 cells/mm3 and/or viral load &lt;1,000 copies/mL. 2. Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) as determined by neurological evaluation and neuroimaging. (Neuroimaging studies, if needed, will be performed as part of patient care and hence have not been included as a budget item in this proposal.) 3. History of diabetes or the use hypoglycemic agents. 4. Underlying neurologic and/or neuropsychiatric disorders such as cerebrovascular events; history of meningitis/encephalitis, CNS opportunistic infections, or seizures; head trauma (&lt;6 months with loss of consciousness for &gt;1 hr); cerebral palsy; or any other neuropsychiatric condition that in the judgment of the investigators may affect the study. 5. Active systemic infection or illness, which in the judgment of the investigators may affect the study. 6. Pregnant/nursing mothers or women with recent birth (&lt;60 days). 7. Substance abuse: active drug use all participants will be screened with urine toxicology and active alcohol abuse those scoring &gt;3 points in the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) will be screened with blood samples for alcohol levels (Seltzer 1975). 8. Patients who are unwilling to give informed consent or incapable of understanding informed consent. 9. Education less than 9th grade.</criteria>
