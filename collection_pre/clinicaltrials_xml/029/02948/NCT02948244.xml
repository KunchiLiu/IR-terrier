	<brief_summary>This multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial will compare changes in strength-related motor function following treatment with creatine monohydrate to treatment with placebo, as measured by the Motor Function Measure, from baseline to 12 weeks. Eligible subjects will undergo baseline assessments then will be randomised to either creatine monohydrate therapy or placebo for three months, followed by a six week wash-out period, then crossover to a further three months of therapy with either placebo or creatine. Subjects will undergo clinical assessments and study safety assessments at the beginning and end of each treatment period. The study will begin recruitment in early 2017.</brief_summary>
