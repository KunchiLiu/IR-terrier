	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with uncontrolled persistent asthma. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with uncontrolled persistent asthma: - The safety and tolerability of dupilumab. - The effect of dupilumab in improving patient-reported outcomes (PROs). - The dupilumab systemic exposure and incidence of anti-drug antibodies. - To explore the association between dupilumab treatment and pediatric immune responses to vaccines: any vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The total study duration per patient will be up to 69 weeks, consisting of a screening period of 3-5 weeks, a randomized treatment period of 52 weeks and a post-treatment period of 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Children 6 to &lt;12 years of age, with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma for ≥12 months prior to Screening, based on clinical history and examination, pulmonary function parameters according to Global initiative for asthma (GINA) 2015 Guidelines and the following criteria: Existing background therapy of mediumdose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with second controller medication (ie, longacting β2 agonist [LABA], leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA], long acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], or methylxanthines) or highdose ICS alone or high dose ICS with second controller, for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Screening Visit 1. Prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≤95% of predicted normal or prebronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.85 at Screening and Baseline Visits. Reversibility of at least 10% in FEV1 after the administration of albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication before randomization. Documented reversibility or positive airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine within 12 months prior to Screening V1 is considered acceptable. Must have experienced within 1 year prior to Screening Visit 1 any of the following events: Treatment with a systemic corticosteroid (SCS, oral or parenteral), as prescribed by a healthcare professional for worsening asthma at least once or, Hospitalization or emergency room visit for worsening asthma. Evidence of uncontrolled asthma, with at least one of the following criteria during the 4 (±1) weeks Screening Period: Asthma Control QuestionnaireInterviewer Administered (ACQIA) ACQ5 score ≥1.5 on at least one day of the Screening Period. Use of reliever medication (ie, albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol), other than as a preventive for exercise induced bronchospasm, on 3 or more days per week, in at least one week during the Screening Period. Sleep awakening due to asthma symptoms requiring use of reliever medication at least once during the Screening Period. Asthma symptoms 3 or more days per week in at least one week during the Screening Period. Exclusion criteria: Patients &lt;6 or ≥12 years of age. Patients with &lt;16 kg bodyweight. Any other chronic lung disease (cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc) which may impair lung function. A subject with any history of life threatening asthma (ie, extreme exacerbation that requires intubation). Comorbid disease that might interfere with the evaluation of investigational medicinal product (IMP). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
