	<brief_summary>Comparison of two methods for revascularization of the superficial femoral artery: remote endarterectomy vs. stenting of the superficial femoral artery cin patients with steno-occlusive lesion of the femoro-popliteal segment of TASC C, D</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial of the Remote Endarterectomy and the Femoral Arteries Endovascular Treatments in Patients With the Femoral Artery Occlusive Disease (TASC C, D)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reported local percutaneous angioplasty and stenosis of femoral popliteal arteries indicate that the primary technical and clinical success above 95%. The technical success of recanalization of long occlusions femoral arteries less than 80%. Improvement of endovascular equipment designed for the treatment of total occlusions, increases the technical success of recanalization. The materials of the TASC II summarizes the results of several large studies that presented data on the operated segment artery patency at 56-73,7% within 2 years of observation. An alternative method of revascularization own femoral artery is remote endarterectomy. The two-year primary patency at remote endarterectomy is 86% (Moll FL, Ho GH. Closed superficial femoral artery endarter-ectomy: a 2-year follow-up. Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 5: 398-400). Primary assisted patency for 33 months 88% (Rosenthal D, Martin JD, Schubart PJ, Wellons ED. Remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy. Cardiovasc Surg 2004; 45: 185-192). The length of the occlusion is not a limitation to the use of remote endarterectomy. Primary patency at 31 months was 60%.</detailed_description>
