	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effects of PD 0360324 on participant's immune system in participant's with epithelial ovarian, Fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and who have agreed to participate on Protocol PA13-0291. As part of this study, participant will also receive a type of standard chemotherapy called cyclophosphamide. The safety of PD 0360324 and cyclophosphamide will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Conditioning Effects of Anti-Macrophage Therapy Using PD 0360324 in Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Cycle 1 is 42 days. Cycles 2 and beyond are 28 days. If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive PD 0360324 by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1. These are the only 4 doses that participant will receive of the study drug. Starting at Cycle 2, participant will take 1 cyclophosphamide capsule by mouth at the same time every day in the morning with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. The capsules should not be chewed, crushed, or cut. If participant forgets to take a dose, they may take it within 12 hours after the usual dosing time. If participant vomits within 30 minutes after taking a dose, they should take the dose again. If it has been more than 12 hours since forgetting to take dose or if participant vomits and it has been more than 30 minutes since their dose, they should not take another dose. Participant should wait and take their next dose as scheduled. Length of Study: Participant may receive up to 4 doses of PD 0360324. Participant may continue to receive cyclophosphamide for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after participant has completed the follow-up visits (described below). Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycle 1: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn within 6 hours before participant's dose of study drugs for routine, biomarker, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in participant's body may affect the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this blood will also be used for a pregnancy test. - Participant will have an EKG. On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn within 6 hours before participant's dose of study drugs for routine, PK, and PD testing. On Day 8 only, this blood sample will also be used for immune system testing. - Participant will have an EKG. Between Days 29 and 36 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system, PK, and PD testing. - Participant will have an MRI or CT scan. - Participant will have a tumor biopsy for immune system testing. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing. - During Cycle 3 only, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing. - During Cycle 2, participant will have an EKG. After Cycle 2, participant will have an EKG only if the doctor thinks it is needed. - If participant can become pregnant and the doctor thinks it is needed, part of the above blood sample will also be used for a pregnancy test. At Day 1 of Cycle 4 and every even-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 6, 8, 10, and so on), participant will have an MRI or CT scan. End-of-Dosing Visit: About 7 days after participant's last study drug dose: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, immune system, biomarker, PK, and PD testing. - Participant will have an EKG. - Participant will have an MRI or CT scan. - If the study doctor thinks it is possible and if participant did not receive all doses of PD 0360324, they will have a core tumor biopsy for biomarker and immune system testing. Follow-Up Visits: About 30 and 90 days after your last dose of study drugs: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing. - Participant will have an EKG. - Participant will have an MRI or CT scan. This is an investigational study. PD 0360324 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Cyclophosphamide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of many types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. The study doctor can tell participant how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent. 2. Age &gt;/= 18 years at time of study entry. 3. Histology showing recurrent high grade epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. 4. Platinum resistant or refractory disease as defined by progression of disease on a platinumcontaining regimen or recurrence of disease within 180 days of previous platinum treatment. 5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Measurable disease is defined at least two lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each "target" lesion must be &gt;20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT, and MRI, or &gt;10 mm when measured by spiral CT. PET/CT will be acceptable at baseline if PET/CT was previously performed and available. Imaging must be within 4 weeks of starting therapy. The target lesion must be distinct from other tumor areas selected for pretreatment biopsies. 6. Subject must be willing to undergo protocol directed biopsies and blood draw for immune profiling. 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 8. Life expectancy of &gt;/= 4 months in the attending physician's estimation. 9. Estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min by the CockcroftGault formula: Creatinine CL (mL/min) = [Weight (kg) x (140Age)]/[72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)] x 0.85. 10. WBC &gt;/= 3.0 X 103/ul ; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1.5 x 10^9/L (&gt; 1500 per mm^3); Platelet count &gt;/= 100 x 10^9/L (&gt;100,000 per mm^3); Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9.0 g/dL. 11.
