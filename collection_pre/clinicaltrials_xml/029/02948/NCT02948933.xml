	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of Dengvaxia® when used in the real-world immunization setting Primary Objective: - To measure the incidence of selected adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) occurring over a period of six (6) months after each Dengvaxia® dose administration; - To quantify the association between Dengvaxia® and each of the selected AEs and SAEs for which a risk window after vaccination can be defined, using estimates of relative risk - To monitor the occurrence and frequency of hospitalized dengue disease as well as any other SAEs leading to hospitalization or death, including new and previously unrecognized SAEs, following Dengvaxia® administration on a longer term (up to 5 years after the first Dengvaxia® dose administration. Secondary objectives: - To identify risk factors for hospitalized dengue disease (severe or not) among subjects vaccinated with Dengvaxia®; - To describe the frequency of hospitalized dengue disease and/or other SAEs or selected AEs according to the number of Dengvaxia® doses and/or interval between doses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cohort Event Monitoring for Dengvaxia®, CYD-TDV Dengue Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multi-national non-interventional study that includes two components of Cohort Event Monitoring (i) Short-term safety surveillance with a follow-up of 6 months after each Dengvaxia® dose administration and (ii) a long-term safety surveillance with a follow-up of five years after the first dose. No vaccine will be provided as part of this study. Study population will be identified in a convenient sample of sites as representative as possible of vaccination centers in each country. Subjects who received their first dose of Dengvaxia® at participating sites during the recruitment period and who meet the eligibility criteria will be asked to participate. After enrollment, vaccinees will be contacted periodically by telephone, e-mail, or Short Message Service (SMS) during follow-up for the identification of outcomes and Dengvaxia® vaccination status.</detailed_description>
