	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help adolescents and young adult cancer survivors address their psycho-social needs during the transitional period. The transitional period begins at completion of cancer treatment and continues throughout that first year. Patients often report this period can be difficult and distressing in many areas of life. This study will use a simple tool to measure, on a regular basis, the level of distress a young adult may be feeling. Based on this assessment additional mental health support and intervention can be recommended to help cancer survivors cope and enhance their feelings of well-being.</brief_summary>
