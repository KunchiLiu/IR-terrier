	<brief_summary>This is a investigative initiated, comparative pilot clinical trial to ascertain the safety of application of ex-vivo cultivated limbal stem cells in human eyes for treating different superficial corneal pathologies. Pre-clinical work in murine models have already demonstrated efficacy of this technique in curing murine corneal pathologies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this prospective interventional study patients with superficial corneal pathologies like scars, ulcers and burns will undergo a surgical procedure. Limbal ring from a cadaveric donor tissue, which is therapeutically accepted and serologically tested, is collected. This tissue will then be cultivated in the stem cell biology laboratory using standardized culture technique. Briefly the limbal tissue will be cut up into small pieces and digested overnight using an enzyme (Collagenase L). The cells obtained from the digest will be cultured on a petri-dish using 2% serum and growth factors. The cultured cells will be passaged three times to remove all epithelial cells from the culture. In the second procedure, the central corneal epithelium will be removed using a surgical sponge. 0.1ml of stromal cells in a concentration of 5x10^3 cells/uL diluted in the thrombin component of fibrin glue (TISEEL, Baxter) will be applied to the debrided corneal stroma. A soft bandage contact lens will be placed over the cornea at the end of the procedure. The patient will receive topical antibiotic and steroid eye drops in the post-operative period. Periodic comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation along with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) scanning and slit-lamp photography will be done at day 1, day 7, day 45 and day 90.</detailed_description>
