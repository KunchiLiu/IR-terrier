	<brief_summary>This is a phase Ib/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to investigate the safety, efficacy, and proof of concept (POC) of monotherapy with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug, as a sequential therapy following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with capecitabine and subsequent surgical therapy in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Nivolumab Following Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[Phase Ib] After preoperative CRT, to sequentially administer nivolumab in combination for patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer. To evaluate the safety of nivolumab in sequential combination therapy, the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the safety of subsequent surgical therapy, and to decide on a recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part. [Phase II] To evaluate the efficacy and safety when nivolumab is sequentially administered in combination at the RD determined in the phase Ib part, following preoperative CRT in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer and to identify biomarkers related to the therapeutic response. To also evaluate the safety of surgical therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who personally provided written consent for participation in the study Treatmentnaive patients with rectal cancer, in whom the inferior margin of the tumor was at a distance of 12 cm or less from the AV before CRT Primary rectal cancer histopathologically confirmed to be adenocarcinoma Clinical stage of T3,and T4 ,N any,M0,before CRT Macroscopic radical resection could be feasible, based on diagnostic imaging before CRT Patients with the ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at the time of enrollment CRT meeting the following conditions has been administered: Radiation at a dose of 45Gy 25 fractions to the pelvic cavity and boost radiation at a dose of 5.4Gy 3 fractions to the primary lesion Capecitabine was started at a dose of 1650 mg/m2 and orally administered in combination with radiation during a period equivalent to the half of 28 fractions , irrespective of a dose reduction. The last day of CRT is defined as the last day of radiotherapy. Oral administration of capecitabine is completed at the same time as the completion of radiation. Patients with CRT associated AEs that recovered to grade 1 based on the CTCAE ver. 4.0, with regard to all items within 14 days after the end of CRT who are anticipated to be able to receive nivolumab. Patients without distant metastasis on the imaging test at the end of CRT Women of childbearing potential who consent to practicing contraception during the period from giving informed consent to at least 23 weeks after the last dose of therapy Male patients who consent to practicing contraception during the period from giving informed consent to at least 31 weeks after the last dose of the study drug Exclusion criteria: Active multiple cancers However, lesions equivalent to cancer in situ or intramucosal cancer determined to have been cured by local treatment are not included in active multiple cancers. Patients with recurrent rectal cancer Patients with a history of pelvic radiation Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease Patients with a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease Patients with concurrent autoimmune disease or a history of chronic or recurrent autoimmune disease Patients requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants or who have received these treatments within 14 days before enrollment in the study Patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction Patients with a history or finding of cardiovascular risk falling into any of the following: Patients with a left ventricular ejection rate below 50percent based on ejection fraction Patients with a history or finding of clinically significant, poorly controlled arrhythmia; exception: patients with wellcontrolled atrial fibrillation for more than 30 days before enrollment may be enrolled. Patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome , coronary angioplasty, or stent placement within 6 months before enrollment Patients with a history or finding of class II or more severe congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association Functional Classification Patients with treatmentresistant hypertension ï½¥Patients wearing an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or permanent pacemaker Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or other diseases possibly interfering with toxicity evaluation Patients who are positive for any of the following: HIV1 antibody, HIV2 antibody, HTLV1 antibody, HBs antigen, or HCV antibody test Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who may be pregnant Patients with significant unstable mental diseases or other medical diseases that may interfere with the safety of the subjects, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with the procedures for the clinical study</criteria>
