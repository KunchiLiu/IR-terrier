	<brief_summary>Initially investigators will find LncRNA which to be able to affect Notch2 signaling pathway; then confirm the relationship between Notch2 and LncRNA, and analysis the regulation mode of LncRNA to Notch2 signaling pathway, and to observe the correlation between LncRNA and thymoma complicated with autoimmune diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regulation of LncRNA For Breg in Patients With Thymoma and Autoimmune Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. This study plans to research the correlation between Bregs and thymoma complicated with autoimmune diseases and the regulation the severity of the disease. 2. Clarify different expression levels of Notch2 signaling pathway in thymoma complicated with autoimmune diseases, and the effect on Regulatory B Cells(Bregs). 3. Find the effective regulation mode of Notch2 signaling pathway and the regulation of Bregs cell development and function in LncRNA.</detailed_description>
