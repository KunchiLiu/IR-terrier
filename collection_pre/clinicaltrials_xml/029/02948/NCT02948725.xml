	<brief_summary>Based on the current state of knowledge and gaps in the literature we will conduct an intervention study to explore novel treatment and rehabilitation of patients at Royal University Hospital (RUH) with motor deficits following stroke. This project has the following objectives: 1. To determine if cross-education, in addition to standard rehabilitation leads to better recovery of upper limb function for stroke patients with hemiparesis. 2. To incorporate functional brain activation as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural mechanisms associated with changes in motor function of the paretic arm post-stroke. 3. To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to measure connectivity and examine the extent to which white matter tract thickness correlates with preserved motor output in patients post-stroke.</brief_summary>
