	<brief_summary>Cerebral infarcts represent a major cause of morbidity/mortality in spite of therapeutics for a premature recanalisation (intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and thrombectomy). Thrombolysis failure by the administration of rt-PA is frequent, in particular in proximal occlusion. Experimental studies suggest that neutrophils could play an important role in the thrombus development via the organization of a network (NET) within the thrombus. Targeting this network of NET could, in addition to the fibrinolysis, increase the rate of recanalisation and thus improve the neurological prognostic after a cerebral infarct. The aim of the research is to Study of the biochemical and histological composition of the stemming thrombi of cerebral thrombectomies with in vitro analysis of the sensibility in the thrombolysis induced by rt-PA +/- Desoxyribonuclease I (DNase I).</brief_summary>
