	<criteria>NET Cohort Patients with histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of any grade, any stage NET of GEP or lung origin; In the first stage of the study (initial 50 patients) only patients with stage IV, welldifferentiated tumors (G1/G2) will be enrolled. Patients with stable or progressive disease, as documented on a scan (CT, MRI); Progression status will be documented on case report form (CRF). Allowed prior therapies include: a.) Surgery (tumor surgery at least four weeks prior to study entry); b.) Locoregional therapy such as: chemoembolization, radioembolization, radiofrequency ablation, radiotherapy at least six weeks prior to study entry; c.) Any number of previous lines of systemic therapy, providing that cytotoxic therapies (chemotherapy, PRRT) have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to study entry. NonNET Cohort Healthy participants Patients with histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of any grade, any stage GI malignancies. NET Cohort Patients on treatment with cytotoxic agents (chemotherapy, PRRT). Patients with renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure. No other active malignancy within 3 years of enrolment except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission. NonNET Cohort Patients with GI malignancies with neuroendocrine differentiation.</criteria>
