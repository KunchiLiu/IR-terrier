	<brief_summary>The chemo-radiotherapy for the local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients will induce the mucosal ulcer and damage salivary glands. Consequently, it can disturb the nutrition conditions and clinical outcomes of patients. This research tries to evaluate the nutrition status at the baseline, before and after radiotherapy, during the follow-up by the body mass index, hematological indexes, immunological indexes, and nutrition questionnaires including PG-SGA and NRS 2002. Through the evaluation of two different nutritional interventions, the investigators aim to find an optimized assessment model and the best nutrition support patterns.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Research About Nutrition Impact for Local Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All nasopharyngeal patients received radical treatment including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. At the beginning, the investigators assign patient to experimental and control groups randomly. Patients in experimental group received standard nutritional support by adding NUTRISON. Control patients will give conventional nutritional guidance. The investigators collected all the nutritional indexed at first visit, before and after radiotherapy, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after radiotherapy. All these data will be set into statistical software to produce an optimized model for clinical practice.</detailed_description>
