	<brief_summary>Postprandial lipemia is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes subjects even with normal fasting triglyceride values. Humans are mostly in a postprandial rather than in a fasting state and therefore non-fasting triglyceride values reflect more accurately the continuous exposure of arterial wall to the substantial cholesterol load. Evolocumab lowers blood LDL-cholesterol. This study evaluates the effect of evolocumab on postprandial lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes. All participants in this study receive evolocumab treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female (nonfertile or using a medically approved birth control method) overweight/obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with lifestyle counselling and a stable metformin dose for at least three months age 1877 yrs. body mass index 2540 kg/m2 triglycerides between 1.54.5 mmol/L and lowdensitylipoprotein cholesterol &gt;1.8 but ≤4.0 mmol/L (on Atorvastatin 20 mg/day) glycohemoglobin: ≤9%. Each patient will attend a prescreening visit (at week 5) where eligibility criteria will be evaluated. If the patient uses another statin than atorvastatin (20 mg) at screening visit the used statin is stopped and atorvastatin 20 mg will be initiated. If the patient is not using any statin, atorvastatin 20 mg will be initiated and the lipid values will be checked after 4 weeks when all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed.
