	<brief_summary>TGCT is a rare disease that is difficult to manage, surgical resection is the primary treatment currently available. To date no disease registry exists and there is little data available detailing the management of patients with diffuse TGCT, the burden of diffuse TGCT for patients (including pain, joint stiffness, swelling, reduced mobility and quality of life) or the economic impact of diffuse TGCT. This study aims to collect data by an observational disease registry involving no intervention to the patient or changes to investigators treatment decisions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GCT is a rare, benign, but potentially locally aggressive and recurrent disease. Treatment pattern and treatment initiation, continuation or changes are solely at the discretion of the physician and the patient. There will be no attempt to influence the prescribing patterns of any individual treating physician. All medication will be prescribed in the usual standard of care and will not be provided by the study sponsor. Participation in the study will in no way influence payment or reimbursement for any treatment received by patients during the study. It is the responsibility of the investigator and his study staff to enter all relevant patient data required for this registry in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and in the patients' medical records. Approximately 15 sites from up to 6 European Countries (France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom) are planned to participate. The sites will be specialized sites that treat diffuse TGCT regularly.</detailed_description>
