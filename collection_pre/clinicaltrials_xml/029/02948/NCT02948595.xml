	<brief_summary>The long term goal of our research is to develop a curriculum for Obstetrics and Gynecology resident physicians that regularly employs use of video assessment to improve surgical skills. Regular use of video feedback may enable improved self-assessment and allow for formal documentation of proficiency. The overall objective is to compare the use of video feedback to use of structured verbal feedback in the simulated task of laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure.</brief_summary>
