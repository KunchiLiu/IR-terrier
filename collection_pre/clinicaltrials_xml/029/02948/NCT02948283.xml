	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of metformin hydrochloride and ritonavir in treating patients with multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to treatment. Metformin hydrochloride and ritonavir may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride and Ritonavir in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of administering metformin hydrochloride (metformin)/ritonavir combination therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the clinical activity of this two-drug combination by assessing disease response, response duration, and (in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma [RRMM]) clinical benefit response. II. To assess the progression-free survival, overall survival and compliance of all patients who start the two-drug combination. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of metformin and ritonavir when given in combination. II. In relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RRCLL), to describe changes in pAKT, pAMPK, and MCL-1, in circulating lymphocytes in response to treatment. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. SINGLE AGENT STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. COMBINATION REGIMEN STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID and ritonavir PO BID on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 28 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA (MM): Diagnosis of multiple myeloma Patients with MM must have measurable disease, defined as one or more of the following: Serum Mprotein &gt;= 0.5 g/dL Urine Mprotein &gt;= 200 mg/24 hr Serum immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) &gt;= 100 mg/L (10 mg/dL) and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda FLC ratio IgA patients must have serum quantitative immunoglobulin &gt;= 750 mg/dL Patients with oligosecretory or nonsecretory disease must have a documented abnormal free light chain ratio (normal value 0.26 to 1.65) or a value beyond the laboratory calculation range Disease must be refractory or relapsed after &gt;= 3 prior regimens (induction therapy and stem cell transplant +/ maintenance will be considered as one regimen) At least 2 weeks from prior therapy to time of start of treatment; prior therapy includes steroids (except for =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent which is permitted during the study) FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL): Diagnosis of CLL without the following: Richter's transformation, prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) Measurable disease, defined as one or more of the following: Lymphocytosis &gt;= 5000 in peripheral blood Measurable lymph nodes &gt; 1.5 cm on palpation and/or computed tomography (CT) scan Organomegaly by physical exam and/or CT scan Active disease per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic (IWCLL) 2008 criteria, as defined as one of the following: Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia Massive (i.e., at least 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly Massive nodes (i.e., at least 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50 percent over a twomonth period or lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of less than six months; LDT can be obtained by linear regression extrapolation of absolute lymphocyte counts obtained at intervals of two weeks over an observation period of two to three months; in patients with initial blood lymphocyte counts of less than 30 x 10^9/L (30,000/L), LDT should not be used as a single parameter to define a treatment indication; in addition, factors contributing to lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other than CLL (e.g., infection) should be excluded Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroids or other standard therapy Constitutional symptoms, defined as any one or more of the following diseaserelated symptoms or signs: Unintentional weight loss of 10 percent or more within the previous six months Significant fatigue (i.e., ECOG performance scale [PS] 2 or worse; inability to work or perform usual activities) Fevers higher than 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or 38.0 degrees Celsius (C) for two or more weeks without other evidence of infection Night sweats for more than one month without evidence of infection Received at least 2 prior therapies for CLL In the opinion of the investigator do not require rapid cytoreduction due to bulky disease (e.g. painful lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, or impending endorgan dysfunction) At least 2 weeks from prior therapy to time of start of treatment; prior therapy includes steroids (except for =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent which is permitted during the study) CLINICAL LABORATORY PARAMETERS: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 50,000/mm^3 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt;
