	<brief_summary>This dietary intervention aims at developing a more personalized and targeted treatment for NAFLD in Hispanic children and adolescents who are GG for the PNPLA3 variant. The investigators previous publications have shown that this particular demographic has a greater than 2-fold higher liver fat compared to GC and CC individuals. They have also demonstrated a significant gene*dietary sugar interaction with a significant association between liver fat and dietary sugar intake in GG subjects with no such association in GC or CC individuals. These studies suggests that different dietary strategies may have differential effects on reducing liver fat, depending on PNPLA3 genotype. To confirm this, the investigators will complete a clinical trial in 120 overweight and obese Hispanic children (12 - 18 years) with clinically verified NAFLD who will be randomized to one of two 12-week interventions: Group 1 (standard of care control group): Dietary intervention focused on healthy eating (n=60; 30GG + 30GC/CC) Group 2 (standard of care + sugar reduction): Dietary intervention based on healthy eating and sugar reduction focused on reduction of sugary beverages and added sugar towards a goal of 10% of daily calories (n=60; 30GG + 30GC/CC) The following outcomes will be measured before and after intervention: Total liver fat fraction, and visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); liver fibrosis by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE); total body fat by DEXA; liver enzymes, fasting insulin, glucose, lipids, free fatty acids and inflammatory markers, gut microbiome, and insulin and glucose response to an oral glucose challenge. The investigators hypothesize that liver fat fraction, liver fibrosis, and metabolic outcomes, such as fasting and 2h-glucose and insulin, and inflammatory biomarkers, will show significantly greater improvements with sugar reduction relative to control. In addition, the investigators also hypothesize a treatment*genotype interaction whereby the reduction in liver fat will be significantly greater in GG relative to CC/CG subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>NAFLD: Children with clinically diagnosed NAFLD through the pediatric gastroenterology/liver disease clinics at LACounty+USC Medical Center, CHLA, or other pediatric GI clinic will be eligible for the study. NAFLD will be defined by: 1. Fatty liver indicated by clinical assessment through qualitative ultrasound ultrasound measures will be used for diagnosis purposes only and upon entry to the study, liver fat and fibrosis will be evaluated through MR imaging and MR elastography, as described below; 2. Negative evaluation for viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, alpha1antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease, and drug or toxin exposure; and 3. Elevated AST and ALT (defined by 1.5 times upper limit of normal). Ethnicity: This study is limited to Hispanics because of their higher risk of NAFLD, higher frequency (~50%) of the atrisk PNPLA3 allele (G), and because no prior studies have targeted improvement in liver fat and NAFLD in this highrisk population. As with all of our ongoing studies, Hispanic ethnicity will be based on selfidentity for the participants as well as their parents and grandparents. Gender: Males and females will be eligible for this study. Age: Children 12 to 18 years of age will be eligible. In our experience, children younger than around 12 years of age and greater than 18 years would require different intervention/counseling strategies. Therefore, we can develop a more consistent "ageneutral" approach if we limit the age range to 1218 years. In addition, based on our ongoing experience, this age range incorporates the general window of late pubertal development and we will limit recruitment to subjects who are Tanner stage 3 or greater to exclude the potential confounding effects of early pubertal transition. Puberty will be determined by a selfassessment of pubertal maturation, and included as a covariate. Weight status: Subjects will be eligible if they are overweight or obese, defined by a BMI &gt; 85th percentile for age and gender. Diabetes: Presence of type 1 or 2 diabetes, as defined by fasting plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl, or positive for diabetes related antibodies including ICA512 and GAD. Participants testing positive for diabetes will be referred for treatment. Subjects with prediabetes will be eligible for the study Pregnancy: Women who selfreport as pregnant or obtain a positive pregnancy test result during Visit 1 will be excluded. Furthermore, should a woman become pregnant during the course of the intervention, she will be withdrawn from the study at that time and asked to no longer participate. This is in order to protect the mother and child from radiation involved with the DEXA scan and potential complications associated with a lowsugar diet. Medication: Taking any medications known to influence liver function, insulin action or lipid levels Selfprescribed dietary supplements: Taking any nonprescription supplements that could potentially affect liver function and liver fat (eg vitamin E or fish oils) Other metabolic diseases: Diagnosis of other syndromes or diseases that may influence insulin action and secretion (e.g., maturityonset diabetes of the young, lipoatrophic diabetes, cystic fibrosis), or body composition and fat distribution (e.g. Cushing syndrome, Down syndrome, lipodystrophy) Other medical condition: Previously diagnosed with any major illness since birth (e.g. severe intrauterine growth retardation, chronic birth asphyxia, cancer) Familial hyperlipidemia: Patients with a family history of hyperlipidemia will be excluded, due to the particular genetic background of this disease, which may bias our results. Familial hyperlipidemia will be defined as LDL/cholesterol &gt; 160 mg/dL and/or triglycerides &gt; 200 mg/dL in both the participant AND at least one family member (first degree: parents or siblings). Smoking or drinking: Selfreported current smoking participants (more than 1 cigarette in the past week) will be excluded due to the potential effect of smoking on weight control and inflammatory status. Consumption of alcohol on a regular basis (40g/day alcohol per day determined by questionnaire) will also be excluded due to its important role in liver disease. Use of recreational drugs will also be an exclusion criteria, due to the potent effect of cannabinoids receptors on weight status and food intake. Participation in a weightloss or exercise program: participants who have participated to a weightloss or exercise program in the past three months will be excluded due to its potential effect on weight status.</criteria>
