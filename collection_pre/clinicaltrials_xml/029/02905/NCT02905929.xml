	<brief_summary>Project 2 of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) American Heart Association (AHA) Women's Health Program will assess 3-month changes in sitting time, standing time, physical activity and blood pressure in a randomized control trial. This 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will occur in the community with post menopausal Latina women (N=250) who spend at least 8 hrs/day sitting and have increased risk for cardiovascular disease through high BMI and borderline hypertension. Women will be identified through the San Ysidro Health Clinic and assessed at the South Bay Latino Research Center.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Reduce Sitting Time in Postmenopausal Latina Women at Increased Risk for Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project 2 will address the following aims: 1. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the primary behavioral outcomes of sitting, standing and stepping time assessed objectively by a thigh worn inclinometer (ActivPAL) in Latinas at risk for heart disease. 2. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the secondary health outcomes of blood pressure, depressive symptoms, and anthropometrics. 3. Explore the psychosocial &amp; environmental mediators &amp; moderators of changes in sitting time.</detailed_description>
