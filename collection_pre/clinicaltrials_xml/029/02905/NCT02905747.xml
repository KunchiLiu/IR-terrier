	<brief_summary>The aim of the project is to investigate effects of medical exercise therapy (MET) on patients with knee osteoarthritis. MET is a common physical therapy intervention, and the project aim to strengthen the evidence of this intervention. An experimental cohort design is chosen, and 20 participants will be followed for 6 months. Assessments will be clinical tests, questionnaires and accelerometer measurements before, during, and after a 3 month period of exercise (3 days per week) with a physical therapist. The project will answer if a 3 month physical therapy intervention using MET causes changes in pain level, function and activity level for patients with knee osteoarthritis. In addition, it will investigate whether a single global endurance workout for 30 minutes will have an effect on pain level for these patients</brief_summary>
