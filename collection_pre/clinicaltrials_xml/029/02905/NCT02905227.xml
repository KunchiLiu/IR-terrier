	<criteria>eligible subjects will be men or women aged 18 to 65 years inclusive; body mass index (BMI) 18 to 30 kg/m2; healthy adults must be in general good health with no clinically significant abnormalities that would affect ability to complete study. subjects with asthma must be nonsmokers who have a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 60% of predicted for race, age, sex, and height; subjects who smoke must have at least a 12month, 0.5 pack of cigarettes per day history or the equivalent consumption of cigars and a positive result for plasma cotinine. subjects with asthma will be excluded for more than 2 hospitalizations or emergency room visits, or more than 3 courses of systemic steroids in the past 12 months or 1 course within the past 8 weeks for respiratory illness; asthma exacerbation within 8 weeks of before screening; unscheduled or urgent visit to any medical facility for asthmarelated problems within 8 weeks before screening; history of intubation or intensive care unit admission for asthma in the past 5 years. Subjects who smoke will be excluded if they have intrinsic lung disease including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an FEV1 of &lt;60% of predicted and a score of ≥2 on the Medical Research Council Dsypnea Scale (MRC); any cardiovascular risk factor or contraindication for the use of triptans use of nonselective monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), propranolol, or cimetidine within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, or planned use during the study; positive serology test (hepatitis B virus surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 1 &amp; 2 antibodies).</criteria>
