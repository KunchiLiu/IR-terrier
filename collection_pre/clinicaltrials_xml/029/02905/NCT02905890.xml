	<brief_summary>The proposed study, Hormonal Contraception &amp; BV (HCBV), will investigate the effect of NET-EN and DMPA on recurrent BV, vaginal microbiota and inflammatory markers among women at high risk for HIV in Kampala, Uganda. The hypothesis is that NET-EN will show a similar beneficial effect on recurrent BV and vaginal microbiota as DMPA, without inducing signs of mucosal inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Norethisterone Enanthate on Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is highly prevalent among women in Africa and is associated with HIV acquisition. BV has been described as a dysbiosis, or a microbial imbalance, and is treated with metronidazole; however, once treated, it often recurs rapidly. Developing robust treatment strategies to prevent recurrent BV is important for HIV prevention in key populations at high risk for HIV infection. There is evidence that hormonal contraceptives, including depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), decrease BV recurrence; however, there is also evidence that DMPA increases the risk of HIV infection. Encouraging women to start or switch to an alternative progestin injectable such as norethisterone enantate (NET-EN) may mitigate HIV risk whilst decreasing the risk of recurrent BV. To date, there are no published studies that have investigated the effect of NET-EN on vaginal microbiota. The proposed study will investigate the effect of NET-EN and DMPA on recurrent BV, vaginal microbiota and inflammatory markers among women at high risk for HIV in the Good Health for Women Project in Kampala, Uganda. Consenting and eligible women will be treated for BV, and randomised to either NET-EN plus condoms or condoms only. Women currently using DMPA will be enrolled as an observational comparison arm. All participants will be interviewed and examined; samples for vaginal microbiota, sexually transmitted infections, and inflammatory markers will be obtained. Women will be followed up after 1 week, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months. The primary outcomes will be differences in vaginal microbiota clusters, time to recurrent BV, and inflammatory markers. Qualitative research will be carried out to assess the acceptability of, and adherence to, NET-EN.</detailed_description>
