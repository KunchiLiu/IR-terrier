	<brief_summary>The environment of the ICU and operating room allows the multi continuous monitoring of patients in critical situations. The physician anesthesiologist is working more and more in an environment where he receives a multitude of information from both the patient's medical history but also measured data in real time to its physiological situation. It is sometimes difficult for practitioners to consider all of the information by identifying a course of action. A decision support and a degree of automation can increase security along the lines of what has been observed in many processes and industries like aviation. The goal of this project is to establish initially a database of physiological parameters. We want to use patient data to model physiological processes in order to advance towards the creation of "physios" program,</brief_summary>
