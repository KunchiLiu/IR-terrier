	<brief_summary>The proposed study aims to combine evidenced based tools and guidance (H.E.A.L.T.H.: Healthy Eating Activity Lifestyle Training Headquarters) previously tested that has been developed specifically for use by Army Soldiers and a remote clinical intervention model that includes mobile tracking technology/devices for physical activity, weight and nutrition. This program is called the H.E.A.L.T.H. Intensive.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this investigation is to test the efficacy of a remote intervention to assist Soldiers in meeting standards for body fat and fitness. The intervention will include: 1. An Internet/Smartphone program for weight management and weight gain prevention developed during previous DoD research. 2. Integrated remote monitoring technology/devices, e.g. smart scales, activity tracking devices. 3. Individualized weight management and exercise recommendations based on data collected from web/mobile app/devices to be delivered via web/mobile app/Smartphone; participants will not travel to a clinical facility for the intervention. The objectives are: 1. to further develop the H.E.A.L.T.H. intervention by merging components of the H.E.A.L.T.H. program, remote monitoring technology components, e.g. activity tracking devices, smart scales, and direct/individualized weight management and exercise feedback into a single and comprehensive intervention that targets weight and fat loss, improved fitness, improved sleep, and personal well-being for Soldiers and their family members. 2. Compare body weight, body fat, and activity changes associated with participation in the H.E.A.L.T.H Intensive intervention for six months and a six-month website only phase/follow-up phase, in comparison to participation in a wait-list control group; and 3. Evaluate blood biomarkers associated with changes in body weight. Evaluate changes in gut bacteria associated with body weight.</detailed_description>
