	<brief_title>Resveratrol in Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the first cause of handicap in individuals over 40 years-old in France. OA physiopathology is driven by local joint inflammation responsible for pain and joint destruction. Experimental studies have shown that resveratrol, a molecule antagonist to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, has anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. The investigators hypothesize that resveratrol, in a new formulation developed by the coordinating investigator improving its bioavailability, will decrease pain in patients presenting with primary knee OA.</detailed_description>
