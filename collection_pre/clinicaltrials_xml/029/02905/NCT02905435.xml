	<brief_title>Assessment of Safety and Effectiveness of Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix in the Treatment of Deep Burn Skin Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, single arm, traditional feasibility study to allow a preliminary assessment of the safety and effectiveness of BTM treatment. Patients with 10-70% TBSA burns will have BTM devices implanted in areas with deep partial or full thickness burns to treat at least 5% TBSA.</detailed_description>
