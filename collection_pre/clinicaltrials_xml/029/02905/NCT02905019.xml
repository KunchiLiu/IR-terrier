	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of adjuvanted R21 alone and in combination with viral-vectored vaccine regimen (constituting adjuvanted R21 + ChAd63 and MVA encoding ME-TRAP) against malaria sporozoite challenge in healthy malaria-naive volunteers. Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in London, Oxford and Southampton, England. All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Each volunteer will receive either three or five vaccinations in total, depending on the group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of R21 +/- ChAd63/MVA ME-TRAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Groups 1-3 consist of volunteers receiving either R21 alone or R21 + ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP followed by CHMI by sporozoite challenge (mosquito bite) at week 12. Groups 4 and 5 are infectivity-control groups for the sporozoite challenge procedures: these volunteers will not be vaccinated. Group 4 will undergo sporozoite challenge at the same time as Group 1-3 volunteers. Group 5 volunteers will be used as infectivity controls if any volunteers from Groups 1-3 are rechallenged 5 - 7 months after the initial CHMI. Following are the vaccine schedules: Group 1 vaccinations- in week 0,4 and 8 Group 2 vaccinations- in week 0,4 and 8 Group 3 vaccinations- in week 0,4 and 8 in addition to viral-vectored vaccines in week 1 and 9. A total of 12 volunteers will be recruited to each vaccine group. After the sporozoite challenge, volunteers will be treated with the topical anti-histamine (as a treatment for local inflammatory response) and malaria infection treated with oral Riamet (artemether-lumefantrine).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years. Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all study requirements. Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with their General Practitioner. Women only: Must practice continuous effective contraception* for the duration of the study. Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study and for at least 3 years after the end of their involvement in the study. Written informed consent to participate in the trial. Reachable (24/7) by mobile phone during the period between CHMI and completion of antimalarial treatment. Willingness to take a curative antimalaria regimen following CHMI. For volunteers not living in Oxford: agreement to stay in a hotel room close to the trial centre during a part of the study (from at least day 6.5 post mosquito bite until antimalarial treatment is completed). Answer all questions on the informed consent quiz correctly. History of clinical malaria (any species). Travel to a clearly malaria endemic locality during the study period or within the preceding six months Use of systemic antibiotics with known antimalarial activity within 30 days of CHMI (e.g. trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and azithromycin) Receipt of an investigational product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned receipt during the study period. Prior receipt of an investigational vaccine likely to impact on interpretation of the trial data as assessed by the investigator. If any volunteers in Group 13 undergo rechallenge, this exclusion criterion does not extend to the vaccines previously received in the VAC065 trial For Group 3 volunteers only: prior receipt of a nonmalaria MVA or nonmalaria adenovirus vectored experimental vaccine Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, including HIV infection; asplenia; recurrent, severe infections and chronic (more than 14 days) immunosuppressant medication within the past 6 months (inhaled and topical steroids are allowed). Use of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months prior to enrolment. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine (e.g. egg products, Kathon) or malaria infection. Any history of anaphylaxis post vaccination. History of clinically significant contact dermatitis. History of sickle cell anaemia, sickle cell trait, thalassaemia or thalassaemia trait or any haematological condition that could affect susceptibility to malaria infection. Pregnancy, lactation or intention to become pregnant during the study. Use of medications known to cause prolongation of the QT interval and existing contraindication to the use of Malarone Use of medications known to have a potentially clinically significant interaction with Riamet and Malarone Any clinical condition known to prolong the QT interval History of cardiac arrhythmia, including clinically relevant bradycardia Disturbances of electrolyte balance, eg, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia Family history of congenital QT prolongation or sudden death Contraindications to the use of all three proposed antimalarial medications; Riamet, Malarone and Chloroquine. History of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ). History of serious psychiatric condition that may affect participation in the study. Any other serious chronic illness requiring hospital specialist supervision. Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as defined by an alcohol intake of greater than 42 standard UK units every week. Suspected or known injecting drug abuse in the 5 years preceding enrolment. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) detected in serum. Seropositive for hepatitis C virus (antibodies to HCV) at screening (unless has taken part in a prior hepatitis C vaccine study with confirmed negative HCV antibodies prior to participation in that study, and negative HCV RNA PCR at screening for this study). An estimated, ten year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease of â‰¥5%, as estimated by the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) system.60 Positive family history in 1st and 2nd degree relatives &lt; 50 years old for cardiac disease. Volunteers unable to be closely followed for social, geographic or psychological reasons. Any clinically significant abnormal finding on biochemistry or haematology blood tests, urinalysis or clinical examination. Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding which may significantly increase the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data.</criteria>
