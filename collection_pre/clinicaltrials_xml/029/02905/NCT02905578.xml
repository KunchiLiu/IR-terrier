	<brief_summary>This clinical trial adds high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to the standard of care regimen for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (a type of pancreatic cancer). All subjects receive high-dose ascorbate in addition to the standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial of High-dose Ascorbate for Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the standard treatments for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine. This standard therapy administers chemotherapy once per week for three weeks; patients then get a 'rest week' to complete the cycle (1 cycle = 4 weeks). This study adds 75 grams of ascorbate (vitamin C, sometimes called pharamcological ascorbate because the dose is so high) to standard therapy. The ascorbate is administered intravenously - through a vein in the arm. Participants will: - receive 75 grams of ascorbate 3 times per calendar week for each week of the chemotherapy cycle. - undergo imaging which is standard for their cancer and therapy. This can include CT scans, PET scans, and X-rays - provide blood samples to determine the biological effects, if any, the ascorbate has on the body during therapy. This active therapy portion lasts until the disease progresses and a new treatment needs to be adopted - this can be months to years. If disease progresses, participants go back to standard follow-up for their caner and the new/additional therapy their doctors prescribe. However, it is very important we remain in contact with participants; they will have life-long follow-up for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologic diagnosis (cell samples, biopsy, brushing, surgical sample) of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The tissue sample can be from a metastatic location, like a lymph node. Metastatic or node positive disease A physician must deem the patient medically fit for chemotherapy The patient must have failed initial therapy or be ineligible for definitive curative therapy (e.g., surgical excision, radiation therapy) A platelet count of at least 100,000 cells per mL A creatinine level of less than 1 1/2 times the upper limit of normal for the local lab test, or, a creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/(min*1.73m2) Not pregnant Commit to using birth control during the study (all participants) Prior chemotherapy to treat the metastatic disease Other therapy (including radiation) within the past 4 weeks Side effects from prior therapies that are still deemed moderate to severe by a physician Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency Patients actively receiving insulin Patients requiring daily fingerstick blood glucose measurements Patients who are on the following drugs and cannot have a substitution (or who decline the substitution): warfarin flecainide methadone amphetamines quinidine chlorpropamide A malignancy (cancer) within the past 5 years, other than nonmelanoma skin cancers, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder. Enrolled in another therapeutic clinical trial Uncontrolled, intercurrent illness HIV positive individuals undergoing therapy due to known drug:drug interaction between antiretroviral drugs and highdose ascorbate therapy If all of the above are met, the potential participant will receive a 15 gram challenge dose of ascorbate via intravenous infusion. This is the final screening procedure.</criteria>
