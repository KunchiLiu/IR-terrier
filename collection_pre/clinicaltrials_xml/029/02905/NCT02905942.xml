	<brief_title>PEG-rhG-CSF in Lymphoma Patients After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, there is few related research of Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor applying to AHSCT in China. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF in lymphoma patients after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to PEG-rhG-CSF group or rhG-CSF group. Patients in PEG-rhG-CSF group received PEG-rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 100μg/kg. Patients with the weight more than 45kg were suggested a dose of 6 mg. Patients in control group received rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 5μg/kg once per day until the recovery of neutrophil.</detailed_description>
