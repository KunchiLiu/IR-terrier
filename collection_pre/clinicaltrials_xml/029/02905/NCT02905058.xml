	<brief_summary>IUD can cause pain and discomfort in several ways: Use of the tenaculum to grasp the cervix and straighten the uterus for proper insertion; trans-cervical actions including measuring uterine depth, inserting the IUD insertion tube, and removing the tube; and placement of the device in the uterus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Ketoprofen Before Intrauterine Device Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To minimize the discomfort and the hazards of an IUD insertion, several measures have been proposed including NSAIDs, anxiolytics, and local anesthetics in the form of intracervical gel, cervical and para-cervical block, but there have not done enough studies about their effectiveness. According to the review published in the Cochrane, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and misoprostol are not effective on reducing an IUD insertion pain.</detailed_description>
