	<brief_title>Teledermatology and Modulation of Antibiotic Dose in Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are going to ascertain if antibiotic burden can be reduced with tele dermatology use. There are two arms of the study: 1. Feedback group 2. Non feedback group All subjects will be randomised to either group, all subjects will take photos of their face and answer questions at baseline, visit 2 (1 month), visit 3 (2 months), visit 4 (3 months). The investigators will then use measurements of acne grading (patient grading, investigator global assessment, lesion counting, global acne grading) to reduce/taper antibiotics in the feedback group.</detailed_description>
