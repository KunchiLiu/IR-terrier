	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will assess the efficacy and tolerability of a novel, initial triple combination therapy with metformin, saxaglipitin, and dapagliflozin, compared to conventional stepwise add-on therapy in drug-naïve patients with recently onset type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness &amp; Tolerability of Novel, Initial Triple Combination Therapy vs Conventional Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADA/EASD guideline recommends sequential treatment approach starting with metformin, and adding other classes of anti-diabetic medications if target HbA1c is not achieved. However, several clinical studies clearly showed that initial dual or triple combination therapy was more favorable in terms of glycemic control. A DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin increases serum level of GLP-1, and potentiates its action of increasing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin lowers hyperglycemia via blocking SGLT-2 to increase glucosuria, that is, in an insulin-independent manner. Therefore, the mechanism of action of these drugs are complimentary to that of metformin, and all of these have a low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.</detailed_description>
