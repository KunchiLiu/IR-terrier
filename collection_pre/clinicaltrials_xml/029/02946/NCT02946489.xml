	<brief_summary>Cannabis use disorders remain a significant public health problem. The pharmacological facilitation of behavioral treatment represents a promising strategy for addressing disordered cannabis use. Cannabis use disorders are recognized to be associated with various vulnerabilities that complicate the course of treatment and that may be amenable to glutamate modulators. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial is to test various glutamate modulators in conjunction with motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and mindfulness based relapse prevention (MBRP) for cannabis use disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitating the Behavioral Treatment of Cannabis Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals diagnosed with cannabis dependence will be randomized to receive one or two infusions of glutamate modulators during week 2 and week 3 or 4. The participants will also receive 2-week course of MET and 4-week course of MBRP. Participants will meet with staff twice weekly, except for week 2 and potentially week 3 or 4 during which participants will present to the clinic three times. Clinic visits include MET sessions, MBRP sessions, psychiatric monitoring, assessments, and study procedures (e.g., medication administration).</detailed_description>
