	<brief_summary>This study will be a Phase III, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with an enriched-enrollment withdrawal design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM2038 in opioid-experienced subjects with moderate to severe CLBP that requires continuous, around-the-clock (ATC) opioid treatment. The study will comprise 5 phases: a Screening Phase (up to 2 weeks), a Transition Phase (up to 2 weeks), an open label Titration Phase (up to 10 weeks), a Double-Blind Phase including a Final Study Visit (12 weeks), and a Follow-up Phase (4 weeks). The overall duration of participation will be up to 32 weeks, from Screening Phase to Follow up Phase, including 12 weeks of double-blinded treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 38 kg/m2, inclusive. Clinical diagnosis of a recent history of moderate to severe Chronic Lower Back Pain (CLBP) for a minimum of 3 months prior to Screening. The pain must occur in an area with boundaries between the lowest rib and immediately above the knee with no radiculopathy. Subjects must be on a stable dose of greater than or equal to 80 mg/day of oral morphine or Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED) during the 14 days prior to Screening and, despite prior dose escalation, have not received adequate pain relief. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, antibodies to hepatitis C virus, or antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Currently using fentanyl (all formulations) or have used fentanyl within the last 30 days. Clinically significant symptoms, medical conditions, or other circumstances which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude compliance with the protocol, adequate cooperation in the study, or obtaining informed consent, or may prevent the subject from safely participating in study Current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMV), Fifth Edition diagnosis for moderate to severe substance use disorder (including alcohol) other than caffeine or nicotine and currently being treated as the primary substance use disorder. Surgical procedure(s) for back pain within 6 months prior to Screening. Concomitant disease(s) that could prolong QTcF interval such as autonomic neuropathy (caused by diabetes or Parkinson's disease), human immunodeficiency virus, cirrhosis, Long QT Syndrome, or family history of Long QT Syndrome. Screening QTcF &gt;450ms for males and &gt;470 ms for females or any clinically significant abnormality on 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG). A nerve or plexus block, including epidural steroid injections or facet blocks, within 1 month prior to Screening or botulinum toxin injection in the lower back region within 3 months of Screening. Any other chronic pain condition that would interfere with the assessment of Chronic Lower Back Pain (CLBP). An active or pending workman's compensation, insurance claim, or litigation related to back pain (i.e., primary claim is back pain). Intake of agents that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) such as some azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin), or protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir) for at least 30 days prior to Screening. CYP3A4 inhibitors are prohibited for 30 days after the last dose of CAM2038. Has a significant renal or hepatic disease, as indicated by clinical laboratory assessment results (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or lactate dehydrogenase values greater than or equal to 3 × the upper limit of normal [ULN], or creatinine value greater than or equal to 1.5 × ULN).</criteria>
