	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to study the brain mechanisms underlying the effect of subliminal (not consciously perceived) intragastric administration of bitter tastants on hunger and food intake, which was previously found. The investigators will assess brain activation patterns after an acute intragastric administration of Quinine-hydrochloride versus saline on two different test days, and will simultaneously assess a putative role of altered gut peptide release in these effects. The hypothesis is that intragastric infusion of a bitter agonist will decrease the activity in homeostatic and hedonic brain regions and that this effect is mediated by gut peptide release.</brief_summary>
