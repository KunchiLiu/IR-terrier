	<brief_title>Health Benefits of Expressive Writing Among Chinese Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study examines the potential health benefits (i.e., physical health, psychological health, and quality of life) of this expressive writing intervention for Chinese-speaking breast cancer survivors. The study also explores the mechanism through which expressive writing confers health benefits and investigates who will benefit most from the expressive writing intervention. Chinese-speaking breast cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment will be randomly assigned to a control writing condition, a self-regulation condition, or a enhanced self-regulation writing condition. Health outcomes are assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months follow-ups. Mixed qualitative-quantitative mixed methods are used to explore the effect of the intervention on health outcomes and explore the mechanisms that explain the benefits of this intervention.</detailed_description>
