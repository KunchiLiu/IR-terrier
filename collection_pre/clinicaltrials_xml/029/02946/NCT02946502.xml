	<brief_title>Handgrip Strength Value in Predicting Mechanical Ventilation Weaning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have evidenced that Intensive Care Unit acquired peripheral muscle weakness may lead to delayed mechanical ventilation weaning (i.e difficult or prolonged weaning according to guidelines). Nevertheless, no study has ever tested the association between handgrip strength and extubation outcome. The investigators have generated the hypothesis that ICU acquired weakness, as tested by handgrip strength might be associated with extubation outcome. The investigators have planned to include 240 patients. Handgrip strength will be monitored, along with a full muscular assessment through Medical Research Council score by the attending physiotherapist. Physicians in charge of the patients will be blinded to these values and the weaning protocol will continue according to guidelines.</detailed_description>
