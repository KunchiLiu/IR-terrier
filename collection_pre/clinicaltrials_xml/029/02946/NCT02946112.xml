	<brief_title>Shoulder Position in Volleyball Players With Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The position is defined as the alignment of body segments at a given time. The assessment of the position is part of the physical examination. Recent studies have shown that photometry can be a reliable method to assess posture. The measurement of angles can identify situations as the forward position of the head and shoulder protraction. The aim of this study is to assess the position of the shoulder, using photometry by the measurement of angle between acromion process and seventh cervical vertebra, and the relationship with the presence of pain in volleyball players. For this study will be recruited thirty nine volleyball players. The variables measured are pain sensation registered with a visual analog scale and the position of acromion process measurement with photometry</detailed_description>
