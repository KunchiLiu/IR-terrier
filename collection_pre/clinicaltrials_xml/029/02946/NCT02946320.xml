	<brief_title>Optimal Predilatation Technique for BVS Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, single-center study. Forty-five patients with intended BVS implantation will be randomized in ratio of 1:1:1 to different predilatation strategies(non-compliant balloon/Emerge NC™, Boston Scientific, cutting balloon/Flexitome™, scoring balloon/Scoroflex™,Orbus). Predilatation is intended to be done in a vessel:balloon ratio of 1:1. If the device is not able enter the lesion, it will be replaced with a conventional semicompliant balloon with the same predilatation strategy (a vessel:balloon ratio of 1:1) After a successful predilatation, the BVS (Absorb™, Abbott) will be implanted and this procedure will be accomplished by a high pressure postdilatation with a non-compliant balloon (Emerge NC™, BSCI). The MLA of the Absorb stent will be evaluated with optical coherence tomography (OPTIS, St.Jude).</detailed_description>
