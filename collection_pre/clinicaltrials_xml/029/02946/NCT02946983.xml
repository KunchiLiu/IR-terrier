	<brief_summary>The investigators will test whether a subliminal, intragastric dose of fructose is able to influence the emotional state at the behavioural and neural level, as has been previously shown for fatty acids. They will also examine the potential involvement of gut peptide release. Based on previous research using fatty acids, an attenuating effect of fructose compared to placebo on the induced negative emotional state is hypothesized at the self-report as well as the brain level.</brief_summary>
