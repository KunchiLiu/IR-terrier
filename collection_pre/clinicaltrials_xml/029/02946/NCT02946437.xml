	<brief_summary>Feasibility and safety of short term application of sevoflurane in patients with SAH treated with aneurysm coiling or clipping in the setting of a neurointensive care unit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sevoflurane in Subarachnoidal Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After admission to the ICU, before the coiling / clipping intervention has been performed, the patients are screened for eligibility. When the patients are coming back to the ICU, after successful aneurysm coiling or clipping, a baseline (cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement will be conducted with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and indocyanine green (ICG) dye dilution (NeMo®System). Data of artificial ventilation, systemic and other cerebral parameters will be collected continuously by online monitoring, starting at baseline and stopping at discharge of the ICU. Sevoflurane will be vaporized and administrated by the MIRUS™System directly to the inspiratory part of the ventilation circuit for the next 4 hours. After 1 hour of postconditioning with sevoflurane, there will be again a measurement of CBF with NIRS and ICG dye dilution (NeMo®System), as well as 1 hour after stopping postconditioning with sevoflurane. In the following 14 days of the stay on the ICU, standard monitoring parameters, the appearance of vasospasm and brain oedema will be recorded. Besides the continuous online monitoring, one measurement with NIRS and ICG dilution and a laboratory assessment will be performed daily. At day 7±2 and day 14±2 after bleeding a MRI or CT examination will be performed, according to the clinical condition of the patient, to detect secondary brain injuries, as ischemia or brain oedema. At ICU discharge, the neurological outcome will be assesses applying GOS. Important: only the measurement of CBF with NIRS and ICG dye (NeMo®System) during and 1 hour after postconditioning with sevoflurane are measurements additionally to the standard monitoring of patients suffering from severe SAH.</detailed_description>
