	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a demonstrably effective device intervention for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and specific indication. However, many patients with heart failure (HF) are unable to maintain sinus rhythm and approximately 30-36% of CRT patients are in atrial fibrillation (AF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Junctional AV Ablation in CRT-D: JAVA-CRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate if patients with AF indicated for CRT will have significant reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume when randomized to atrioventricular junction (AVJ) ablation. In this study, subjects will be randomized to receive CRT-D or CRT-D with AVJ ablation. Randomization will be stratified by enrolling center (1:1 ratio).</detailed_description>
