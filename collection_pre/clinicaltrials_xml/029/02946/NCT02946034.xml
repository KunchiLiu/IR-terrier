	<brief_title>Viekira Pak Treatment for Patient With Chronic Kidney Disease and Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir (referred to as Viekira Pak) ± ribavirin for adults with advanced CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45ml/min that are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and to determine the effect of treatment on traditional and novel markers of kidney function and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with advanced CKD. During the course of this prospective, single arm treatment trial, we will measure currently accepted markers of kidney function and novel biomarkers of CKD progression to determine if they improve with eradication of HCV.</detailed_description>
