	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to examine the effectiveness of a brief intervention that might better facilitate the transition into the community for people with schizophrenia. The intervention is called the Welcome Basket. It involves Peer Support Workers connecting with and supporting hospitalized individuals in the days before discharge and again in the community in the first month immediately following discharge. The investigators will compare the outcomes of discharge from hospital as usual with the full version of the welcome basket and a preliminary test of an abbreviated 2 visit version of the intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing the Effectiveness of The Welcome Basket Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Discharge from hospital has been highlighted as a critical time in the care of individuals with mental illness. The peak period of risk for readmission for individuals with severe mental illness is in the first month and the highest risk for post-discharge suicide is within the first 2 weeks with discontinuity of contact with providers highlighted as a key risk factor. One half of individuals with schizophrenia miss their first-scheduled outpatient appointment following discharge and this time is a key period of risk for medication non-compliance. Common problems that occur at the time of discharge from psychiatric care settings include poor communication between inpatient and outpatient providers and inadequate involvement and support of families. The research literature on effective practices linked with discharge is strikingly sparse given the evidence that this is a period of heightened risk. The investigators hypothesize that the full version of the Welcome Basket intervention will improve the discharge-related outcomes of individuals with schizophrenia. Investigators will also explore the outcomes of an abbreviated, 2-visit version of the intervention. This study will employ a randomized, controlled trial design. Inpatient clients with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis will be randomized with a 2:2:1 ratio to: treatment as usual, the full welcome basket intervention, and the abbreviated intervention. Measures will include re-hospitalization, symptomatology, quality of life, and community functioning. Assessments at baseline, 4 weeks post-discharge, and 6 months post-discharge will facilitate studies of relative effectiveness and sustainment of gains. This design will facilitate an examination of both overall outcomes as well as some preliminary dismantling of mechanisms of action.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participants will be adults, 18 years of age or older, with a chart diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum mental illness confirmed by the MiniInternational Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.15). All participants will be on CAMH inpatient units at the time of recruitment and will have been in continuous inpatient care for 2 or more weeks. This timeframe is guided by the rationale and experience indicating that an overly brief period of hospitalization circumscribes the relevance of the intervention. 2. Participants will be returning to places of residence in the Greater Toronto Area (catchment of CAMH). 3. Participants must have been referred to outpatient case management. 4. Proposed housing arrangements must be stable and conducive to the intervention. If homelessness or emergency shelter residence appears likely, or boarding home policy precludes any external staff from entering the premises, such individuals will be excluded. 5. Proficiency in English. Exclusion criteria: 1. Do not meet the above criteria.</criteria>
