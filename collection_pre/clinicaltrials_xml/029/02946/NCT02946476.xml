	<brief_summary>To better understand the public health prognostic impact of noncardiac chronic illnesses, we explored the attributable risk of noncardiac comorbidities on outcomes between heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) and heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in a large contemporary heart failure (HF) population The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and the population attributable risk were used to compare the contributions of 15 noncardiac comorbidities to adverse outcome. The comorbidities that contributed to high attributable risk were: anemia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral artery disease. These findings were similar for HFrEF and HFpEF groups. Interaction analysis confirmed similar results.</brief_summary>
