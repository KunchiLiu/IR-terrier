	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) is a reliable, safe, and effective technique for obtaining samples from pancreatic masses. A new core biopsy needle has been developed by Beacon bnxÂ® (Medtronic, Newton, MA) that allows the possibility to achieve a core for histology evaluation and the interchangibility of needle size using the same needle shelter and different needle sizes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of a New Core Needle in the Endoscopic Ultrasound Assisted Tissue Sampling for Pancreatic Solid Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At every pass, the material will be fixed in formalin. Three passes will be done. Details of the aspirated material will be described at macroscopic evaluation by the endoscopist and then by the pathologist at macroscopic and microscopic evaluation, in order to find an interobserved agreement on the definition of the core.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age greater than 18 and less than 90, both genders.. Presence of a pancreatic solid lesion. In the presence of a cystic component, the solid part of the lesion should be more 75% of the total. Absence of an uncorrectable coagulopathy as defined by abnormal prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that does not normalize after administration of fresh frozen plasma or coagulation factors.
