	<brief_summary>Those patients with newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM) who are not candidates for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) and who meet the screening criteria described in this protocol can participate. The participating patients must sign an informed consent, which the investigator who will collect the study variables in an electronic case report form (eCRF) will provide to them. The investigators must recruit at least 450 patients in a 24-month period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Disease Burden, in Terms of Health-related Quality of Life and Direct Healthcare Costs, in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Who Are Not Candidates for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in Spain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following the baseline enrolment visit, the following data corresponding to the patient's visits scheduled according to routine clinical practice will be collected in accordance with the following model: 1. Recruitment period: data collection at the baseline visit, every 4 months +/- 15 days in the first year (month 4, 8 and 12) and every 6 months +/- 1 month in the second year (month 18 and 24). 2. Follow-up period: (study will end at 4 years following enrolment of the first patient) - From month 24 until up to 4 years from enrolment of the first patient, follow-ups will be performed with semi-annual data collections coinciding with the patient's routine clinical practice visits. - In case of progression, suspension or unexpected termination of treatment (for example due to toxicity), or death, a data collection coinciding with the visit in which any of the cases presented occurs will be performed. - If a new line of treatment is started, the follow-up model will be started with the same frequency of follow-ups described in point 1 above (month 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 and semi-annually according to routine clinical practice until up to 4 years from enrolment of the first patient in the study). 3. Observation period: Following this 4-year period, an additional 5-year follow-up will be performed only to evaluate the onset of second primary malignant neoplasms. This follow-up during the 5-year observational period will be performed semi-annually (± 1 month) according to routine clinical practice at each site.</detailed_description>
