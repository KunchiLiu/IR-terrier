	<brief_summary>Most genital infections by human papillomaviruses (HPV) are asymptomatic or benign and clear within a few months or years. There infections are much less studies than chronic infections, even though they represent the main reservoir for the virus. The goal of this project is to decipher the kinetics of the virus and of the host immune response in acute HPV genital infections in your women. This will be performed by following women longitudinally and regularly in order to measure variations in virus load, immune cell count, cytokine concentration and antibody titers. The investigators will also investigate the interaction between these kinetics and host genetics and host vaginal microbiota</brief_summary>
