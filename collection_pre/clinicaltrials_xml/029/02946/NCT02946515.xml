	<brief_title>The SIM-PLICITY Study: The SIMulation Project - LIstening &amp; Intervention in Pediatric obeSITY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of childhood obesity has tripled within the last twenty-five years (Skelton et al., 2009). Interventions targeting children are a high priority because children bear the greatest lifetime health risk from overweight and obesity (Ogden et al., 2007; Franks et al., 2010). Health professionals in primary care settings have the potential to reach large numbers of parents and children and address obesity because they have regular interactions with and are influential in the lives of families. Studies show that even brief advice delivered well can have a meaningful impact. To support providers in this important role, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with other health organizations to develop recommendations for assessment, prevention, and treatment of childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity. Despite the 2007 publication of these recommendations and increasing recognition of childhood obesity as a public health problem, rates of provision of obesity-related guidance and counseling remain low (Tanda &amp; Salsberry, 2013), and research indicates that health care providers could use additional education, training, and support related to obesity prevention and treatment. Thus, effective strategies to support pediatric primary care providers in their efforts to intervene against address childhood obesity are needed. Building off the successes achieved in their Phase I study, SIMmersion LLC, in collaboration with Dr. Nancy Sherwood from HealthPartners Institute , Dr. Jayne Fulkerson from the University of Minnesota, and Dr. Michael Fleming from Northwestern University, will expand the Phase I simulation prototype, utilizing feedback provided by a team of independent experts. The innovative computer-based training system with interactive role-play simulations will provide health care providers with much needed experiential opportunities to develop skills in conducting discussions with parents and children about obesity. The product's efficacy will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); 100 pediatric, family practice, and nursing clinicians and trainees at various levels of experience will be recruited to participate. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group during which they will use the newly developed simulation product to develop their skills and half of participants will be randomly assigned to the wait-list control group; the primary outcome is performance in a role play with trained actors at 3 month follow-up.</detailed_description>
