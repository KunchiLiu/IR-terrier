	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot evaluation of 'Stick To It', a behavioral intervention based on the concept of gamification. The objective of the program is to encourage young men who have sex with men (MSM) to be regularly screened for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and to adopt safer sexual behaviors, with the ultimate goal to decrease HIV and STI incidence. Gamification is the application of game elements, like points, badges, and rewards, to non-game settings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a quasi-experimental pilot study of 'Stick To It', a prevention intervention that uses gamification principles and mechanics. The intervention includes an online timer that reminds men to get tested, online quizzes, and peer recruitment; these activities are awarded with points redeemable for chances at prizes at participating clinics. The intervention was designed based on findings from interviews with health staff and focus groups with young MSM, and with input from a gamification consultant. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention will increase repeat HIV/STI testing among young MSM. The intervention will be implemented at two STI clinics in Oakland and Los Angeles, California in 2-week intervals for six months. The investigators will review medical records of exposed and unexposed young MSM attending the same STI clinics to compare uptake of quarterly HIV testing and self-reported behavior after six months.</detailed_description>
