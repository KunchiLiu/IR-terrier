	<brief_summary>This project seeks to determine whether estradiol suppression achieved with adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor improves end-follicular and luteal phase parameters during IVF. 128 patients will be randomized to either placebo or active treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Addition of Aromatase Inhibitor to Ovarian Stimulation Therapy in IVF Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate whether the detrimental effects of ovarian stimulation on outcomes in fresh embryo transfer cycles be ameliorated by co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors? The research questions are: 1. Can the impact of ovarian stimulation on late follicular phase sex steroid levels (and hence endometrial receptivity) be mitigated by co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors during ovarian stimulation? 2. Does co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors 'normalize' the endocrinology of the luteal phase</detailed_description>
