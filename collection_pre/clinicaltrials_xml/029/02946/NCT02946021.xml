	<brief_title>Response to Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Therapy in Head and Neck Cancer-related Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-randomized, non-blinded, single site pilot study designed to assess whether near-infrared fluorescence imaging can report on the efficacy of a pneumatic compression device to move lymph in head and neck cancer survivors with resulting head and neck lymphedema.</detailed_description>
