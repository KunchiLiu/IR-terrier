	<brief_summary>Comparing the postoperative pain resulting after mechanical instrumentation using Reciproc reciprocating files versus that resulting after using ProTaper Next rotary files in asymptomatic necrotic molars.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Reciproc and Protaper Next</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asymptomatic Necrotic molars are selected according to the eligibility and exclusion criteria and patients are then randomized to receive treatment either using Reciproc Files or ProTaper Next files. Postoperative pain is then assessed using the Numerical Rating scale 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-instrumentation. The tooth is then temporized and after 1 week obturation is then and post obturation pain is assessed using the Numerical Rating scale after 12 and 24 hours following obturation. The time required to complete instrumentation is also measured and compared using the two files.</detailed_description>
