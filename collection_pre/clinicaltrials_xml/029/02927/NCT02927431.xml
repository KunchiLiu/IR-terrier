	<brief_summary>Danirixin (DNX) is a novel, selective, and reversible antagonist of the C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 2 and has been shown to decrease neutrophil transmigration and activation to areas of inflammation. An intravenous (IV) formulation of DNX hydrobromide (HBr) is being developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of adults hospitalized with influenza (IFV). While early therapy with antivirals decreases severity and duration of symptoms of influenza, there are no drugs that have demonstrated clinical efficacy in randomized clinical trials in this population. Current treatment guidelines for hospitalized IFV recommend neuraminidase inhibitors as standard of care therapy. IFV studies in animals have demonstrated that therapeutic treatment with the combination of a CXCR2 antagonist and a neuraminidase inhibitor reduced lung neutrophils and showed trends for improvements in clinical scores, lung function and pathology with no evidence of worsening outcomes, including viral load. This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind (for IV DNX), placebo-controlled (for IV DNX) 3-arm study will be the first study to determine the efficacy and safety of IV DNX when co-administered (in all groups) with standard of care antiviral treatment (open-label oral oseltamivir [OSV]) in subjects hospitalized with IFV. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of treatment with IV DNX twice daily given with oral OSV compared to oral OSV twice daily on time to clinical response (TTCR). In this study, subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 15 milligram (mg) free base equivalent (FBE) IV DNX, 50 mg FBE IV DNX, or matching placebo twice daily. All subjects will also receive open-label 75 mg oral OSV, twice daily (given as standard of care). The study treatment duration will be for up to 5 days. The investigator may elect to continue treatment with OSV after 5 days of study treatment. Follow up will continue until Day 45 for all subjects. The study will begin with enhanced safety monitoring in sentinel cohorts, leading to stepwise enrollment of subjects. Subjects will be enrolled based on increasing levels of renal impairment, and less severe hospitalized subjects will be enrolled prior to enrollment of critically ill subjects, as this is the first study conducted in the hospitalized population with severe IFV. Approximately 300 subjects are targeted to be enrolled in the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults 18 years (as per local laws) of age and older at the time of signing the informed consent. Presence of fever (&gt;=38.0 degree Celsius [&gt;=100.4 degree Fahrenheit] by any route) at Baseline (enrollment) or history of fever/feverishness during the 48 hours prior. Oxygen (O2) saturation &lt;95% on room air by transcutaneous method OR need for any supplemental oxygenation (noninvasive ventilation, facemask, facetent, nasal canula, etc) or ventilator support (mechanical ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure [BIPAP], continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) or increase in oxygen supplementation requirement of &gt;=2 liters for subjects with chronic oxygen dependency. For those subjects with a history of chronic hypoxia (without supplemental oxygen), an oxygen saturation of at least 3% below the subject's historical baseline oxygen saturation. And at least 2 out of the following 3: respiratory rate &gt;24 breaths per minute. For those subjects who require ventilator support or oxygen supplementation, this requirement is waived; heart rate &gt;100 beats per minute; SBP &lt;90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Severity of symptoms at enrollment: 1) Less severe hospitalized subjects are those who (but not limited to): are hemodynamically stable; may require oxygenation with facemask, facetent, nasal canula, etc; may or may not have radiological signs of lower respiratory tract disease; or have exacerbation of underlying chronic disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other cardiovascular conditions not leading to hemodynamic compromise. 2) Critically ill hospitalized subjects are those who (but not limited to): require CPAP, BIPAP, mechanical ventilation; have hemodynamic instability (with or without pressor support); or have central nervous system involvement (example encephalopathy, encephalitis). Presence of influenza that in the Investigator's judgment requires hospitalization for treatment and supportive care Onset of influenza symptoms within 6 days prior to study enrolment. Symptoms may include cough, dyspnea, sore throat, feverishness, myalgias, headache, nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, congestion), fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. A positive result from a rapid influenza test (provided by GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) or other available, local laboratory diagnostic test Baseline renal criteria as follows: 1) Sentinel Cohorts: Normal renal function: Baseline creatinine clearance within normal reference ranges (&gt;=80 milliliter per minute (mL/min) for the first approximately 30 subjects enrolled; Mild renal impairment: Baseline creatinine clearance of 5079 mL/min for the next approximately 10 subjects enrolled into the sentinel cohort; Moderate renal impairment: Baseline creatinine clearance of 3049 mL/min for the next approximately 10 subjects enrolled into the sentinel cohort. 2) Postsentinel cohorts: Normal renal function, mild or moderate renal impairment: creatinine clearance &gt;30mL/min. Baseline Liver Function Tests: Subjects will be included if: 1. ALT is &lt;=5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin is &lt;=2 times the ULN 2.
