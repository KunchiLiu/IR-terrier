	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist SD-101 when given together with ibrutinib and radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or no longer responds to treatment. Immunostimulants such as TLR9 agonist SD-101 may increase the ability of the immune system to fight infection and disease. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving TLR9 agonist SD-101 with ibrutinib and radiation therapy may induce an immune response and prolong anti-tumor response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TLR9 Agonist SD-101, Ibrutinib, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Grade 1-3A Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of intratumoral TLR9 agonist SD-101 (SD-101) in combination with ibrutinib and radiation in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the safety and tolerability of SD-101 in combination with ibrutinib and radiation in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma. (Phase Ib) III. To evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with ibrutinib and radiation in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma by assessing overall response rate. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate progression-free survival after treatment with intratumoral SD-101 in combination with ibrutinib and radiation in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of TLR9 agonist SD-101 followed by a phase II study. Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1 and 2. Within 12 hours of the completion of radiation therapy, patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 intratumorally (IT) on day 2 and on days 9, 16, 23, and 30. Patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily beginning on day 10 for 96 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.</detailed_description>
