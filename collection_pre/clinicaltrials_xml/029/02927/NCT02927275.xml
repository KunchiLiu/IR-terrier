	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-intensity exercise on cognitive functioning during activity. Evaluation was accomplished by having participants perform standardized cognitive tests while in three forms of low-intensity exercise and then comparing results to performance when sitting.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of exercise, even when low-intensity, on physical health, investigations into cognitive performance during these periods of activity are increasing in number. For changes in the workplace to occur, data needs to show that mental processing is not compromised while engaging in low-intensity exercise. In this current study, participants, after giving written consent, performed quantitative, computer-based cognitive tests to evaluate for differences in performance between active and sedentary conditions. The participants engaged in four activity modalities: sitting, standing, biking slowly on a stationary bicycle, and walking at 1mph. The validated tests used were immediate and delayed verbal recall, the color-word test based on the Stroop test, and the "n-back" test. Responses were scored according to both the speed in answering along with accuracy on each test. From the scores generated, effect sizes were calculated for sitting and compared to effect sizes for cumulative activity stations for statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
