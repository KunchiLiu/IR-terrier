Subjects must take a screening test within the 4 weeks before the date of administration of the study drug; subjects must take a screening test before the date of administration of the study drug and exhibit no clinically abnormal findings in the judgment of the investigator or any of the subinvestigators 1. Concurrent or history of potentially fatal infections such as opportunistic infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and fungal infection; 2. Individuals with history of tuberculosis or diagnosed with tuberculosis by interview, chest Xray examination, or interferongamma release assay; 3. Concurrent or history of demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis, etc.); 4. Concurrent or history of congestive cardiac failure; 5. Concurrent or history of allergic symptoms such as asthma bronchial, druginduced rash, and urticaria, which, in the judgment of the investigator or any of the subinvestigators, may affect participation in this clinical study; or 6. Concurrent or history of cardiac, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and/or hematological function disorders, which, in the judgment of the investigator or any of the subinvestigators, may affect participation in this clinical study</criteria>
