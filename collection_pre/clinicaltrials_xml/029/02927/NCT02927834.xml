	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common disease that effects millions of people world wide. Despite its frequency it is unclear what treatment options are the best for these patients. Typically patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) are given a long term antibiotic (3 weeks), nasal steroid sprays, saline nasal irrigation and occasionally oral steroids. Oral steroids benefit patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) however their role in non polyp patients is less clear. It is the goal of this study to see if oral steroids benefit the treatment outcomes in those patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. In addition this study will look to see if a short course (5 day burst) versus a longer course (21 day taper) of oral steroids make a difference in outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Steroids in Chronic Rhinosinusitis Without Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will compare patients with CRSsNP who are treated with antibiotics/nasal steroid sprays, and compare them to chronic sinusitis patients who receive antibiotics/nasal steroid spray along with a course of oral steroids. The goal is to determine if oral steroids have a role in CRSsNP, and if so, the most effective dosage.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. They have threemonths of persistent symptoms meeting criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis as defined by the taskforce on rhinosinusitis. 2. They have a CTscan in the clinic or have a viewable recent (&lt; 3 weeks prior to clinic visit) CTscan with a Lund Mackay score of 6 or greater. A Lund Mackay score of 6 or greater is felt to be indicative of at least moderate CRS. 3. They do not have nasal polyps on initial clinic nasal endoscopy 4. They are willing to participate in a clinical study 5. They are between the ages of 18 to 80. 1. They have a condition in which the use of systemic corticosteroids is contraindicated such as diabetes will be excluded. 2. They are unable to or unwilling to take the prescribed antibiotics or steroids will excluded. 3. They have been treated with a &gt; 3 week course of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids will also be excluded. 4. They have variants of chronic sinusitis known to be refractory to medical therapy such as Wegener's granulomatosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia or sarcoidosis. 5. They have sinusitis secondary to prior surgery, a dental procedure or anatomical variants. 6. They have nasal polyps on physical exam. 7. They are pregnant. Subjects who are possibly pregnant will be excluded based on history. Pregnancy testing is not standard of care for diagnostic imaging. 8. They have a LundMackay score on CT scan of &lt; 6 9. They are &lt; 18 or &gt; 80 years old</criteria>
