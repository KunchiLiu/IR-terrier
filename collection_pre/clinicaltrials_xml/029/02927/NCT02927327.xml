	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To demonstrate diagnostic image quality of image sets with ZTE MRAC and Q Static (Q. MRAC) for SIGNA PET/MR in representative clinical cases of the general imaging population. Secondary Objective(s): To verify diagnostic acceptability, ease of use, and functionality of ZTE MRAC and Q Static (Q. MRAC) for SIGNA PET/MR at clinical sites. Safety Objective(s): To collect information about safety events and device issues.</detailed_description>
