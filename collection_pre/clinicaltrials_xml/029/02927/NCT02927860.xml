	<brief_title>Sleep and Activity Monitoring After Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about how sleep deprivation affects recovery after thoracic surgery. There is some evidence that in cardiac surgery, sleep disturbance can lead to delayed recovery and mental status changes in the postoperative period. There are no similar reports of studies after thoracic surgery. We think that increased activity after surgery is beneficial for a rapid recovery and prevents blood clots, pneumonia and deconditioning. Without specific data this is difficult to prove.</detailed_description>
