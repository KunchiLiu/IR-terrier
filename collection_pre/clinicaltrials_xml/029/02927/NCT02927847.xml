	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of a smoking cessation intervention combining behavioral treatment with low nicotine cigarettes on neuroimaging measures of reward function and smoking cessation outcomes. The results of this study will provide information about mechanisms contributing to smoking and smoking cessation and will help to guide future treatment studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Smokers with mild depressive symptoms who are interested in quitting will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions. In the BA +VLNC condition (n = 24) smokers will switch to smoking very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) while wearing a 21 mg/d nicotine patch for 5 weeks prior to their quit date. They will also participate in weekly behavioral activation (BA) treatment sessions. Smokers in the VLNC Only group (n = 24) will undergo the same pharmacological pretreatment but will undergo standard counseling instead of BA. Following the quit date, both groups will receive standard nicotine replacement therapy. At baseline and pre-quit, BOLD response to smoking and non-smoking rewards will be measured using fMRI after 24 hr abstinence. Latency to relapse will serve as a continuous clinical outcome measure.</detailed_description>
