	<brief_title>Shifting Rehabilitation Paradigms in Skilled Nursing Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is growing recognition that acute hospitalization contributes to marked functional decline in older adults. Nearly 20% of all hospitalized older adults are discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to address these functional deficits. However, rehabilitation in SNFs may not adequately restore physical function, which potentially contributes to poor community discharge rates. Strikingly, only 37% of all patients admitted to SNFs are discharged to a community setting, which suggests a paradigm shift is required to optimize rehabilitation within SNFs. Currently, usual care rehabilitation in SNFs consists of low-intensity rehabilitation interventions, which are physiologically inadequate to induce meaningful changes in skeletal muscle strength and physical function. Therefore, the investigators propose a novel "IntenSive Therapeutic Rehabilitation for Older skilled NursinG HomE Residents" (I-STRONGER) program, which integrates principles of physiologic tissue overload into combined strengthening and functional interventions for greater gains in physical function. The overall goals of this investigation are to 1) demonstrate feasibility of I-STRONGER in SNF settings and 2) determine the effectiveness of I-STRONGER in improving physical function. A comparison of usual care (UC) with I-STRONGER will occur using a staged, 2 group design (independent cohorts), with a single SNF serving as its own control. The first cohort of SNF patients will participate in UC (Stage 1) and after therapist training on ISTRONGER is completed, a second cohort of patients entering the same facility will participate in I-STRONGER (Stage 2). The feasibility of I-STRONGER will be evaluated by patient acceptability and therapist compliance measures. Sample size estimates (using patients with mobility deficits in home health settings) suggest at least 86 participants are necessary to be adequately powered. Heterogeneity of the sample will be re-evaluated during the study period using SNF data and sample size estimates may be adjusted as appropriate.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Older adults &gt; 55 years of age who are admitted to a skilled nursing facility following hospitalization 2. Qualify to receive at least physical therapy services Patients with primary diagnoses related to neurological disorders will be excluded as patient needs require more of a motor control approach rather than the proposed highintensity approach. Such patient populations include: Parkinson's Disease Traumatic Brain Injury Recent Cerebral Vascular Accident Alzheimer's Disease Patients on hospice care will be excluded as the approach is based on palliative principles. Other patients to be excluded will include those with conditions where strength training is contraindicated (as indicated by the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription): Recent unstable fracture Advanced congestive heart failure Bone metastasis sites Tumors in strengthening target areas Acute Illness Recent myocardial infarction (within 36 weeks) Weight bearing restrictions on graft or fracture sites Exposed tendon or muscle Absence of pedal pulses Presence of fistula Platelet levels &lt;50,000/ L</criteria>
