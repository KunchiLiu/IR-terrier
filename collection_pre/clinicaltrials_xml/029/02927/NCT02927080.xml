	<brief_summary>Study A083-02 is a multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ACE 083 in patients with FSHD to be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is open-label, dose-escalation and Part 2 is randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ACE-083 in Patients With Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 (dose escalation, open-label) Part 1 will consist of up to 6 cohorts (A to F) of patients and will evaluate multiple ascending dose levels of ACE-083 in either the tibialis anterior (TA) or biceps brachii (BB) muscle. Patients in each cohort will be enrolled in a 4-week screening period before beginning treatment. A Safety Review Team (SRT) will meet to review data for each cohort when at least 4 patients within a cohort have completed their Day 43 visit prior to dose escalation. Part 2 (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) Prior to the initiation of Part 2, a review of safety and efficacy data from Part 1 will be conducted to determine whether cohorts for one or both muscles will be pursued in Part 2, as well as the recommended dose level for each muscle. A total of up to 40 new patients (20 patients per muscle) may be enrolled and randomized (3:2) to receive either ACE-083 (n=12) or placebo (n=8) unilaterally or bilaterally (if both sides are affected per inclusion criteria) to either the TA or BB muscles (but not both). The SRT will meet to review Part 2 patient safety data after the first 10 patients reach Day 43 in the study and approximately every 3 months thereafter. Study duration for Parts 1 and 2 for each patient will be approximately 24 weeks, including a 4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period after the last dose</detailed_description>

For biceps brachii (BB) cohorts: mild to moderate weakness in left and/or right elbow flexion. 4. Females of childbearing potential must have negative urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment and use highly effective birth control methods during study participation. Males must agree to use a condom during any sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 5. Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule/procedures, and to understand and comply with protocol requirements 6. Signed written informed consent Key 1. History of active malignancy, with the exception of fully excised or treated basal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma insitu, or ≤ 2 squamous cell carcinomas of the skin 2. Symptomatic cardiopulmonary disease, significant functional impairment, or other co morbidities that in the opinion of the investigator would limit a patient's ability to complete strength and/or functional assessments on study 3. Renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) 4. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥ 3 times ULN 5. Increased risk of bleeding (i.e., due to hemophilia, platelet disorders, or use of any anticoagulation/platelet modifying therapies up to 2 weeks prior to Study Day 1; low dose aspirin [≤ 100 mg daily] is permitted) 6. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1 7. Systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks before Study Day 1 and for duration of study; inhaled therapeutic or physiologic doses of corticosteroids are permitted 8. Any change in medications potentially affecting muscle function within 4 weeks of Study Day 1 and for duration of study 9. Previous exposure to any marketed or investigational agent potentially affecting muscle volume, strength, or function within 5 halflives of last dose or 4 weeks of Study Day 1 if halflife is unknown, or any prior exposure to ACE083 10. Significant change in physical activity or exercise (e.g., significant increase or decrease in intensity or frequency) within 8 weeks before Study Day 1 or inability to maintain the baseline level of physical activity throughout the study 11. Any condition that would prevent MRI scanning or compromise the ability to obtain a clear and interpretable scan of the TA or BB muscles, as applicable (e.g., pacemaker, knee/hip replacement, or metallic implants) 12. Known active substance abuse, including alcohol 13. History of sensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals 14. Female that is lactating/breastfeeding</criteria>
