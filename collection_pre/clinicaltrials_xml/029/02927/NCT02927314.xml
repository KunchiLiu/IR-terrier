	<brief_title>A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of CF102 in the Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with a diagnosis of NAFLD. Subjects will undergo Screening procedures during the 4 weeks preceding Baseline. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to oral doses of CF102 12.5 mg BID, CF102 25 mg BID, or matching placebo BID for 12 weeks using a stratified randomization, with stratification by presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety, and indicators of efficacy will be measured at Baseline and Week 12. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 4 weeks after completion of the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. At least 18 years of age. 2. Diagnosis of NAFLD by noninvasive determination of liver triglyceride concentration, as defined as triglyceride concentration ≥10.0% by NMRS. 3. At least 2 of the following: Obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 and ≤40 kg/m2; or waist circumference &gt;88 and &lt;200 cm for women or &gt;102 and &lt;200 cm for men Type II diabetes mellitus, defined by the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (Appendix 1) Blood pressure of 130/85 or higher (either systolic or diastolic) Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as &gt;150 mg/dL (&gt;1.7 mmol/L) Reduced highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, defined as &lt;40 mg/dL (&lt;1.04 mmol/L) in men or &lt;50 mg/dL (&lt;1.3 mmol/L) in women. 4. Acceptable hepatic metabolic and synthetic function, as indicated at Screening by: Serum albumin ≥3.5 gm/dL INR ≤1.2 Serum total bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL. 5. Absence of cirrhosis, defined as a Fibroscan score of ≤F4 and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) of 7 13 kPa. 6. The following laboratory values must be documented at Screening prior to initiation of study drug: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.5x109/L Platelet count &gt;100x109/L Serum creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL. 7. For women of childbearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test result (not pregnant or lactating). 8. Understand and provide written informed consent to participate. 9. Patients taking herbal supplements, homeopathic medications, or other alternative treatments, must be on a stable regimen for at least 6 months prior to randomization. 10. Willing to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory assessments, and other studyrelated procedures. 1. Presence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or other clinical evidence of cirrhosis. 2. Other active acute or chronic liver disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of Screening and randomization. 3. Familial dyslipidemia. 4. Weight loss of &gt;5% within 6 months prior to Baseline. 5. History of bariatric surgery within 5 years of Screening. 6. Diabetes mellitus other than Type II. 7. Daily alcohol intake &gt;20 g/day for women and 30 g/day for men (on average per day), as per medical history. 8. Treatment with the following antidiabetic medications: DPP4 inhibitor unless it was stopped 3 months before Screening, GLP1 receptor agonists (such as Januvia [sitagliptin], Byetta [incretin], etc.) unless it was started at least 12 months and on stable dose at least 3 months prior to Screening. 9. Metformin, fibrates, statins, insulin, or sulfonylurea unless the dose has been stabilized for the last 1 month prior to Screening. 10. More than 7 days of treatment with valproic acid, tamoxifen, methotrexate, amiodarone, rifaximin, other antibiotics, or anticholinergic agents within 3 months prior to Screening. 11. Uncontrolled or clinically unstable thyroid disease, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator. 12. Seropositivity for markers of viral hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at Screening. 13. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification 3 or 4). 14. Angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft surgery, transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism within 3 months prior to initiation of study drug. 15. History of or ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias requiring treatment, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or persistent prolongation of the QTc (Fridericia) interval to &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females. 16. Pregnant or lactating female. 17. Women of childbearing potential, unless they agree to use dual contraceptive methods which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, are effective and adequate for that patient's circumstances while on study drug. 18. Men who partner with a woman of childbearing potential, unless they agree to use effective, dual contraceptive methods (ie, a condom, with female partner using oral, injectable, or barrier method) while on study drug. 19. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
