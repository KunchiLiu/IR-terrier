	<brief_title>Effect of Wound Infiltration by Ketamine Versus Dexmedetomidine Added to Bupivacaine on Surgical Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly assigned using an online research randomizer into three groups, 30 patients in each group: Group C: 30 patients receive local anesthetic wound infiltration with with 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of incision( control group). Group K: 30 patients receive local anesthetic wound infiltration with with 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline +1 mg /kg ketamine (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of incision. Group D: 30 patients receive local anesthetic wound infiltration with with 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline + 1Âµg/kg dexmedetomidine (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of incision.</detailed_description>
