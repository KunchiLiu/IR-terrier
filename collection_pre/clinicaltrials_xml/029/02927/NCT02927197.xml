	<detailed_description>In a two-phase randomized controlled study, investigators will examine the effects of a one-on-one cognitive training program on memory, visual and auditory processing, processing speed, reasoning, attention, and General Intellectual Ability (GIA) score for students ages 8-14. In Phase 1, participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group to complete 60 hours of one-on-one cognitive training or to a wait-list control group. In Phase 2, the wait-list control group will complete the intervention using an alternative delivery model: 50% clinician delivered and 50% digital delivery.</detailed_description>
