	<brief_title>Glucose Response From Antioxidant Rich Potato Chips</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical data obtained using an Caco-2 intestinal cell model and enzyme assays suggest phenolic-rich potato extracts decrease intestinal glucose transport. The aim is to determine if these effects extend to the the an in vivo situation. Specifically, the glycemic response following consumption of phenolic rich pigmented potatoes compared to white potatoes with lower phenolic content will be measured. Gastric emptying will also be measured to show the effects are in fact due to rate of carbohydrate digestion and intestinal glucose transport and not gastric emptying rate.</detailed_description>
