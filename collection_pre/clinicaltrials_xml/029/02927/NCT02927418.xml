	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of a strength &amp; conditioning (S &amp; C) program on risk factors for injury (Y-balance and Functional Movement Screen scores), as well as parent reported injury occurrence in 12-16 year old male and female athletes. Forty girls and 40 boys aged 12-16 will be recruited; half will participate in supervised S &amp; C sessions 2-3x/week while the other half will continue with their regular sports and activities. Risk factors for injury and performance indices (20 m sprint and multiple jump test) will be assessed before and after the 4 month study. Injury occurrence will be recorded via bi-weekly phone calls to the parent and athlete.</brief_summary>
