	<brief_summary>There is an increasing trend on decreasing narcotic use and maximizing efficiency in the perioperative care. There are no studies that have compared a TAP block versus a TAP block plus gabapentin for laparoscopic procures.This study will investigate if taking gabapentin and receiving a TAP block decrease post-operative morphine consumption. It will be a randomized controlled, double blind study, with 130 patients between 18-60 years; that will undergo laparoscopic GYN procedures. Secondary outcomes will look at the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and VAS (verbal analog scale) scores. This combination may be helpful because gabapentin will be used to decrease visceral and central pain, and TAP block will decrease somatic pain. Performing a multimodal approach may decrease narcotic consumption, adverse effects and improve pain management.</brief_summary>
