	<brief_summary>This study is designed to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical effect of repeat dosing of GSK2646264 in patients with subacute and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) lesions and in acute CLE like lesions induced by photoprovocation (PV). Current study is two group study. In Group A, Patients with fewer than two active lesions will be enrolled and exposed to photoprovocation (PV) for 3 consecutive days. Patients that develop PV lesions at any time during this period, as determined by the local investigative team, will receive 1% strength GSK2646264 on 1 lesion and placebo on 1 lesion daily and either 1% strength GSK2646264 or placebo on an area of uninvolved skin, for skin pharmacokinetic (PK) of study drug, for 28 days. In Group B, Patients that have a minimum of 2 active existing CLE lesions as determined by the investigators will be enrolled into group B and have one lesion treated with 1% GSK2646264 and 1 lesion with placebo. A completed patient will be defined as a subject who receives at least 25 days of study drug and completes the end of treatment biopsy (at day 28) and assessment. Thereafter patients will be followed for 28 days in Group A only or until complete resolution of induced PV lesions, as determined by the investigator.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Subject values for the following parameters thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), and free triiodothyronine (T3) within the normal range. Subject has confirmed diagnosis of Lupus Erythematosus Tumidus (LET) (group A only), subacute or chronic CLE as determined by the investigators.

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment.
