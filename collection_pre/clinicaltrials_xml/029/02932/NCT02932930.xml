	<brief_summary>The original concept of a quadratus lumborum block (QLB) indicated for analgesia after abdominal surgery was first described by Blanco in 2007. Also referred to as a posterior transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, the QLB consists in deposition of local anesthetic on either the posterior or the anterolateral border of the quadratus lumborum muscle. TAP blocks have already been proved effective in urologic, abdominal, and gynecologic procedures by blocking the sensory nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall thus reducing the amount of postoperative analgesic medication. The main advantages of QLB compared to the TAP block is a wider sensory block area and a longer duration of analgesia. This is due to the extension of local anesthetic agents beyond the TAP plane to the thoracic paravertebral space(4). Previous reports have shown that QLB is effective in providing pain relief after various abdominal operations. However, there are no published reports on QLB for postoperative pain after abdominoplasty. This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, opioids consumption and quality of recovery of QLB in patients undergoing abdominoplasty. Patients scheduled to have abdominoplasty will be randomized to receive bilateral QLB with either ropivacaine 0.2% or normal saline. Post-operative cumulative analgesic medication consumption, pain severity at rest and on movement, as well as quality of recovery will be evaluated and compared in both groups.</brief_summary>
