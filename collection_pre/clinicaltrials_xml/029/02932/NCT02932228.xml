	<brief_title>Evaluation of Intensive Management Patient Aligned Care Team</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: VA's highest-utilizing patients generally have complicated health care needs—including complex and multiple chronic conditions, comorbid mental health conditions, and social stressors—that contribute to high rates of hospitalization, emergency services, and specialty care use. Inspired by emerging intensive primary care models for high-utilizers, VA Palo Alto launched a quality improvement program to augment existing VA primary care (provided by Patient Aligned Care Teams, PACT) with intensive care delivered by a multidisciplinary team. The Intensive management PACT (ImPACT) intervention encompasses a number of evidence-based strategies, including a comprehensive intake process, coordination of specialty care, chronic condition case management, provision of social services, rapid response to deteriorations in health, and facilitation of transitions after high-acuity events. The ImPACT program was designated as quality improvement (non-research) by the Palo Alto VA. A retrospective evaluation using deidentified data was approved by the Stanford University IRB. Objectives: The objectives of this evaluation are to assess ImPACT's feasibility, implementation, and effectiveness, and lay the groundwork for future larger-scale efforts and evaluations within the VA system. Methods: We will partner with the implementation team of VA Palo Alto's ImPACT clinic to conduct a Hybrid Type 1 evaluation of the program's feasibility, implementation, and effectiveness. Specifically, the evaluation will aim to: 1. Evaluate the feasibility and implementation of the pilot ImPACT intervention. Using semi-structured interviews with ImPACT and PACT team members and leadership, we will evaluate the success of intervention delivery, including patient identification, recruitment, and retention; provision and uptake of planned services; and monitoring of patient participation and key outcomes. 2. Evaluate ImPACT's effect on utilization and costs of care. We will use a difference-in-differences approach, wherein we compare changes in VA health care costs (total, as well as inpatient, outpatient, and fee-basis) and utilization (including hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and specialty care) among ImPACT patients and high-utilizing patients who are receiving usual PACT care. 3. Examine the association between ImPACT participation and patient-centered outcomes. Using data from surveys administered in the ImPACT clinic, we will assess patient satisfaction with the ImPACT intervention and overall care, as well as changes in patient-reported outcomes, including health status, symptom burden, and function.</detailed_description>
