	<brief_summary>Lifestyle and environmental factors can disrupt development and testicular function. In France, cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance and about 8% of adults between 18 and 64 years smoke cannabis at least once a year, and mostly men under 45 years. Endocannabinoids are lipid mediators that share some effects with the active ingredients of cannabis. Cannabis and endocannabinoids act via two types of endogenous receptors which were detected at different levels of the reproductive system and are involved in the central and local regulation of the gonad. Cannabis use may alter the normal regulation of the endocannabinoid system. In males, the regulation of the endocannabinoid system is critical for Sertoli and Leydig cells functions, germ cell differentiation, maturation of sperm nucleus and sperm quality. The cannabis can have a negative impact on sperm parameters, capacitation and acrosome reaction. Cannabinoids may decrease testosterone synthesis and induce apoptosis of Sertoli cells. Studies on the effect of cannabinoids on male fertility are scarce or nonexistent in infertile men because of ethical considerations and bias due to consumption often underreported. Investigators hypothesized that cannabis use may alter sperm nuclear quality. Investigators want to explore this hypothesis conducting a multicentric prospective study exposed/non-exposed in infertile men who are consulting for Medically Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). To reach this study, it is planned to include a total of 200 subjects taking into account any exclusions.</brief_summary>
