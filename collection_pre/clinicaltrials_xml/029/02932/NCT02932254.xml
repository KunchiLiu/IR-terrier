	<brief_title>Magnesium Sulfate Effect Following the Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade Induced by Rocuronium With Sugammadex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sugammadex is a novel neuromuscular blocking reversal agent. Its mechanism of action is the encapsulation of rocuronium and vecuronium molecules. Numerous studies show a potential role of magnesium in reducing anesthetic requirements, sympathetic response to surgical trauma, antinociceptive action and neuroprotective effects. However, its use is limited because magnesium potentiates non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Primary outcome: evaluating the effect of treatment with magnesium sulfate the T4 / T1 ratio after reversal with sugammadex deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Secondary outcome: evaluate the occurrence of severe respiratory events, the incidence of residual neuromuscular block in the post-anesthetic recovery room, evolution of T1 high, and postoperative pain.</detailed_description>
