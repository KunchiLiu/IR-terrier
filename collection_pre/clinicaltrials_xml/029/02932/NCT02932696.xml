	<brief_summary>The main goal of our project is to study and describe the effect of exercise training on systolic and diastolic myocardial function assessed by 2D ultrasound strain after myocardial infarction. Our working hypothesis is that the intrinsic myocardial contractility and relaxation assessed by global longitudinal strain in phase II (or 2D strain) during post-infarction exercise training will be improved compared to baseline values as well as compared to values in a no-training group. Should this hypothesis prove true, it would help explain the improvements in functional capacity observed during the post-infarction period and after exercise training.</brief_summary>
