	<brief_summary>Purpose: The objective of this proposal is to study the safety and efficacy of metformin added to insulin for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among pregnant women. Participants: 1200 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes complicating pregnancy from 10 U.S. clinical centers Procedures (methods): Pregnant women with T2DM between 10 weeks and 20 weeks 6 days and a singleton fetus will be randomized to insulin/placebo versus insulin/metformin. Primary outcome is composite adverse neonatal outcome (clinically relevant hypoglycemia, birth trauma, hyperbilirubinemia, stillbirth/neonatal death). Study visits monthly at clinical visits; blood draw at 24-30 weeks. Maternal and infant outcomes will be chart abstracted.</brief_summary>
