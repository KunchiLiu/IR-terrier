	<brief_summary>Introduction: It is well established that physical fitness improves muscle performance either in sedentary people or in athletes. In this regard, specific exercises for respiratory muscles can result in better functional performance in hospitalized individuals, especially in critically ill patients in prolonged weaning. Objectives: To compare the following variables between intervention and control patients: success in weaning, free time off ventilator on ICU after weaning, and gain of muscle strength with the use of the inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Patients and methods: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Only individuals on prolonged weaning will be enrolled. They will undergo IMT or will be managed in a conventional manner. The primary endpoint will be successful weaning. In addition, other variables such as free time off ventilator on ICU after weaning and muscle strength will be measured. In addition, mortality in the ICU, inside the hospital and after discharge will be followed for one year after study entrance. Expected results: According to the working hypothesis, it is expected that the performance of patients undergoing IMT will be superior to the conventional treatment. Also, their time to mortality is expected to be longer.</brief_summary>
