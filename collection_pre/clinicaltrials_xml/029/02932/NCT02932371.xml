	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to estimate the reliability of the determination of the cardiac output measured by the ECOM™ device. This study will be performed with the latest version of the software which should give better results than those published previously. Two techniques of measure of the cardiac output will be compared: the reference measure by trans-esophageal echography and the bioimpedance used by the ECOM™. monitor.</brief_summary>
