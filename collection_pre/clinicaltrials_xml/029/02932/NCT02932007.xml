	<brief_title>Chloroquine for Symptomatic Persistent and Longstanding Persistent AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, pilot study to explore the efficacy of chloroquine in terminating persistent and longstanding persistent AF within 2 weeks of drug administration and assess its potential role as a pharmacological cardioversion agent for the management of AF. Subjects will be followed for 2 weeks from the start of drug administration to study drug termination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 years and older Eligibility for treatment with chloroquine according to local label History of symptomatic persistent or longstanding persistent AF Persistent AF defined as continuous AF that is sustained more than 7 days but less than 12 months. Episodes of AF of ≥ 48 hours duration in which a decision is made to terminate with electrical or pharmacological cardioversion prior to 7 days will also be classified as persistent AF Longstanding persistent AF defined as continuous AF of &gt; 12 months and ≤ 3years of duration AF must be documented at least once either by ECG, Holter monitoring, loop recorder, telemetry, transtelephonic monitoring, pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator readouts within 24 months prior to enrollment Anticoagulation therapy as indicated per local guidelines, which is considered optimal for stroke prevention in the opinion of the investigator Implanted dual chamber pacemaker/ICD or willingness to wear a 2 weeks Holter monitor if does not have an implanted pacemaker/ICD Signed informed consent Age &lt; 18 years History of paroxysmal AF Paroxysmal AF defined as recurrent AF (≥ 2 episodes) that terminates spontaneously within 7 days. Episodes of AF of ≤ 48 hours duration terminated with electrical or pharmacological cardioversion will also be classified as paroxysmal AF Permanent AF Permanent AF defined as ongoing AF &gt; 3 years of duration AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause such as, but not limited to, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, recent surgery, pericarditis, alcohol intoxication, hypoxemia, or thyrotoxicosis Structural heart disease Coronary heart disease Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction &lt; 50% Prolonged QTc of &gt;440 msec on baseline ECG Contraindications to quinolines Known allergy to chloroquine Use of amiodarone 12 months prior to enrollment History of AF ablation within 30 days prior to enrollment Renal failure requiring dialysis Significant intrinsic liver disease History of alcohol abuse Preexisting auditory damage History of epilepsy Women of childbearing potential (those who have had a menstrual period in the previous 12 months) who: are pregnant or breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant during study or who are not surgically sterile and are not practicing two acceptable methods of birth control, or do not plan to continue practicing two acceptable methods of birth control throughout the study (highly effective methods are listed under section 6.0 Pregnancy) Current participation in another clinical study Serious or active medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol Not able to discontinue medications known to have significant interactions with chloroquine</criteria>
