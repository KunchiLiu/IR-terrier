	<brief_summary>In this pilot study, investigators will test the efficacy of AlloGen-LI, an allograft derived from amniotic fluid, injected into the epidural space at the level of spinal stenosis as an anti-inflammatory treatment to relieve back and leg pain symptoms in patients with spinal stenosis and/or disc herniation. The patients will be followed for 12 weeks. The effect of this treatment will be examined by patient reported changes in pain and disability utilizing validated outcome measures, and MRI imaging evaluating changes in contrast enhancement and T2 signal related to that reflect inflammation and degeneration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AlloGen-LI Treatment of Spinal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AlloGen-LI contains multiple factors that may serve to ameliorate the detrimental effects of osteorarthritis and degenerative disc disease. Anti-inflammatory components include inhibitors of matrix metalloproteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and interleukins. The product has low immunogenicity and is hypo-osmotic.2 Placental tissues, including amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane and chorion are regulated as human cell and tissue products (HCTP) by the FDA. This regulation allows clinicians to use the allograft materials for human injection. AlloGen-LI is derived from placental tissues obtained from carefully screened healthy mothers at the time of scheduled cesarean section. The mothers have agreed to donate the tissues, which would otherwise be discarded. The experimental treatment would entail an injection of one dose of AlloGen-LI and marcaine into the epidural space under CT guidance, in an identical manner to traditional epidural steroid /marcaine injections.</detailed_description>
