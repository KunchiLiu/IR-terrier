	<brief_summary>Emergence of general anesthesia is a critical period, in the same way as the induction of anesthesia, during which several adverse events may occur. Extubation may even be more difficult than the intubation, with a higher respiratory complications rate. Among these, cough is common and expected. It can be associated with significant complications including hypertension, tachycardia, increased intracranial pressure, bleeding at the surgical site or even wound dehiscence. The incidence of coughing during emergence of general anesthesia varies depending on the type of airway instrumentation, the population under study, agents used for the maintenance of the anesthesia and techniques used to prevent coughing. In the literature, the incidence of coughing during emergence of general anesthesia under endotracheal intubation varies from 38 to 96%. In our center, the incidence of coughing during emergence of general anesthesia under desflurane and endotracheal intubation is 30 % according to a local preliminary study. Propofol is well-known to inhibit airway reflexes. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is associated with a lower incidence of coughing compared to inhalated anesthesia. The efficacy of propofol at a subhypnotic dose to reduce coughing during emergence has recently been demonstrated in patients undergoing nasal surgery under sevoflurane. However, the most effective antitussive dose remains unknown and its efficacy during anesthesia under desflurane has not yet been demonstrated. Propofol is rapidly available, simple to administer and has an interesting pharmacological profile, among others due to its short half-life. The aim of this study is to evaluate if an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of propofol is more effective than placebo administration to decrease the incidence of coughing during emergence of general anesthesia under desflurane (PROPOREV). Propofol could also reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).</brief_summary>
