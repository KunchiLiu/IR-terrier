	<brief_summary>A cluster-randomized crossover trial involving adult ICU patients, family members and ICU workers is being conducted. Near 35 intensive care units (ICUs) will be evaluated. In the first study period (T1) Brazilian ICUs with RFVMs (&lt;4.5 hours/day) will be randomly assigned to either an restrictive family visitation model (RFVM) (intermittent visits according to local ICU regulation) or to a flexible family visitation model (FFVM) (12 consecutive hours per day) in a 1:1 ratio. After enrollment of 25 patients and 25 family members, there will be a 30-day period without subject recruitment (T2) to avoid contamination bias. After this period, each ICU will be assigned to an intervention contrary to that which initially receive (T3) until the enrollment of more 25 patients and 25 family members. The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of delirium among ICU patients. Secondary outcome measures include delirium-free days, mechanical ventilation-free days, any ICU-acquired infections, ICU length of stay and all-cause hospital mortality among patients; satisfaction and symptoms of anxiety and depression among family members; and prevalence of symptoms of burnout syndrome among ICU workers. Tertiary outcomes include need of antipsychotic use, need of mechanical restraints, unplanned loss of invasive devices, and ICU acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection and bloodstream infection among ICU patients; perception of involvement in patient care among family members of ICU patients; and satisfaction among ICU workers.</brief_summary>

For Patient's Family Members: nearest relative of the ICU patient recruited in the study and consent to participate in the study. For ICU Workers: ICU workers that assist patients in the ICU during the daytime for at least 20 hours per week and consent to participate in the study. For ICUs: ICUs with structural or organizational impediments to extended visitation. For Patients: Subjects with coma (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale 4 or 5) lasting &gt; 96 hours from the moment of first evaluation for recruitment, or delirium at the baseline (positive Confusion Assessment Method for ICU) will be excluded. Individuals with cerebral death, aphasia, severe hearing deficit, a prediction of ICU length of stay &lt; 48 hours, exclusively palliative treatment, or without a familiar member able to participate in extended ICU visits and those who are prisioners, unlikely to survive &gt;24hs, readmitted to the ICU after enrolment in the study will also be excluded. For Patient's Family Members: Another ICU patient's relative enrolled in the study; family members who don't speak Portuguese; Difficulty to answer the selfadministered questionnaires (e.g.: illiteracy) For ICU Workers: ICU workers who have a prediction of withdrawal of ICU care activities &gt;15 days during the study will be excluded.</criteria>
