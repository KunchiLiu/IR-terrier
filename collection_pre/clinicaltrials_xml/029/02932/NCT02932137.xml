	<brief_title>Anti-infection of Low-does IL-2 in SLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune syndrome affecting various organs.Many feel that glucocorticoid and immunosuppressor are the standard therapy for patients with SLE. While it can improve the risk of infection among SLE patients. A novel therapy to treat SLE with low-does IL-2 has been identified recently. IL-2 also used to against some virus infect. So we hypothesized that low-dose IL-2 could reduce risk of infection in SLE patients. Methods: A total of SLE patients (n=30) were divided into two groups randomly. One received standard therapy, while another one administrate with low-does IL-2 plus standard therapy.Each patient will be treated with low-dose IL-2. The end points are clinical and immunologic response. Expected Results: This trail wlii provide both clinical and basic profe that low-dose IL-2 plus standard therapy have lower infection risk in SLE patients.</detailed_description>
