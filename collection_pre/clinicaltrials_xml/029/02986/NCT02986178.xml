	<brief_title>PVSRIPO With/Without Lomustine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) alone or in combination with the chemotherapy drug lomustine in adult patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke. The primary objective of this study is to assess the survival of subjects receiving PVSRIPO with or without a single dose of lomustine relative to the survival observed in a historical control group. The secondary objective is to assess the safety of PVSRIPO in combination with lomustine. Subjects will be randomized to receive either PVSRIPO alone, or PVSRIPO in combination with a single dose of lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO infusion, to evaluate the impact of these treatment regimens on 24-month survival. PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Subjects randomized to the lomustine arm will receive a single oral dose of 110 mg/m2 lomustine 8 weeks after PVSRIPO administration. The target accrual for the study is 62 patients, 31 patients per arm. All patients who are randomized and receive PVSRIPO treatment will be included in efficacy and safety analyses..</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma based on imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm and ≤ 5.5 cm of contrastenhancing tumor). Prior histopathology consistent with a World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma confirmed by the study pathologist Age ≥ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70% Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x normal prior to biopsy Total bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x normal prior to biopsy Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior to biopsy Hemoglobin ≥ 9 prior to biopsy Platelet count ≥ 125,000/µl prior to biopsy; Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl prior to infusion Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x normal range prior to biopsy Positive serum antipoliovirus titer prior to biopsy The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™ (SanofiPasteur) at least 1 week prior to administration of the study agent. At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis. A signed informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Adults of reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control. Sexually active women of child bearing potential, whose partner is male, must use medically accepted birth control. Sexually active men, whose partner is a female of child bearing potential, must use a medically accepted birth control. Patients with an impending, lifethreatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of the study neurosurgeons or their designate Patients with severe, active comorbidity, defined as follow: Patients with an active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F/37.5°C) Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus infection Patients with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease, such as congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart Association Class ≥ 2), uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmia; QTcF &gt; 470 msec on electrocardiogram (ECG) if performed or congenital long QT syndrome; acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris &lt; 3 months prior to study Patients with known lung (FEV1 &lt; 50%) disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Patients with albumin allergy Patients with gadolinium allergy Patients with a previous history of neurological complications due to poliovirus infection Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo and/or radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used. Patients may not have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4 weeks apart or histopathologic confirmation Patients who have not completed all standard of care treatments, including surgical procedure and radiation therapy (at least 59Gy) If the MGMT (O(6)methylguanineDNA methyltransferase) promoter in their tumor is known to be unmethylated, patients are not mandated to have received chemotherapy prior to participating in this trial. If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be methylated or the MGMT promoter methylation status is unknown at time of screening, patients must have received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participating in this trial. Patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord, radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal disease, subependymal or leptomeningeal disease Patients with undetectable antitetanus toxoid IgG (Immunoglobulin G) Patients with known history of agammaglobulinemia Patients on greater than 4 mg per day of dexamethasone within the 2 weeks prior to admission for PVSRIPO infusion Patients with worsening steroid myopathy (history of gradual progression of bilateral proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups) Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to lomustine, dacarbazine, or any components of lomustine</criteria>
