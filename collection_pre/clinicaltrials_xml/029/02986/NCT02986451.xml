	<brief_summary>This phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of a combination of biaxin,lenalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed/refractory MM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clarithromycin,Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone is effective in increasing the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.Clarithromycin is an antibiotic that has shown efficacy in association with steroids and lenalidomide.Clarithromycin, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (BiRd) in newly diagnosed MM has yielded an overall response rates (ORR) of 93% and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 43 months.No prospective study of BiRd to treat relapsed or refractory myeloma has been reported so far.The goal of this phase 2 clinical trial was to assess the response rate and toxicity of a combination regimen of clarithromycin (Biaxin), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone (BiRD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM.</detailed_description>
