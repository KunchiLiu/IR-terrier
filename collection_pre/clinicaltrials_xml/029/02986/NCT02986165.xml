	<brief_title>Effect of Ingesting a Tomato Pomace Extract on Platelet Aggregation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence from human intervention trials and mechanistic studies suggests that tomato and tomato based products are associated with a reduction in CVD risk. The mechanism by which this protective effect occurs is not clearly understood but research has focused on its potential to modulate platelet function. This single-blind, randomized, parallel design human intervention trial will recruit 99 participants to consume an orange flavoured beverage containing different doses of a tomato pomace extract (1.0 and 2.5 g) or placebo control over a 5-day period. The study aims is to investigate the effects of consuming different doses of the tomato pomace extract on platelet aggregation. Safety and tolerability of the tomato pomace extracts was tested prior starting this study by undertaking a single ascending dose study.</detailed_description>
