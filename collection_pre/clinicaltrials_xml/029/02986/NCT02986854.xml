	<brief_summary>The purpose/aim of this study is to assess the safety and antibody response to vaccination with a booster dose of Menveo given 4-6 years after primary MenACWY vaccination and to assess the safety and antibody response to a single dose of Menveo given to vaccine-naïve subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Single Dose of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Meningococcal MenACWY-CRM Vaccine (Menveo), Administered to Subjects 15 Through 55 Years of Age, Approximately 4-6 Years After Primary ACWY Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3b, controlled, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Menveo after a single vaccination in healthy individuals who were vaccinated with Menveo or Menactra 4 to 6 years before and in vaccine-naive individuals. Vaccine-naive subjects: subjects who have not received any meningococcal vaccine prior to participation to this clinical trial. Subjects will be randomised into one of the two different blood draw schedules according to a 1:1 ratio. - Blood draws at Day 1, Day 4 and Day 29 - Blood draws at Day 1, Day 6 and Day 29</detailed_description>

Current or previous, confirmed or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis. 3. Household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with any laboratory confirmed N. meningitidis infection within 60 days prior to study vaccination. 4. Progressive, unstable or uncontrolled clinical conditions. 5. Hypersensitivity, including allergy, to any component of vaccines, medicinal products or medical equipment whose use is foreseen in this study. 6. Clinical conditions representing a contraindication to intramuscular vaccination (IM) and blood draws. 7. Abnormal function of the immune system resulting from: 1. Clinical conditions. 2. Systemic administration of corticosteroids for more than 14 consecutive days within 90 days prior to study vaccination. 3. Administration of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy within 90 days prior to study vaccination. 8. Received immunoglobulins or any blood products within 180 days prior to informed consent. 9. Received systemic antibiotic treatment within 3 days prior to study vaccination or blood draw. 10. Received an investigational or nonregistered medicinal product within 30 days prior to study vaccination. 11. Study personnel as an immediate family or household member. 12. Individuals who have received any other vaccines within 7 days or 14 days prior to vaccination in this study or who are planning to receive any vaccine within 28 days from the study vaccination. 13. Individuals who have experienced a moderate or severe acute infection and/or fever defined as a temperature ≥38°C (100.4°F) within 3 days prior to study vaccination. 14. Any other clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose additional risk to the subject due to participation in the study.</criteria>
