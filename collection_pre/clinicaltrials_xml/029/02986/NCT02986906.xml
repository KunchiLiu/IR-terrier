	<brief_summary>Ulnar neuropathy at elbow (UNE) is the second common peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Although many conservative managements of UNE, the effectiveness of these methods are unsatisfied especial the moderate degree of UNE. Recently, ultrasound-guided perineural injection therapy (PIT) with 5% dextrose is progressively applicated for clinical treatment for entrapment neuropathy. However, current studies have not proved the effects of PIT on peripheral neuropathy because these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. We design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided PIT with 5% dextrose in patients with mild and moderate UNE.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining written informed consent, 40 patients, clinically diagnosed with mild or moderate UNE were randomized into intervention or control group. Participants in intervention group received one-session of ultrasound-guided PIT injection with 5cc. 5% dextrose and control group received 2cc 2% Xylocaine+3cc Triamcinolone (30mg) (total 5 cc) ultrasound-guided PIT injection. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the ulnar nerve, motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve, and strength of palmer finger pinch and grasp. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 1st, 3rd and 6th month after the treatment.</detailed_description>
