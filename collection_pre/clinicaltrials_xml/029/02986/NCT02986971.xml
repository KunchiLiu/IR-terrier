	<brief_summary>There are no implant removal devices on the market by any manufacturer. New features are described in comparison with the existing removal technique. Overall, the RemovAid™ combines the features of fixation, incision and extraction. This combination of functions has not previously been combined in a single device. The investigators wish to perform this pilot clinical investigation with the aim to demonstrate that the Investigational Medical Device (IMD), RemovAid ™, may safely and effectively facilitate implant removal. Other aims are to show that the IMD have the potential to reduce procedure length variability, reduce procedural complexity and reduce the need for additional procedural equipment related to CI removal procedures, without causing any harm to the subject.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Removal of Palpable Subdermal Contraceptive Rod Implants.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contraceptive Implants (CIs) were introduced to the commercial market in the early 1980s. They are advocated as a safe and effective method of contraception, and are included on the WHO's Essential Medicines list. CI manufacturers have focused intense efforts on making insertion of CIs easier, but have largely left CI removals untouched and at the mercy of the various service providers. Different introducers and trocars are available for use with the different CI systems available internationally, and a second generation, single-use trocar is supplied with the Nexplanon® implant system available in Sweden. This second generation trocar has reduced the number of misplaced or deeply inserted CIs, and underlines the benefits of standardizing minor surgical procedures through the use of dedicated medical devices. The CI removal procedure recommendations have remained essentially unchanged for 40 years, relying on scalpels, forceps and general surgical skills from the service provider. Currently, no standardized technique for removal of CIs exists, and no dedicated CI removal device is found on the commercial market. Removal of palpable subdermal implants is generally a simple, minor surgical office procedure. However, the procedure for implant removal requires more training and skill than the procedure for insertion. There is a risk of slippage of the scalpel blade or a sudden movement by the client causing inadvertent deeper penetration, in which case any underlying structure could be affected. Mean removal times, from time of incision until removal of the rod, are consistently reported as less than four minutes, however with ranges from 0.2 - 60 minutes. Available research shows that the procedure length of the current CI removal procedure is highly variable and reliant on individual operator skills.</detailed_description>
