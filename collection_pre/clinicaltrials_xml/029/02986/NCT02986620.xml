	<brief_summary>This is a study where there are no interventions planned. Investigators will only collect data already in the patient's history and analyze it. Particularly, we are interested in molecular data from AML patients. This means that patients will follow their regular diagnostic and clinical practice. The analyses will be conducted according to the routine diagnostic and clinical practice as well and no additional blood withdrawal will be performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Italian Registry on the Prevalence of IDH1/IDH2 Mutations in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted as follows: 1. Retrospective phase clinical and molecular data of patients analyzed for IDH1/2 mutations will be retrospectively collected in the centers that have already introduced IDH1/2 mutational screening in their practice from cases collected according to standard procedure (Ficoll and lysis in RLT buffer). 2. Prospective phase: each participating center already performing IDH1/2 mutational status on samples of their AML patients at diagnosis or relapse - on freshly isolate mononuclear cells from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood using Ficoll density gradient preparation - will prospectively collect the clinical and molecular data.</detailed_description>
