	<brief_title>Sacral Chordoma: Surgery Versus Definitive Radiation Therapy in Primary Localized Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>International, multicenter, comparative, open-label, parallel-group, mixed Observational-Randomized Controlled Trial. All the patients, who are candidate for the study will receive full information on the characteristics, potential effectiveness and side effects of the two alternatives treatments: radiotherapy (RT) and surgical treatment Eligible patients will be asked to be randomized in order to receive treatment A (surgery, with or without RT) or treatment B (definitive RT) Who will refuse randomization will be included in the Prospective Cohort Study (PCS) and will be treated accordingly to their choice (treatment option A or treatment option B). The same radiotherapy and surgical regimen will be administered in the PCS and in the Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) cohort</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Chordoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis (brachyury expression) of primary sacral chordoma,of any diameter and arising at any site from S1 to coccyx. Age≥18years ECOGperformance status (PS) 02 No previous antineoplastic therapy Macroscopic tumor detectable at MRI/CT scan Patient amenable for surgery Patient amenable for RT Written informed consent given before the enrolment, according to International Conference on Harmonisation/good clinical practice (ICH/GCP). Distant metastasis Inability to maintain treatment position Prior radiotherapy to the pelvic region Prior therapy for sacral chordoma (including surgery, cryoablation, hyperthermia, etc) Local conditions that increase the risk of RT toxicity (tumor ulcerated skin infiltration, nonhealing soft tissue infection, fistula in treatment field) Rectal wall infiltration General conditions that increase the risk of RT toxicity (active sclerodermia, xeroderma pigmentosum, cutaneous porphyria) Presence of a second active cancer (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer insitu cervix neoplasia and other insitu neoplasia) Severe comorbidities resulting in a prognosis of less than 6 months Inability to give informed consent Other malignancy within the last 5 years Performance status ≥ 2 (ECOG). Significant cardiovascular disease (for example, dyspnea &gt; 2 NYHA) Significant systemic diseases grade &gt;3 on the NCICTCAE v4.03 scale, that limit patient availability, or according to investigator judgment may contribute significantly to treatment toxicity Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Psychological, familial, social or geographic circumstances that limit the patient's ability to comply with the protocol or informed consent</criteria>
