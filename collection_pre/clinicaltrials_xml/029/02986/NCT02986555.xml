	<detailed_description>Current virtual reality device makes motion sickness and visual fatigue having limitation for recreation and other clinical approaches. Still there is no standardized quantification of motion sickness and visual fatigue measurement with objective approach. After quantification and improvement with these shortcomings, current biofeedback accompanied with virtual reality would be promising tool for stress relief. This research aims to measure objective motion sickness and visual fatigue with psychological stress in highly stressed group, and to compare between stress relief with existing biofeedback only approach and relief with mixed biofeedback and virtual reality relaxation.</detailed_description>
