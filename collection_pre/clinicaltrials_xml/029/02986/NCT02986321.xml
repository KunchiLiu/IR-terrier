	<brief_title>A 24-wk Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 4 Doses of a New PDE4 Inhibitor in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo and active controlled multinational, multicenter, dose ranging, 6-arm parallel-group study to identify the optimal dose of CHF6001, PDE4 inhibitor under development, with respect to lung functions and symptoms. After a 2-wk run-in period under formoterol (Oxis Turbohaler®) and rescue salbutamol prn, patients will be randomized to one of the 6 treatment groups. After the randomization, patients will be assessed after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks of treatment at clinic/hospital. A follow-up visit will be performed 12 days after the last visit. During the study, patients will report daily symptoms with the EXACT-PRO/E-RS questionnaire, rescue/background medication use and compliance with the study medications. AEs, SAEs and COPD exacerbations will be monitored throughout the study. At randomization and subsequent visits, patients will undergo physical and vital signs examinations, spirometry measurement, 12-lead ECG. Symptoms and Health status will be assessed through validated questionnaires. Routine lab analysis and blood biomarkers will be done.</detailed_description>
