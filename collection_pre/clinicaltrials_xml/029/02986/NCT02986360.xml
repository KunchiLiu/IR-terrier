	<brief_summary>1. To develop brief informational videos, Vidscrips, that can be sent to women following their mammogram to provide personalized information that integrates breast density with overall breast cancer risk, and provides information about additional care recommendations and talking tips for conversations with the health care providers. 2. To test the effectiveness of this tool in a trial of 300 women undergoing mammography. The investigators hypothesize that individuals in the intervention arm (vs. those in the standard care arm who receive a letter with the language required by the legislation) will have more accurate knowledge of their overall risk of breast cancer, their Mammographic Breast Density (MBD) result, more appropriate observed and intended use of additional screening [i.e., use of screening Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be reserved only for women at high risk of breast cancer], better satisfaction with their episode of breast cancer screening, less decisional conflict about their personal decision for any additional evaluation, and less worry about breast cancer.</brief_summary>
