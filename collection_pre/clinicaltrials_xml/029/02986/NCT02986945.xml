	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test an experimental method, a text-messaging app called B-RESILIENT, for improving participants' mood. B-RESILIENT is a text messaging app adaptation of a Resiliency Course, developed by community members known as Building Resiliency and Community Hope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community-Partnered Participatory Development of Mobile Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase 1, the investigators held a series of in-person and virtual workshops with the Partnered Research Center for Quality Care (PRC) community partners to co-develop mobile interventions to address community priorities. The goal of the workshops was to develop novel mobile interventions based on stakeholder input. The specific intervention to be developed was determined based on stakeholder input regarding community priorities during the workshops. Workshops were audio and/or video recorded to document the process. One of the tools used in this process was the Chorus Participatory Mobile Framework created at the Center for Health Services and Society at UCLA. Chorus is a web application that allows users to easily create mobile (text messaging and interactive voice) applications in real-time without requiring any server programming. The investigators used this framework during the workshops to develop and test the application in real-time. Participants were also given phone numbers to call or text in to the intervention that they co-developed for the purpose of testing, providing feedback, and guiding future development. In phase 2, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized control trial of the B-RESILIENT tool developed during the workgroup phase 1. Investigators will enroll 30 adults in South Los Angeles to participate in a randomized, wait-list trial. The study group will receive the intervention for 4 weeks, followed by the wait-list group for another 4 weeks. Investigators will conduct baseline and follow-up surveys, as well as in-person or telephone workgroups, to assess the tool's usability and feasibility for supporting management of mood and depressive symptoms.</detailed_description>
