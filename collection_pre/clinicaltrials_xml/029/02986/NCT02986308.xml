	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to confirm the TCM syndrome types and TCM constitution classifications of the patients with intestinal polyps via on-site epidemiological survey, to analyze metabolomics of the serum samples of intestinal polyps and healthy volunteers, and to study the metabolomics differences of the two populations and the metabolomics variations of the patients with intestinal polyps of pre-polypectomy and post-polypectomy. Finally, this study is to investigate the serum metabolomics variations of patients with intestinal polyps of pre-polypectomy and post-polypectomy and the relationship with their TCM syndrome types and TCM constitution classifications, to determine the correlation among pathology, TCM constitution, TCM syndrome types and the metabonomics variations of patients with intestinal polyps.</brief_summary>
