	<brief_summary>Background: Resilience is important for successful adaptation. The investigators' resilience intervention was effective in enhancing resilience, emotional functioning, and adaptation in Mainland immigrants. In the present proposal, the investigators will work with the International Social Service to scale up application of this intervention in immigrants, and develop the training infrastructure to ensure that the evidence-based intervention can be sustained despite turnover of interventionists. Objectives: 1. To deliver the resilience intervention to 200 new immigrants, 2. To enhance their resilience by 5%, and decrease their depressive symptoms by 20% and adaptation difficulties by 10% after the completion of the intervention, and 3. To establish a sustaining mechanism which ensures that this intervention can continue to be used in routine services. Project design: Well-trained social workers will deliver the intervention. Participants will complete programme evaluation. A train-the-trainer workshop and training materials will be prepared to transfer knowledge to social workers who are future trainers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention programme has been developed, manualized, and rigorously tested in the investigators' previous study. This programme is largely a replica of the investigators' original programme. The intervention consists of 4 sessions, each lasting for 2.5 hours. The investigators will promote this intervention programme in new immigrants, and recruit participants by open recruitment, contacting current service users of the community agency, referral and cold call. Orientation gatherings will be organized to screen for eligible immigrants. Participants will receive four sessions. Unlike most programmes that have not been developed in the community, the investigators have identified some key strategies to reduce attrition during the intervention. Before each session, social workers will call participants to remind them of the coming session. During the intervention, the investigators will provide child care upon participants' request. For those who are unable to attend a specific sessions, social workers will conduct a make-up on the content, and provide general encouragement that attendance of further sessions will bring important gains. During the follow-up period, social workers will send reminder postcards to participants. At the end of the intervention, participants will obtain a certificate in recognition of their participation in this programme. Evaluation will be conducted before the first session (pre-intervention) and immediately after the intervention (post-intervention).</detailed_description>
