	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the mass balance, absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways of orally administered [14C] rucaparib followed by cycle by cycle treatment with rucaparib continuing until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion Following a Single Oral Dose of [14C]-Rucaparib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, mass balance study in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors. Approximately 6 patients will be enrolled. The study will consist of 2 parts: a mass balance part (Part I) and a rucaparib treatment part (Part II). Each patient will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg [14C] rucaparib (approximately 140 ÂµCi) in the fasted state. Patients will be confined at the study site for the collection of blood samples and excreta for a maximum of 13 days, from Day -1. The patient can be discharged sooner than Day 13, if the discharge criteria are met. If the cumulative recovery of radioactivity exceeds 90% of the administered dose or if radioactivity in urine and feces is &lt; 1% of the administered dose over a 24 hour period on two consecutive days, as determined by quick counts. In Part II, the treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation.</detailed_description>
