	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a short duration. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients with kinds of musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for peripheral neuropathy in animal studies. Since 2014, three small clinical trials showed the positive effect of PRP in peripheral neuropathy included CTSin a pilot research. However, these studies have not entirely proved the effects of PRP on peripheral neuropathy because these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided PRP injection in patients with CTS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized into intervention and control side. Participants in intervention group received one-dose ultrasound-guided PRP injection and control side received one-dose ultrasound-guided normal saline injection. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd, 6th month and one year after the treatment.</detailed_description>
