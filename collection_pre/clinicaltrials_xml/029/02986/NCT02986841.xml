	<brief_summary>This is a 4-phase study to implement the NIDA (Common Data Elements) Common Data Elements (CDEs) in primary care settings. The study will be conducted at three adult primary care clinics, in two large health systems. Each phase will include deliverables essential to move to the next phase, and an independent Advisory Committee will review progress and make recommendations at each transition about how best to progress to each subsequent phase. Based on progress during earlier phases, the Advisory Committee may recommend expansion to additional clinics or health systems during the second part of Phase 4. Phase 2 prepares for implementation of the screening and CDS tools as part of routine clinical practice. A key component of this phase is tailoring the screening and CDS tools through an iterative process of usability testing and adaptation of their design. In the KTA framework, this phase corresponds to the 'select, tailor, and implement interventions' step. Simultaneously, investigators will plan for implementation in one clinic of the MSHS system by identifying clinical champions, educating clinic leadership and staff, and conducting a workflow analysis to identify barriers and facilitators of implementation.</brief_summary>
