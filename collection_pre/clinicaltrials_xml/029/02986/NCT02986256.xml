	<brief_summary>The TELEPIED project aims to show that it is possible to reduce the number of hospitalization days of a patient with ulcers of the foot thanks to a new organization of care, based on the intervention of a coordinating nurse interacting with the nurse in charge of the patient thanks to a telemedicine tool allowing the transfer of photos and ensuring itself a regular follow-up of the evolution of the wound and adapting the support nurse to the home if necessary. It is a monocenter, randomized, in parallel study, in 180 diabetic patients with ulcers of the foot. Patients included in the conventional group will be followed according to the usual practice Patients included in the "telepied" group will benefit from a personalized accompaniment by a nurse referring to diabetic foot ulcers who will guide and advise the nurse at home by acting by delegating tasks of the investigator. The patient will be visited by the referring nurse every 15 days. During these visits, the referring nurse will have the objective to evaluate the evolution of the ulcer as well as the care performed. This visit also allows a close personalized accompaniment for the patient, who will benefit from an education adapted to the characteristics of ulcer (discharge modalities for example ..) and its way of life. Every patients will be followed for one year (12 months).</brief_summary>
