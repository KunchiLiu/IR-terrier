	<brief_summary>This study aim to evaluate the effect of marine monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids on children aged from 6-13 years, with ADHD/ADD and related symptoms. The study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-control study including approximately 330 children from Norway. The primary outcome measure is ADHD core symptoms reported by caregivers, teachers and the child at 0 months (baseline), 6 months (end of treatment) and 12 months (6 months post treatment). The secondary outcome measures are reading and writing disabilities, cognitive functions, and physical Health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention With Omega-3 in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with ADHD are shown to have low blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids, not related to diet. Low levels of omega-3 has also been directly related to poor cognition and behavior. Trials have shown that supplement with omega-3 may improve literacy and behavior in children with ADHD symptoms. It has also been shown to improve both memory and reaction time. The effect sizes found in meta analysis of placebo- controlled clinical trials on ADHD core symptoms are small to modest. In a study of adolescent mental health in North Norway in 2003-2005 a significant association was found between intake of fish and hyperactivity as adolescents with a high intake showed less hyperactivity than peers with a low intake (unpublished results from The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study, Siv Kvernmo). There are several key limitations to the existing studies. Underpowered sample size, different methodology and short intervention periods are some factors raising the question of effect size. Other trials have no control group. We are designing this study taking these limitations into consideration. In addition we are using whole marine oil from the zooplankton Calanus finnmarchicus that has a high natural content of steardidonic acid 18:3 n-3 that is a precursor to EPA. The oil also has a high content of astaxanthines - a natural antioxidant. Earlier clinical studies have not used pure oil from zooplankton such as Calanus finnmarchicus. The oil is not processed chemically such as ethylation, that not only alter the structure of the oil, but also devoids the product of its natural antioxidants.</detailed_description>
