	<brief_summary>This will be multicentre a phase II randomized controlled and open-label trial. It will compare the 6-months objective response (CR+PR) rates obtained with Drug Eluting Bead Trans-Arterial Chemo-Embolization (DEB-TACE) alone versus DEB-TACE followed by Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with hepatocarcinoma stage BCLC B. This trial will also include one substudy. This substudy will confront the immuno-histochemical results collected on tumoral biopsies to the biological and imaging (MRI) results. Every patient participating to the trial can also participate to this substudy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients will be randomized in 2 arms determining the treatment they will receive: Arm A: actual standard treatment = TACE Arm B: experimental arm = TACE + SABR</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hepatocellular carcinoma larger than 3 cm and nonresectable, with a diagnosis established either by: dynamic imaging (noninvasively), showing a typical contrast enhancement and washout histopathology satellite lesions are allowed (at most three lesions) as long as the doses constraints are still achievable Hepatocellular carcinoma belonging to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage System class B Tumor must be measurable on a multiphase MRI according to mRECIST criteria Nontumoral liver volume ≥ 800 cc ChildPugh (CP) A to B7 cirrhosis HCC Patients can be included if they require treatment prior to liver transplantation ECOG performance status 01 AST/ALT &lt; 5 times ULN Initial platelets ≥ 50 000 x 10E9/l, neutrophils &gt; 1500 x 10E9/l, Hb &gt; 9 g/dl Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 X normal, or calculated Creatinine clearance rate ≥ 60 mL/min As tumor biopsy can be performed after inclusion, pure hepatocellular carcinoma but also mixed hepatocellular carcinoma will be allowed in this trial.
