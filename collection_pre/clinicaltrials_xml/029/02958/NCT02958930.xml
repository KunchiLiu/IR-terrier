	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and initial efficacy of Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT) in patients with mild/moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Throughout a 2-month treatment period, patients will be evaluated for cognitive performance, brain energy utilization, functional brain imaging, and blood/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for Alzheimer's Disease. Since all patients will receive TEMT, each patient's baseline measurements will serve as their own control for any treatment effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment Against Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is currently no effective therapeutic to stabilize or reverse the cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias. Clinical trials with drugs have been unsuccessful because the wrong therapeutic target/species were selected, because drugs have great difficulty traversing the blood-brain barrier and getting into neurons, and/or because drugs largely have only a single mechanism of action. Since ever-increasing experimental evidence indicates that the toxic forms of both beta-amyloid and tau are the soluble "oligomeric" species of these two proteins, therapeutics to disaggregate these oligomers within neurons represent perhaps the best chance for attaining cognitive benefit in AD patients. Pre-clinical studies performed by the Sponsor and his collaborators have demonstrated that AD transgenic mice treated daily with electromagnetic waves in the radiofrequency (RF) range are protected from cognitive impairment or show a reversal of pre-existing cognitive impairment. These cognitive benefits appear to be due primarily to two complimentary mechanisms: 1) disaggregation of toxic protein oligomers within neurons, and 2) mitochondrial enhancement to increase energy metabolism. Moreover, no deleterious effects of treatment over many months have been observed in these pre-clinical studies. In order to provide similar treatment to mild/moderate Alzheimer's patients clinically, NeuroEM Therapeutics has developed a unique head device that provides electromagnetic (RF) treatment to the entire human forebrain at levels similar to those that provided cognitive benefits in pre-clinical studies. Using the MemorEM 1000 head device in the present Phase I trial, AD patients receive twice daily 1-hour treatments in-home, as administered by their caregiver. The device allows for the patient to have complete mobility for moving throughout their home. A comprehensive array of markers will be analyzed both during and following the 2-month treatment period, with baseline (pre-treatment) values serving as controls. Cognitive safety and efficacy will be evaluated using a variety of cognitive assessments including ADAS-cog (Primary), and secondary cognitive measures including ADCS-ADL, Rey AVLT, Trails A &amp; B, Digit span, and clock draw tasks. Treatment effects on brain energy metabolism will be determine by FDG-PET scans, while treatment effects on brain functional connectivity will be determined through both resting state MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Also being assessed are the effects of treatment on various beta-amyloid and tau protein species (e.g., monomers, oligomers) in both blood and CSF. Safety of the treatment will be monitored by regular Adverse Events Assessment, physiologic monitoring, and patient daily diaries maintained by the caregiver. Expected Results: The investigators expect that 2-months of daily electromagnetic (RF) treatment will not present any significant side effects or safety issues. The investigators further expect that cognitive measures will be stable and/or improve by the end of treatment. In addition, the investigators anticipate that brain functional connectivity may be improved and that enhanced brain metabolism (FDG-PET) will occur. Changes in blood/CSF levels of various beta-amyloid and tau species are also anticipated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosed with mild or moderate stage of Alzheimer's Disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and StrokeAlzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDSADRDA) criteria. MMSE score 18 to 26 ADASCog above 17 Physical clearance for study participation as evaluated by the clinician. Caregiver (spouse, family member, etc.) who agrees to and is capable of taking care and being responsible for the participation of the patient in the study (keeping a diary of health measures they collect on the patient at home, logging the patient's condition daily, and assuming responsibility for administering daily inhome treatment). Caregiver to have nonimpaired mental abilities and normal motor skills, as determined by the investigators at screening. The definition of caregivers for this study is adults providing unpaid care to relatives or friends 65 and older to help them take care of themselves in such activities as managing finances, shopping, preparing meals, and going to doctor appointments. Agreement to participate in approximately 10 weeks during the study. Normal to nearnormal vision and hearing with correction as needed (e.g. corrective lenses, hearing aid). Fluent in English Minimum of 8th grade education Head circumference between 53 58 cm (to minimize variability in head antenna locations) If medicated for AD, then use of cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine for at least 3 months, on stable dose for at least 60 days prior to screening, and maintenance on that dose for the period of this study. All other nonAD medications must be stable for a period of 4 weeks prior to screening CDR 0, 0.5 or 3 Severe agitation Mental retardation Unstable medical condition Use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates 2 weeks prior to screening Pharmacological immunosuppression Participation in a clinical trial with any investigational agent within 6 months prior to study enrollment History of Epileptic Seizures or Epilepsy Patients with depression (not controlled with medication), bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders or any other neurological or psychiatric condition (whether now or in the past). The investigator will obtain this information from available patient medical records, history provided by the patient and caregiver, interview, and neurological exam.
