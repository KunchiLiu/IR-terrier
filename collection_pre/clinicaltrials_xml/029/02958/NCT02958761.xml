	<brief_title>Treatment of Knee Arthrosis With Platelet-derived Growth Factors vs. Hyaluronic Acid.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid are effective in improving symptoms and slow disease progression, but are not able to revert the damage mechanism and trigger cartilage healing. Growth factors included in PRP could stimulate cartilage repair, normalize synovial fluid viscoelasticity, induce a correction in tissue damage, improve articular function, control pain and ameliorate quality of life. Primary aim of this trial was to assess, among patients with grade II/III osteoarthrosis of the knee, efficacy (as determined by improvement at MRI 6 months after the first injection) of three intraarticular injections of platelet lysate when compared to hyaluronic acid. Additional objectives were to compare the treatment groups in terms of a number of functional scales (WOMAC, Lysholm, Tegner Knee, Scale, AKS, Lequesne, VAS) and of number of adverse events.</detailed_description>
