	<brief_summary>This study compare the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine as a sedative drug during NIV and the different strategies routinely used in patients with ARF of different aetiologies. Efficacy will be assessed based on absence of intubation, short term prognosis, and occurrence of medical complications.</brief_summary>
