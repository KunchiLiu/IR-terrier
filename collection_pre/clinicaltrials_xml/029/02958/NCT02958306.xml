	<brief_title>Effect of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) on the Esthetic Outcome and Scar Formation of Unilateral Cleft Lip Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRP is a portion of the plasma fraction of autologous blood, having a platelet concentration above baseline values. PRP is made by centrifugation of whole blood (drawn from a peripheral vein and stored in an acid citrate dextrose solution A (ACD-A) anticoagulant), which separates the various components of blood by their specific weight and increases the concentration of platelets. Platelets are a rich source of the complex group of proteins called growth factors (GFs) involved in natural wound healing and in regeneration of injured tissues. GFs are active signals for attracting stem cells into the site of injury and triggering proliferation of these cells. PRP limit inflammation, interacting with macrophages to improve tissue healing and regeneration, promote new capillary growth, and accelerate epithelialization. Platelets in PRP also play a role in host defense mechanism at the wound site by producing signaling proteins that attract macrophages; PRP also may contain a small number of leukocytes that synthesize interleukins as part of a non-specific immune response. Previous studies of PRP have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoforma. So, PRP is effective in soft tissue healing, having no side effect and showed excellent healing score in skin wound healing.</detailed_description>
