	<brief_title>Pre-myeloid Cancer and Bone Marrow Failure Clinic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pre-myeloid cancer and bone marrow failure clinic is an individualized medicine clinic conceptualized for the early detection of myeloid malignancies such as, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using next-generation sequencing technologies, clonal hematopoietic stem cell changes can be detected early on in myeloid malignancies. These changes are currently classified as follows: 1. Idiopathic cytopenias of unclear significance (ICUS). 2. Clonal cytopenias of unclear significance (CCUS). 3. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate prognosis (CHIP). 4. Bone marrow failure syndromes with risk for clonal myeloid transformation. 5. Familial/Germline syndromes with increased risk for myeloid malignancies. This clinic blends next-generation sequencing technologies with functional studies to help identify, prognosticate and define management plans; including early intervention strategies, for affected patients.</detailed_description>
