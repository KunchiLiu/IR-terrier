	<brief_summary>Obese patients have a high level of intestinal microflora imbalance, with serious consequences such as loss of digestive function. Potential mediators of intestinal microbiota are prebiotics, supplements considered safe because they are naturally contained in food and human microbiota. Their use has been studied as new therapeutic approach for the regulation of intestinal microbiota in various situations of disease, including severe obesity. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of prebiotic supplementation (fructo-oligosaccharide - 12 g / day) on body mass index in participants with obesity class III, with follow up of 90 days.</brief_summary>
