	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Lansoprazole and Domperidone Combination on Intragastric and Intraesophageal Acidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives of the trial to assess the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with domperidone on gastric acidity, intraesophageal acidity, GERD symptoms, impedance kinetics and gastric emptying in patients with GERD. 24 hour pH measurement and gastric emptying test will be done at screening visit and after 7 days of drug treatment. Twelve patients will take one tablet for 7 days.</detailed_description>
