	<brief_title>Arthroscopic Resection Arthroplasty of Carpometacarpal and/or Pantrapezial Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purposes of this study were to report 1) long-term outcomes on a large series of patients that underwent arthroscopic resection arthroplasty (ARA) for thumb basal joint arthritis (BJA) and 2) to compare outcomes of ARA for isolated carpometacarpal osteoarthritis versus those undergoing simultaneous ARA of CMC plus the scaphotrapeziotrapezoid joint for pantrapezial disease. Please note, all patients treated by Dr. Cobb for CMC and/or STT OA received the same treatment regardless of whether or not they chose to participate in the study. Patients who chose to enroll in the study received the same treatment as those who did not only their data was analyzed. Data collection is the same for those who do not participate, only their data is not analyzed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary cases of ARA for thumb BJA with isolated CMC ARA or simultaneous ARA of the CMC and STT joints. Exclusions included 19 cases that received interposition materials that since have been shown to produce unfavorable postoperative inflammatory responses, (Orthadapt Bioimplant, Pegasus Biologics, Irvine, CA and Artimplant Artelon CMCI Spacer, Small Bone Innovations, LLC, New York, NY), 6 cases that had prior CMC surgery, and 27 cases that underwent concomitant surgeries that would potentially effect outcome.</criteria>
