	<brief_title>A Clinical Research of CD30-Targeted CAR-T in Lymphocyte Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD30 is originally described as a marker of Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma. CD30 antibody has been applied to treat lymphocyte derived malignancies. To explore the potency of CD30 in CAR-T therapy, this trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effect of CD30-targeted CAR-T.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. CD30expressing lymphocyte malignancy must be assured and must be relapsed or refractory disease. According to current traditional therapies, there must be no available alternative curative therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT at this time. 2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS. 3. CD30 expression of the malignant cells must be detected by immunohistochemistry or by flow cytometry. In general immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. 4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years. 5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the time of enrollment. 7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell dose based on dosage cohorts. 8. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy: CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic and intensive IT chemotherapy (and therefore not eligible for radiation) 9. Ability to give informed consent. 10. Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% by MUGA or cardiac MRI, or fractional shortening greater than or equal to 28% by ECHO or left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% by ECHO. 11. Renal function: Creatinine level of peripheral blood is required no greater than 133umol/L. 12. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the potentially dangerous effects on the fetus. 13. Patients with history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible if there is no evidence of active GVHD and no longer taking immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days prior to enrollment. 14. Patients volunteer to participate in the research. 1. Evident signs suggesting that patients are potentially allergic to cytokines. 2. Frequent infection history and recent infection is uncontrolled. 3. Patients with concomitant genetic syndrome: patients with Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome, Shwachman syndrome or any other known bone marrow failure syndrome 4. Active acute or chronic graftversushost disease (GVHD) or requirement of immunosuppressant medications for GVHD within 4 weeks of enrollment. 5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids or chronic use of immunosuppressant medications. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. For additional details regarding use of steroid and immunosuppressant medications. 6. Pregnancy and nursing females. 7. HIV infection. 8. Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C. 9. Participation in a prior investigational study within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or longer if required by local regulation. Participation in nontherapeutic research studies is allowed. 10. Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association Classification. 11. Patients with a known history or prior diagnosis of other serious immunologic, malignant or inflammatory disease. 12. Other situations researchers think not eligible for participation in the research.</criteria>
