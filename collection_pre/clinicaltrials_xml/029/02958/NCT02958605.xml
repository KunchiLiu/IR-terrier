	<brief_summary>Medication errors are common in children. Characteristics of errors during critical situations in the Emergency Department are ill-defined and might be more frequent than previously thought. However, optimal strategies to eliminate the risk of prescribing errors remain unknown. Many smartphone apps have been suggested over the last years with some of them designed to calculate medication dosage for children. The impact of these apps to decrease dosage error has never been evaluated in resuscitation setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the use of a smartphone application designed to calculate medication doses decreases prescribing errors among residents during pediatric simulated resuscitations. This will be a crossover-randomized trial using high fidelity simulation among 40 residents rotating in the pediatric emergency department.</brief_summary>
