	<brief_summary>Eighty community-living individuals in Uppsala municipality will be included. Intervention: Outdoor walking exercise program and one strength exercise. Methods: Clinical assessments, questionnaires and medical records. Assessment of motor function, cognition, level of physical activity, food intake and perceived stress are performed at screening as baseline measurements. Walking capacity, mobility, handgrip strength, body composition and cardiovascular risk markers will be assessed at baseline and after 12 week of training. At one year after training health-related quality of life, another cardiovascular incidence and mortality will be documented.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outdoor Walking and Strength Training After Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty community-living individuals in Uppsala municipality will be included in a randomized controlled trial with two arms. Intervention: Participants will perform an outdoor walking exercise program together with one strength exercise for 12 weeks. The intensity and frequency of the training will progressively increase. Participants are supposed to walk and perform strength training 5-7 days/week. Methods: Clinical assessments, questionnaires and medical records used for documentation of age, sex, comorbidity, blood pressure, medications and previous education. Assessment of motor function, cognition, level of physical activity, food intake and perceived stress are performed at screening as baseline measurements. Walking capacity (primary outcome measure), mobility, handgrip strength, body composition and cardiovascular risk markers will be assessed at baseline and after 12 week of training. At one year after training health-related quality of life, another cardiovascular incidence and mortality will be evaluated. Power analysis is performed. The investigators will analyze the data using an intention-to -treat analysis. Participants should have participated in at least 50% of the training sessions</detailed_description>
