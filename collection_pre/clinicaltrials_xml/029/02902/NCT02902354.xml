	<brief_title>Changes in Central Arterial Pressure of Normotensive Women Taking Nifedipine for Tocolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only women whom have been prescribed nifedipine tocolysis by their covering obstetrician will be approached to participate in the study. The patient will take their nifedipine as scheduled, we will attain central arterial pressure reading in addition to arterial waveform measurements. These will be collected: Before administration of the medication Every 20 minutes for 3 hours (total of 10 measurements) -This timing will allow measurements through approximately 2 half lives Routine sphygmomanometry will also be completed at the testing times All of these measurements will be collected for study purposes, although the nurses will have the opportunity to record the routine blood pressure measurements for their charting/vital signs assessment if they desire. Once the patient has been monitored for 3 hours, her participation in the study is considered complete and no additional information will be collected. Each patient will serve as her own control (blood pressure prior to administration of medication), no randomization will occur.</detailed_description>
