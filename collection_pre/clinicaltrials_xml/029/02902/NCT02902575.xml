	<brief_title>The Safety and Feasibility of Laparoscopic-assisted Gastrectomy for Advanced Gastric Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective single-arm study designed to further evaluate laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy for advanced Gastric Cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be performed, to evaluate the safety, feasibility, long-term and oncological outcomes. The evaluation parameters are perioperative mobility and mortality, perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.</detailed_description>
