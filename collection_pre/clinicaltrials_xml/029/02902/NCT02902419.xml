	<brief_title>The Effect of Timing of Removal of Wound Dressing on Surgical Site Infection Rate After Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 602 patients to study the effect of timing of wound dressing removal on the surgical site infection rate. 300 patients were randomized to a group that had the wound dressing removed between 12-30 hours postoperatively. 302 patients were randomized to a group that had the wound dressing removal between 30-48 hours postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the timing of dressing removal had statistical significance on the surgical site infection rate, the primary outcome.</detailed_description>
