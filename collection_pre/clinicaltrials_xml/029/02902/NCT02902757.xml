	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies fluordeoxyglucose (fludeoxyglucose) F-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in monitoring very early therapy response in patients with glioblastoma. Diagnostic procedures, such as FDG PET/CT, may help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment. Chemotherapy can induce very rapid changes to the tumor's glucose consumption which can be measured with imaging. FDG PET/CT shortly after the start of therapy may help identify very early therapy response in patients with glioblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess very early response to therapy in glioblastoma patients using 18F-FDG PET/CT. II. Evaluate very early changes in FDG uptake within 48 hours of start of therapy and correlate them with objective response parameters such as Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) and survival. OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard FDG PET/CT scan 6-8 weeks before start of chemotherapy and one additional FDG PET/CT scan within 48 hours of the start of chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
