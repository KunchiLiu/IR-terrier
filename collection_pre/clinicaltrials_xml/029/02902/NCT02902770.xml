	<brief_summary>The literature regarding analgesic modalities, their combinations and routes of administrations for patients with pain related to renal colic is expanding. NSAID's (IV ketorolac) and opioids (morphine) constitutes the mainstay of treatment of renal colic either alone or in combinations. Despite their synergism and analgesic superiority when administered together, both classes of these medications possess a set of unfavorable side effects that limit their use. Emerging data of the use of IV lidocaine for patients with renal colic demonstrated good analgesic efficacy and safety profile. However, none of the trials directly compared lidocaine to ketorolac or the combination of both as viable options in patients unable to tolerate or to have serious contraindications to opioids. We designed a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate analgesic efficacy, safety and feasibility of non-opioid analgesics and their combinations in patients with renal colic. The hypothesis and proposed study will try to determine if a combination of IV lidocaine and reduced dose of IV ketorolac is superior to either drug alone and if this non-opioid analgesic modality is effective for controlling pain of renal colic origin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Lidocaine and Ketorolac for Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators designed a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial to evaluate analgesic efficacy, safety and feasibility of non-opioid analgesics IV Lidocaine and IV Ketorolac and combination of both in patients with renal colic. The hypothesis and proposed study will try to determine if a combination of IV lidocaine and IV ketorolac is superior to either drug alone and if this non-opioid analgesic combination is effective for controlling pain of renal colic origin. The trial will compare pain scores at 15 min and 30 min between and within the three treatment groups of the study: IV ketorolac 30mg push and 10 minute normal saline drip placebo, 1.5mg/kg IV lidocaine drip (given over 10 minutes) and normal saline push placebo, or IV ketorolac push and IV lidocaine drip. Once a patient is enrolled, the on duty ED pharmacist will prepare any one of the three treatment groups based on a predetermined randomization list generated via SPSS 19.0.The study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and side effects at baseline, 15, 30 and 60 minutes post-medication administration. If the patient still reports pain of five or greater and requests additional pain relief then morphine at 0.1mg/kg will be given as the rescue analgesic. Blinding of medication from the patient, research team, and staff will be strictly maintained by the pharmacist investigators.</detailed_description>
