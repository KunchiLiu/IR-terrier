	<brief_summary>In critically ill patients, the small bowel permeability is increased, leading to bacterial translocation, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Plasma citrulline is a validated biomarker of functional enterocyte mass. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a part of Gram negative bacteria, and plasma LPS concentration is a biomarker of bacterial translocation. The link between plasma citrulline and LPS in the critically ill is unknown. Investigators hypothesize that patients presenting with low plasma citrulline concentration, with presumed altered small bowel function, would have an increased phenomenon of bacterial translocation, and increased plasma LPS concentration. Investigators aimed to evaluate the link between plasma citrulline and LPS concentrations in critically ill patients at the time of ICU admission.</brief_summary>
