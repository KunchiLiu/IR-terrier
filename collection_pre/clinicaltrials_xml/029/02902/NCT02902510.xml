	<brief_title>Therapeutic Yoga to Improve Function in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single blind, randomized, wait-list controlled, phase II exploratory pilot study utilizing an after-trial embedded mixed methods approach that will examine the efficacy of therapeutic yoga as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals with PD to improve balance and reduce fear of falling (FoF). Potential participants will have a FoF in order to enter the study. An after-trial embedded mixed methods design will be employed in this study and will include the collection of qualitative data to assist in the overall interpretation of the more heavily weighted quantitative trial data. Adding qualitative methods will serve as a post-hoc analysis capturing participant perceptions of the relationships between the yoga intervention and various outcomes. More specifically, the qualitative data will aide in explaining the link between the various yoga techniques and mechanisms that participants attribute to improved balance, reduced FoF, and other bio-psychosocial outcomes and experiences. Qualitative data will be collected using focus group interviews with participants in the yoga group at the end of the class in week 8.</detailed_description>
