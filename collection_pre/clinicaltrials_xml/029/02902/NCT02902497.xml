	<brief_summary>The goal of this study was to evaluate, in the hands of an inexperienced surgeon, the cochleostomy location of an endaural approach (MINV) compared to the conventional posterior tympanotomy (MPT) approach. Since 2010, the investigators use in the ENT department of Nice a new surgical endaural approach to perform cochlear implantation. In the hands of an inexperienced surgeon, the position of the cochleostomy has not yet been studied in detail for this technique. This is a prospective study of 24 human heads. Straight electrode arrays were implanted by an inexperienced surgeon: on one side using MPT and on the other side using MINV.</brief_summary>
