	<brief_summary>Revascularisation using recombinant tPA is the reference treatment of stroke. However, the efficacy of fibrinolysis is about 50%. Several factors, including the size of thrombus, have been associated with revascularisation efficacy. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate ex vivo the effect of tPA in patients with stroke with thromboelastography and to correlate results with the clinical outcome of patients. Results may predict revascularisation in patients with stroke.</brief_summary>
