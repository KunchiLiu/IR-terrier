	<brief_title>Psychological Intervention modifiEs Outcome of Patients With implAntable Cardioverter dEfibrillator: The PEACE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The implantation of an ICD in primary prevention is known to increase the rates of anxiety and depression, which can reach up to 45% and 35% respectively in this patient population. Several studies have reported that psychological accompaniment for these patients can alleviate the symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Therefore, we aim to investigate the utility of psychological follow-up for a period of 1 year after first implantation of an ICD for primary prevention.</detailed_description>
