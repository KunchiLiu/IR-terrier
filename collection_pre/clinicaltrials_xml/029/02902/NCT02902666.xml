	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a new paracetamol 1000 mg/codeine 30 mg formulation vs. the marketed reference Co-efferalgan® 500 mg/30 mg in terms of rate and extent of absorption, when administered as single oral dose (one tablet of the new A.C.R.A.F. formulation vs. two tablets of the reference formulation Co-efferalgan®) to healthy male and female volunteers, under fasting conditions, in two consecutive study periods.</brief_summary>

Body Mass Index (BMI): 18.530 kg/m2 inclusive 4. Vital signs: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100139 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 5089 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 5090 bpm, measured after 5 min at rest in the sitting position 5. Full comprehension: ability to comprehend the full nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks and side effects; ability to cooperate with the investigator and to comply with the requirements of the entire study 6. Tobacco: nonsmokers or exsmokers for at least 6 months 7. Contraception and fertility (females only): females of childbearing potential must be using at least one of the following reliable methods of contraception: 1. Hormonal oral, implantable, transdermal, or injectable contraceptives for at least 2 months before the screening visit 2. A nonhormonal intrauterine device [IUD] or female condom with spermicide or contraceptive sponge with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide or cervical cap with spermicide for at least 2 months before the screening visit 3. A male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom with spermicide 4. A sterile sexual partner. Female participants of nonchildbearing potential or in postmenopausal status for at least 1 year will be admitted. For all female subjects, pregnancy test result must be negative at screening. 1. Electrocardiogram (12leads, supine position): clinically significant abnormalities 2. Physical findings: clinically significant abnormal physical findings which could interfere with the objectives of the study 3. Laboratory analyses: clinically significant abnormal laboratory values indicative of physical illness 4. Allergy: ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity to the active principle (paracetamol and/or codeine) and/or formulations' ingredients or related drugs, namely nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and/or opioid derivatives; history of anaphylaxis to drugs or allergic reactions in general, which the investigator considers may affect the outcome of the study 5. Diseases: significant history of renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, cardiovascular, respiratory (including allergic asthma, allergic or chronic bronchitis and other pulmonary diseases), skin, haematological, endocrine or neurological diseases that may interfere with the aim of the study 6. Medications: medications, including over the counter (OTC) medications and herbal remedies for 2 weeks before the start of the study. Hormonal contraceptives for females will be allowed 7. Investigative drug studies: participation in the evaluation of any investigational product for 3 months before this study. The 3month interval is calculated as the time between the first calendar day of the month that follows the last visit of the previous study and the first day of the present study 8. Blood donation: blood donations for 3 months before this study 9. Drug, alcohol, caffeine: history of drug, alcohol [&gt;1 drink/day for females and &gt;2 drinks/day for males, defined according to the USDA Dietary Guidelines 2010], caffeine (&gt;5 cups coffee/tea/day) abuse 10. Drug test: positive result at the drug test at screening or day1 11. Alcohol test: positive alcohol breath test at day 1 12.
