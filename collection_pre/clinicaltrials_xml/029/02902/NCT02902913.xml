	<brief_summary>Data from limited dietary intervention trials suggest that the cardiovascular health benefit of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) may increase with phenolic content. However, while EVOOs contain an array of bioactive compounds, little information exists regarding the physiological effects of specific chemical species. Among the EVOO-derived phenolics with demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in animal and in vitro models is oleocanthal, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). The current study compared the impact of acute intake (40 mL) of EVOO on platelet reactivity in healthy adult males (n=9). The volunteers were randomly assigned to consume three EVOOs in a double-blind controlled trial. The EVOO were characterized and chosen for equivalency in their total phenolic content and fatty acid profiles, but differing in their oleocanthal to oleacein ratio.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Extra Virgin Olive Oil Oleocanthal Content on Platelet Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten healthy adult males (20-50 years of age) will be enrolled into a randomized triple-blind, controlled crossover study that will test the acute effects of oleocanthal-rich extra virgin olive oil intake on platelet aggregation. Each participant will be asked to participate in four study days, separated by at least 1-week, in which they will be randomized to consume on each study day 40 mL (~3 tablespoons) of either oleocanthal-rich extra virgin olive oil (OO), or an extra virgin OO that is matched in total phenolics but oleocanthal-poor, or a refined OO that is low in all phenolics In addition to the oils, on a fourth study day visit, after completion of the study visits involving oil intake the subjects will be asked to take 400mg of ibuprofen. Collection procedures will be performed at the same time of the day to avoid circadian effects. A blood sample (50 mL ~ 3.5 tbsp) will be collected for the measurement of platelet aggregometry and COX metabolites. Following this initial blood draw, the subjects will consume their assigned test product for the day. Two-hours following the intake of the assigned olive oil, a second blood sample will be drawn (50 mL ~ 3.5 tbsp). After the second blood draw, the study day will be complete.</detailed_description>
