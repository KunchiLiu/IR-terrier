	<brief_title>MĒ Device for At-Home Skin Rejuvenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mē home use device is an FDA approved device for hair removal on all skin types and body regions including the face. The device uses Elōs technology which is a combination of electrical field at radio frequencies (RF) and intense optical energy that are simultaneously applied to the tissue and were found to have synergistic effects. Elōs technology has been used at the clinic for non-ablative skin rejuvenation. The levels of Elōs energy used with the professional devices at the clinic is much higher than the level of energy used by the mē device for home use. The current study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the mē device for home-use non-ablative skin rejuvenation. Healthy female volunteers, seeking facial skin rejuvenation treatment will be enrolled. The study includes up to 7 visits at the clinic. The defined areas for treatment are one or more facial sub areas (e.g., forehead, peri-orbital, cheeks, peri oral). Subjects will be provided with the device and will be instructed as to the method of usage. The subjects will perform treatments at the clinic and at home according to the schedule detailed in the intervention section. Follow ups will take place at the 1 and 2 months visits. Optional additional follow up visits will take place 3 and 6 months after the initial treatment. Evaluations will include skin safety, tolerability of the procedure, improvement assessment by the study doctor and subject, satisfaction. Optionally, before/after pictures of follow-up visits vs baseline will be sent to blinded evaluators.</detailed_description>

Subjects who currently use or have used in the prior 30 days any skin products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) e.g. glycolic, lactic, citric, or mandelic acid containing products or retinol/tretinoin containing products or exfoliating washes, masks or scrubs or other microdermabrasion skin care products on the treatment areas. 2. Subjects who are unwilling to maintain their daily skin care regimen for the duration of the study. 3. Subjects who have any skin pathology or condition that could interfere with the evaluation i.e. personal or family history of skin cancer, rosacea and/or requires the use of interfering topical or systemic therapies. 4. Subjects with synthetic or metal implants or permanent cosmetic tattoos in the test areas. 5. Subjects who have a history of abnormal scarring, e.g. keloids or have significant scarring in the areas to be treated. 6. Subjects with bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulation medications, including heavy use of aspirin. 7. Subjects who have participated in any clinical investigation involving the face within the 30 days prior to the first planned treatment or subjects who plan to participate in concomitant facial studies during this trial. 8. Subjects, who are pregnant, were pregnant or gave birth in the last 3 months, are currently breast feeding, or might become pregnant during the course of the study. 9. Subjects who have a history of light triggered seizures. 10. Subjects with prior use of neurotoxins e.g. Botox®, collagen, fat injections and/ or other methods of skin augmentation (enhancement with injected or implanted material) of the face or having had chemical peels within 6 months of initial laser application or planning to so during the course of the study. 11. Subject's use of oral isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 12 months of initial device application or during the course of the study. 12. Subjects having had facial skin treatments with any professional laser, light based, radiofrequency or other devices within the last year. 13. Subjects ever having facial skin treatments with home use laser, light based or radiofrequency or other devices, i.e. PaloVia® or Tria®. 14. Subjects with facial plastic surgery within the last 12 months of the initial laser application or planning to do so during the course of the study. 15. Subjects who have had sun exposure or used a tanning bed 4 weeks prior to the start of the study.</criteria>
