	<brief_title>Impact of Local Anesthesia on Postbronchoscopy Fever: a Randomised Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is the essential procedures for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases。 Fever following FOB has been frequently reported. Fever is usually caused by patient discomfort and delay recovery from illness, or even worse. The reported frequency of this complication ranges from 1 to 20%. According to previous reports, postbronchoscopy fever is associated with advanced age, the presence of abnormal bronchoscopic findings,documented endobronchial obstruction, bronchoscopic intervention for malignancy, BAL, bronchial brushing, endotoxin contamination during bronchoscopy, instillation of topical anesthetic through the bronchoscope, abnormal differential cell counts in the BAL fluid (BALF), bacterial growth in the BALF culture,and the severity of bleeding. At present, guidelines recommend sedation and analgesia combined with airway surface anesthesia for Fiberoptic bronchoscopy. laryngeal spray and cricothyroid anesthesia often used in clinical.Cricothyroid local anesthesia has a good effect, but it is an invasive operation, this is risk factors for fever after bronchoscopy.Therefore, to compare fever in the two kinds of airway anesthesia on Bronchoscopy . So as to provide the local anesthesia method with little influence on the patient.</detailed_description>
