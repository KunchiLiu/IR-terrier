	<brief_summary>To evaluate image quality of coronary CT angiography (cCTA) after sublingual and transdermal administration of Nitroglycerin. Aim of this prospective research study is to investigate equivalence on image quality after sublingual or transdermal Nitroglycerin administration (H0). Furthermore, the feasibility of transdermal Nitroglycerin administration will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
