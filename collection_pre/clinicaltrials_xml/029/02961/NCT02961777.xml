	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular diseases, and more precisely patients with ST - elevated myocardial infarction are globally responsible for a large number of hospitalizations and deaths. Monitoring the quality of care for these patients is very relevant topic. Investigators developed indicators from the scientific literature on the quality of care for patients with STEMI at both the patient level and hospital level. The indicators were subsequently validated by a RAND modified Delphi - study of multidisciplinary experts in the care of patients with STEMI. In this study, the following objectives are set: 1. ) Study of the quality of care for patients with STEMI in 16 Flemish hospitals with cardiology department by retrospective and prospective audit of 20 patient records per participating hospital . 2. ) Study of the interdisciplinary relationships and communication within teams involved in the care of patients with STEMI in the participating hospitals 3) Study of perceived organization of care for patients with STEMI in the participating hospitals In accordance with the objectives of the research, the study consists of three phases: 1. ) A retrospective observational audit of 20 patient records of patients with STEMI each participating hospital. 2. ) A prospective observational audit of 20 patient records of patients with STEMI each participating hospital. 3. ) A survey using validated instruments of interdisciplinary relationships and communication on the one hand and on the other by the teams involved in the care of patients with STEMI perceived organization of care . Data collection is performed by local researchers and remains their property. The data is coded and kept confidential. Only the local researcher has access to the encryption key. The data are protected by the Belgian law on privacy and medical confidentiality, only to be used in the context of this study. The results are published anonymously.</brief_summary>
