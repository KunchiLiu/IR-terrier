	<brief_summary>A randomized clinical trial involving 32 individuals submitted to partial menisectomy will be conducted. Participants will be randomized into: Group I, submitted to a muscular rehabilitation program based on eccentric isokinetic exercise; and Group II, submitted to a muscular rehabilitation program based on eccentric isotonic exercise. Concomitantly with the muscular rehabilitation protocols, individuals will undergo the same physiotherapeutic protocol with analgesia, edema reduction, range of motion, proprioception and functionality goals. Muscle rehabilitation programs based on eccentric isotonic and isokinetic exercise will begin 15 days after partial menisectomy. The programs will last six weeks, with training frequency of two sessions per week, separated by a minimum interval of 72 hours.</brief_summary>
