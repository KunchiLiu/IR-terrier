	<detailed_description>AMN and progressive multiple sclerosis share some similarities including progressive spastic paraparesis and secondary energy failure leading to progressive axonal degeneration. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high doses of biotin might be efficient in patients with AMN.</detailed_description>
