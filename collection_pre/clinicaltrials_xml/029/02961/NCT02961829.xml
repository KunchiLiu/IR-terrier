	<brief_summary>It is becoming clear that a combination of interventions will be desirable to achieve HIV cure. Therefore the investigators propose a pilot proof of concept study, using combination of a number of different interventions for eradicating residual plasma viremia and decreasing HIV reservoirs. The investigators hypothesize that, (i) antiretroviral intensification using Maraviroc, and/or dolutegravir with (ii) Dendritic Cell vaccination using autologous HIV, and (iii) purging intervention using the Class III HDACs, Sirtuin-1, and (iv) decreasing the ratio of long-lived central memory (TCM)/transitional memory (TTM) CD4+ T-cells using Auranofin will provide a synergistic impact leading to a sterilizing cure of HIV infection. Results of this study may provide insightful evidence for planning the next steps using the more efficacious combination of intervention strategies towards HIV sterilizing cure.</brief_summary>
