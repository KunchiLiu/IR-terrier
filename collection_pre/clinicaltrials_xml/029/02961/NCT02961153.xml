	<brief_summary>With the development of national economy and medical technology, patients can extend life rely on high-end medical facilities. At the same time, the continued treatment cannot bring benefits to children, even resulting in poor quality of life of children and bringing high medical costs. This makes the limited medical resources are unreasonable distributed. Research showed that PICU mortality rate halved over ten years ago, but the data did not include death cases who left hospital before death. However, the death number of out-hospital were more than death in-hospital. Therefore, the data cannot actually reflect China's mortality rate of PICU. The reason analysis was limited to the cause of the disease, and does not take the social, economic factors into account. This study include eight PICUs of children's Hospital PICU. Critically ill patients are prospectively studied from death risk factors, admission status, disease diagnosis, severity of illness, analyzing of the risk factors of death from disease diagnosis and death risk factors. In addition, we will illuminate the relationship of death and economic factor, especially for who died out-hospital after withdraw or stop treatment.</brief_summary>
