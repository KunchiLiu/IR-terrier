	<brief_summary>Bronchopleural fistula (BF), an abnormal passage or communication between a bronchus and another part of the body, may develop when there are penetrating wounds of the thorax and after lung surgery. Without effective therapy, treatment of BF is a challenge, with a high rate of mortality and teratogenicity. The investigators will conduct endoscopic injection of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells to fistula, observe the recovery of bronchopleural fistula and systemic reactions, to investigate the application of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of bronchopleural fistula.</brief_summary>
