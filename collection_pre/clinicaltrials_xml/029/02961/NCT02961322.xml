	<brief_title>Medico-economic Study of the Lobo-isthmectomy Assisted Robot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 50,000 thyroidectomies are performed each year in France. The externally surgery produces satisfactory results, but it nevertheless remains a risk of complications in the order of 10 to 20%. Moreover, the patients operated by traditional externally have a basi-cervical visible scar which is a major concern for many of them. The team of Montpellier University Hospital is a pioneer in the use of the technique of endoscopic thyroidectomy under robotic assistance that saves totally cervical scarring for patients, but also decrease the rate of complications. This technique based on the use of the da Vinci robotic system if justified, depending on the manufacturer and the scientific literature, with its minimally invasive character, an amplitude of greater movement than the hand of man, and movements called intuitive that reduce tremors instruments during the operation (Patel 2008). In France and in Europe, there is a growing demand from patients and surgeons to access the surgical technique. An assessment of the real and specific cost of this technique and its overall management is essential in order to assess the financial impact of the introduction of this surgery for our hospitals, or no data is available on this in Literature. The main objective of this study is to describe the direct medical cost of the treatment of thyroid Lobo-Isthmectomy Robot-Assisted (LIRA) with a follow-up 12 months. The secondary objectives of this research are to determine the rate of laryngeal paralysis, the rate of complications specific to access axillary robot, the size of the incision made for surgery, the number of channel conversion transaxillary assisted robot traditional externally, to assess the satisfaction of each patient over his scar, pain over time, the evolution of potential disorders sensitivity of anterior chest wall, the vocal functional suites and quality of life self-administered questionnaire (Voice handicap Index VHI 10 and Short Forme SF-36), and finally to compare the cost of care by the robot with the average cost of a conventional surgery.</detailed_description>
