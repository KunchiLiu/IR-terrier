	<detailed_description>Anesthetic management and fluid therapy is crucial in esophageal resection and reconstruction, which is associated with high incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Excessive fluid administration may result in pulmonary complication, while extremely hypovolemia may lead to shock, circulatory dysfunction, and renal damage. Little is known about fluid status will have impact on anastomotic leakage. Goal-directed fluid therapy has shown to benefit perioperative outcome in major abdominal surgery. This study aims to investigate the effect of goal directed fluid management on the postoperative outcome of esophageal resection and reconstruction.</detailed_description>
