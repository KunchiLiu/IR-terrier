	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and/or neutropenic complications (febrile neutropenia, neutropenic infection) with two schedules of cabazitaxel (bi-weekly versus tri-weekly) plus prednisone in elderly men (≥ 70 years) with mCRPC previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating the Safety of 2 Schedules of Cabazitaxel in Elderly Men With mCRPC Previously Treated With a Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in mCRPC patients aged ≥ 70 years. Treatment: - Arm A : cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle plus daily prednisone or - Arm B: cabazitaxel 16 mg/m² on Day 1 and Day 15 of a 4-week cycle plus daily prednisone. - Treatment will be continued for a maximum of 10 cycles unless there is documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Standard cabazitaxel premedication will be used - Prophylactic G-CSF (GRANOCYTE) will be injected from Day 3 to Day 7 after every cycle of cabazitaxel if neutrophil count is&gt; 2000/mm3, only 3 days). - All new hormonal treatment, including ODM-201, prior to study entry is allowed. - Patients who received Radium-223 are eligible for this study - Treatment with LHRH should not be discontinued. Exploratory assessments: CT-Scan (abdominal/pelvic/chest) or whole body MRI and Bone scan: at screening, every 3 months and EOT. FACT-P questionnaire:at C1D1,each subsequent visit and EOT Number of subjects: Total:170 (85 per arm) Statistical analysis: A sample size of 77 evaluable patients per arm will achieve 80% power to detect a 20% difference in G3 neutropenia incidence between the 2 arms. The incidence in group cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 q3w is assumed to be 32% and 12% on bi-weekly cabazitaxel arm. The test used is a two-sided Fisher's exact test at 0.05 significance level. Assuming 10% non-evaluable patients, 85 patients should be included in each arm for a total of 170. Patients will be stratified according to G8 score and previous ARtargeted agent (abiraterone or enzalutamide) before randomization.</detailed_description>
