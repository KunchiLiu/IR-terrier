	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death among the "communicable" diseases in the world. Pulmonary TB, the main localization, leads to the dissemination of cases. An earlier diagnosis of contagious pulmonary TB is a cornerstone to stop the air transmission. The aim of the study will be to compare two strategies, in patients with a chest-X-ray in favour of contagious pulmonary TB: the classical strategy of sputa collection during three consecutive early mornings, versus the studied strategy of sputa collection at hour h, hour h+1, hour h+2 during the first early morning.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death among the "communicable" diseases in the world. Pulmonary TB, the main localization, leads to the dissemination of cases. An earlier diagnosis of contagious pulmonary TB is a cornerstone to stop the air transmission by starting earlier treatment. The aim of the study will be to compare two strategies, in patients with a chest-X-ray in favour of pulmonary TB: the classical strategy of sputa collection during three consecutive early mornings, versus the studied strategy of sputa collection at hour h, hour h+1, hour h+2 during the first early morning.</detailed_description>
