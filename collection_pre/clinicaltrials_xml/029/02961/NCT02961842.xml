	<brief_title>Combined Colloid Preload And Crystalloid Coload Versus Crystalloid Coload During Spinal Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, controlled, double-blind study will be conducted on ASA physical status II parturients with full-term singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Participants will receive either 500 mL colloid preload and 500 mL crystalloid coload (Combination group) or 1000 mL crystalloid coload (Coload group). Systolic blood pressure will be recorded every minute and ephedrine will be administered when hypotension occurs according to a predefined protocol. The total ephedrine dose, time to the first ephedrine dose, heart rate, inferior vena cava diameter, nausea/vomiting, and neonatal Apgar scores will be recorded.</detailed_description>
