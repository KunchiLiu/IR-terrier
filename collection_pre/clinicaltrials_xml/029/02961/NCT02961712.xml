	<brief_summary>HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy is a chronic disease of the spinal cord, caused by a virus called human T lymphotropic virus type 1（HTLV−1）. Natural Killer cells provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation. In this trial, the investigators aim to study the therapeutic safety and the effect on HTLV-1 virus. This in turn will improve the knowledge and understanding of the disease and should lead to better therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy of Natural Killer(NK) Cells in Human T Lymphotropic Virus Type 1(HTLV-1) Associated Myelopathy(HAM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HAM is a chronic disease of the spinal cord, caused by a virus called HTLV−I. Natural Killer cells provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation. In this trial, the investigators aim to study the therapeutic safety and the effect on HTLV-1 virus. This in turn will improve the knowledge and understanding of the disease and should lead to better therapy. In a single-center, one year open-label trial, 5 HAM patients will be treated with single intravenous injection of NK cells (0.9~1*10^9). Then, the the clinical effect was evaluated by dynamic analysis of Osame's Motor Disability Score and other related physiological indices, such as HTLV-1 antibody titer in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.</detailed_description>
