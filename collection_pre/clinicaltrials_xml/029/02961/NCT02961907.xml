	<brief_summary>Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, It affects approximately one in six couples pregnancy. Many lifestyle factors of the couple's pre and peri-conceptional environment (weight, diet, alcohol, tobacco, coffee, drugs, exercise, stress, sleep, pollution...) are risk factors for infertility. Weight gain, in both members of the couple, is associated with an increased risk of Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) failure and adverse pregnancy outcome, while healthy lifestyle makes the risk of infertility three times less likely to happen. Idiopathic infertility may greatly benefit from lifestyle factors optimization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathway Taking Into Account PeriConceptional Environment for Infertile Couple</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate and optimize periconceptional habits (diet and lifestyle factors) of unfertile couple may have favorable impact on conception and pregnancy. The investigators propose to undertake a controlled trial of the efficiency of an integrated global care program. This trial of an intervention on lifestyle factors will be compared with the ""cohort multiple randomised controlled trial"" methodology in order to strengthen external validity by limiting bias that may result from initial consent to randomisation, or from deception of allocated treatment. Firstly, at their first visit in any participating ART center, all attending couples will be invited to participate in an observational survey in order to allow access to their data. In this whole cohort, all eligible couples will be identified as consultations go. An ""on the fly"" randomisation process (ration 2 usual / 1 experimental) will select candidate couples from all eligible ones, who will be ten offered the experimental PEPCI intervention. In case of refusal of the experimental care, they will be given the usual care.</detailed_description>
