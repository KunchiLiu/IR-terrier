	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is through a randomized clinical trial, double blind, splith-mouth, evaluate the retention rate of restorative protocols of Non-carious cervical lesion. The presence of gingival displacement with a retraction cord (yes or no) and the category of adhesive system (etch-and-rise and self-etching) will be evaluated. Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influences of Gingival Cord Retractor in Retention Rate of Non-carious Cervical Lesions Restorations.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical wear is classified as a noncarious cervical lesion (NCCL), which is a pathological process characterized by loss of dental hard tissues near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). The aim of this study is through a randomized clinical trial, double blind, splith-mouth, evaluate the retention rate of restorative protocols of Non-carious cervical lesion. The presence of gingival displacement with a retraction cord and the category of adhesive system will be evaluated. Two hundred and twenty teeth, with NCCL of depth greater than 1.5mm, of 55 healthy patients of both sexes will be select. The teeth will be randomly divided into 4 different groups according to the gingival displacement with retraction cord (yes or no) and adhesive system category (etch-and-rise and self-etching). Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
