	<brief_summary>Rationale: Previous reviews showed that the evidence regarding the effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) in patients with therapy-resistant, idiopathic (slow-transit) constipation is of suboptimal quality. Furthermore, there is no estimate of costs and cost-effectiveness in this patient group. Study design: A prospective cohort study with one group. This study is conducted next to a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) on 'the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation in patients with idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory to conservative treatments' (for more information ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT02961582). This RCT is part of a temporary reimbursement arrangement, called conditional reimbursement of health care (in Dutch: Voorwaardelijke Toelating) of the National Health Care Institute (Zorginstituut Nederland). As part of this arrangement, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports requires that SNM remains available for eligible patients during the conditional reimbursement period, also when inclusion of the RCT has ended. Furthermore, the Ministry requires that patients who received personalized conservative treatment in the RCT (control group), are offered SNM after completion of their follow-up of 6 months. As a result, the National Health Care Institute requires that the patients who receive SNM outside the RCT are included in a prospective cohort study to be able to collect data on them. Aim: The aim of this prospective cohort study is to collect more (but uncontrolled) information regarding the safety and effectiveness of SNM. Study population: Adolescent (14-17 years) and adult (18-80 years) patients with idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory to conservative treatment. Intervention: The intervention is SNM, a minimally invasive surgical procedure consisting of two phases. In the screening phase an electrode is inserted near the third sacral nerve and connected to an external stimulator. If the screening phase is successful (average defecation frequency (DF) ≥3 a week), the electrode is connected to a pacemaker that is implanted in the buttocks of the patient. If not successful, the pacemaker will be removed and patients receive conservative treatment. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is treatment success at 6 months, defined as an average DF of ≥3 a week according to a 3-week defecation diary and safety. Secondary outcomes are straining, sense of incomplete evacuation, constipation severity and generic (health-related) quality of life ((HR)QOL).</brief_summary>
