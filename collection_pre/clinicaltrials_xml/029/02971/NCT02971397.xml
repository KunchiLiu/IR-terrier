	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading, and may be safer for the heart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytarabine and Daunorubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety (at 3 months) and feasibility of administering daunorubicin hydrochloride (daunorubicin) as continuous infusion under the proposed treatment regimen. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety (at 6 months) of administering daunorubicin as continuous infusion under the proposed treatment regimen. II. To assess treatment outcomes (including complete remission [CR] and complete remission with incomplete recovery [CRi]) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under the proposed treatment regimen. III. To compare the concordance between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiogram (ECHO) in identifying cardiac toxicity, ie a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &gt;= 10% and ejection fraction (EF) =&lt; 50% compared to baseline LVEF. OUTLINE: INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously over 24 hours on days 1-7 and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on day 14. Patients with bone marrow cellularity &gt;= 10% and &gt; 5% leukemic blasts, may receive a second induction of cytarabine IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-5 and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving remission receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with core-binding factor (CBF) AML may receive 4 courses of therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 30 days, at 3 and 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
