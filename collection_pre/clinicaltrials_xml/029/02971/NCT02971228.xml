	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Bionic Pancreas with ZP4207 (dasiglucagon*) is feasible to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. *dasiglucagon is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (pINN) for ZP4207</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Testing the Bionic Pancreas With ZP4207</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label, 2-part, randomized cross-over trial. The trial will enroll up to 20 adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and will assess the safety and efficacy of the Bionic Pancreas (BP) using either the iLet or iPhone platform when used with the glucagon analogue ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) versus Lilly glucagon. In Part 1, up to 10 patients will participate in two 1-day treatment arms in random order (iPhone-based BP using ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and iPhone-based BP using Lilly glucagon) according to a pre-generated randomization scheme. In Part 2, up to 10 new patients will participate in two 1-day treatment arms in random order (iLet using ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and iLet using Lilly glucagon) according to a pre-generated randomization scheme. Patients can only participate in 1 part of the trial. One day the BP will use glucagon analogue ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and the other day the BP will use Lilly glucagon. Subjects will also receive insulin lispro through the BP on both days. The trial will be conducted at single center, the Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes Center in Boston, MA.</detailed_description>
