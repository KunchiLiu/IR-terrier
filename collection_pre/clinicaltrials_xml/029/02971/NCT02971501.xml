	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well osimertinib with or without bevacizumab works in treating patients with EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving osimertinib with or without bevacizumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osimertinib With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With EGFR Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival with osimertinib plus bevacizumab compared to osimertinib alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab. II. To evaluate the time to progression in the central nervous system (CNS) with osimertinib plus bevacizumab versus single-agent osimertinib. III. To determine the overall response rate and the intracranial response rate to the combination versus single agent. IV. To assess the overall survival in patients receiving osimertinib plus bevacizumab compared to osimertinib alone. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to combination osimertinib plus bevacizumab versus osimertinib by molecularly characterizing tumor samples including T790M status. II. To assess whether circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in plasma can be used as an indicator of sensitivity and resistance to treatment. III. To determine whether an angiogenic signature using a multiplex panel array is associated with benefit from the combination of osimertinib plus bevacizumab. IV. To investigate angiogenesis, immune and signaling pathway markers in tumor samples to determine biomarkers predictive of benefit from combination therapy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-12 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-12. In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

plasma testing for EGFR is a suitable alternative to tissue testing if performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)certified laboratory; AND The presence of an EGFR T790M mutation from biopsy from any site of disease (intra or extracranial) after progression on a first or secondgeneration EGFR TKI; plasma testing for EGFR T790M is a suitable alternative to tissue testing if performed in a CLIAcertified laboratory; for patients who have disease progression in the CNS only (with otherwise stable disease systemically), T790M positivity is not required Patients must have measurable disease, defined as one or more of the following: At least one systemic (i.e. nonCNS) lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm (&gt;= 1 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam; and/or At least one brain lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 5 mm (&gt;= 0.5 cm) with brain MRI; if the lesion is 510 mm in size and is the only measurable disease, MRI imaging must be performed with 1.5 mm slice thickness or less Disease progression on a first or secondgeneration EGFR TKI (i.e. erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib); patient may have also received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy but this is not required The presence of at least one untreated cerebral metastasis that is at least 5 mm but less than 20 mm, that is asymptomatic, and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment;
