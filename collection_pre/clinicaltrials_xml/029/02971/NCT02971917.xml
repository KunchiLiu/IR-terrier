	<brief_summary>To validate the following theory: "With TRUVIEW ART™ applied a detector's quantitative performance index, MTF(Modulation Transfer Function), is increased 20% or more". This is to examine the effect of the increased MTF index, whether it influences or not the interpreter's preference</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study of TRUVIEW ART™(Advanced Reconstruction Tech)to Improve Image Quality on Chest Radiograph</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background of Study : DRTECH Corp. has developed and applied for patenting the unique technology of TRUVIEW ART™. TRUVIEW ART™ is advanced image reconstruction technology that restores image quality from the side effects of scattering signals in indirect type scintillator detectors. It is an advanced image pre-processing technology that constructs signal scattering models (PSF) of indirect type detector scintillators. Image sharpness (MTF) is improved by predicting scattering models and eliminating the scattering signal. Purpose of Research and Assumption : Indirect conversion type detectors using scintillators are universal in today's diagnostic imaging area. However, they have a disadvantage of signal scattering compared with direct conversion type detectors. TRUVIEW ART™(Advanced Reconstruction Technology) can restore images from the scattering problems. The purpose of this study is to verify how well it improves the usefulness in clinical diagnostic imaging. Evaluation will measure the improvements in MTF, which is the quantitative performance index of a detector.</detailed_description>
