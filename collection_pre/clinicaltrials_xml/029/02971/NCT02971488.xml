	<brief_summary>Screening, diagnosis and treatment of HCV in PWID, should be part of a harm reduction strategy. Treatment of HCV infected PWID should be delivered in a multidisciplinary care setting with services to reduce the risk of reinfection and for management of the common social and psychiatric comorbidities in this population. More frequent diagnosis, new methods that prevent loss of tracking, and access to antiviral treatment are all strategies that must be implemented jointly if the prevalence of HCV infection in our setting is to be reduced.</brief_summary>
