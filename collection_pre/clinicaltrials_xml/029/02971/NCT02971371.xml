	<brief_summary>Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of repetitive task practice by using robotic devices, including Lokomat, for the treatment of lower limb paresis. Virtual reality (VR) has proved to be a valuable tool to improve neurorehabilitation training. Our pilot randomized clinical trial aimed at evaluating the correlation between the modifications of brain oscillations during a VR neurorehabilitative training of gait and the motor function recovery in patients with chronic stroke. Twenty-four patients suffering from a first unilateral ischemic stroke in the chronic phase were randomized into two groups. One group performed 40 sessions of Lokomat with VR (RAGT+VR) whereas the other group underwent Lokomat without VR (RAGT-VR). Outcomes (clinical, kinematic, and event-related synchronization, ERS, and desynchronization, ERD, at the EEG) were measured before and after the robotic intervention. The robotic-based rehabilitation combined with VR could be associated with improvements in several measurements of lower limb function, gait, and balance in patient with chronic hemiparesis. Moreover, ERS/ERD analysis can be proposed as a tool to monitor motor performance and to develop non-invasive brain-computer interfaces controlling robotic devices.</brief_summary>
