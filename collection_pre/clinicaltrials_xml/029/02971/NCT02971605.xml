	<brief_summary>The proposed pilot study will assess whether ingestion of a classic hallucinogen (psilocybin) leads to changes in emotion processing and neural circuitry that may predict repeated self-administration of this drug and underlie an atypical mechanism of abuse liability, which may vitally contribute to our understanding of the potential for abuse and the underlying mechanisms supporting abuse of classic hallucinogens.</brief_summary>

If the participant does not routinely consume caffeinated beverages, he/she must agree not to do so on the session day. Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages and nicotine, within 24 hours of each drug administration. The exception is caffeine.

Agree that for one week before each drug session, he/she will refrain from taking any nonprescription medication, nutritional supplement, or herbal supplement except when approved by the study investigators. Exceptions will be evaluated by the study investigators and will include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and common doses of vitamins and minerals. Have limited lifetime use of hallucinogens (at least one prior use of a hallucinogen, but preference will be given to those with the fewest number of prior exposures to a hallucinogen) Last hallucinogen use was at least 3 months ago (but preference will be given to those with a greater duration of time since last hallucinogen use) Women who are pregnant (as indicated by a positive urine pregnancy test assessed at intake and before each drug session) or nursing; women who are of childbearing potential and sexually active who are not practicing an effective means of birth control. Cardiovascular conditions: coronary artery disease, stroke, angina, uncontrolled hypertension, a clinically significant ECG abnormality (e.g., atrial fibrilation), artificial heart valve, or stroke in the past year Epilepsy with history of seizures Insulindependent diabetes; if taking oral hypoglycemic agent, then no history of hypoglycemia Currently taking psychoactive prescription medication on a regular (e.g., daily) basis Currently taking on a regular (e.g., daily) basis any medications having a primary centrallyacting serotonergic effect, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). For individuals who have intermittent or "as needed" use of such medications, psilocybin sessions will not be conducted until at least 5 halflives of the agent have elapsed after the last dose. More than 20% outside the upper or lower range of ideal body weight according to Metropolitan Life height and weight table Current or past history of meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM5) criteria for schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (except substance/medicationinduced or due to another medical condition), or Bipolar I or II Disorder Current or past history within the last 5 years of meeting DSM5 criteria for a moderate or severe alcohol or drug use disorder (excluding caffeine and nicotine) Have a first or seconddegree relative with schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (except substance/medicationinduced or due to another medical condition), or Bipolar I or II Disorder Has a psychiatric condition judged to be incompatible with establishment of rapport or safe exposure to psilocybin Head trauma Claustrophobia incompatible with scanning Cardiac pacemaker Implanted cardiac defibrillator Aneurysm brain clip Inner ear implant Prior history as a metal worker and/or certain metallic objects in the body must complete magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening form and be approved by MRI technologist before each scan</criteria>
