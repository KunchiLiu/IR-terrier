	<brief_title>ESWL Versus ESWL and Endoscopic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination mode of ESWL and ERCP is an established method of treatment of painful obstructive calcified chronic pancreatitis. However, the investigators notice that patients after ESWL alone in calcified CP is followed by spontaneous elimination of stone fragments and pain relief. Inui reported that 40% of 555 patients spontaneous eliminate stone fragments. Dumonceau found that combining systematic endoscopy with ESWL adds to the cost of patient care, without improving the outcome of the pancreatic pain. So the investigators design such a prospective and randomized controlled trial. People diagnosed with uncomplicated painful chronic pancreatitis and calcifications obstructing the MPD will be randomly assigned to the ESWL or endoscopy group according to a table of random numbers. ESWL will be performed in all patients using a electromagnetic lithotriptor. ESWL sessions will be repeated if necessary, until stone fragmentation is obtained. Patients in the endoscopy group will undergo endoscopy in 48 hours with possible stent insertion. In the ESWL group, if pain continues or aggravates, endoscopic drainage of the MPD will be carried out. Follow-up will consists of telephone interview1 after treatment and clinical examination every 6 months thereafter. Data collected will include clinical presentation, ESWL, endoscopic and surgical procedures, life quality. In addition, S-MRCP will be performed 6 months after treatment. Blood glucose, insulin, stool elastase will be taken each clinical examination.</detailed_description>
