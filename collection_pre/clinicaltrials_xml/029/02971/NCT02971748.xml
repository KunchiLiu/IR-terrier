	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pembrolizumab in combination with standard hormone therapy can help to control and prevent IBC. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Anti-PD-1 (Pembrolizumab) + Hormonal Therapy in HR-positive Localized IBC Patients With Non-pCR to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 (+/- 3 days) of each 21-day cycle. Participant will also receive hormonal therapy that participant's doctor has chosen for participant's standard treatment. The study doctor will tell participant which hormonal therapy participant receives, its risks, and how often participant will receive it. Length of Study: Participant may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 months, as long as the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (described below). Study Visits: On Day 1 of each cycle: - Participant will have a physical exam - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At Cycle 4 and then every 3 cycles after that (before Cycle 4, 7, 10, 13 and so on), participant will have imaging scans, including an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan, to check the status of the disease as part of participant's standard care. Also, blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and immune system testing. This blood will also be drawn if the disease appears to get worse. Participant will have chest wall or breast photos if the doctor thinks participant needs them. End-of-Treatment Visit: As soon as possible after participant stops receiving the study drugs: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 10 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, biomarker, and immune system testing. - Participant will have the same imaging scans participant had at screening to check the status of the disease. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan. Follow-Up: About 1 month after the last dose of study drugs, participant will be asked about participant's health and any side effects participant may have had. Participant may be asked during a routine clinic visit or participant may be called. If participant is called, each call should last about 2 minutes. If participant stopped taking the study drugs for reasons other than the disease getting worse, participant will be called about 24 months after participant's first dose of pembrolizumab to learn how participant is doing. If participant is called, this should last about 3 minutes. This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Its use in patients with IBC in combination with standard hormonal therapy is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Is willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial. 2. Is a female or male and &gt;/= 18 years of age 3. Has histological confirmation of breast carcinoma. 4. Has confirmed inflammatory breast cancer by using international consensus criteria: (1) Onset: Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema and/or peau d'orange, and/or warm breast, with/without an underlying breast mass. (2) Duration: History of such findings no more than 6 months (3) Extent: Erythema occupying at least 1/3 of whole breast. (4) Pathology: Pathologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma 5. Did not achieve pathological complete response (pCR) to any chemotherapy that was given with the intention to induce best response prior surgery. pCR is defined as the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) breast cancer staging 6. Is HER2 normal, defined as HER2 0 or 1+ by IHC and negative by FISH if performed; or HER2 is 2+ by IHC and negative by FISH; or HER2 negative by FISH if IHC is not performed. 7. Has positive ER or PR status. ER or PR &gt;/= 10% 8. Has a performance status of 01 on the ECOG Performance Scale. 9. Has adequate organ function as determined by the following laboratory values: ANC &gt;/= 1,500 /mcL, Platelets &gt;/=100,000 /mcL, Hgb &gt;/= 9 g/dL, creatinine levels &lt; 1.5 x ULN, Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN, ALT and AST &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN 10. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following: (1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity; OR (2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity. 11. Has negative serum or urine pregnancy test for subjects of childbearing potential within 10 days before first dose. 12. If patient has already started hormonal blockade therapy after radiation as adjuvant therapy, patient is eligible as long as the patient has been on hormonal blockade therapy within 2 months by the time of screening and can start the study drug within 4 weeks since the completion of screening 1. Is currently participating in a study of an investigational anticancer agent. 2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy. 3. Has not recovered from adverse events due to prior therapies, i.e. monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, alopecia and general disorders and administration site conditions (per CTCAE version 4.0) are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. 4. Has a known malignancy (other than breast cancer) except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy. 5. 5. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators, inhaled steroid or local steroid injections to the skin would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjögren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study. 6. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis. 7. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. 8. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. 9.
