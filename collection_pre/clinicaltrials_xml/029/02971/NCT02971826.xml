	<brief_summary>The last marketed thrombectomy devices, named stentretriever, permit a better and faster recanalization in patient with a stroke. The REVIVETM SE is a device designed to restore the brain perfusion in patient with an intracranial artery occlusion. The REVIVETM Se device is not widely use in Europe and in France. The objective of this study is to assess the interest of using this device in the standard care of ischemic stroke in the radiology unit of the hospital Pierre Wertheimer, Lyon. The medical care will not be modified but data will be collected in order to determine whether or not this device is useful for the practice of the radiology unit.</brief_summary>
