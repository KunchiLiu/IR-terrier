	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer diagnosed among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. In 2013, it is estimated that 29,270 men have died from prostate cancer. Although radiation and surgery are quite effective for localized disease, there is no effective cure for men who present with metastatic prostate cancer as the 5-year relative survival rate is only 28%. Currently, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) via medical or surgical castration is the standard first-line therapy in men with metastatic disease but castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually emerges with a median time of 18-24 months. Once CRPC develops, secondary hormonal manipulation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are marginally effective. Given the dismal prognosis of metastatic prostate cancer, new ideas and novel approaches must be explored to improve the clinical outcome. In this regard, recently emerging data suggest that local tumor control may enhance the effectiveness of subsequent systemic therapies. Therefore, in this proposal, the investigators have designed a Phase I/II study in which they will prospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of cytoreductive prostatectomy in men with newly diagnosed mPCa.</brief_summary>
