	<detailed_description>Veterans with chronic pain represent an important population in which to focus smoking cessation efforts. Smoking cessation among patients with chronic medical illnesses substantially decreases morbidity and mortality;yet, many patients (&gt;50%) with chronic pain continue to smoke. This study aims to test the telephone delivery of a cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI), for smoking cessation among Veteran smokers with chronic pain. Proposed is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial with a two-group design in which 370 Veteran smokers with chronic pain will be randomized to either: 1) smoking cessation plus CBI (SMK-CBI), an intervention that includes a proactive tele-health intervention combining evidence-based smoking cessation counseling augmented with behavioral approaches for coping with pain and a tele-medicine clinic for accessing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), or 2) smoking cessation telephone counseling control (SMK Control), a contact-equivalent control that provides standard smoking cessation telephone counseling and a tele-medicine clinic for accessing NRT.</detailed_description>
