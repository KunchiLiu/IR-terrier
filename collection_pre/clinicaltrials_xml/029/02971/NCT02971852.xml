	<brief_summary>Hypnotic glove anesthesia is a hypnosis technique wherein the patient, following the suggestions of the hypnotherapist, is mentally capable to create a loss of sensation in areas of the hand that would be covered by a glove. We investigated the effects of hypnotic glove anesthesia on skin temperature measured by thermography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Hypnosis on Skin Temperature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After 20 min installation and temperature equilibration (T0), the subject skin temperature was recorded in 5 regions of both hands (1 = distal hand, 2 = proximal hand, 3 = wrist, 4 = distal forearm, 5 = proximal forearm) using infrared thermography. After 10 min of latency, skin temperature was recorded again in both hands (T1). A first noxious stimulus (NOX1) is then applied by the hypnotherapist by pinching the webbing between the thumb and index fingers of the dominant hand between the thumb and the index. Pain intensity is assessed on a 0-10 (0 = no pain, 10 = maximal pain imaginable) numerical rating scale (NRS1). The hypnotic glove is then mentally created by the subject on his dominant hand following the suggestions of the hypnotherapist (T2). To assess the efficacy of the hypnotic glove, a second noxious stimulus (NOX2) is applied similarly to NOX1 and the NRS was recorded (NRS2). The subject is then invited to mentally wear off the glove (T3). Skin temperature is then recorded in both hands, and a third noxious stimulus (NOX3) is applied similarly to NOX1 and NOX2 to verify the disappearance of hypnotic anesthesia. A last record of skin temperature in both hands is performed 5 min after the glove is withdrawn (T4).</detailed_description>
