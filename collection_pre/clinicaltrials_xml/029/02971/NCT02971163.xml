	<brief_summary>Syncope, or transient loss of consciousness/fainting, is a common emergency department (ED) complaint responsible for over 1 million ED visits yearly. Potential causes include benign conditions such as dehydration or vaso-vagal syncope. Rarely, syncope is the result of serious cardiac conditions. In older patients without a clear cause of syncope hospital admission is frequently initiated at very low risk thresholds, though there is little evidence that these admissions improve patient outcomes. These decisions are often made without significant patient input or discussion of reasonable alternatives. In this situation, a patient's values, preferences, and particular circumstances should be taken into account. This mutualistic approach to clinical management is referred to as Shared Decision-Making. Shared Decision-Making (SDM) is a joint process of choice selection between providers and patients in clinical scenarios where multiple reasonable management options exist. To improve syncope emergency care, the researchers can leverage recent advances in risk stratification to engage patients in SDM and deliver superior, patient-centered care. This study will provide the groundwork for a larger, randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of the decision aid for management of low-risk syncope.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Setting: Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) has a 61-bed adult Emergency Department with a volume of over 100,000 patient visits/year or approximately 300 visits/day. MSH is a large academic tertiary care medical center located in East Harlem and serves a large black and Hispanic community. Projected Recruitment: There are approximately 60 MSH ED visits for syncope per month of which 35 per month are by patients above age 40. Roughly half of these do not have a clear etiology of their syncope discovered in the ED. The researchers project that of the 17 potentially eligible patients per month, three will be successfully enrolled for a projected 72 patient enrollees at the completion of the 24-month recruitment period. The PI, clinical research coordinators, and SRAs will monitor the real-time electronic tracking system for all ED patients and will identify any patient over age 40 with a chief complaint of syncope or loss of consciousness.</detailed_description>
