	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the technical performance of Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT as compared to F-18 FDG PET for the differentiation of radiation necrosis from glioma relapse and to obtain estimates of diagnostic accuracy for Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT and F-18 FDG PET in an intra-individual comparison.</brief_summary>
