	<brief_summary>In the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), goals of critical care are often discussed in long-term ventilated patients around the time of extubation. Muscle weakness predicts extubation failure but formal muscle strength assessment by the Medical Research Council scale is time-consuming and not part of the daily clinical exam. In this observational study, we hypothesize that COMA measurement, routinely used by the SICU nurses, is a reliable and valid predictor for patients' SICU outcomes. This prospective observational study is carried out within a consecutively enrolled cohort of adult patients who are extubated in two SICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.</brief_summary>
