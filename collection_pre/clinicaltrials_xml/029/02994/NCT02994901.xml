	<brief_summary>The goal of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the difference in cytokine profiling approach and mitochondrial function between geriatric sarcopenic patients (group 1) and geriatric non-sarcopenic patients (group 2) and healthy (group 3) geriatric participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cause and Importance of the Age-dependent Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants (group 1&amp;2) are assessed during the hospital stay and age-matched controls (group 3) will be recruited through Flyers. The investigators aim to isolate and cryopreserve peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood to perform functional assays on mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ROS. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate the association between biomarkers and frailty, quality of life, functional performance, fatigue and risk of depression. The investigators hypothesize that this profiling approach will allow the evaluation of the progression of age-dependent sarcopenia and uncover novel therapeutic targets.</detailed_description>
