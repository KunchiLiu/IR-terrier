	<brief_summary>Acetaminophen is frequently used as an adjunct for pain management in pediatric surgical patients. The drug is available in an over the counter, inexpensive oral form as well as a considerably more expensive intravenous form. This study will compare opioid requirements and acetaminophen plasma levels post operatively for two dosing regimens to compare oral versus intravenous routes given pre operatively.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to compare opioid utilization in post-operative patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, between IV and PO acetaminophen. Secondarily, it will provide information regarding possible cost savings, pharmacokinetics and safety between these two regimens.</detailed_description>
