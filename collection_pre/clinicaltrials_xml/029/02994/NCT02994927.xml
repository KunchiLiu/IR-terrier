	<brief_summary>The aim of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of the orally-administered, selective complement C5a receptor inhibitor CCX168 (avacopan) in inducing and sustaining remission in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Clinical Trial of CCX168 (Avacopan) in Patients With ANCA-Associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complement 5a and its receptor C5aR (CD88) is involved in the pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the orally-administered, selective C5aR inhibitor CCX168 (avacopan) in inducing and sustaining remission in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) treated concomitantly with Rituximab or Cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine.</detailed_description>
