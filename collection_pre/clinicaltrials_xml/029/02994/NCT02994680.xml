	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled field trial is to determine whether a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel distribution intervention reduces personal and kitchen exposure to household air pollutants and improves cardiopulmonary health outcomes when compared to usual cooking practices with open-fire biomass-burning stoves in adult women aged 25-64 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Outcomes and Household Air Pollution Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, controlled field trial of an LPG stove and fuel distribution intervention compared to standard cooking practices with open-fire biomass-burning stoves in the homes of participating adult women aged 25-64 years. The aim is to determine whether provision of cleaner fuels will result in important reductions in household air pollutants and consequently in an improvement in cardiopulmonary health outcomes over a one-year period. Participants randomly assigned to the intervention arm will receive a free LPG stove and fuel delivered to their homes during the one-year intervention period. Participants randomly assigned to the control arm will receive a free LPG stove and vouchers that can be used to obtain free fuel for an entire year at LPG fuel distribution centers at the end of the one-year intervention period. All participants will be followed for a second year to assess patterns and impacts of sustained use (intervention arm) and initial adoption (control arm).</detailed_description>
