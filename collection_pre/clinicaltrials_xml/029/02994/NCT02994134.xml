	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of a moderate intensity aerobic exercise intervention (delivered at 55-64% age-predicted maximal heart rate) with a high intensity aerobic exercise intervention (delivered at 65%-90% age-predicted maximal heart rate) on measures that probe cortical synaptic plasticity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in sedentary healthy adults.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult males and females aged 1860 years old Primary language is English Sedentary (defined as not engaging in purposeful physical activity more than 2 times over the last two months) Exercise clearance Presence of cognitive, neurologic or orthopedic conditions that could affect performance of the testing and training procedures History of migraines. History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute seizures History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, history of abnormal (epileptiform) EEG or family history of treatment resistant epilepsy Any current history of a psychiatric illness Any unstable medical condition No medication is an absolute exclusion from TMS. Medications will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and a decision about inclusion will be made based on the following: The subject's past medical history, drug dose, history of recent medication changes or duration of treatment, and combination with other CNS active drugs. The published TMS guidelines review medications to be considered with TMS (Rossi, Hallett, Rossini, PascualLeone, &amp; Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009). Any metal in the brain, skull or elsewhere unless approved by the responsible MD Any medical devices (i.e. Cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, medication infusion pump, cochlear implant, vagal nerve stimulator) Intracranial lesion Substance abuse or dependence within the past six months Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, might not be suitable for the study</criteria>
