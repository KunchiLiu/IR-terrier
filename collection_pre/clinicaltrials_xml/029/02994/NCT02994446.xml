	<criteria>Ischemic post myocardial infarction ventricular tachycardia (VT) Scar identified on imaging Drug refractory or drug intolerant VT following use of at least one Class III antiarrhythmic as demonstrated by a recurrent arrhythmia and is not a suitable candidate per the investigator's expert opinion for ongoing or alternative drug therapy Prior failed ablation as evidenced by implantable cardioverter defibrillator device therapy within the prior 3 months Minimum 3 month implantable cardioverter defibrillator interrogation history available Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 20% 1875 years old Signed informed consent and willing and able to participate in all study procedures and follow up requirements Patients without ischemic, scarrelated VT VT with findings suggestive of right ventricular free wall origin findings VT of septal origin may be excluded. Patients requiring ablation at such locations should only be included when the arrhythmia itself is lifethreatening or otherwise sufficiently severe to justify the risk. Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within previous 60 days Cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention within previous 60 days Patients with NYHA class IV heart failure Prosthetic cardiac valve(s), severe aortic stenosis or flail mitral valve Left ventricular assist device planned or required for the procedure Comorbidities such that a patient has less than 1 year life expectancy Significant intracardiac and/or laminated thrombus prior to ablation procedure Thrombocytopenia or other coagulopathy Pregnancy Other acute illness or active systemic infection (unrelated to VT or its origin) Significant congenital anomaly heart disease Allergy or contraindications to the medications/agents used during a standard ablation/EP intervention. Concurrently enrolled in any other investigational drug or device study</criteria>
