	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of off-the-shelf (OTS) and adapted game controllers on quality of game play, enjoyment, and energy expenditure during active video gaming in persons with mobility impairments. The controllers to be evaluated include off-the-shelf and adapted gaming mats and off-the-shelf and adapted Wii Fit balance boards.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Adapted Controllers for Active Video Gaming in People With Physical Disabilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that individuals with disabilities have lower levels of physical activity and fitness and higher levels of obesity compared to their non-disabled peers. Research has also shown that engaging this population in physical activity can be extremely challenging due to physical impairments associated with their disability, as well as fewer opportunities to participate. Active video games (AVG), also known as exergames, are a category of video games that require much more body motion for successful play than the traditional pushbutton or joystick actions. The recent introduction of motion controlled AVGs allow a much greater variety of physical activity to be part of play. These games hold promise for promoting higher levels of energy expenditure, weight management and fitness. However, many current AVGs are inaccessible or offer limited play options for individuals who are unable to stand, have balance issues, poor motor control, or cannot use their lower body to perform game activities. Making AVGs accessible to people with disabilities offers an innovative approach to overcoming various barriers to participation in beneficial physical activity. A recent publication by Dr. Rimmer in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation journal examining the use of AVGs as a means to increase energy expenditure in non-ambulatory young adults with disabilities suggested that clinically significant increases in energy expenditure could be achieved with AVGs.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Potential participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of lower extremity mobility disability (e.g., spina bifida, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,1 year post spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, or limb loss) with partial or full use of upper extremities and use of an assistive device (manual wheelchair, walker, crutches, or canes) for balance and/or mobility or should have gait deviation. Participants must be between the ages of 10 and 60 yrs, and not weigh more than 350 pounds. Unstable cardiovascular conditions as identified by their physician. Weight over 350 pounds Visual impairment that interferes with playing video games Score is below 4/5 on the comprehension screening form.</criteria>
