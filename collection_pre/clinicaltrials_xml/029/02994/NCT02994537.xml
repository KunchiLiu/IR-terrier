	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the pathogenes, clinical characteristics, laboratory and histological examination results, treatment and prognosis of autoimmune hepatitis(AIH). At phase 1, the investigators focus on studying of the clinical characteristics of acute autoimmune hepatitis, and then will study the difference about treatment effects between acute autoimmune hepatitis and chronic AIH. Morever, the investigators have noticed that drug induced AIH have some special characteristics that may be beneficial to distinguish it with durg induced liver disease. Therefore the investigators will do some studies about drug induced AIH or other disease which maybe related to the onset of AIH.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Now this study has been researched at phase 1, the investigators focus on studying the difference between acute AIH and chronic AIH. In this phase, the investigators analysed the serum biochemical results such as ALT,AST,IgG,PT,INR and so on, and also compared the histological performance. Finally, we compared the percentages of biochemical remission in the two groups, and the time from initial treatment to biochemical remission has also been put into the analysis. Now, the investigators are preparing for submitting the manuscript of phase 1.</detailed_description>
