	<criteria>All patients consecutive enrolled from 1990 to 2004 with soft tissue sarcomas located either in the limbs or girdles, superficial or deep, grade 2 or 3 (FNCLCC), who were first treated with radical conservative surgery and adjuvant RT atto a minimum biologically equivalent dose of 45 Gy, with or without concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy. A patient record captured outside the time frame from 1990 to 2004 with trunk, retroperitoneum, and head and neck localisations, grade 1 histology and, PSâ‰¥3, were excluded as well as and those plus patients who had received neoadjuvant treatment.
