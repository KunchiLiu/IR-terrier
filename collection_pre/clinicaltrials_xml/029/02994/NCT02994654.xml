	<criteria>1. The subject requires skin grafting as a result of an acute thermal burn injury (i.e. injuries caused by exposure of the skin to fire/flames, excessive heat, hot steam or water). 2. The area of total burn injury is 550% TBSA inclusive. 3. Two areas requiring skin grafting, each at least 300cm2 (or 600cm2 contiguous), excluding hand/face and joints. 4. The subject is at least 5 years of age. 5. The subject (or family, for those under 18 years of age) is willing and able to complete all followup evaluations required by the study protocol. 6. The subject is to abstain from any other treatment of the wound(s) for the duration of the study unless medically necessary. 7. The subject agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other interventional clinical trial for the duration of the study. 8. The subject and/or guardian are able to read and understand instructions and give informed, voluntary, written consent. 1. The subject's burn injuries were caused by chemicals, electricity, and/or radioactive substances. 2. The subject is unable to follow the protocol. 3. The subject has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the investigator may compromise patient safety or study objectives. 4. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for irrigation (Hartmann's) solution. 5. Life expectancy is less than 1year.</criteria>
