	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to characterize the metabolic disposition, pharmacokinetics (PK), and routes of elimination of [14C]‑labeled BVD‑523 after administration of a single, oral dose to healthy male subjects. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of [14C]‑labeled BVD‑523 in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>

Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic, infectious, dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorder (as determined by the Investigator [or designee]) prior to Check‑in History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator (or designee) prior to Check‑in History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that could alter absorption or excretion of orally administered drugs prior to Check‑in except appendectomy, and hernia repair will be allowed if it was not associated with; History of Gilbert's Syndrome History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the Investigator's (or designee's) opinion, is clinically significant History of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to Check‑in History of nicotine use within 6 months prior to Checkin or positive cotinine at Screening or Checkin Participation in more than 1 other radiolabeled investigational study drug trial within 12 months prior to Checkin. The previous radiolabeled study drug must have been received more than 6 months prior to Check‑in for this study and the total exposure from this study and the previous study will be within the recommended levels considered safe, per United States (US) Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 361.1 (eg, less than 3,000 mrem whole body annual exposure) Exposure to significant radiation (eg, serial x‑ray or computed tomography scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure monitoring) within 12 months prior to Check‑in Use of any drugs or substances known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A enzyme within 30 days prior to study drug administration, unless otherwise stated, and throughout the study Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 5 halflives (if known) or 30 days prior to Check‑in, whichever is longer Use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to Check‑in, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee) Use of any overthecounter, nonprescription preparations (including vitamins, minerals, and phytotherapeutic/herbal/plantderived preparations) within 7 days prior to Check‑in, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee) Poor peripheral venous access prior to Check‑in Donation of whole blood from 56 days prior to Screening through Discharge, inclusive, or of plasma from 30 days prior to Screening through Discharge, inclusive Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Check‑in Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator (or designee), would limit the subject's ability to complete or participate in this clinical study Any other unspecified reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator (or designee) or Sponsor, make the subject unsuitable for enrollment</criteria>
