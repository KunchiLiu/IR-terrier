	<brief_summary>Our goal is to temporarily implant the following groups for 90 days: 1. Three human partial hand amputees (amputated at the level of the hand) with 2 FAST-LIFE electrodes, one inserted into the motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve and the other into the sensory fascicle. 2. Five human hand and forearm amputees (amputated at the level of the forearm) with 2 FAST-LIFE electrodes in the ulnar nerve (one in the motor fascicle, one in the sensory fascicle) and 4-5 FAST-LIFE electrodes in the median nerve (one in the motor fascicle, one in each of the 3-4 sensory fascicles).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects: Hand and forearm amputees: Male or female, age 18 and older, of any race or ethnicity Able and willing to sign Consent Able and willing to participate in all study activities including implantation, testing and explantation of the study device. Able to communicate effectively in English without an interpreter After preliminary screening subjects will be assessed for the following inclusion criteria: Patient has an existing myoelectric hand prosthesis for &gt;3 months and demonstrates proficiency during daily use Overall and phantom pain are wellcontrolled and not incapacitating Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects: If MR neurogram and EMG/NCS study show nerve or muscle dysfunction/injury at a higher level than anticipated based on the appearance of the physical amputation stump, the subject may be excluded from the study due to adverse neuromuscular anatomy which would preclude use of the proposed experimental electrode implants. The radiographs will be used to confirm suitability of the amputation stump configuration. If the bony anatomy of the amputation stump is found to be unsuitable, the patient may be excluded from the study.</criteria>
