	<brief_summary>Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) has been shown to be safe and cost-effective, but program coverage remains low. New treatment models that maintain high levels of clinical effectiveness but allow for increased coverage are still needed. A reduced schedule of follow-up, in which children receive clinical follow-up and therapeutic foods on a monthly rather than weekly or biweekly basis, may be one alternative. This study aims to describe the safety and feasibility of a monthly distribution of ready-to-use therapeutic food in the treatment of uncomplicated SAM, in terms of clinical response to treatment and household ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) utilization. This is a non-randomized pilot intervention study in which 115 children eligible for the outpatient treatment of SAM were provided a monthly ration of RUTF. Anthropometric measurements were taken on a weekly basis for 4 weeks to monitor treatment response defined as weight gain, (mid-upper arm circumference) MUAC gain, weight loss &gt; 5%, and the development of edema. Unannounced household spot checks were conducted over 4 weeks to assess household utilization of RUTF and storage practices.</brief_summary>
