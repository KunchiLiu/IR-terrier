	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery is the most effective, long-term treatment for morbid obesity, and consistent with previous findings, individuals who lose significant weight after surgery also have improved cognition or "brain function". The mechanisms behind these cognitive improvements are currently unknown, but are the focus of much research effort. The goal of this pilot study is to thoroughly describe these changes in surgical versus medical weight loss patients over time in a repeated measures fashion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination of Cognitive Function in Obesity and Following Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity is associated with decreased cognitive function and, interestingly, weight loss is associated with improved cognitive function. Bariatric surgery is the most effective, long-term treatment for morbid obesity, and consistent with these previous findings, individuals who lose significant weight after surgery appear to have improved cognition. Previous results have only reported the appearance of cognitive improvements starting at three months postoperatively, thus, the main focus of this study is to discover whether cognitive function improvements are seen as early as one month after bariatric surgery. An acceleration in the onset of cognitive function changes could provide insight towards the ambiguous underlying neural mechanisms. The benefits of bariatric surgery extend beyond reversible cognitive deficits. Many of the medical comorbid conditions that these patients have before surgery (e.g. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes) typically resolve prior to any significant weight loss. The mechanisms for these weight-independent improvements are also undetermined. A secondary focus of this study is to determine whether or not cognitive function following bariatric surgery also improves prior to significant weight loss. To test whether cognitive function changes following bariatric surgery, two cohorts of surgical patients will be recruited as well as another group of patients undergoing medical weight loss treatment. The goal of this pilot study is to reproduce and expand upon previous findings that demonstrate cognitive improvements following bariatric surgery.</detailed_description>
