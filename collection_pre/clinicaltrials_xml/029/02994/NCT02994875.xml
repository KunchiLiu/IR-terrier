	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of N-acetylcysteine in Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this research is to identify the functional neural mechanisms (as assessed using fMRI) of short-term N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration among methadone-maintained individuals with cocaine dependence. Specifically, this application proposes to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to examine the effects of 7-day NAC administration (2400mg/day) on the neural networks engaged during response inhibition (Go/No-Go task) and affective (emotion-regulation task) processes among cocaine-dependent, methadone-maintained individuals (n=40; 20 per treatment-order condition).</detailed_description>
