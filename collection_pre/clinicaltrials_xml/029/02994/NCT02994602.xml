	<brief_summary>This is a two-center, open-label study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers at two academic research centers. The study will consist of three single applications of the Nestorone (NES) + testosterone (T) combined gel on the shoulders/upper arms of male participants followed 2 hours later by supervised skin contact by the non-dosed female participants on the application site on days 1, 8, and 15. Effect of Washing or Clothing Barrier to the Application will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Serum Testosterone and Nestorone in Females After Secondary Exposure to Nestorone ® (NES) + Testosterone (T) Combined Gel Applied to Shoulders and Upper Arms in Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-center, open-label study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers at two academic research centers. The study will consist of three single applications of the Nestorone (NES) + testosterone (T) combined gel on the shoulders/upper arms of male participants followed 2 hours later by supervised skin contact by the non-dosed female participants on the application site on days 1, 8, and 15. On day 1, the male participant will wear a 100% cotton T-shirt over the application area before skin contact with the female. On day 8, the male participant will shower approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes after gel application and engage in skin contact with the female participant (2 hours after gel application) after washing the area with soap and water then drying it. A measurement of residual Nestorone and testosterone will be taken from the male's skin on a single location of the application site using adhesive D-square strips 90 minutes after application (30 minutes before shower/90 minutes after gel application) and 30 minutes after the shower and rubbing (150 minutes after application). On day 15, there will be no shower or clothing barrier for the male participant before skin contact with the female participant. A measurement of residual Nestorone and testosterone will be taken from a single location of the application using adhesive D-square strips site 90 minutes and 150 minutes after the application. An end of study/exit visit will occur for both male and female participants two weeks after treatment completion.</detailed_description>

Known hypersensitivity to progestins or testosterone. 9. Any clinically significant abnormal findings at screening per the Investigator's medical judgement. 10. Use of androgens or other anabolic steroids that may affect testosterone measurements. 11. Known active or chronic dermatitis or other severe skin disorder. 12.
