	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study designed in an effort to develop and improve access to effective treatments for tobacco use in rural Veterans using a tailored intervention approach. Specifically, we will evaluate a combined behavioral and pharmacological smokeless tobacco cessation which concomitantly addresses comorbid issues commonly experienced by rural tobacco users including elevated depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and concerns about weight gain. The objectives are to: 1. Evaluate the feasibility of an individually-tailored telephone intervention for rural smokeless tobacco users 2. Examine the impact of the intervention on treatment utilization, patient satisfaction, and smokeless tobacco cessation.</brief_summary>
