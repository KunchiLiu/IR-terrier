	<brief_summary>The study will be a single-center, single-arm, Phase II study of gemcitabine and cisplatin in combination with conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization therapy in adult patients with advanced ICC. 25 patients will be enrolled over the course of 2 years, with an additional 1.5 years for patient follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Systemic Chemotherapy in Combination With Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients With Advanced Intra-Hepatic Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients enrolled on study will receive a chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. After every 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy, patients will receive contrast-enhanced MRI to assess liver disease; conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) will be performed as indicated based on this assessment. Patients will receive a maximum of 8 cycles of the gemcitabine/cisplatin combination. Up to 3 TACE treatments may be delivered in this same time frame, with the first TACE taking place after 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy. Following the treatment period, patients will continue clinical follow-up at 3 month intervals until study exit at 18 months post the start of treatment. It is hypothesized that the addition of conventional transarterial chemoembolization to standard chemotherapy will result in an improvement in PFS in patients with advanced, unresectable ICC, including patients with extra-hepatic disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is at least 18 years of age. Patient has advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Advanced, unresectable ICC is defined as biopsyconfirmed adenocarcinoma in the liver, with an immunohistochemical profile consistent with a pancreaticobiliary primary, not involving the common bile duct or bifurcation, and not amenable to surgical resection. Eligible for conventional TACE as defined by local treatment guidelines. ChildPugh class of A to B7. Adequate endorgan and bone marrow function as manifested as: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Creatinine ≤ 2.0 g/dL AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN Albumin ≥ 2.4 mg/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 For TACE procedures, subjects are allowed to have platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3. Disease is liverdominant with &gt;70% of measurable disease burden within the hepatic parenchyma. No prior surgery or chemotherapy for ICC. ECOG performance status of 01. No other active malignancy within 2 years. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Prior or concurrent chemotherapy treatment for advanced ICC. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to gemcitabine, cisplatin, doxorubicin, or mitomycinC. Active treatment with CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers. Recent surgical procedure within 21 days of study enrollment. Severe and/or uncontrolled comorbid medical conditions including, but not limited to, active infection, viral hepatitis, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris, and psychiatric illness or social circumstance that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnancy during study duration. Active immunosuppressive medications. Presence of grade 2 or higher hepatic encephalopathy. Complete occlusion of the entire portal venous system. Partial or branch portal vein occlusion allowed if without reversal of flow. Radiotherapy within 21 days from treatment with study interventions or medications. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of first infusion of this study), or planned participation in additional experimental drug. Unstable angina. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (Appendix C). History of myocardial infarction or CVA within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures. Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks.</criteria>
