	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether state-of-the-art technologies such and next generation sequencing and drug sensitivity and resistance testing of patient derived tumour tissue can facilitate research translation and improve outcome of urologic cancers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Access to high-quality clinical patient material (e.g. tissue of primary tumor and metastasis, plasma and urine) linked to comprehensive registry and clinical data and molecular characterization of the patient material using state-of-the-art technologies (e.g. NGS, transcriptomics, imaging, DSRT) will facilitate a more rapid translation of basic research innovations into clinical care (diagnostics, imaging, therapeutics) and result in improved outcome of patients suffering from urologic cancers ("personalized medicine"). The principal aim of the project is to establish a framework and infrastructure for the systematic collection and interpretation of biological patient samples. Similarly, the investigators aim to establish the format how the related clinical and research data can be made readily accessible for both clinicians and researchers without compromising patient privacy. The key objectives of the project are to facilitate research translation and to improve outcome of urologic cancers.</detailed_description>
