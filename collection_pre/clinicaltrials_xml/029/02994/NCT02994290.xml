	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to assess the implementation of IPP-HPV immunization at Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and to identify potential barriers to and facilitators of this intervention to optimize its feasibility and effectiveness. It is imperative that innovative interventions be developed to achieve comprehensive utilization of this highly effective vaccine to reduce rates of HPV infection, lower rates of cervical and other HPV associated cancers, and address cancer disparities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Implementation and Effectiveness of IPP-HPV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Administration of the HPV vaccine during the inpatient postpartum hospital stay has the potential to be an innovative intervention to improve HPV immunization rates. Following onset of pregnancy, the postpartum period becomes the next available opportunity to immunize with the HPV vaccine, which is safe in breastfeeding women. The benefits of such an intervention include a focus on women engaged with the health care system who are often highly motivated to invest in their personal health. Specific Aims Aim 1: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of postpartum women with receiving the HPV vaccine during the inpatient postpartum admission as part of the Inpatient Postpartum HPV Immunization Quality Improvement Program (IPP-HPV). Aim 2: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of healthcare providers with inpatient postpartum HPV immunization as part of IPP-HPV and to identify facilitators of and barriers to its implementation. Aim 3: To assess the uptake and effectiveness of a Pilot Quality Improvement Program to increase HPV vaccine uptake (IPP-HPV) for Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) Women's Center and Center for Women's Health and Midwifery (CWHM) postpartum patients ≤ 26 years of age who deliver at YNHH York Street Campus (YSC) or Saint Raphael Campus (SRC).</detailed_description>
