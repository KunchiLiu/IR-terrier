	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting the quality of life of patients who suffer. Despite medical and surgical treatments available, there are a significant number of people suffering from CRS refractory to these standard treatments. A preliminary clinical trial conducted at CHUM Hôtel-Dieu, has allowed us to evaluate the therapeutic potential of intranasal irrigation of probiotics in patients with CRS. This treatment administered twice daily for 14 days was well tolerated and resulted in improved chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. Prior to deployment on a larger scale, the safety of this therapy must be confirmed in a healthy population, free of sinus disease. Therefore, this study aims to assess the safety of the use of probiotic intranasal irrigation in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
