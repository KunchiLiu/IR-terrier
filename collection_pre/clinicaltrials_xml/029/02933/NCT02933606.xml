	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, evaluating the effects of BNC210 versus placebo on the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effects of BNC210 on anxiety, depression, global functioning and patient reported outcomes in patients with PTSD. Safety and tolerability of BNC210 will also be assessed. Study participants will receive 12 weeks of blinded treatment followed by a 12 week follow-up period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed and dated informed consent. 2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive. 3. Diagnosed with current PTSD as defined by the CAPS5 for DSM5. 4. Currently not using any medication for PTSD, except for as needed (PRN) use of benzodiazepines (BZD) at a frequency not exceeding 2 days per week in the 3 months prior to Screening. The total dose must not exceed 30 mg/day in diazepam equivalents. 5. Subjects not currently receiving psychotherapy except long term supportive counseling or subjects that have received intensive regular psychotherapy for a minimum of three months prior to Screening. 6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine test at Day 1. Females not of childbearing potential must be postmenopausal (defined as cessation of regular menstrual periods for at least 12 months prior to Screening and confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in menopausal range at Screening). Two effective methods of contraception (double barrier contraception or hormonal contraceptive along with a barrier contraceptive) must be used during the study and for 16 weeks following last study treatment. Contraception that is deemed acceptable in this study includes the following: Condoms Hormonal (includes oral, injected, intrauterine, transdermal, or implanted). Females must be using hormonal contraceptives for at least 3 months prior to randomization and not change the contraceptive during the trial. Surgical sterilization (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy for women or vasectomy for men). Sterilized male patients must be at least 1 year postvasectomy to be considered of nonchild bearing potential. Rhythm methods will not be considered as an effective method of birth control, however, abstinence may be allowed based on the opinion of the Investigator. Requirement for contraception can be waived in certain circumstances (i.e. same sex relationships) if approved by the Sponsor. Males must not donate sperm for at least 16 weeks following last study treatment. 7. In the opinion of the Investigator the participant has a high probability for adherence with and completion of the study, and willing and able to withdraw and refrain from specific therapies. 8. Fluent in English and able to understand and comply with written and verbal protocolrelated requirements. Exclusion Criteria 1. Current and ongoing exposure to the trauma that caused the PTSD. 2. Failed more than three trials of antidepressant medication(s) prescribed for the treatment of PTSD. Each trial must have lasted at least 6 weeks to be considered a failed attempt. 3. The use of antidepressant medication (SSRIs and SNRIs) within 2 weeks of Screening. 4. History of significant traumatic brain injury. 5. Depression as measured by MontgomeryÄsberg depression scale (MADRS) rating &gt; 23. 6. Bipolar and psychotic disorders as identified at Screening using the MINI (V7.0). 7. A score ≥ 7 on the McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSIBPD) at Screening. 8. History of seizure disorders, uncontrolled sleep apnoea or severe neurologic disease 9. Increased risk of suicide, defined as: Any previous suicide attempt disclosed by the participant at Screening using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). Any active suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in the past year, as captured at Screening using the CSSRS. A score &gt; 4 on item 10 of the MADRS at Screening. 10. The use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers within 30 days of Screening. This includes, but is not limited to: carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, barbiturates, phenobarbital, butalbital, St. John's wort, rifampicin, rifabutin, efavirenz, nevirapine, pioglitazone, troglitazone, corticosteroids by the systemic route, grapefruit or grapefruitcontaining products. 11. The use of alprazolam or flunitrazepam within 3 months of Screening. 12. History or presence of impaired renal function, as indicated by clinically significant abnormal creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or moderate to severe renal dysfunction as defined by the CockcroftGault equation (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;50 mL/min). 13. Liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or serum bilirubin (&gt;2x upper limit of normal [ULN]) or history of hepatic cirrhosis. 14. Any clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results at Screening (biochemistry, hematology or urinalysis) as assessed by an Investigator. 15. Fridericiacorrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;460 msec for males and QTcF &gt;480 msec for females as measure by ECG at Screening. 16. Any clinically significant ECG abnormality as determined by the Investigator at Screening. 17. A family history of congenital long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or unexplained sudden cardiac death. 18. Positive result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C (HCV) at Screening. 19. Moderate to severe substance use or alcohol dependence disorder as identified by the DSM5. 20. Participation in an investigational study within 30 days of Screening. 21. Participants involved with ongoing insurance or workplace claims that in the opinion of the Investigator are likely to have an impact on the mental health, presentation or capacity of the patient to engage in the study. 22. Females who are pregnant, nursing, or intend to become pregnant during the study or within 16 weeks of last dose of Investigational Product, or any males who plan to father/conceive a child within 16 weeks of last dose of Investigational Product. 23. Blood or plasma donation or significant blood loss within 60 days of Day 1. 24. Known to have poor peripheral venous access. 25. Subjects that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not suitable to participate in the study due to clinically significant findings from medical history that could interfere with the objectives of the study or put the subject at risk or any other reason, the investigator deems applicable. 26. History of allergies, allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to BNC210 or excipients. 27. BP systolic &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic &gt;90 mmHg.
