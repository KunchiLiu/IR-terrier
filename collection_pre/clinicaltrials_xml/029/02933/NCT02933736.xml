	<brief_summary>In the proposed trial, patients will be administered ribociclib prior to surgical resection of their tumor. Patients will be enrolled in time-intervals sequentially (non-randomized). All patients will be orally-administered 5 doses of LEE011 (900 mg/d) with the final dose occurring at one of 3 intervals before brain tumor resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib (LEE011) in Preoperative Glioma and Meningioma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>900 mg/d is the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), as determined in a recent Novartis-sponsored Phase I study for advanced solid tumor patients. The recommended dose expansion and Phase 2 is 600mg/d for 3 weeks on and 1 week off. Due to drug pharmacokinetics, the MTD (900mg) dose will be used for pre-surgical dosing in order to maximize the opportunity to identify relevant tumor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics endpoints. To assess the PK, PD, and PG endpoints listed above, CSF and brain tumor tissue will be collected intraoperatively (for gliomas, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor tissue will be collected and analyzed separately). Additionally, blood samples will be obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the final ribociclib dose is administered. Patients with tumors demonstrating positive PK, PD, and PG effects will continue treatment with ribociclib (21 days on, 7 days off) after surgery. This will constitute the Phase II component of the study. Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity is observed, or until disease progression as assessed by radiographic or clinical metrics. Preliminary rates of progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas treated with ribociclib will be measured through radiographic and clinical response metrics, specifically Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and investigator discretion. Overall survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas treated with ribociclib will be assessed by medical record review and survival follow up. Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event (CTC AE 4.0) will be utilized to review ribociclib treatment effects in patients with brain tumors. The trough plasma samples of ribociclib will be collected at pre-dosing on each clinical visit day (e.g., days 1, 22, 43, 64...) prior to the administration of ceritinib on that day. Ribociclib will be administered in the clinics on the clinic visit days to ensure the collection of trough level samples.</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 Patients ≥ 18 years of age Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patient has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent. (Written informed consent for the protocol must be obtained prior to any screening procedures. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.) Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests and other procedures. Patients must have recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to ≤ grade 2 (CTCAE v 4.03), provided that concomitant medication is given prior to initiation of treatment with ribociclib. Exception to this criterion: patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the treatment. The following laboratory criteria have been met: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL Platelets ≥100 x 109/L Potassium, total calcium (corrected for serum albumin), magnesium, and sodium within normal limits for the institution or corrected to within normal limits with supplements before first dose of study medication. INR ≤1.5 Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min In the absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN.

History of HIV infection. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance with the protocol. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormalities. Currently receiving any of the following medications and cannot be discontinued 7 days prior to starting study drug: Known strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, including grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids, pummelos, starfruit, and Seville oranges That have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4/5 Herbal preparations/medications, dietary supplements.

History of noncompliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.] Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drugdrug interaction. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.</criteria>
