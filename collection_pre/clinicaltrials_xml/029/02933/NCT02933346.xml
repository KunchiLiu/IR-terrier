	<brief_summary>Our study sought to examine nivolumab efficacy and safety in advanced NSCLC patients treated under the Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU, compassionate use) setting and describe their long-term clinical characteristics, notably the treatments they received after nivolumab discontinuation. The profile of these patients shows greater conformity to that of a non-selected population, yet the clinical data collection does not reflect "real life" conditions and stops when treatment ends, which does not enable us to get an overview of post-immunotherapy treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cohort of Patients With NSCLC Treated With Nivolumab Under the ATU Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the oncogene addiction concept has led to effective targeted treatments for certain histological non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) types, most patients with advanced tumors are still treated with first-line chemotherapy. In 2015, several studiess demonstrated the efficacy of nivolumab, an immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints. In France, besides the clinical trials, this molecule has been made available in January 2015 under a Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU, compassionate use). Our study sought to examine nivolumab efficacy and safety in advanced NSCLC patients treated under the ATU setting and describe their long-term clinical characteristics, notably the treatments they received after nivolumab discontinuation. The profile of these patients shows greater conformity to that of a non-selected population, yet the clinical data collection does not reflect "real life" conditions and stops when treatment ends, which does not enable us to get an overview of post-immunotherapy treatments.</detailed_description>
