	<brief_title>Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) for Oligometastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess quality of life and side effects in participants with up to 5 metastatic cancer lesions treated with a comprehensive oligometastatic SABR treatment program. Secondarily, the investigators will document the disease free and overall survival. Rationale: The oligometastatic state was first defined in 1995 and refers to a stage of disease where cancer has spread beyond the site of origin, but is not yet widely metastatic. In such a state of limited metastatic disease, it is hypothesized that eradication of all sites of metastatic disease could result in long-term survival, or even cure, in some participants. Ablation of metastatic deposits can be achieved through several techniques, including surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or through Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), a new radiotherapy technology that delivers very large, hypofractionated doses of radiotherapy to small tumor targets, with high rates of local control. Clinical evidence to support the presence of an oligometastatic state is controversial. However, there is emerging low quality evidence in both the surgical and SABR literature that this state may exist. In a study of over 5200 participants with lung metastases who underwent surgical resection, a 5-year survival of 36% was reported in participants who achieved a complete resection, much higher than would be expected for stage IV disease.3 Similarly, in participants treated with SABR for 1-3 lung metastases from a variety of primary tumors, local control with SABR was 96% at 2-years, and 2-year survival was 39%. Long-term survival has been demonstrated in participants treated for oligometastases with surgery or SABR at several other tumor sites, including liver, brain, bone, and adrenal metastases. The risk of further metastases after ablative treatment is up to 60-80% in some studies. SABR can also be used for further salvage at newly progressive sites (oligoprogression). Despite the apparent achievement of long-term survival with ablative treatment for oligometastatic disease, the level of evidence to support such treatments is weak, often based on single-arm studies without appropriate controls. Participants included in such reports are highly selected, based on good performance status and slow pace of tumor progression. It has been suggested that the long-term survival achieved with treatment of oligometastases is a result of the selection of fit participants with very slow-growing tumors, rather than the result of treatment intervention. Randomized trials are therefore necessary to establish the utility of ablative treatment of oligometastatic disease, and therefore the BCCA oligometastatic SABR group, recommends that participants be considered for a randomized control before being offered SABR on this current trial. In some circumstances, participants may not be comfortable with this approach, or their physicians do not have clinical equipoise, and therefore SABR for oligometastatic disease may be appropriate. BCCA has decided that given the limited evidence for SABR in this setting, it will not be offered off trial. The main focus of this trial is to assess the side effects and quality of life post SABR. This trial aims to provide a clear informed consent process, including the limited evidence for SABR off trial, and potential harm from SABR, for participants opting to pursue SABR for oligometastases. This is a non-randomized phase II trial where all participants will receive experimental SABR to all sites of metastatic disease. The investigators will accrue 200 participants to assess toxicity associated with this experimental treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able to provide informed consent Histologically confirmed malignancy with metastatic disease detected on imaging. Biopsy of metastasis is preferred, but not required. Maximum 5 metastases Standard of care tests prior to SABR CT simulation within 2 months: Brain CT or MRI imaging (for tumor sites with propensity for brain metastasis) Body imaging: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with bone scan required if no PETCT is performed PETCT is only required for specific evidencebased indications, and in such cases the CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan are not required: MRI spine for participants with vertebral or paraspinal metastases For other indications, at the discretion of the treating oncologists, PETCT scans may be done but are not required. Liver function tests (AST,ALT,GGT, alkaline phosphatase) for participants with liver metastases Tumor marker testing as appropriate (e.g. CEA for colorectal cancer, PSA for prostate cancer, etc) Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age ECOG performance status 02 All sites of disease can be safely treated based on criteria below For nonbrainstem mets, maximum size of 3cm if using single fraction radiosurgery. If size is from 3.1 to 4cm, 2535Gy/5 can be considered with discussions of CNS ROs Maximum size of 6 cm for lesions outside the brain, except: Bone metastases up to 5 cm may be included, if in the opinion of the local PI it can be treated safely (e.g. rib, scapula, pelvis) Life expectancy &gt; 6 months In many scenarios this is best estimated by a multidisciplinary opinion by disease site experts in the site. This is often best obtained by presentation at multidisciplinary tumours rounds. Not a candidate for surgical resection at all sites: surgery to all sites not recommended by multidisciplinary team, or unfit or declining surgery. Not a candidate for a clinical trial that randomizes between SABR and a standard treatment (e.g. SABRCOMET), or physician or participant are uncomfortable with that option. Prior chemotherapy allowed but no chemotherapy (cytotoxic or molecularly targeted agents) 48 hours prior to first fraction of radiotherapy, during radiotherapy, or 48 hours after last fraction. Certain chemotherapy agents may require a longer break prior to or after SABR if protocols dictate. Hormonal therapy during SABR is allowed. The potential treating SABR radiation oncologist reserves the right to require a multidisciplinary note documenting life expectancy, other treatment options and suitability for SABR. Participants with metastases that have been previously treated may be eligible for this SABR protocol: If the previous treatment was by a nonradiation means (e.g. prior resection, RFA or microwave ablation), SABR may be delivered for residual/recurrent disease If the previous treatment was SABR, the participant is not eligible unless it is a new site not previously treated If the previous treatment was conventional RT, SABR could be considered if it can be delivered safely. In such a circumstance it must be presented in a multidisciplinary setting for approval. Serious medical comorbidities precluding radiotherapy Bone metastasis in a femoral bone if risk of pending fracture is high Participants with 13 brain metastasis and no disease elsewhere (these participants should not be accrued but treated with stereotactic radiotherapy as per results of published randomized trials) Complete response to firstline chemotherapy (i.e. no measurable target for SABR) Malignant pleural effusion Inability to treat all sites of active disease with ablative intent Clinical or radiological evidence of spinal cord compression Dominant brain metastasis requiring surgical decompression Pregnant or lactating women</criteria>
