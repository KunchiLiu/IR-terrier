	<brief_summary>The Investigator hypothesize that a single dose of patiromer will lower serum potassium levels in less than 6hrs. Since a dosage of 30g/day for a period of 4 weeks has been studied in at least two multicenter randomized controlled trials, the Investigator further hypothesize that a single dose of 25.2g of patiromer will be well tolerated in hyperkalemic patients in the Emergency Department setting. The FDA approved dosage of 25.2g is appropriate for this study because the research staff will enroll patients with moderate (K greater than 6 mEq/L) to severe hyperkalemia, and the higher dosage has typically been used in this population for more effective control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relypsa For ED Acute Hyperkalemia Control and Reduction (REDUCE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label pilot study. Thirty patients with ESRD who qualify for emergent dialysis on the basis of serum potassium greater than 6mEq/L will be randomly assigned, using a random number generator in blocks of sixes, to standard-of-care (standard care) or patiromer group. Patients in the patiromer group will be given a single dose of 25.2g of patiromer in addition to standard-of-care treatment after randomization. Standard-of-care is defined as intervention or care provided by clinical provider according to individual practice pattern or hospital protocol. Each group of 15 patients will be observed with telemetry monitoring for 10 hours or till hemodialysis units become available for treatment (whichever comes first). Blood draws and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed at enrollment and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10hrs thereafter. Serum will be analyzed for basic metabolic panel and magnesium. Medications, including potassium lowering agents, administered during this period will be documented. 1. Informed consent will be obtained. 2. Subject will be randomized. 3. A. Randomized to Standard of Care (SOC): data will be collected on SOC treatment. 3. B. Randomized to patiromer group: subjects will receive a single dose of 25.2g of patiromer. SOC data will be collected. 4. all subjects will have blood drawn and ECGs (1 12 lead ECG and 1 Lead I Rhythm strip) done at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours. Blood will be analyzed for basic metabolic panel and magnesium. 5. CRF completion-SOC data will be recorded in addition to current medications. 6. After subjects have received hemodialysis or reach the 10 hour study period, whichever comes first, the subject will be completed on the study.</detailed_description>
