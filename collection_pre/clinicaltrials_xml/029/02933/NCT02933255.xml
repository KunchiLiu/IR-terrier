	<brief_summary>Background: The immune system is the cells and organs in the body that recognize and fight infection and cancer. The PROSTVAC vaccine might teach the immune system to find and kill certain prostate cancer cells. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are drugs that allow the immune system to fight tumors. They might help PROSTVAC work better. Objective: To test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of PROSTVAC, nivolumab, and ipilimumab. To test this for people with castrate resistant prostate cancer and then for other people with prostate cancer. Eligibility: Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer Design: Participants will be screened with: - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood and urine tests - Electrocardiogram - Bone scan - CT scan or MRI - Tumor sample. This may be from a previous procedure. All participants will get a combination of the study drugs over 8 weeks. They will have 1 visit for the initial injection then 3 booster injection visits. Blood will be tested at these visits. Over the next 4 weeks, some participants will have: - An exam of the large intestine through the rectum. - CT and bone scans - Standard hormonal treatment - Option to continue treatment every 3 weeks if their disease does not get worse. They will be have scans every 12 weeks. Other participants will have surgery to remove the prostate in week 9. Participants will have a safety visit about a month after their last treatment. This will include a physical exam, blood tests, and possibly scans. If their cancer progresses, participants will leave the study and may enroll in a long-term follow-up study. They will be contacted once a year to ask about their cancer and treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PROSTVAC in Combination With Nivolumab and/or Ipilimumab in Men With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Immune checkpoint inhibitors interfere with the immune system s autoregulatory mechanisms, allowing for a potentially expanded and prolonged T-cell response with the possibility of greater antitumor effects. - Ipilimumab, a fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, is a first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor. CTLA-4 is expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) after activation by APCs. - Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 protein. Specifically, the antibody binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including anti-tumor immune response. - PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for prostate cancer. Early studies have demonstrated immunologic efficacy and suggested clinical benefit. A phase III trial has completed accrual. - A previous study combining the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and PROSTVAC suggested greater efficacy than PROSTVAC alone. Additional studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of ipilimumab and a second immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. - This study will aim to evaluate the impact of immunologic combinations on the tumor microenvironment focusing on immune cell infiltration as the primary endpoint. - US-MRI imaging technology will be employed to sample the tumor before treatment and after radical prostatectomy. - The findings from this study could serve as the basis for future studies with these combinations in this population of patients and more advanced disease. Objectives: -Safety (For castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) lead-in cohort) Evaluate changes in T-cell infiltration in the tumor after neoadjuvant treatment with PROSTVAC and ipilimumab, and PROSTVAC and nivolumab, relative to changes seen with PROSTVAC, ipilimumab and nivolumab (For all other cohorts). Eligibility: - Patients must have histopathological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate prior to starting this study and evaluable biopsy tissue (e.g., unstained slides or blocks) available for analysis. - For the castration resistant lead in cohort, if histopathological documentation is unavailable, a rising PSA and a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer would be acceptable. - Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria. - Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy): - Granulocyte count 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count 100,000/mm^3 - Hgb greater than or equal to 8 g/dL - Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy): - Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl (OR in patients with Gilbert s syndrome, total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL), AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 times upper limit of normal. - Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN Design: - The primary focus of this study will be to evaluate PROSTVAC, ipilimumab and nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting. - Lead-in cohort evaluating the safety and tolerability of this combination in the castration resistant setting (CRPC cohort) - This cohort will undergo sigmoidoscopies at 9 weeks to evaluate for any rectal inflammation or colitis which may pose a problem for men in the neoadjuvant cohorts undergoing radical prostatectomy (done at 9 weeks on study). - Following this lead-in cohort in the CRPC setting, we will enroll three sequential cohorts in the neoadjuvant setting. - The first cohort will evaluate the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab. The second cohort will evaluate the combination of PROSTVAC and ipilimumab. The final cohort will evaluate the combination of all three. - The lead-in safety cohort will require 10 patients and Cohorts A through C will require 48 evaluable patients. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set to 65 patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: For all cohorts except the CRPC lead in cohort, patients must have histopathological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate prior to starting this study and evaluable biopsy tissue (e.g., unstained slides or blocks) available for analysis. If evaluable tissue is not available, the patient must agree to undergo a prevaccination prostate biopsy on study. For the CRPC lead in cohort, if histopathological documentation is unavailable, a rising PSA and a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer would be acceptable. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of PROSTVAC in combination with nivolumab, ipilimumab or both in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.
