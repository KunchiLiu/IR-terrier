	<brief_summary>Cesarean scar diverticula (CSD) is a novel recognized cause of postmenstrual abnormal uterine bleeding in women. No clinical guidelines have been issued for the management of CSD. Currently, several limited surgical management procedures for CSD have been reported, such as hysteroscopic combined with laparoscopic excision (abbreviated as hysteroscope + laparoscope) and vaginal repair of CSD (abbreviated as VR). However, which management can achieve better clinical effects remains unknown. Therefore, this prospective study is designed to compare the therapeutic effects between VR and hysteroscope + laparoscope in the treatment of CSD.</brief_summary>
