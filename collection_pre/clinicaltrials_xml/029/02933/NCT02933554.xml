	<brief_summary>Obesity is an epidemic in the US. With progression of obesity, Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been a growing public health issue. Presently there is no cure for NASH.Prevention of progression of fibrosis in NASH is crucial, as they are at a high risk for cirrhosis and may need liver transplant. Recent studies have shown that blocking blood vessels to a particular portion of the stomach (bariatric or left gastric artery embolization) can temporarily decrease levels of the appetite inducing hormone ghrelin, and result in weight loss.The purpose of this study is to determine if Left gastric artery embolization (LGAE) in patients with obesity and NASH leads to clinically significant weight loss with improvement of NASH.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity:In adults, obesity is defined as a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m2. It is estimated that, by the year 2030, 38% of the world's adult population will be overweight and another 20% obese.An expert panel convened by the NIH stated that for the first time in history, the steadily improving worldwide life expectancy could level off or even decline, as the result of increasing obesity. NAFLD and NASH: The Problem: Obesity is a chronic disease that is strongly associated with a number of diseases with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) has been established as risk factor for primary nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) .In the US, recent estimates suggest that NAFLD affects 30% of the general population, 90% of the morbidly obese . NAFLD can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in up to 25% . Of patients with NASH progression of fibrosis is seen in 26-37% and progressing to cirrhosis in 9-25 % . NASH cirrhosis can result in liver failure, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) . Current options in management of NASH: The goal of managing NASH is to eliminate risk factors and preventing fibrosis by treating metabolic syndrome, primarily obesity [10]. Although dietary modification and exercise can achieve weight loss, this is difficult to sustain . Very few effective medical therapies are available, and are associated with adverse effects. Although weight loss after bariatric surgery has demonstrated histological improvement in NASH, a recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient data to determine if bariatric surgery is an effective treatment. Also high mortality rates are seen post-bariatric surgery. Thus a safe and effective minimally invasive option is needed. Based on currently available data, Left gastric artery embolization (LGAE) appears effective in inducing weight loss of about 10.5% in 3-6 months, with a high safety profile. In patients with NAFLD, a 3-5% weight loss is thought to improve steatosis, 7- 10% may be needed to improve necroinflammation. Thus, LGAE has the potential to reverse the histology of NASH to prevent progression to cirrhosis, HCC and its sequale.</detailed_description>

Contraindications to obtaining a liver biopsy Subjects with preexisting abdominal pain will be excluded (because of the potential confusion with pain related to the procedure). Subjects who are intolerant to PPIs Subjects requiring any anticoagulant medications should be excluded. Subjects who are taking aspirin/ NSAIDs and in whom these medications are unable to be withdrawn from aspirin and NSAIDs for at least 3 days prior to the LGAE procedure and for 30 days following the LGAE procedure (because of the potential risks of gastric bleeding following the procedure). Presence of systemic illness or other medical conditions relevant to survival .(Note that in the HCC pre liver transplant cohort, the presence of HCC will not be considered an exclusion criteria) Metastatic cancer Evidence of decompensated liver disease (uncontrolled ascites, or uncontrolled spontaneous encephalopathy) Prior surgical weight loss procedures including gastroplasty, jejunoileal, or jejunocolic bypass, total parenteral nutrition within the past 6 months; Prior history of gastric pancreatic, hepatic, and/or splenic surgery Prior embolization to the stomach, spleen or liver. If review of available prior imaging studies (i.e CT, MRI, or US)shows potential anatomical variations, presence of severe atheromatous disease, large arteriovenous shunting of blood. Abnormal Endoscopy large sliding hiatal hernia or paraesophageal hernia, active peptic ulcer disease, active H. pylori infection History of abnormal Nuclear Gastric Motility examinationdefined as delayed emptying of gastric contents &gt; 90%, 60% and 10% at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours respectively.
