	<brief_summary>Remifentanil is a potent opioid widely used during the administration of general anesthesia. There is a lot of evidence that suggest that the used of remifentanil is associated with the development of hyperalgesia (a reduction of nociceptive thresholds). However, the mechanism of this hyperalgesia is not fully understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the disruption of the Cl- homeostasis could be involved. Interestingly, this was prevented in a murine model with the administration of Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. In our clinical trial we will try to determine if the preoperative administration of acetazolamide could prevent the hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil in patients scheduled for thyroidectomy with general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
