	<brief_summary>Rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhea in children worldwide. Oral rotavirus vaccines work remarkably well in high-income countries, but for unclear reasons they underperform in low-income countries. A double-blind, randomized control trial will be performed to evaluate whether using a higher dose of a currently licensed vaccine (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline) can improve immune responses among infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Infants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a standard or a double dose of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks of life. Infants will be assessed for fecal vaccine shedding and serum rotavirus-specific IgA responses to determine vaccine immunogenicity.</brief_summary>
