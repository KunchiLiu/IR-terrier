	<brief_title>IVES for Treatment of UUI and OAB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EMED Technologies detrusetTM intravesical electrical stimulation (IVES) catheter is indicated for use with the EMED detrusanTM 500 electrical generator for the treatment of overactive bladder and urge urinary incontinence (UI) in women who are not satisfied with or cannot tolerate other conservative treatments. EMED is interested in conducting a prospective randomized multi-center study of IVES therapy vs conventional UI treatments. In order to gain sufficient knowledge of the treatment effect and variability of IVES therapy to power an RCT, a pilot study will be initially conducted. The pilot study is intended to show the efficacy of IVES in treating overactive bladder with or without frequency and/or urgency urinary incontinence with safety profile of IVES being no worse than with standard urological catheters. A primary endpoint at 3 months showing reduction in incontinence events via a 7-level patient global impression of improvement will be established. Secondary endpoints will include PCI for subsets of symptoms, 3 day voiding diary, and patient satisfaction questionnaires. Follow up at end of therapy and 3 months from the first therapy session will be conducted. 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month follow up can be conducted to establish durability of IVES therapy if it is found to be effective at 3 months after the first treatment</detailed_description>
