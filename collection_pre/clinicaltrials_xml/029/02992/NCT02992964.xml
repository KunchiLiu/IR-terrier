	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, pilot study of Nivolumab in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory hypermutant malignancies aged 12 months to 18 years of age. This study is to assess clinical and radiological benefits of treatment with Nivolumab in children with hypermutated cancers, including those with bMMRD syndrome. It is our expectation that patients with bMMRD syndrome will account for the majority of patients enrolled on this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt; 18 years of age at the time of study enrollment. 2. Patients must have had histologic verification of malignancy at the time of diagnosis and/or at relapse. 3. Patients must have recurrent or refractory tumour. All tumour types are eligible (including malignant hematological conditions), as long as other criteria are met. 4. Patients must have evidence of biallelic mismatch repair deficiency either in their tumour tissue (by immunohistochemistry or sequencing) or in their germline (by sequencing) and/or evidence of hypermutant malignancy by whole exome sequencing with a mutation load &gt; 100 per exome. 5. Patients must have either measurable or evaluable disease. 6. Patients with multiple concurrent and or sequential neoplasms (e.g. glioblastoma and colon cancer) are eligible. 7. Patient's current disease state must be one for which there is no known curative therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life.. 8. Karnofsky ≥ 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky ≥ 60 for patients ≤ 16 years of age (See Appendix I for the KarnofskyLansky Scores). Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score. 9. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer therapy: Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy: at least 21 days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior Nitrosourea). Hematopoietic Growth Factors: At least 14 days after the last dose of a longacting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for shortacting growth factor. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study sponsor. Biologic (Antineoplastic Agent): at least 14 days after the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 14 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study sponsor. Monoclonal Antibodies: at least 3 halflives of the antibody after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody. XRT: at least 14 days after local palliative XRT (small port); At least 150 days must have elapsed if prior Total Body Irradiation (TBI), craniospinal XRT or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis; At least 42 days must have elapsed if other substantial BM radiation. Stem Cell Infusion without TBI: no evidence of active graft vs. host disease and at least 56 days must have elapsed after transplant or stem cell infusion. Patients with prior allogeneic transplants are not eligible. 10. Patients must not have received prior exposure to antiPD1 orantiPDL1 agents 11. Organ Function Requirements 1. Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined as: For patients with solid tumours without known bone marrow involvement: Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 0.75 x 109/L or 750/mm3, Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L or 75,000/mm3 , Hgb ≥ 90 g/L (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment) Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided they meet haematological criteria; patients may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red blood cell or platelet transfusions. These patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. 2. Adequate Renal Function Defined as: A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: Age Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female 1 to &lt; 2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to &lt; 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to &lt; 10 years 1 1 10 to &lt; 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to &lt; 16 years 1.5 1.4 ≥ 16 years 1.7 1.4 Table 4. The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula (Schwartz and Gauthier 1985) for estimating GFR utilizing child length and stature data published by CDC. 3. Adequate Liver Function Defined as: • Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (except for patients with Gilbert Syndrome, who must have total bilirubin less than 51 µmol/L or 3.0 mg/dL). • ALT/AST ≤ 2.5 ULN for patients without liver metastases ≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver metastases For the purpose of this study, the ULN for ALT is 45 U/L, for AST 52 U/L. 4. Adequate Pulmonary Function Defined as: No history of chronic pulmonary disease (such as Cystic Fibrosis) and no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to pulmonary insufficiency and a pulse oximetry &gt; 92% on room air. 5. Adequate Pancreatic Function Defined as: Serum lipase ≤ ULN. Patients with glucose intolerance should be on a stable regimen and be monitored. 3. Pregnancy or BreastFeeding Pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as there is yet no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)* must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 1 week prior to the start of Nivolumab. WOCBP who are sexually active must be willing to adhere to effective contraception** during treatment and for 23 weeks after the last dose of Nivolumab. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must be willing to adhere to effective contraception** during treatment and for 31 weeks after the last dose of the study drug. Women, who are surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception. "Women of childbearing potential" is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. List of contraception methods is provided in the Appendix II 4. Concomitant Medications Corticosteroids: Patients requiring daily systemic immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids (&gt; 2mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent) are not eligible. Patients must not have received systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to enrollment. Note: Use of topical, ocular, intraarticular, intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids will not render a patient ineligible. Physiological replacement doses of systemic steroids can be permitted even if &gt; 10mg/day prednisone equivalent. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of nonautoimmune conditions (eg, delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted if completed at least 7 days prior to initiation of therapy. Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible. Anticancer Agents: patients who are currently receiving other anticancer agents are not eligible. 5. Patients with the History of Autoimmune Disease: patients with a history of any Grade autoimmune disorder are not eligible. Asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities (e.g. ANA, rheumatoid factor, altered thyroid function studies) will not render a patient ineligible in the absence of a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder. Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger. 6. Hypothyroidism: patients with ≥ Grade 2 hypothyroidism due to history of autoimmunity are not eligible. Note: patients with residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, or hypothyroidism due to previous irradiation or thyroidectomy will be permitted. 7. Infection: patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible. 8. HIV and/or Hepatitis B/C Patients: patients with known HIV/AIDS or acute/chronic hepatitis B or C are excluded. 9. Transplant Patients: patients who have received prior allogeneic bone marrow transplants or prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible. 10. NonCompliance: patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible. 11. Previous antiPD1 and/or antiPDL1 therapy: Patients who have received prior antiPD1 and/or antiPDL1 directed therapy (mAb or small molecule) are not eligible</criteria>
