	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection is an infection at a place in the body where surgery has taken place, and has been reported in around 5% of people undergoing an operation. In vascular surgery, infection rates are as high as 30%. Methods to reduce this rate of infection should be investigated thoroughly for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The investigators aim to conduct a research trial examining one such method. Leukomed Sorbact is a wound dressing coated with a chemical (DACC) derived from spider-silk that interacts with, and binds bacteria, causing them to be mechanically removed from a wound when the dressing is changed.The trial aims to compare the effectiveness of this dressing to a standard, non-coated dressing, in the reduction of surgical site infection. 712 patients from a number of centres across the UK will be recruited to this study. Adult patients who are having a vascular surgery operation will be approached for entry into the trial. The trial will be explained to them, as well as an explanation that participation is voluntary and their operation or other aspects of their care will not be impacted in any way should participants not wish to participate. Participants will be randomised by computer into one of two groups - one group whose wounds are dressed with Leukomed Sorbact, and the other whose wounds are dressed with a standard dressing. Patients will be followed up at 5-7 days and 30 days, and at 1 year. At the follow up, their wounds will be inspected for infection, and participants will be asked to complete short questionnaires measuring quality of life. The trial will aim to answer a number of questions, with the primary question being does a DACC coated dressing applied after an operation reduce the risk of an infection at the surgery site? It will also ask whether this treatment is cost-effective and whether it promotes satisfactory healing.</brief_summary>
