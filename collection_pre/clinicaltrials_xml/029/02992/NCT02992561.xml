	<brief_summary>Heightened levels of aggression are fuelling violent incidents at all levels, especially in post-war regions. Narrative Exposure Therapy for Forensic Offender Rehabilitation (FORNET) aims to address trauma symptoms along with reactive and instrumental/appetitive aggression to encounter the downward cycle of perpetration and enforce a sustainable (re-)integration into civil life. In the present study, the investigators provide an adapted version of FORNET to former combatants in the North Kivu, Eastern DR Congo. Structured baseline, 3 and 6 month follow up interviews will be administered to assess the main outcome measures recent violent acts and appetitive aggression.</brief_summary>
