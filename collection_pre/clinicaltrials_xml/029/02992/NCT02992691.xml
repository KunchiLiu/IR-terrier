	<brief_title>Efficacy of Three Experimental Toothpastes to Remove Plaque</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single centre, controlled, examiner blind, five treatment, five period, crossover design study in healthy participants. This study will evaluate the dose response of three experimental toothpastes (test product 1, test product 2 and test product 3) to remove plaque after a single brushing, compared to a positive control and negative control dentifrice. Plaque removal efficacy will be measured by Turesky modification of Quigley Hein Plaque Index (TPI).</detailed_description>
