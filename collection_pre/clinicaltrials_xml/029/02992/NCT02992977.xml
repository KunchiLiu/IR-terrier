	<brief_summary>This is an open-label Phase 1 study to determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of single-agent treatment with AutoSynVax™ vaccine in subjects with advanced cancer and a life expectancy of ≥6 months. A minimum of 6 (≤20) subjects will be enrolled to receive biweekly subcutaneous injection of 240 μg AutoSynVax™ vaccine + 50 μg QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant for up to 1 year.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of advanced cancer that is refractory to standard therapies. 2. No curative therapy exists and subject has received appropriate therapy known to be associated with clinical benefit for the condition, if it exists. 3. Minimum estimated life expectancy of 6 months in the absence of further treatment. 4. Age 18 years or older. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;2. 6. Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥1,500/mm3; absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] ≥500/mm3; platelet count 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal [IULN], total bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL), and adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;1.5 x IULN). 7. Adequate cardiac function (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class ≤II). 8. Available tissue from an archival tissue sample or tissue from a biopsy done during the initial screen, or both. 9. All participants must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. 10. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following intervals before first administration of study drug: 1. ≤14 days for chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy. Subjects must also not have had radiation pneumonitis as a result of treatment, and cannot participate in the study if they are on chronic corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. A 1week washout is permitted for palliative radiation to nonCNS disease with sponsor approval. Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted medications. Novel imaging agents that have Phase 1 safety data and have not demonstrated therapeutic activity are also permitted. 2. ≤28 days for a prior immunotherapy. 3. ≤28 days for prior monoclonal antibody used for anticancer therapy with the exception of denosumab. 4. ≤7 days for immunosuppressivebased treatment for any reason. Systemic corticosteroids are not allowed. Note: Use of inhaled or topical corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures is permitted. Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved after consultation with the sponsor. 5. ≤28 days before the first dose for all other investigational study drugs or devices. 2. Receipt of other investigational agents or other anticancer therapies during treatment with AutoSynVax™ vaccine. 3. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or actively receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 4. Corticosteroid dependency. 5. Requirement for immunosuppressive medication aside from corticosteroids. 6. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy are an exception to this rule. Subjects who require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections will not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study. 7. Brain metastases or leptomeningeal spread of disease. 8. Known endocrinopathies. 9. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. 10. Known medical, psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would preclude participation in the study. 11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 12. Known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Testing is not required in the absence of history or high index of suspicion. 13. Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 14. Intolerance of prior immunotherapy treatment necessitating cessation of therapy. 15. History of intolerance or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to AutoSynVax™ vaccine or QS21 Stimulon® adjuvant. 16. Inability to comply with protocol.</criteria>
