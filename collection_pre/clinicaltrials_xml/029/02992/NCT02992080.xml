	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to assess miRNAs expression profiles in the circuling blood of patients with cystic fibrosis and highlight "signatures" that could reflect the pulmonary status of patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Small Circulating RNA as Molecular Markers of Lung Disease in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this project is to study the circulating miRNA profiles in 40 patients with cystic fibrosis and 40 healthy individuals to assess whether these biomolecules could be used as markers of the pulmonary disease in cystic fifbosis. Moreover by comparing miRNAs expression level between Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with severe (n=20) or moderate (n=20) pulmonary impairment, we want to assess whether some of these miRNAs may be used as markers for the severity of CF pulmonary disease. The identification of sensitive and early markers, from a non-invasive sampling could enable more effective and early treatment of CF patients</detailed_description>
