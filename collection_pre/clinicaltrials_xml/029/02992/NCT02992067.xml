	<brief_title>CK19 Combined With Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound: a Prediction System on Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The feasibility and predictive accuracy of peripheral blood CK19mRNA and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of axillary lymph nodes metastasis in breast cancer were verified by the data of specimen bank; to establish the evaluation system of predicting the lymph node status based on CK19 and CEUS, validate the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and ROC curve of the system model and use Youden index, negative likelihood ratio, positive likelihood ratio to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency.</detailed_description>
