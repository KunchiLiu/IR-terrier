	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is investigate the immunogenicity and safety of CYD dengue vaccine and Tdap vaccine when both vaccines are administered concomitantly or sequentially. Primary Objectives: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response to the Tdap booster dose concomitantly administered with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine as compared to sequential administration, measured 28 days after Tdap booster dose - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response to the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine concomitantly administered with Tdap as compared to sequential administration, measured 28 days after the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine. Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine with the first dose concomitantly administered with Tdap as compared to sequential administration, measured 28 days after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine. - To describe the humoral immune response at baseline and 28 days after the first and third doses of CYD dengue vaccine, in each and any group. - To describe the humoral immune response of Tdap vaccine at baseline and 28 days after concomitant administration with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine as compared to the sequential administration, in each and any group. - To describe the safety of the CYD dengue vaccine and of the Tdap booster dose after each and any injection in each group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Administered Concomitantly or Sequentially With Adacel® in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive the CYD dengue vaccine according to a 3-dose schedule to be administered 6 months apart, with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered either concomitantly or sequentially with a booster dose of the Tdap vaccine, Adacel®. They will be assessed for immunogenicity and safety.</detailed_description>
