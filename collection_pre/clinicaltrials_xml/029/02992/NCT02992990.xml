	<brief_title>Bladder Tumor Biopsy Study to Improve Preoperative Determination of Stage and Grade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive bladder cancer is challenging to treat because it is a condition characterized by frequent recurrences that lead to numerous invasive procedures for detection and treatment. The mainstay of therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which has remained unchanged for decades, relies on surgical resection (TUR) associated with utilization of intravesical immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite our best efforts, these tumors continue to have suboptimal rates of recurrence and require long-term follow-up with costly and invasive procedures. The rationale for this study is to show that the preoperative biopsy, taken at the time of the office cystoscopic evaluation, improves pre-TUR staging and grading correlation with the final pathology of the resection. Indirectly, this will suggest that the routine use of pre-TUR biopsy provides more accurate information for intraoperative decision-making that can ultimately lead to better management of these patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</detailed_description>
