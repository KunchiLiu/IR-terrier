	<brief_summary>This study aimed to observe whether a hydrolyzed oyster extract improves liver health in participants whose alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are1-3 fold above the normal. A total of 96 participants will be randomly allocated to active (oyster) or placebo group (1:1). Each group will receive 750 mg of oyster extract or placebo per day for 8 weeks. Primary outcome will be the change in ALT level and secondary outcomes will be; (1) ratios of participants with normal ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT); (2) the change in serum bilirubin; (3) the change in multi-dimensional fatigue inventory; (4) the changes in serum lipids; (5) the changes in antioxidant enzymes.</brief_summary>
