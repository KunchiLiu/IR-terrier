	<brief_title>Effects of the NO-synthase Inhibitor VAS203 on Renal Function in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analysis of the effect of i.v. VAS203 on renal function and perfusion in healthy subjects. Primary objective: Possible adverse effect of VAS203 on the Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) and the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) during and after 6 hours of constant-rate iv. infusion of 10 mg/kg VAS203. Secondary objective: To analyse the effects of VAS203 on - filtration fraction - hemodynamics (afferent and efferent resistance, intraglomerular pressure) - markers of kidney injury and renal function - systolic, mean and diastolic brachial blood pressure - Plasma PK of VAS203 and its first metabolite.</detailed_description>
