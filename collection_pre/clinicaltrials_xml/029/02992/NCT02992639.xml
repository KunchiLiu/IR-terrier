	<brief_summary>To investigate weight loss effect with mild calorie restriction on circulating levels of liver enzymes in nondiabetic and overweight subjects with high visceral fat area [visceral fat area (VFA) at L4 ≥ 100 cm²].</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weight Loss Effect on Circulating Liver Enzymes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 80 nondiabetic and overweight subjects with high VFA. The participants divided into two groups: 12-week mild calorie restriction (a 300 kcal/day intake reduction, n=40) or no treatment (control, n=40). The randomization was according to computer-generated block randomization (placebo:test = 1:1). Before and after intervention period, venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects, and biochemical parameters including circulating liver enzymes were measured.</detailed_description>
