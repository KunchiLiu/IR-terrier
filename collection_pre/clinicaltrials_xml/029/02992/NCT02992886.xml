	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy With Raltitrexed for Intermediate or Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer in the Fit Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concurrent chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients with intermediate or locally advanced rectal cancer. However, the data from prospective trial for elderly patients is still lacking. The aim of this multicenter phase II study is to evaluate the response rate, local control, disease-free survival and treatment-related toxicity of preoperative chemoradiation with Raltitrexed for intermediate or locally advanced rectal cancer in the fit elderly aged 70 years above. And all the participants have to be evaluated by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Clinical stage was evaluated by chest and abdominal computed tomography, endorectal ultrasound, and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. 5 weeks after the preCRT, the multi-disciplinary team decided the following treatment of patients based on imaging evaluation. Surgical resection would be done with a minimum interval of 6 weeks after the last radiation. Acute toxicity was evaluated during and within 2 weeks after CRT. Toxicities were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Sample size consideration.It has been calculated that 68 patients will need to be included, according to the following assumptions: Recruitment period of 24 months. Minimum follow-up period of 24 months. We estimated that 51 patients were required to test the hypothesis that the 2-year DFS was equal to or greater than 78% with 80% power and to reject the hypothesis that the 2-year DFS rate was less than 63% at a significance level of 5% (one sided).Taking into account that a 5% percentage of losses, 20% of patients will refuse surgery, 68 patients are expected to be included in the study. The intermediate analysis design. An intermediate safety evaluation will be carried out when 39 patients have finished their preoperative CRT. We estimated that 39 patients were required to test the hypothesis that the G3 or higher acute toxicities rate was equal to or less than 21% with 80% power and to reject the hypothesis that G3 or higher toxicities rate was more than 36% at a significance level of 10% (one sided). Biospecimen Retention. Blood, plasma, feces and tissue (optional). Feces were collected before any treatment. Peripheral blood samples of 10-20mL were collected from the patients for CTCs analysis, exploration analysis for frailty and tumor marker before and after preCRT, before and after surgery, and then on each follow up visit, according to our study protocal.</detailed_description>
