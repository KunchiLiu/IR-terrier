	<brief_summary>Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the world, estimated nationally at 14.7%. Genotype 4 (and subtype 4a in particular) dominates the HCV epidemic in Egypt. For decades the antiviral therapy of chronic HCV infection was based on the administration of Interferon(IFN), initially alone and then in combination with Ribavirin (RBV), but this regimen was effective in only 50% of patients with genotype 1, with significant side effects.</brief_summary>

Genotype 4 (and subtype 4a in particular) dominates the HCV epidemic in Egypt. For decades the antiviral therapy of chronic HCV infection was based on the administration ofInterferon(IFN), initially alone and then in combination with Ribavirin (RBV), but this regimen was effective in only 50% of patients with genotype 1, with significant side effects. The introduction of direct acting antiviral agents, in particular sofosbuvir (SOF), has revolutionized the treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus.</detailed_description>
