	<brief_summary>This two-part, Phase 1 protocol will be the first clinical study of ABI-H0731. Part I will be a Phase 1a dose-ranging assessment of ABI-H0731 in healthy adult volunteers. If the dose-related safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABI-H0731 in human volunteers are deemed satisfactory, then the study will advance to Part II, a Phase 1b dose-ranging assessment of ABI-H0731 in non-cirrhotic, CHB patients.</brief_summary>
