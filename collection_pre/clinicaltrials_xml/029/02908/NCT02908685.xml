	<brief_summary>Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of RO7034067 in adult and pediatric patients with Type 2 and Type 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study consists of two parts, an exploratory dose finding part (Part 1) of RO7034067 for 12-weeks and a confirmatory part (Part 2) of RO7034067 for 24-months.</brief_summary>
