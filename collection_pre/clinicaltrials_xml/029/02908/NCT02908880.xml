	<brief_summary>Research study which tests the safety and effectiveness of a new vascular closure device to close the femoral access puncture that is created in patients who require this form of access in order to perform the planned procedure. The MANTA device is expected to seal the femoral access puncture in less than 1 minute. This may result in less blood loss and a shorter time to walking compared to alternative closure means. Use of the MANTA device in this study is experimental. All other parts of the procedure involve standard medical care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MANTA Vascular Closure Device Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MANTA device is a VCD intended for use in catheterization laboratories following percutaneous cardiac or peripheral procedures that use the retrograde common femoral artery access route for large bore (10‐18F ID) interventional devices. The function of MANTA is to percutaneously close the puncture in the artery wall (arteriotomy) through which the catheters were inserted for the procedure. The study is being conducted o demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of MANTA in achieving hemostasis in femoral arterial access sites in subjects undergoing percutaneous transcatheter interventional procedures using a large-bore procedure sheath.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Candidate for elective or planned (i.e., not emergent or urgent) percutaneous transcatheter interventional procedure via a 1018F size retrograde common femoral artery approach (i.e., transcatheter aortic valve implantation [TAVI], endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR], Impella® use) 2. Vessel size would allow for access for the MANTA device as determined by baseline CTA: minimum vessel diameter 5mm for the 14F MANTA and 6mm for the 18F MANTA 3.

Allergy to bovine materials or any other device material, including collagen and/or collagen products, polyglycolic or polylactic acid, stainless steel or nickel 8. Femoral artery puncture in target groin within the prior 14 days 9. Previous iliofemoral intervention in region of access site, including but not limited to prior atherectomy, stenting, surgical or grafting procedures in the access area 10. Patients who have undergone use of an intraaortic balloon pump through the arterial access site within 30 days prior to the baseline evaluation 11. Patients who are not mobile and are confined to a wheelchair or bed 12. NYHA class IV heart failure 13. Patients who have already participated in the IDE study 14. Currently participating in another clinical trial of an unapproved investigational device or drug that has not concluded the followup period 15. Patient cannot adhere to or complete the investigational protocol for any reason including but not limited to geographical residence, psychiatric condition or life threatening disease</criteria>
