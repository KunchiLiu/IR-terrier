	<detailed_description>Randomized, controlled pilot study with a convenience sample of 45 adult cardiac surgical patients. The main intervention to be studied will be the use of a neurocognitive training program (Lumosity) for 10 days preoperatively, and then for four weeks postoperatively. The prescribed regimen of training will focus on the areas of cognitive function most commonly affected in the postoperative period, including working memory, attention, and processing speed. Patients in the control arm will undergo current standard cardiac surgical postoperative care and will be asked to refrain from obtaining a Lumosity account.</detailed_description>
