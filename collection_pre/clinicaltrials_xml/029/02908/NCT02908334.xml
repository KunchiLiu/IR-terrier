	<brief_summary>In this study patients will be randomized 1:2 to receive either standard of care treatment or standard of care + Sertraline 200mg/day for 2 weeks, then 400 mg/day for 50 weeks for treatment of disseminated and meningeal coccidioidomycosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sertraline in Addition to Standard of Care Treatment for Coccidioidomycosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sertraline has been demonstrated to have in-vitro activity against coccidioides, and in-vivo activity against cryptococcal meningitis in clinical trials. Disseminated and meningeal coccidiodes infections require lifelong treatment, have poor outcomes, and new treatment options are needed. In this study the investigators will determine safety and tolerability of adjunctive sertraline (grade 4-5 adverse reactions) compared to standard coccidioidomycosis therapy alone.</detailed_description>
