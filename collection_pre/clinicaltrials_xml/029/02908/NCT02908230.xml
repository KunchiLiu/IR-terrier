	<brief_summary>The primary aims of this research project are to: 1. Evaluate the efficacy of Camp NERF to improve child nutrition, physical activity, mental health, and anthropometric outcomes. 2. Evaluate the efficacy of Camp NERF to improve caregiver self-efficacy for establishing healthy family nutrition and physical activity practices, amount of physical activity, and BMI. 3. Evaluate the efficacy of Camp NERF to improve youth mentor nutrition, physical activity, and anthropometric outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Camp NERF: Methods of a Summer Nutrition Ed Rec &amp; Fitness Program to Prevent Unhealthy Weight Gain in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The number of obese children in the US remains high, which is problematic due to the mental, physical, and academic effects of obesity on child health. Data indicate that school-age children, particularly underserved children, experience unhealthy gains in BMI at a rate nearly twice as fast during the summer months. Few efforts have been directed at implementing evidence-based programming to prevent excess weight gain during the summer recess. Methods: Camp NERF is an 8-week, multi-component (nutrition, physical activity, and mental health), theory-based program for underserved school-age children in grades Kindergarten - 5th grade coupled with the USDA Summer Food Service Program. Twelve eligible elementary school sites will be randomized to one of the three programming groups: 1) Active Control (non-nutrition, physical activity, or mental health [4H curricula]); 2) Standard Care (nutrition and physical activity); or 3) Enhanced Care (nutrition, physical activity, and mental health) programming. Anthropometric, behavioral, and psychosocial data will be collected from child-caregiver dyads pre- and post-intervention. Site-specific characteristics and process evaluation measures will also be collected. Discussion: This is the first, evidence-based intervention to address the issue of weight gain during the summer months among underserved, school-aged children. Results from this study will provide researchers, practitioners, and public health professionals with insight on evidence-based programming to aid in childhood obesity prevention during this particular window of risk.</detailed_description>
