	<brief_title>MindMate: A Study of a Reminder System for People With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Memory difficulties are a core feature of dementia. These include difficulties remembering to do something at a specific time and place in the future (Prospective Memory). Although a range of electronic prospective memory aids currently exist (e.g. "Neuropage"), the evidence supporting their use among the dementia population remains limited. "Mindmate" is a recently developed mobile application that aims to support individuals with a diagnosis of dementia, improving self-management skills and quality of life. Aims This study will explore the effectiveness of "MindMate" reminder alerts delivered to a smart phone or tablet computer as a memory aid for people with a diagnosis of Mild Dementia. Method Three participants with a diagnosis of dementia, who are considered to be in the early stages and who report everyday prospective memory difficulties, will be recruited from Older People Community Mental Health teams within Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The participants will own a smart phone or tablet and will be living with a partner or family member who will also participate in the study. During the initial baseline phase, the partner or family member will monitor the number of pre defined tasks the participant remembered and forgot. The partner or family member will record this information on a weekly monitoring form and this phase will last between five to seven weeks. This will be followed by a five-week intervention phase where "MindMate" reminder alerts will be sent to the participant's phone or tablet. Again, tasks that require remembering will be identified prior to the intervention phase, and family members or carers will monitor their success on a form. Results will be analysed using visual inspection and Tau-U analysis. Applications This study will provide information on the effectiveness of a form of assistive technology at supporting people with a dementia, which could improve quality of life of those with a diagnosis.</detailed_description>
