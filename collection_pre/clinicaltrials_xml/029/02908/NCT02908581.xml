	<brief_title>Effect of Folic Acid on Skin Fungal Pattern in Patients With Arsenicosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arsenicosis is remaining as a precarious issue in Bangladesh for the last few decades. The fact of resentment is that this perilous condition still remains unresolved worldwide. So, it has become the demand of era to address this issue. Different diseases are manifested in different way. In arsenicosis melanosis and keratosis are the most common manifestations. The actual mechanism of development of keratosis is unclear. Chronic ingestion of arsenic contaminated water causes accumulation of arsenic in keratin rich tissues like skin, hair, nail and producing characteristic skin manifestations like melanosis and keratosis. Metabolism of arsenic depends on folate pathway and dietary deficiency of folic acid reduced the total arsenic excretion and leads to development of cancer. In different study results shown that folic acid reduces the blood arsenic level. As arsenicosis is a chronic disease condition, fungal infection is more common to them. Moreover the skin fungal pattern in arsenicosis yet not known. Therefore, this study will be conducted to determine is there any change in skin fungal pattern in patients with palmar arsenical keratosis before and after administration of folic acid. Forty two patients with palmar arsenical keratosis will be recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty one patients will be furnished folic acid (5 mg) and iron (200 mg) once daily for 12 weeks without any interruption. Another twenty one patients will be furnished iron (200 mg) once daily for 12 weeks without any interruption. Water and nail samples will be collected for confirming the diagnosis. Skin sample will be collected two times (before and after giving iron and folic acid) for qualitative analysis of fungi. So, this study will determine any change in fungal pattern after administrating tablet folic acid.</detailed_description>
