	<brief_summary>Copepod oil is extracted from the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the dominant plankton species in the marine food web in the Norwegian Sea. Copepods constitute the largest renewable and harvestable resource in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent waters, and it is now developed knowledge and technology for sustainable harvesting of this "new" resource. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Calanus copepod oil supplementation has an equivalent effect on maximal oxygen uptake in humans to that seen in experimental studies in mice.</brief_summary>
