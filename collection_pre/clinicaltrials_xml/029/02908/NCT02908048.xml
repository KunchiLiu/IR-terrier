	<brief_title>Extracellular RNA Markers of Liver Disease and Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal is to identify an extracellular RNA candidate for the detection and diagnosis of liver cancers such as hepatocellular cancer or biliary cancer, and chronic liver diseases. The use of selected exRNA biomarkers for diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) or biliary tract cancers in patients with cirrhosis will be evaluated in a prospective case-control study. The study will create a registry of patients who have chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver and biliary tract cancers. A risk factor questionnaire will be administered to facilitate identification of risk factors for development of liver cancer. Patient information will be obtained from the medical record, and include demographics, medical history, liver disease, smoking and alcohol history, etiology, family history, and clinical laboratory data.</detailed_description>
