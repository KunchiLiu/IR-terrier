	<brief_summary>Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often have other difficulties as a result of the disorder. Up to half of the children with ASD are thought to suffer with anxiety in a way that interferes with their wellbeing and every day functioning. In this project the investigators will study the effect of the group program The Cool Kids Anxiety Program: Autism Spectrum Disorder Adaptation (Cool Kids ASD) - an anxiety treatment program specific developed for children with ASD. The investigators expect a decrease in the overall anxiety level together with an increase in the ability of handling anxiety.</brief_summary>
