	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study of up to 250 participants, from birth to 18 months, who have already had a chest x-ray while a patient at the National Institute of Health (NICH) in Karachi, Pakistan. Participants will include both males and females as well as all races and ethnicities. Participants will have thermal pictures of their chest taken by trained study staff using a Smartphone and a FLIR ONE attachment. Thermal images will be read by trained radiologists to determine if bacterial pneumonia is present. Results of the thermal image will then be compared to the results of the chest x-ray. If additional images of the chest or other areas of suspected related infection are available, additional thermal images will be taken of the same location within 24 hours of the other image.</brief_summary>
