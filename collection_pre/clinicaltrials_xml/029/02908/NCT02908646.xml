	<brief_summary>Both of microcoil localization and hookwire localization have been proved as good preoperative CT(computed tomography)-guided techniques to guide VATS resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules technique to guide VATS resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules. The objective of this study is to determine if microcoil localization for pulmonary nodules can be safer than hookwire localization</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing of Microcoil Localization and Hook Wire Localization for Resectable Pulmonary Small Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both of microcoil localization and hookwire localization have been proved as good preoperative CT-guided techniques to guide VATS resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules technique to guide VATS(video assisted thoracoscopic surgery) resection for the diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules. Compared with the commonly used hook wire, the platinum microcoil can be retained in the patients'body and the configuration of which had an effect in reducing the severity of complications. The fibered microcoil may promote blood coagulation of the surrounding lung tissues, block the needle pathway, and decrease the severity of pneumothorax and bleeding caused by the puncture needle, which has been proven in animal experiments. The objective of this study is to determine if microcoil localization for pulmonary nodules can be safer than hookwire localization</detailed_description>
