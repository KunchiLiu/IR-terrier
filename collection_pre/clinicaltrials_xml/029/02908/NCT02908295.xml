	<brief_title>Rectal Misoprostol in Women Undergoing Myomectomy for Intraoperative Blood Loss: A Randomized Placebo-controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to development of reproductive technology to assist infertile women, rate of myomectomy increases. During this operation, surgeons would deal with hypervascular masses with raw surfaces that tend to bleeding. Interventions to diminish bleeding were studied such as using misoprostol, vasopressin, transamenic acid along with mechanical intervention such as tourniquet and uterine artery ligation. But in Rajavithi hospital, such procedures aren't generally used because of fewer cases and also lacks of supporting data. Misoprostol, used in gynecologic patients for a long time with a wide safety margin acts at prostaglandin receptors of myometrium to stimulate contraction that constricts uterine vessels that lead to decreasing amount of bleeding during the operation. This led to the experimental study of rectal misoprostol administered at 15 - 30 minutes prior the operation to decrease blood loss and also blood transfusion rates. Our study also gather data about adverse effect that subject experienced after drug administration.</detailed_description>
