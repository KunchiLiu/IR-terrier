	<brief_summary>Patients are treated with infusions of Tocilizumab (TCZ) or placebo for 5 months. Clinical evaluation is performed using PMR-AS. The PMR-AS is computed by summing the 5 variables after multiplying by 0.1 for weighting purposes: PMR-AS (activity scale = AS) = C reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dl) + patient scale (VASp) (0-10 scale) + physician scale (VASph) (0-10 scale) + morning stiffness(MST) [min]Ã—0.1) + elevation of upper limbs (EUL) (0-3 scale). All the patients included are treated with glucocorticoid (GC).GC are reduced at each visit until the end of the study, depending on response to treatment and PMR-AS.</brief_summary>
