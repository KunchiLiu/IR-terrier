	<brief_summary>When screening results for cervical premalignant lesions are positive, colposcopy is recommended. This is highly sensitive screening method. However, specificity of the test is of low. Thus, a technology that improves the accuracy of the colposcopic exam is needed. This is a feasibility study with the goal of examining the performance of a thermal imaging camera in the detection of cervical malignant and premalignant lesions.</brief_summary>
