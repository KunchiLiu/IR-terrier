	<detailed_description>It is well known that in order to promote a proper nutrition and to prevent malnutrition in Mexican population, both by deficiencies and excesses, it is essential to recover Mexican food culture. It is known that only information is insufficient to implement healthy lifestyles. There are a number of barriers that interfere with the adoption of healthy dietary practices that need to be identified and addressed in order to achieve the adoption of healthy eating behaviors. Therefore, Comer en Familia focuses on the people, their lifestyles, motivations and social context, based on an action methodology. To design the program, culinary traditions from different country regions were integrated, the habits of proper food preparation at home, promoting eating in the company of family with special emphasis on the importance of enjoying the taste of food were also integrated. This model delivers information on the transcendence of preparing food at home, the impact of nutrients on health and the influence of eating habits of the family in the conducts of their members in a practical way. Comer en Familia is a nutritional educational model that aims to promote proper nutrition, and therefore improve health and welfare of the beneficiaries of food banks. Through 24 cooking workshops throughout a period of a year, each workshop every 15 days, communities will be trained in optimal food preparation and the use of local food, based mainly on vegetables, while promoting the importance of cooking and having family meals. Anthropometric evaluations and interviews on food practices will be conducted to the beneficiaries at the beginning and at the end of the program. Anthropometric evaluations will be carried out and psychosocial risks surveys will be applied to the children in charge of the mothers/ caregivers from Comer en Familia. Also, in a sub-sample of the population of mothers/caregivers benefitted from the program, fasting capillary glucose and hemoglobin will be measured at the beginning and at the end of Comer en Familia.</detailed_description>
