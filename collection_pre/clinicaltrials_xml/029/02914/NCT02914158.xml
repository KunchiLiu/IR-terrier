	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the curative effects in patients under the age of 35 with hormone receptor positive breast cancer and high recurrent risk factors including large tumor or metastatic lymph nodes randomized to ovarian function suppression (OFS) plus aromatase inhibitors or OFS plus tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy, and explore the differences of curative effects between different subtypes to provide direct evidence for treatments of young breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>

Clinical stage (TNM) meets at least one of the conditions as follow: T≥2cm or at least one region of regional lymph node metastasis (including micrometastases); 7. Patients must have undergone a surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy (if necessary) according to Chinese AntiCancer Association guidelines and specifications version 2015 for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer; 8.

Prior use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy after a definite diagnosis; 5. Nervous system disorders caused by diseases or obvious mental disorder, which would affect patients right to consent and compliance, or make patients in critical condition; 6. Serious hepatopathy (e.g., cirrhosis, etc.), nephropathy, respiratory illness, digestive illness or poorly controlled diabetes; 7.
