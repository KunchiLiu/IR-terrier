	<brief_summary>This study will investigate how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) paradigm affects sensorimotor dysfunction such as pain, spasticity, motor weakness and sensory loss. TMS is technique which allows non-invasive stimulation of the cortex, and can modulate activity of neurons. The purpose of this study will be to assess the feasibility of using TMS with iTBS paradigm to treat sensorimotor dysfunction in people with incomplete spinal cord injury affecting the upper limbs.</brief_summary>
