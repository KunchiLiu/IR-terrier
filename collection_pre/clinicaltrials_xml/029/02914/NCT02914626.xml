	<brief_summary>Neovascular glaucoma is a potentially blinding condition characterized by the growth of newvessels at the anterior part of the eye. This growth is driven by the overexpression of a protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). That happens in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy or venous retinal occlusion, and lead to a fast increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). Traditional treatment include laser photocoagulation of the retina in order to decrease VEGF formation. The investigators postulate that the use of anti-VEGF intravitreal injections may accelerate recovery and decrease the need of surgery in cases of neovascular glaucoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) for Neovascular Glaucoma- a Randomized Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized controlled study that aims to evaluate the efficacy of ranibizumab (Lucentis®) as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with neovascular glaucoma. 28 patients with neovascular glaucoma (14 in the study group and 14 in the control standard of care group) will be recruited at a single center- University of Sao Paulo Medical School General Hospital. A complete ophthalmologic exam will be carried out, including the obtention of an informed consent for eligible patients willing to participate on the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to either standard of care- retinal laser photocoagulation and clinical management of intraocular pressure with drops, or standard of care plus intravitreal ranibizumab injections. Two injections will be performed 30 days apart. The patients will be followed for 6 months.</detailed_description>
