	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure how much LY3337641 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. In addition, the safety and tolerability of the study drug will be evaluated. Participants will be admitted to a clinical research unit (CRU) the day before dosing. Participants remain confined to the CRU for at least 7 days. Participants may be discharged from the CRU any time after 7 days post-dose (Day 8), and up to a maximum of 21 days post-dose (Day 22). This study will last approximately 30 days for each participant, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>

If the previous investigational product has a long halflife, 3 months or 5 halflives (whichever is longer, if known) should have passed Have a significant history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal (GI) (cholecystectomy not acceptable), endocrine, hematological, dermatologic, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of constituting a risk when taking the investigational product; or of interfering with the interpretation of data Regularly use known drugs of abuse and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening Have used or intend to use overthecounter or prescription medication, including herbal medications, within 14 days prior to dosing Have donated blood of more than 500 milliliter (mL) within the month prior to screening Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week, and are unwilling to stop alcohol consumption for 48 hours prior to admission, and while resident in the clinical research unit (CRU) In the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, are unsuitable for inclusion in the study Have had exposure to significant diagnostic, therapeutic, or employment related radiation within 12 months prior to dosing (serial xray or computed tomography scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure monitoring) Have participated in a [¹⁴C] study within the last 6 months prior to admission for this study. The total 12month exposure from this study and a maximum of one other previous [¹⁴C]study within 6 to 12 months of this study must be within the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) recommended levels considered safe (per 21 CFR 361.1): less than 5000 Millirem (mrem) /year whole body annual exposure</criteria>
