	<criteria>1. Male or female patients, age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years. 2. Male or female, age ≥ 50 years in the healthy volunteers group 3. No heart pathology (for volunteers) 4. PAF, Pers AF and Ls Pers AF (ECG documented). 5. LVEF ≥ 50% 6. Able to provide written informed consent 7. Able to comply with the requirements of the study 1. Previous AF ablation therapy 2. Clinical evidence of active coronary ischemia, significant valvular heart disease, or hemodynamically significant congenital cardiac abnormality 3. Recent (3 months) myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (except if the patient had a DES implanted stent postMI it would be one year) 4. Contraindication to Iodine123 Metaiodobenzylguanidine (123ImIBG), iodine, isoproterenol 5. Use of medication for noncardiac medical conditions that is known to interfere with 123ImIBG uptake and cannot be safely withheld for at least 24 hours prior to the DSPECT study procedures</criteria>
