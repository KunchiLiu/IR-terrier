	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum biologically effective dose of ME-401; determine the maximally tolerated dose of ME-401 and determine the dose limiting toxicities of ME-401. Secondary objectives to evaluate the safety profile and efficacy of ME-401.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ME-401 in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory CLL/SLL or FL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation/expansion study with seven planned dose levels (Cohorts) of ME-401. DLT will be assessed within the first 56 days (8 weeks). A Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) model will be used to determine dose escalation/de-escalation. Dose levels will consist of 6 subjects and can be expanded to enroll up to 12 subjects. The total number of cohorts depends on the incidence of DLTs.</detailed_description>
