	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Signed informed consent in a language understandable to the subject prior to any studymandated procedure Healthy male subjects aged between 45 and 65 years (inclusive) at screening No clinically significant findings on the physical examination at screening Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100145 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 5090 mmHg, measured on either arm, after 5 min in the supine position at screening and at Day 1 predose Heart rate (HR) 5590 bpm (inclusive) measured with 12lead ECG after 5 min in the supine position at screening and at Day 1 predose Known hypersensitivity to cenerimod or to S1P receptor modulators, or to any excipients of the cenerimod drug formulation History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study treatment (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed, cholecystectomy not allowed) History or clinical evidence suggestive of active or latent tuberculosis including a positive QuantiFERON®TB test at screening Any cardiac condition or illness (including 12lead ECG abnormalities) with a potential to increase the cardiac risk of the subject based on the standard 12lead ECG at screening and at Day 1 predose Participation in another study with a radiation burden of &gt; 0.1 mSv and ≤ 1 mSv in the period of 1 year prior to screening; a radiation burden of ≥ 1.1 mSv and ≤ 2 mSv in the period of 2 years prior to screening, etc. (add 1 year per 1 mSv) Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the subject's full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol Any immunosuppressive treatment within 6 weeks or within 5 elimination halflives of the immunosuppressive treatment, whichever is longer, before study treatment administration</criteria>
