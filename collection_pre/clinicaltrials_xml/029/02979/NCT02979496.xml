	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily intake of orange pomace on gastrointestinal function as measured by stool frequency. Additional outcomes will include aspects of digestive health, diet quality, and fasting blood glucose and lipid concentrations. Possible explanations for the mechanism of the pomace will be explored in microbial ecology analyses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, healthy adults will be asked to consume daily servings of orange juice containing either 0 g (n=120; control) or 180 g (i.e. 10 g fiber; n=120) of orange pomace for 3 weeks to assess the effect of the pomace on stool frequency. Blood samples will be obtained to assess the effect of the pomace on metabolic markers. Stool samples will be collected for analyses of the effect of the pomace on fecal bacteria known to be associated with health benefits (e.g., bifidobacteria). For exploratory analyses, additional groups will be asked to consume orange juice containing 90 g of pomace (i.e. 5 g fiber; n=40) or orange-flavored, calorie-matched water (n=40); outcomes from the water group will be compared to those of the 0 g pomace juice group to assess any effects of the juice alone, and outcomes from the 90 g pomace group will be compared to those of the 180 g and 0 g groups in microbiota analyses.</detailed_description>
