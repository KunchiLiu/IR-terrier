	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single SC doses of alirocumab in Chinese healthy subjects. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single SC dose of alirocumab. - To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of a single SC dose of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other lipid parameters. - To assess the immunogenicity of a single SC dose of alirocumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Subcutaneous (SC) Administered Alirocumab in Healthy Chinese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ascending dose design includes 3 dose levels. Tolerance data up to at least 14 days post dosing from at least 6 subjects of the previous cohort will be reviewed before proceeding with a next dose. Total duration of the study per subject is approximately 15 weeks (including screening period).</detailed_description>
