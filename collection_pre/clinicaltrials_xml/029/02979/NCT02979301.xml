	<brief_summary>The study will examine whether changes in background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging (MBI) can be induced by short-term use of low-dose tamoxifen. Women who have previously had high BPU on MBI will be recruited. Participants will take low-dose tamoxifen for a 30-day period, with post-tamoxifen MBI in order to investigate the impact of tamoxifen on BPU.</brief_summary>
