	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy and safety of amlodipine on renal and vascular function in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. Kitov Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug product (FCDP) consisting of the antihypertensive drug amlodipine besylate and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib. KIT-302 is being developed as a "convenience reformulation" FCDP to facilitate and improve patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual components, amlodipine and celecoxib, when used together for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure, in patients who also require the use of an NSAID for relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. It is also intended to provide prescribers with detailed data on how the combination affects the antihypertensive effect of the calcium channel blocker. The formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a single immediate release tablet. However, for this study, two separate capsules will be utilized: one containing a commercial celecoxib capsule (Celebrex®) or matched placebo capsule and one containing a commercial amlodipine besylate tablet (Norvasc®) or matched placebo tablet. Kitov recently completed a phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension (KIT-302-03-01) demonstrating that the amlodipine + celecoxib combination was statistically non-inferior to amlodipine monotherapy with regard to reduction of blood pressure. Further, trends towards superior blood pressure lowering effects and improved renal function were observed for the combination. This study (KIT-302-03-02) is being conducted to quantify the beneficial renovascular effects noted in the prior study in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Adult 40 to 75 years of age 2. Existing hypertension that is being treated using pharmacological therapy with a single agent that is not a calcium channel blocker 3. SBPday &gt; 135 and ≤ 169 mmHg and average daytime (9:00 to 21:00) ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBPday) ≤ 110 mmHg at Day 0 (after the 10 to 14day washout from prior blood pressure medication) 4. Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 34.9 kg/m2 5. Healthy (other than hypertension) as determined by the Investigator based on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests 6. A negative pregnancy test at initial screening visit 7. If woman of childbearing potential, agree to use a highly effective form of birth control while on study (from Screening through final study visit) 8. Able to comprehend and sign an informed consent form. 1. Resting SBP &gt; 169 mmHg or a resting DBP &gt; 110 mmHg at initial screening visit while on their standard antihypertensive therapy (where resting is defined as supine for at least 10 minutes with minimal interaction) 2. Weight &lt; 55 kg 3. Fragile health 4. Evidence of clinically significant findings on screening evaluations (clinical, laboratory, and ECG) which, in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a safety risk or interfere with appropriate interpretation of safety data 5. Current or recent history (within four weeks prior to initial screening visit) of a clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection 6. Current clinically significant viral infection 7. History of malignancy, with the exception of cured basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 8. Major surgery within four weeks prior to initial screening visit 9. Presence of a malabsorption syndrome possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., Crohn's disease or chronic pancreatitis) 10. Active peptic ulceration or history of gastrointestinal bleeding 11. History of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke 12. Any current cardiovascular disease (other than hypertension) 13. History of psychotic disorder 14. History of alcoholism or drug addiction or current alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and study evaluations 15. History of any illicit drug use within one year prior to initial screening visit 16. Positive drug screen at initial screening visit. A positive drug screen for opiates only (with all other drug tests negative) will not be a basis for exclusion if the subject took overthecounter narcotics as indicated on the product label within 24 hours prior to the drug screen 17. Current treatment or treatment within 30 days prior to first dose of study drugs with another investigational drug or current enrollment in another clinical trial 18. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C 19. Known hypersensitivity to amlodipine or celecoxib 20. Known hypersensitivity to the inactive ingredients in the overencapsulated (OE) study drugs 21. Asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria or other allergic type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase2 inhibitors 22. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unable or unlikely to comply with the dosing schedule and study evaluations 23. Pregnant or lactating 24. Unable to correctly use ambulatory blood pressure monitor after instruction on its use 25. Subjects with ChildPugh Class B or C cirrhosis 26. Subjects currently taking a calcium channel blocker or any NSAID for any reason will be excluded. Subjects will not be withdrawn from these drugs to be enrolled in the trial 27. Subjects that took a calcium channel blocker in the past for any indication 28. Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min as estimated by the CockroftGault equation 29. Known cytochrome P450 2C9 poor metabolizer 30. Subjects with allergy or hypersensitivity to sulfonamides</criteria>
