	<brief_title>When Will I Feel The First Movements of My Baby?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of the obstetricians face the question; "When Will I Feel The First Movements of My Baby?", in daily practice. It becomes a challenge for the obstetrician to answer this question. Because, there is not a sufficient data in the current literature on this issue. A broad range of weeks for fetal quickening are reported as 16th to 20th weeks, in round figures. So, when a woman in the 21st gestational week , asks this question to the obstetrician and informed according to aforementioned literature knowledge, the woman will ask another question immediately after: "What is the problem with my baby?". But, the obstetrician will not be able to give an assuring answer because of the lack of knowledge in the current literature.Thus, to cope with such a clinical situation, the investigators decided to investigate the average week in which pregnant women in a low risk population, felt the babies' movements for the first time and to find out the affects of probable factors which may act on this time.</detailed_description>
