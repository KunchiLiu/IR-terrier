	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare Emergency Department patients who undergo influenza testing using an FDA-approved point-of-care device (Cobas Liat Influenza A/B assay) located in the ED, to patients whose samples are sent to the BMC central laboratory. Patients who agree to participate will have their samples randomly assigned to be tested on either at the core lab, or on the POC device. The current turnaround time for samples sent to the laboratory is approximately two hours; investigators expect that the point of care device can reduce this time. Investigators will determine if the time to disposition and the administration of antibiotics is different in the group undergoing POC influenza testing compared to those undergoing laboratory-based influenza testing</brief_summary>
