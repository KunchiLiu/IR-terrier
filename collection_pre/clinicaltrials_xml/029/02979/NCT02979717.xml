	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a high protein, high fiber supplement pre-load on energy intake at a subsequent meal compared to a low fiber, high carbohydrate Control product in healthy overweight and obese subjects. The investigators hypothesize the high protein, high fiber pre-load will result in reduced energy intake at a subsequent meal compared to low protein, low fiber.</brief_summary>
