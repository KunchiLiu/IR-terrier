	<brief_title>Learning From Online Video Education for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Learning from Online Video Education (LOVE) is a randomized controlled trial that seeks to determine the effect of instructional online videos on medication administration on psychological well being during controlled ovarian stimulation. The investigators hypothesize that usage of online instructional videos by women undergoing their first cycle of controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization or oocyte cryopreservation improves measures of psychological well-being (Infertility Self Efficacy Scale, FertiQoL-T and Perceived stress scores) when compared to subjects that do not have access to this educational resource.</detailed_description>
