	<detailed_description>This study will develop the first well-known household water insecurity scale. Currently, water insecurity cannot be measured at the level of the household or individual, i.e. at the endpoint of water use. Although there are myriad national, regional, community, and hydrological indexes of water availability, to the investigators' knowledge, there is no way of measuring water access at the household or individual levels. Without a comprehensive, validated scale to measure household water insecurity, the scientific, programmatic, and public health communities cannot empirically test the prevalence of household water insecurity access and its potential impacts on economic, nutrition, disease, and psychosocial health pathways and outcomes.</detailed_description>
