	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity, as well as recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS) in combination with a multiagent chemotherapy regimen, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine, in pediatric participants with advanced stage newly diagnosed Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Brentuximab Vedotin + Adriamycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine in Pediatric Participants With Advanced Stage Newly Diagnosed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. Brentuximab vedotin is being tested to treat pediatric participants who have advanced stage, newly diagnosed, classical CD30+ HL. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity, as well as recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in combination with a multiagent chemotherapy regimen that is based on a current standard of care (SOC) first-line treatment regimen for newly diagnosed HL. The study will enroll approximately 55 evaluable participants. The study will be conducted in 2 phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 study will enroll up to 12 participants to determine the recommended dose. Once the recommended dose is identified additional participants will be enrolled into phase 2 so that the total number of evaluable participants will be approximately 55, including participants treated at recommended dose in Phase 1. Participants will be enrolled in the following 2 dose Cohorts: â€¢ Brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m^2 or 36 mg/m^2 in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States (US) and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 55 months. Participants will be followed for a maximum of 30 days following the last dose of protocol therapy for a follow-up assessment and will be followed for survival until death or study closure or a maximum of 2 years after enrollment of the last participant.</detailed_description>
