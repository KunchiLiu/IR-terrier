	<brief_title>Hybrid Catheter Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epicardial (EPI) catheter approach is considered as an accessory to endocardial (ENDO) ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF). We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of EPI ablation as first option to the patients who had previous endocardial ablation for PeAF. This is prospective randomized controlled, single center study. study population is recurred AF patient with failed previous ENDO catheter ablation for PeAF. The investigators randomized study population to both groups: Hybrid group (EpI + ENDO ablation) versus control group (conventional ENDO ablation). Clinical outcome (Freedom from AF/Atrial tachycardia) and procedural safety will be compared.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with persistent AF (AF episode lasting &gt; 7 days) Patients with symptomatic AF that is refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medication Patients with recurrent arrhythmia after prior catheter ablation Patients undergoing a repeat ablation procedure for AF At least one episode of AF must have been documented by ECG, Holter, loop recorder, telemetry, trans telephonic monitoring (TTM), or implantable device within last 2 years of enrollment in this investigation Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in this investigation Patients with permanent AF; Permanent AF will be defined as a sustained episode lasting more than 1 years and sinus rhythm never be observed . Patients for whom cardioversion or sinus rhythm will never be attempted/pursued; Patients with AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause Patients with contraindications to systemic anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin or a direct thrombin inhibitor; Patients with left atrial size â‰¥ 60 mm (2D echocardiography, parasternal long axis view) Moderate to severe valvular disease Reduced left ventricular function (ejection fraction &lt;40%) Patients who are pregnant. Pregnancy will be assessed by patients informing the physicians.</criteria>
