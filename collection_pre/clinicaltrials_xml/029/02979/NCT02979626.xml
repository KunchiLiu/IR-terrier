	<brief_title>Evaluation of Moderate to Severe Influenza Outcomes in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study aims to determine the risk difference of hospitalization due to moderate to severe influenza compared with mild influenza among children aged 6 months to 8 years who are evaluated at Children's Hospital Colorado emergency department and urgent care during the 2016-2017 influenza season. In addition, it intends to evaluate the risk difference for other health outcomes such as ICU admission, antibiotic and antiviral use, caregiver and child absenteeism and recurrent (&gt;1) healthcare visits, and to compare the healthcare costs associated with management of moderate to severe versus mild influenza in children. Children presenting to Children's Hospital Colorado ED and urgent care affiliated sites (North Campus urgent care) with an influenza-like illness from December 2016 to April 2017, during the 2016-2017 influenza season will be eligible for the study. Once enrolled in the study, we will collect respiratory samples (nasal swab specimens) for influenza testing by PCR, sociodemographic and clinical data including variables of interest outlined above, and follow the clinical outcome of these children for 14 days after their initial presentation. Some of the variables of interest we will collect are shown below.</detailed_description>
