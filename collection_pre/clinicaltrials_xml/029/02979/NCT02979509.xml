	<brief_summary>All patients will receive standard medical care and no experimental interventions will be performed. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a well-established procedure commonly used for the investigation of lesions within or adjacent to the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen (i.e. pancreas, liver, mediastinal masses, left adrenal gland, lymph nodes, and subepithelial lesions). EUS-guided tissue sampling has been commonly performed with different size and types of aspiration and core biopsy needles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a well-established procedure commonly used for the investigation of lesions within or adjacent to the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen (i.e. pancreas, liver, mediastinal masses, left adrenal gland, lymph nodes, and subepithelial lesions). EUS-guided tissue sampling has been commonly performed with different size and types of aspiration and core biopsy needles. More recently, a novel through-the-needle microforceps has been introduced. The MorayTM microforceps fits through a 19-gauge FNA needle and allows targeted tissue sampling under EUS visualization. Aim - To prospectively evaluate the safety and diagnostic yield of the through-the-needle microforceps for pancreatic and non-pancreatic solid, cystic and mixed solid/cystic lesions.</detailed_description>
