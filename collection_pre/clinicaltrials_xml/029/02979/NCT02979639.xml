	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Impact of Reactogenicity on Quality of Life (QoL), After Administration of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Candidate Herpes Zoster Subunit (HZ/su) Vaccine (GSK1437173A) in Adults ≥ 50 Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the impact of HZ/su vaccination on the QoL and physical functioning (PF) in 400 adults ≥ 50 years of age (YOA) via Patient Reported Outcome questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D. In addition to the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires, further characterization of the reactogenicity of the vaccine will be made through diary card data collection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performance of any study specific procedure. A male or female aged ≥ 50 YOA at the time of consent. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. For this study population, nonchildbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular (IM) injection unsafe. Use or planned use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine or current participation or planned concurrent participation in another clinical study, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product during the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and the study end. Use or anticipated use of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs during the period starting 180 days prior to study start and during the whole study period. This includes chronic administration of corticosteroids, longacting immunemodifying agents or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy. Inhaled, topical and intraarticular corticosteroids are allowed. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products in the period starting 90 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a nonreplicating vaccine in the period starting 15 days prior to and ending 14 days after either dose of study vaccine. Previous or planned administration of a vaccine against HZ other than the study vaccine, during the entire study period. History of HZ. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. Pregnant or lactating female. Significant underlying illness requiring medications that might confound the evaluation of general/ local AEs, or in the opinion of the investigator, would be expected to prevent completion of the study. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluations required by the study.</criteria>
