	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of pitavastatin for 2 years comparing the effect of study drug versus placebo on vascular measures in at least 354 obese (body mass index &gt;95th percentile) adolescents with CDO (defined as high non-HDL-C + high TG/HDL-C ratio or low HDL-C). Enrollment will take place over 18 months.</detailed_description>
