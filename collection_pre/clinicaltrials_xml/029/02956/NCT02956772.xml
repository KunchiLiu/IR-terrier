	<brief_title>Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in Combination With Arsenic Trioxide Versus TACE in the Treatment of Middle-advanced Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Notably, more than half of the new HCC cases and deaths develop in China. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been proposed as the first-line therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. However, TACE has several limitations itself which might be potentially associated with tumor metastasis and relapse. Recent studies have demonstrated that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) can act as the first-line therapeutic option in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thereafter, several small studies in China showed promising clinical benefits when As2O3 is administrated among the HCC patients. With these preliminary results, the investigators are planning to carry out a multicenter randomized controlled trial through which to explore the potential efficacy and safety of adjuvant As2O3 treatment for HCC patients.</detailed_description>
