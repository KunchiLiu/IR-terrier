	<brief_summary>This sponsor-open, investigator- and participant-blinded, multi-center study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO7020531 in healthy participants and in participants with chronic hepatitis B. Part I will be conducted in two portions: Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) which will include only healthy volunteers. Part II will commence after completion of the MAD portion of Part I and will include only Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1: SAD and MAD in Healthy Volunteers A Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 to 30 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive Nonsmokers, or use of less than (&lt;) 10 cigarettes (or equivalent nicotinecontaining product) per day Negative AntiNuclear Antibody (ANA) test; or positive with dilutions not greater than 1:40 and with no associated history or symptoms of potential connective tissue disease or other immunemediated diseases Part 2: CHB Participants A BMI between 18 to 32 kg/m^2, inclusive CHB infection (positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] for more than 6 months prior to randomization) HBsAg detectable at screening Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) &lt;90 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) for at least 6 months prior to randomization; HBV DNA &lt;90 IU/mL at screening by Roche Cobas assay Negative ANA test; or positive with dilutions not greater than 1:40 and with no associated history or symptoms of potential connective tissue disease or other immunemediated diseases Liver biopsy, fibroscanÂ® or equivalent elastography test obtained within 6 months prior to randomization demonstrating liver disease consistent with chronic HBV infection with absence of cirrhosis and absence of extensive bridging fibrosis (cirrhosis or extensive bridging fibrosis are defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) Metavir 3, recommended cutoff for fibroscan 8.5 kilopascals [kPa]) On treatment with tenofovir, entecavir, adefovir, or telbivudine, either as single agents or in combination, for at least 6 months Part 1: SAD and MAD in Healthy Volunteers History of immunologically mediated disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, autoimmune haemolytic anemia, scleroderma, severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or any other autoimmune disease); clinically significant thyroid disease, psychiatric disease, acute infection (e.g., influenza), gastrointestinal (GI) disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, GI hemorrhage) Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the participant in this study Positive Hepatitis A virus antibody (HAV Ab IgM), HBsAg, Hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab), or positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening History of clinically significant thyroid disease; also, participants with clinically significant elevated thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations at screening Positive results for antimitochondrial antibody (AMA), antismooth muscle antibody (ASMA) or thyroid peroxidase antibody Part 2: CHB Participants History of liver cirrhosis History or other evidence of bleeding from esophageal varices Decompensated liver disease (e.g., ChildPugh Class B or C clinical classification or clinical evidence such as ascites or varices) History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HBV infection (e.g., hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, toxin exposure, thalassemia, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, etc.) Documented history or other evidence of metabolic liver disease within one year of randomization Positive test for Hepatitis A virus (IgM antiHAV), HCV, Hepatitis D or HIV History of or suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma or alpha fetoprotein &gt;/=13 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) at screening History of immunologically mediated disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, autoimmune haemolytic anemia, scleroderma, severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or any other autoimmune disease); clinically significant thyroid disease, psychiatric disease, acute infection (e.g., influenza), GI disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, GI hemorrhage) History of organ transplantation Clinically significant thyroid disease; also, participants with clinically significant elevated TSH concentrations at screening Positive results for AMA, ASMA or thyroid peroxidase antibody</criteria>
