	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure longitudinally the availability of the PDE10A enzyme in HDGECs using the radioligand [18F]MNI-659. The study will be a follow-up, examining HDGECs from the CHDIKI1201/PET-HD-PDE10A (NCT02061722) study from 18 to 28 months after the initial PET measurement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HDGECs will perform 2 study visits: Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 (PET analysis utilizing the radioligand [18F]MNI-659). There will also be 2 telephone follow ups; one after Visit 1 (telephone follow-up after screening) and one after Visit 2, (telephone follow-up after PET). Study visits and telephone follow-ups will take place during a maximum of 97 days.</detailed_description>
