	<brief_title>The Effect of Tear Supplements on Contact Lens Comfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contact lens discomfort (CLD) is the most common cause of discontinuing contact lens wear. Despite years of research and innovations in technology, CLD remains highly prevalent, and thus it is a major concern for patients and practitioners. Studies suggest that meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a cause of CLD. Several lipid-based artificial tears have recently been designed to address dry eye associated with MGD. In this study, the investigators examine if the benefits of lipid based artificial tears extend to improving contact lens comfort. Studies have demonstrated some usefulness of non-lipid based tear supplements in the management of contact lens discomfort. However, the relief was moderate and short-term. To date, no study has examined the impact of lipid based artificial tears on contact lens discomfort. In this study, the investigators will address this gap in knowledge.</detailed_description>
