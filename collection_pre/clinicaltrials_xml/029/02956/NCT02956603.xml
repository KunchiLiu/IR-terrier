	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which the Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface ( i.e. reinnervation of partial muscle grafts by residual peripheral nerves) enables both the generation of high-performance motor control signals for prosthetic limbs, and the input of sensory percepts by electrical stimulation.</brief_summary>
