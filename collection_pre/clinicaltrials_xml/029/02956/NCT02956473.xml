	<brief_summary>This research study involves the use of a common breast imaging modality (magnetic resonance imaging, 'MRI') and is investigating its role in evaluating treatment for breast cancer when it is performed with the patient in a new position (lying on one's back) as opposed to in the standard position (lying on one's stomach).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supine MRI in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The procedure involved is called a supine breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).In this study, the onvestigators are evaluating the value of supine MRI in the treatment of women with breast cancer before and after receiving neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the value of supine breast MRI as a new imaging method for women receiving neoadjuvant therapy. It is possible that the use of supine breast MRI will help your doctor see the size and location of tumors more accurately</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must be female Participants must have a preoperative standard mammogram with or without ultrasound. Participants must have biopsy confirmed and clinical stage I, stage II, or stage III noninflammatory breast carcinoma. If biopsy was done at an outside hospital, pathology will be reviewed at (BWH, BWFH) Patient must meet standard MRI guidelines and be able and willing to undergo MRI Participants must be candidates for neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) upfront Participants must be candidates for definitive local therapy with breast conserving therapy or deemed as potential candidates following NAT (this takes into account tumor to breast size ratio appropriate for BCT, and the ability to undergo standard radiation therapy postoperatively). Study participants will be restricted to those aged â‰¥18 and &lt;70 years old. This age group is selected because it encompasses the majority of women likely to receive neoadjuvant therapy Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Participants with a known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation. Participants with a known LiFraumeni or Cowden's Disease. Participants with prior mantle radiation. Participants with inflammatory breast cancer or multicentric disease Participants who are pregnant. Participants who are already enrolled in a conflicting investigational trial Participants with known active collagen vascular disease. Participants with prior history of ipsilateral breast carcinoma treated with BCS and radiation therapy. Patients who have biopsy confirmed multicentric disease. Participants who are unable to undergo MRI because of documented contraindications for contrastenhanced MRI, including but not limited to renal failure Participants who exceed the weight limit for the operative surgical table, 350 lbs or who will not fit into the 60 cm diameter bore of the MRI scanner.</criteria>
