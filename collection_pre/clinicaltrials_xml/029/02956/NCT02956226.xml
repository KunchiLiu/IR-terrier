	<brief_title>Cannabinoids for Behavioral Problems in Children With ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disruptive behaviors are very common in children and youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Behavioral problems increase social impairment in children with ASD, make interventions more difficult and place considerable strain on families and caregivers. Current treatment is based on behavioral interventions combined with atypical antipsychotics which often have low tolerability and questionable efficacy. Cannabis exerts profound effects on human social behavior. Research using animal models of ASD indicate a possible dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, and stress that it may be a novel target for pharmacological interventions. Anecdotal evidence suggest efficacy of various phytocannabinoids in resistant behavioral problems. However controlled human studies are lacking. Objective: To assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabinoids mix [cannabidiol (CBD), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a 20:1 ratio] for behavioral problems in children and youth with ASD. Setting: A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Methods: One hundred and twenty participants ages 6-30 years, with established ASD diagnosis and moderate to severe refractory behavioral problems will be treated with placebo and cannabinoids mix in a randomized cross-over trial. Each intervention period will be 12 weeks with additional 4 weeks for gradual dose decrease and wash-out. Baseline evaluations will include: Autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS-2), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Vineland II (interview based), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS-2, observation based). Primary outcome measures: Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder (HSQ-ASD), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, parent-rated), and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI) will be assessed every 4 weeks. Secondary outcome measures: Clinical Global Impression (CGI, improvement and efficacy index items, clinician-rated) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, parent and teacher rated) will be assessed at baseline and termination of each treatment period. Adverse events will be taped every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
