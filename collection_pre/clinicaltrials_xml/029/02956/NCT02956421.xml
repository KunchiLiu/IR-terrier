	<brief_summary>Phase II clinical study for an investigational PIKA(Polyinosinic Polycytidylic Acid Based Adjuvant) rabies vaccine comprising Inactivated and Purified Rabies Virus (IPRV) and the PIKA adjuvant. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the vaccine composition in healthy adult volunteers under the accelerated regimen. The secondary objective is to achieve higher seroconversion of the vaccine under accelerated regimen at Day 7.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multi-center, open labelled, randomized study in healthy na誰ve adult subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to groups A (60) and B (60). Group A as a control arm of the study, had received a commercially available rabies vaccine, RABIPUR速. Group B had received doses of the investigational PIKA rabies vaccine in an accelerated regimen. Group A followed the vaccine regimen of (1-1-1-1),one injection on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 was administered respectively. Group B received the accelerated regimen (2-2-1), two injections on both days 0 and 3 were administered in different arms余 and only one injection was administered on day 7. Each vaccine dose comprise 1.0 ml of PIKA rabies vaccine for Group B and 1.0 ml of RABIPUR速 for Group A after reconstitution. The route of administration is intramuscular injection, given in the deltoid region of the arm.</detailed_description>
