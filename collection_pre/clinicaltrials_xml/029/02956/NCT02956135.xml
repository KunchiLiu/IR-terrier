	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the presence of overuse injuries and failure to control of movement in those areas. For this, participants will perform some tests related to movement dysfunction lumbar-pelvic area to check for faults in one or more movement planes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Dysfunctions of Movement in the Lower Back and Pelvis With Overuse Injuries in Handball Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Handball is considered a high intensity sport even though the 70% of the time the game is standing or walking. The large number of repetitions of high intensity activities such as sprinting or jumping, associated with physical contact with opposing players, make this sport in a physically demanding activity. Furthermore, overuse injuries have been widely described but poorly quantified. In addition, is necessary to know the influence of static lumbar-pelvic position in low back pain and its correlation with stability. Not only strength is important for a good quality of movement, there should also be a specific muscle activation in order for a correct motor pattern. This coordinated action must be I just by the action of muscles agonists, antagonists and synergists.The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the presence of overuse injuries and failure to control of movement in those areas. For this, participants will perform some tests related to movement dysfunction lumbar-pelvic area to check for faults in one or more movement planes.</detailed_description>
