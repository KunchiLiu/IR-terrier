	<brief_title>Neoantigen-primed Dendritic Cells (DC)- Pre-activated T (PreT) Cell Therapy for Refractory Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with pathological confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with no standard treatment are enrolled. The patients fails in previous at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and 1 line of targeted therapy where applicable. This is a prospective exploratory trial. Patients' rebiopsy tumor tissues are subsequent to whole exosome sequencing and possible neoantigens are identified. DC is in vitro primed with synthesized peptides. Patients are treated with DC-primed T cells. Both adverse events and responses are recorded.</detailed_description>
