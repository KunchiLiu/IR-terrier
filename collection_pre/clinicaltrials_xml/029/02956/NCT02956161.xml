	<brief_title>Effects of Synchronised Auditory Stimulations of the Sleep Slow Oscillation on Deep Sleep Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep quality impairment has long been identified as a risk factor to develop cardio-vascular, metabolic and more recently neurodegenerative diseases. The slow wave sleep, characterized by slow oscillations, has a major role on memory and hormones releasing. Here, we aim to assess a miniaturized sleep device that would automatically detect and stimulate sleep slow oscillations with sounds to enhance deep sleep quality. The subjects realize 3 conditions : - Up condition : Auditory stimulations are delivered in synchrony with the up phase of slow oscillations during N3 sleep stage. - Random condition : Auditory stimulations are randomly delivered during N3 sleep stage. - Placebo condition: The device is worn without any auditory stimulations delivered. The subjects are equipped with a reference polysomnography and the auditory stimulation device during 3 nights and one habituation night prior to them. A wash out period of 6 days between each night will be respected.</detailed_description>
