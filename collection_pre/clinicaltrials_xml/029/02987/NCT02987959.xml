	<brief_summary>This is an open-label phase II study of TAK-228 for patients ≥ 18 years of age with complex genomic sarcomas exhibiting Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase (PI3K) pathway dysregulation. Patients must have surgically unresectable or metastatic disease that is refractory to at least one prior line of therapy (not including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in a curative setting). Patients disease must also have evidence of progression prior to enrollment. The purpose of this study is to determine the antitumor activity in this group of patients. Patients must meet all eligibility criteria as detailed in section 10. A total of up to 33 patients will be included in the study. Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days of the first dose. All patients will be required to submit baseline tumor samples for analysis. Patients who have had their tumors tested commercially for PI3K/ AKT/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) alterations will be assessed on a case by case basis for eligibility and for determination as to whether additional tissue is required. TAK-228 will be administered orally at 3 mg daily for a 21 day cycle. Clinical and laboratory assessments will be made on day 1 of each cycle. Disease will be assessed by comparing unidimensional tumor measurements on pre and peritreatment imaging (CT or MRI) after weeks 6, 12, 18 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1. Therapy will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This trial has two step inclusion criteria. Step 1 Inclusion Criteria 1. Male or female patients 18 years or older. 2. Patients must have a diagnosis of a locally advanced or metastatic sarcoma that is progressing. The following subtypes (considered genomically complex) will be eligible: leiomyosarcoma (well differentiated or poorly differentiated), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, angiosarcoma or extraskeletal osteosarcoma. Other potentially genomically complex Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS) subtypes may be included on a casebycase basis after discussion with the principal investigator. 3. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria (at least one target lesion outside of previous radiation fields or progressed within a previous radiation field), described in detail in section 15. 4. Progression of disease by radiographic imaging (10% increase in size by RECIST v1.1 within 6 months of registration) or presence of new lesions. 5. Must have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (does not include adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy in a curative setting). 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02. 7. Adequate contraception as follows: For women: Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 effective method of contraception, and 1 additional (barrier) method, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [eg. United Surgical Partners Internationals (USPI), Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), etc;]) after the last dose of study drug OR agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient (Periodic abstinence [e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) Highly effective methods: Intrauterine devices (IUD) Hormonal (birth control pills/oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches, or contraceptive implants) Other effective Methods: Latex Condoms Diaphragm with spermicide; Cervical cap;Sponge For men, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), they must: Agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient (Periodic abstinence [e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) Agree not to donate sperm during the course of this study or 120 days after receiving their last dose of study drug 8. Screening clinical laboratory values as specified below: a) Bone marrow reserve consistent with: i. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10(9)/L; ii. platelet count ≥ 100 x 10(9)/L; iii. hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion within 1 week preceding study drug administration b) Hepatic: i. total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), ii. transaminases (Aspartate aminotransferase/Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (AST/SGOT) and Alanine aminotransferase/Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present); c) Renal: creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min based either on CockcroftGault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour); d) Metabolic: i. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤ 7.0%, ii. fasting serum glucose ≤ 130 mg/dL iii. fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL 9. Ability to swallow oral medications. 10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 11. Patients who have a history of brain metastasis are eligible for the study provided that all the following criteria are met: 1. Brain metastases which have been treated 2. No evidence of disease progression for ≥ 3 months or hemorrhage after treatment 3. Offtreatment with dexamethasone for 4 weeks before administration of the first dose of TAK228 4. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or antiepileptic drugs Step 2 Must be met after meeting step1inclusion and exclusion criteria. 1. Tumor must have dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. For the purposes of this study, patients must have either PTEN protein or genomic loss, or phosphatidylinositol4,5bisphosphate 3kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)/ Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation. Patients must be willing to provide sufficient archival tissue. If this is not available fresh tumor for biopsy is required. In the event that a patient has had tumor analyzed for PTEN/PIK3CA status through commercial means, their eligibility and need for additional tissue will be determined on a case by case basis by the principle investigator. Step 1 Exclusion Criteria 1. Any clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease, active central nervous system disease, active infection, or any other condition that could compromise the patient's participation in the study. 2. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. 3. Known hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection. 4. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol. 5. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before administration of the first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection. 6. Breast feeding or pregnant. 7. Manifestations of malabsorption due to prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, GI disease, or for an unknown reason that may alter the absorption of TAK228. In addition, patients with enteric stomata are also excluded. 8.
