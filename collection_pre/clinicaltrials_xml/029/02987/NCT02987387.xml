	<brief_summary>This study will confirm the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN XT Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) System in patients with a dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) conduit with a clinical indication for intervention in a post-market setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMPASSION XT PAS - Post-approval Study of the SAPIEN XT THV in Patients With Pulmonary Valve Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical study to assess the safety and effectiveness of pulmonic implantation of the SAPIEN THV in patients with dysfunctional RVOT conduits requiring treatment for moderate or severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and/or RVOT conduit obstruction with a mean gradient of â‰¥ 35 mmHg by TTE.</detailed_description>
