	<brief_summary>In this project the investigators will be using non-invasive brain stimulation on people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to improve leg muscle function. Two groups of participants will be recruited. One group will perform strength testing with and without the brain stimulation. After completing the strength testing the participants will walk for six minutes to see if any increases in strength translate into improve mobility. The second group of participants will perform a fatigue task, pulling against a wire at a low level of force, with and without the brain stimulation. This type of brain stimulation has been shown to transiently improve strength and fatigue measures in other populations, e.g. aged, Parkinson's, and improve cognitive abilities in people with multiple sclerosis. It is the investigator's hope that the increases in performance seen in other patient groups will also occur in people with multiple sclerosis. Future investigations will look to apply the non-invasive brain stimulation technique during physical rehabilitation to improve short and long term outcomes related to physical function.</brief_summary>
