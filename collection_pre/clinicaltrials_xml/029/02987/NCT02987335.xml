	<brief_summary>India has the world's highest prevalence of diabetes, expected to rise to 80 million by 2030. This includes many patients with lean diabetes, with low body mass index (BMI) and severe complications of diabetes. Despite its prevalence in India and other countries and its dire health consequences to individuals with the disease, little is known about the aetiopathogenesis and the genotype-phenotype relationship, lean diabetes being a cluster of low birth weight individuals, MODY, lipododystrophic disease, type 1 diabetes and fibrocalcific disease. While rudimentary tests have suggested defects in both insulin secretion and action, no comprehensive metabolic studies have been performed. It is therefore unclear as to how these patients should be treated. The optimal therapeutic adjunct whether a suitable oralantidiabetic agent or insulin is not yet determined. Defining the metabolic defects of 'lean' diabetes should have tremendous therapeutic benefit for millions of patients with this elusive condition.</brief_summary>
