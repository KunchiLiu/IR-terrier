	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two different lots of V114 in healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks (&gt;=42 days to &lt;=90 days) of age. The primary hypothesis of the study is that the proportion of participants receiving V114 who have serotype specific IgG &gt;=0.35 mcg/mL for each of pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F at 1 month after Dose 3 is non-inferior to that for recipients of Prevnar 13â„¢.</brief_summary>
