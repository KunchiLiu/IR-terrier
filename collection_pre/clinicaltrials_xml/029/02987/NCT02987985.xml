	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to determine whether an opioid-free general anesthetic (OFA) technique utilizing ketamine, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine, and gabapentin can help reduce postoperative respiratory depression in the post-anesthesia care unit and ward in children with sleep-disordered breathing undergoing tonsillectomy when compared with traditional opioid-containing techniques. It is expected that this OFA regimen will have a measurable reduction on postoperative respiratory depression in children with sleep-disordered breathing.</brief_summary>
