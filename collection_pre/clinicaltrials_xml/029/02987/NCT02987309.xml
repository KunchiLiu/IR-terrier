	<brief_summary>Dosing of nutrition in PICUs is mainly based on patient weight and assumptions on clinical status. There is however poor correlation between these calculations and actual energy consumption measured with indirect calorimetry (IC). Available equipment for IC has however been too cumbersome to use in daily clinical practice. Of relative new date is IC integrated in modern ventilators. This functionality is easy to use, but we do not know if the results are reliable for children. This study is a method comparison study comparing measurements done with SensorMedics Vmax ("gold standard") vs GE Carescape (modern ventilator with Integrated IC) in children undergoing intensive care treatment.</brief_summary>
