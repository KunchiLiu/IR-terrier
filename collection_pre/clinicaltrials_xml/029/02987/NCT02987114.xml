	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Oral Administration of PTL101 (Cannabidiol) as an Adjunctive Treatment for Pediatric Intractable Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, single-center study, approximately 15 male or female pediatric (ages 2-15, inclusive) patients with, intractable epilepsy, on stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), will participate in a 4-week observation period.The patient will then begin a 2-week dose-titration period. A maximum dose of 25 mg/kg per day, or 450 mg/day, the lower of the two. The subject will participate in a maintenance dose for 10 consecutive weeks, during which the legal patient will visit the clinic in the first and fifth week of the stable dose treatment period.
