	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of two combination of two tablets once daily: dolutegravir associated with emtricitabine / tenofovir versus darunavir / cobicistat associated with emtricitabine / tenofovir on DNA HIV measured in PBMC at 48 weeks in patients with primary HIV-1 infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Multicenter Trial Evaluating Two Treatments in Patients With Primary Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase III, randomized (1: 1), comparative, superiority, open-label, parallel assignment, national multicenter trial evaluating two treatments in patients with primary HIV-1 infection. Comparison of the two combinations regarding: - Viral reservoir at W48 - Early inhibition of viral replication, - Plasmatic and cellular cumulative viremia at W48, - Immune reconstitution with CD4, CD8 levels and CD4 / CD8 ratio, - Activation parameters decrease, - Adherence to treatments, - Treatments tolerance, - Adverse events, - Quality of life (by self-administered questionnaires). Study of the pharmacokinetics / dynamics relationship of the decay of plasma, cellular, rectal and spermatic compartments' viral loads. 50 participants per group will be enrolled in 40 sites in France. Co- inclusion in ANRS CO 06 PRIMO cohort will be offered</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years at screening visit. Patients with primary HIV1 infection: Any results achieved in the previous 10 days of screening will be taken into account. If the Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) test result does not dissociate the signals antibodies and p24 antigen: Negative ELISA and positive HIV1 RNA confirmed by a second positive HIV1 RNA. Positive ELISA and WBHIV1 [05] band (s) confirmed by a positive HIV1 RNA. If the ELISA test result dissociated p24 antigen and antibodies signals: ELISA Ac / p24 and positive HIV1 RNA confirmed by a second positive HIV1 RNA. ELISA Ac / p24 + confirmed by a positive HIV1 RNA. ELISA Ac + / p24 + or and WBHIV1 [05] band (s) confirmed by a positive HIV1 RNA. Written informed consent signed by the person and the investigator no later than the day of the screening visit and before any exam performed in the trial (article L112211 Public Health Code). Affiliate or beneficiary of a social security system (Article L112111 of the Public Health Code) (the State Medical Aid or AME is not a social security system). Patients followed in selected centers, accepting additional constraints and having signed a consent, will participate to virological, immunological and pharmacological substudies. Patient agreeing to participate in the trial for 1 year according to the defined terms. Treatment with Truvada® (for PreExposure Prohylaxis or Postexposure prophylaxis) during the 4 weeks preceding inclusion. Associated pathology with urgent care needed. Prothrombin Ratio &lt; 50%. Creatinine clearance &lt; 70 mL / min (Cockroft). aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), or bilirubin (total and conjugated) ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal. Patient with isolated HIV2 viral strain. Women of childbearing potential without effective contraception method (see appendix A6). Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Person under legal guardianship or deprived of liberty by a judicial or administrative decision. Patient participating in another research evaluating other treatments with an exclusion period ongoing at the screening visit. Planned absence which could prevent optimal trial participation (vacation abroad, moving, imminent job change ...). Coadministration of prohibited treatments (see § 9.5). History or presence of allergy to the study drugs or their components; Unstable liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by ChildPugh classification. Any symptoms or laboratory values suggesting a systemic disorder (renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary) or other medical conditions that could interfere with the interpretation of trial results or compromise the health of patients.</criteria>
