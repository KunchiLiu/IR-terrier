	<brief_summary>Spinal canal anesthesia is marked the most commonly used method of cesarean section. Traditional spinal anesthesia may cause post-dural puncture headache and low back pain.Plenty of parturients are undergoing anticoagulation therapy.They may be forced to accept general anesthesia in order to avoid epidural hematoma.Therefore, we propose minimally invasive spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Lumbar Aneasthesia Used for Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional group patients will receive cutting type 22 gauge needles, while minimally invasive group patients will receive pen type 27 gauge needles.Patients will be blinded to the intervention allocations. Spinal anesthesia will be performed with a standardized technique. Lumbar puncture will be performed through an interspace (L3-4 or L2-3) with patients in a lateral decubitus position. After free flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the needle tip be verified, 2ml ropivacaine will be injected. We will record puncture situation, anesthesia plane and measure post-dural puncture headache, post-operative back pain and epidural hematoma.</detailed_description>
