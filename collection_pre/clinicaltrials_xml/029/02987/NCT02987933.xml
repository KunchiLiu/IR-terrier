	<brief_summary>Resting state fMRI scans of chronic pain sufferers will be compared to those of healthy normals and may be sufficiently different to allow a high level of classification accuracy of whether subjects have chronic pain. In addition, investigators will utilize DTI and a brief activation state using pain rumination to assess whether investigators can reliably find differences between chronic pain sufferers and healthy normals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Resting State, fMRI and DTI in the Identification of Chronic Pain Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resting state fMRI scans of chronic pain sufferers may be sufficiently different from scans of normal subjects to allow a high level of classification accuracy of whether subjects have chronic pain. In addition, investigators will utilize DTI and a brief activation state using pain rumination to assess whether investigators can reliably find differences between chronic pain sufferers and healthy normals. The analysis will use pattern recognition methods in a leave N out cross validation design. The success of the classifications will be the mean of all the validation runs.</detailed_description>
