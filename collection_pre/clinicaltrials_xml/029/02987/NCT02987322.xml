	<brief_summary>Background: Honey, as a natural product produced by honey bees, has anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator properties. A few reports suggest that honey might have positive effects on cardiovascular diseases. Methods: This was a randomized controlled study, which was carried out on 50 children, aged 2 to 12 years, suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups: the honey group and the control group. In the honey group, honey was provided in a dose of 1.2g/kg/day for three months in addition to the traditional treatment of IDC. The patients in the control group received only their standard treatment, without honey. The main outcome measure was the percent change in the ejection fraction (EF) and the fraction shortening (FS) shown in echocardiography.</brief_summary>

The main outcome measure was the percent change in the ejection fraction (EF) and the fraction shortening (FS) shown in echocardiography. Patients in each group were subjected to history taking, clinical examination and investigations, including ECG and echocardiography at baseline and end of the study. Patients continued their standard treatment during the study. The honey used in the study was subjected to physicochemical analysis before use, and it was kept in closed containers away from light until the time of administration.</detailed_description>
