	<brief_summary>The judicious use of antibiotics is one of the main measures to limit the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogen related to excessive antimicrobial use. A recent study demonstrated that C-reactive protein (CRP) was as useful as procalcitonin (PCT) in reducing the time of antibiotic therapy in adult septic patients treated in the ICU setting. Therefore, the present study proposes to compare the time of use of antimicrobials, costs of hospitalization and clinical outcomes of interest among a group of antibiotic therapy guided by serum levels of CRP and a group of therapy based on the best practices of antibiotic therapy (Best Practice).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration of Antibiotic Therapy in Sepsis: C-reactive Protein-guided Therapy Versus Best Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All adult patients (aged&gt; 17 years), hospitalized at the ICU (total of 50 beds) of the Hospital das Clínicas - UFMG, with a diagnosis of sepsis, will be considered for inclusion. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be allocated randomly into one of the following groups: 1) PCR group: antibiotic therapy will be discontinued according to serum CRP levels; 2) "Best Practice" group, length of antibiotic therapy based on the most recent guidelines in the medical literature, according to the focus and / or causative micro-organism. PCR assays shall be performed daily on serum obtained from blood collected for routine intensive care examinations up to 2 days after antibiotic withdrawal. In the PCR group, antibiotic suspension will be encouraged when levels of this marker are &lt;25mg / L (if peak PCR below 100mg / L); or reduce 50% of the highest value (if PCR peak &gt; 100mg / L), with a limit of seven days, if there is clinical improvement. Primary outcomes will be duration of antibiotic therapy and antibiotic-free live days corrected for 1000 days of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes will be costs, clinical cure rate, therapeutic failure, 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, nosocomial infection rate, recurrence of infection, and isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria</detailed_description>
