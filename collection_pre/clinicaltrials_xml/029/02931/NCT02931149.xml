	<detailed_description>Background:To avoid complications secondary to advanced endoscopic resection techniques (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection -EMR- or Endoscopic Submucosal Disection -ESD-) the endoscopists have to avoid deep thermal damage and increase mucosal healing. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical endoscopic resection models. Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of PRP on participants submitted to advanced endoscopic resection techniques: EMR or ESD. Material and Methods: The investigators have evaluated a prospective clinical study. The investigators have included 12 participants submitted to EMR or ESD. Patients were informed and accepted to participate with a written consent. Prior to endoscopy PRP was obtained from autologous blood with a comercial kit. Submucosal injection with PRP were performed prior to resection. Resection was performed with standard technique. Participants were followed-up after the procedure.</detailed_description>
