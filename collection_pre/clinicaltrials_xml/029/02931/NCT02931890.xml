	<brief_summary>The CRITICS-II trial aims to identify the optimal preoperative regimen in resectable gastric cancer by comparing three investigational treatment arms: chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy and subsequent chemoradiotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy. The rationale behind this trial design is based on the following concepts: - Preoperative treatment is associated with better patient compliance than postoperative regimens - Preoperative treatment increases the likelihood of disease downsizing/downstaging and radical R0 resections - Preoperative paclitaxel/carboplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy and DOC chemotherapy are effective, feasible and safe regimens</brief_summary>
