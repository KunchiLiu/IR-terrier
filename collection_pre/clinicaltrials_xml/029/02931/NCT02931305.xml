	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial is to develop Epimedium Prenylflavonoid (EP) extract as a pharmaceutical-quality intervention for post-menopausal osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. There will be 3 cohorts of 10 healthy men each for the Phase 1 study. In each cohort, 8 men will receive the Epimedium capsules and 2 men will received the matched controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epimedium Prenylflavonoid (EP) Extract for Osteoporosis and Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prenylflavonoids and its glycoside derivatives isolated from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Epimedium, have potent estrogenic properties. The principal bioactive compounds in Epimedium are the prenylflavonoids, icaritin, and their glycosylated derivatives which can enhance osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization, inhibits bone resorption, and induces apoptosis of osteoclasts. Animal experiments indicate that icariin can prevent bone loss induced by ovariectomized (OVX) in rats, through its stimulatory effects on osteoblast growth and function, and inhibitory action on osteoclast cells. Epimedium has also demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits with positive actions on vascular reactivity, endothelial function and thrombosis in human subjects. Notably, icariin, demonstrated a significant nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasorelaxation of precontracted coronary arterial rings with intact endothelium in a concentration-dependent manner, via the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein and NO-cyclic guanidine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. Epimedium prenylflavonoids (EP) can prevent steroid-associated osteonecrosis in rabbit model and notably, reduce thrombosis incidence and shrink fat-cell-size significantly. This striking combination of properties highlights the immense potential in EP for osteoporosis and cardiovascular health.</detailed_description>
