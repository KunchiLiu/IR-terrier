	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver SUVmax as reference can better interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT and predict disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating 18F-FDG PET/CT With Liver SUVmax-based Criteria for Prognosis of Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study investigators develope a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver SUVmax as reference to interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold (1.6 fold of liver SUVmax) or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. Investigators compare the prognostic accuracy of the liver SUVmax-based criteria with the 5-PS criteria and Î”SUVmax interpretation with respect to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL. Furthermore,investigators improve the prognostic ability of interim PET/CT by comparing the results to the clinical prognostic factors.</detailed_description>
