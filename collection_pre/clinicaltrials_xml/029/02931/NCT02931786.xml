	<brief_summary>Investigators researched the effect of two different types of drugs on core body temperature during magnetic resonance imaging. The hypothesis is in ketamine group, thermo disregulation is not as distinct as in propofol group, due to its positive effect on thermo regulation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Propofol and Ketofol on Core Body Temperature in MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous anesthetics may impair thermoregulation. Absorption of radiofrequency waves by the body surface may result in heating, especially in small children during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Investigators applied two different intravenous anesthetics as propofol and ketamine and studied the effect of these drugs on core body temperature. All patients aged between 6 months-10 years were administered midazolam and atropine. After that 1 mg/ kg of propofol was applied in group I, and 0,1 ml/kg of propofol ketamine mixture ( 10 mg/ml each) was applied in group II. Core body temperatures were taken before and after MRI and compared.</detailed_description>
