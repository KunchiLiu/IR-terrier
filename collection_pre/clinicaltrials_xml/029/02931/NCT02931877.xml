	<brief_summary>As the investigators know, postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a fairly well-documented clinical phenomenon, which affect patients' short-term and long-term outcome. Most patients will receive general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac valvular surgery. Inhalation sevoflurane based and propofol based anesthesia are most commonly used strategy for general anesthesia. At present, it was unknown that which one is better in providing cerebral protection effect for patients undergoing cardiac valvular surgery with CPB. The current study aimed to explore the possible difference.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Postoperative Outcome After Sevoflurane and Propofol Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is not different in patients received intravenous anesthetics propofol or sevoflurane for their cardiac valvular surgery. Two groups of general anesthetics (propofol or sevoflurane) are used to explore the possible difference of the postoperative outcome and the incidence of POCD. After cardiac valvular surgery with CPB, patients' POCD tests at 7 days and 3 months after the surgery, and postoperative delirium, etc., are evaluated by different questionnaires. Also the blood sample of these patients are collected for detection of some stress hormones.</detailed_description>
