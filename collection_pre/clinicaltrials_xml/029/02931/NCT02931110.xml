	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a Phase 1, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort-expansion study (Part 2) evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of CBL0137. The study will evaluate CBL0137 administered IV weekly on Days 1 and 8 of repeated 21 day treatment cycles in subjects with previously treated hematological malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of IV CBL0137 in Previously Treated Hematological Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety and pharmacology of a range of CBL0137 doses administered IV in subjects with previously treated lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Part 2 of the study provides cohort expansion to further explore the safety, pharmacology, and clinical activity of CBL0137 monotherapy in subjects with specific previously treated hematological cancers, including DLBCL, FL, MCL, HL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and multiple myeloma (MM).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Presence of an active hematological malignancy: Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Diagnosis of Bcell DLBCL, FL, MCL, or HL, as documented by medical records. Part 2 (Cohort Expansion): Diagnosis of DLBCL, FL, MCL, HL, CLL/SLL, ALL, MM, or AML as documented in medical records. Requirement for therapy of the hematological malignancy due to diseaserelated symptoms, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, extranodal organ involvement, or progressive disease. Hematological malignancy has been previously treated, has relapsed after or progressed during prior therapy, and has limited potential for benefit from currently available therapy, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Presence of measurable disease: For subjects with DLBCL, FL, MCL, HL, or CLL/SLL: presence of radiographically measurable lymphadenopathy or extranodal lymphoid malignancy (defined as the presence of ≥1 lesion that measures ≥2.0 cm in the longest dimension [LD] and ≥1.0 cm in the longest perpendicular dimension [LPD] as assessed by computed tomography [CT]). For subjects with MM, measurable disease with serum monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (Mprotein) ≥1 g/dL, or urine Mprotein protein ≥200 mg/24 hours, or involved serum free light chain (SFLC) ≥10 mg/dL. For subjects with ALL or AML, presence of &gt;5% blasts in the bone marrow (based on a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy sample with ≥200 nucleated cells and the presence of bone marrow spicules) and/or &gt;1 x 109/L blasts in the peripheral blood (with the restriction that peripheral blast count in subjects with AML must be &lt;50 x 109/L prior to the start of study therapy). Rapidly progressive, clinically unstable central nervous system hematological malignancy. Note: Central nervous system evaluation is only required in subjects with known or suspected central nervous system malignancy. Significant cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction, arterial thromboembolism, or cerebrovascular thromboembolism, within 6 months prior to start of study therapy; symptomatic dysrhythmias or unstable dysrhythmias requiring medical therapy; angina requiring therapy; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease; New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure; uncontrolled Grade ≥3 hypertension (diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg or systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) despite antihypertensive therapy; or history of congenital prolonged QT syndrome. Significant screening ECG abnormalities, including unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, atrial fibrillation/flutter, left bundlebranch block, 2nddegree atrioventricular (AV) block type II, 3rd degree AV block, Grade ≥2 bradycardia, or QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt;450 msec (for men) or &gt;470 msec (for women). Ongoing risk for bleeding due to active peptic ulcer disease or bleeding diathesis or requirement for systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, lowmolecularweight heparin or heparin fractions (eg, enoxaparin, dalteparin, fondaparinux) or oral anticoagulants (eg, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate, warfarin). Note: Use of heparin or thrombolytic agents for local maintenance or clearance of a central venous catheter is permitted. Evidence of an ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (including upper respiratory tract infections) at the time of start of study therapy. Note: Subjects with localized fungal infections of skin or nails are eligible. Please speak with Investigator for the complete Inclusion/Exclusion criteria.</criteria>
