	<brief_summary>There are currently no studies evaluating the effect of anacetrapib on blood vessel function and stiffness of the arteries. The REVEAL-Vasc trial will assess whether anacetrapib, in addition to atorvastatin (LDL-C lowering drug) treatment, results in greater endothelial-dependent vascular function and aortic stiffness in patients with established cardiovascular disease, compared to adding placebo. Participants will be asked to provide a blood sample and pulse Wave Velocity/Pulse Wave Analysis and Flow Mediated Dilation will be carried out to assess blood vessel function and stiffness of the arteries. REVEAL-Vasc is an investigator led sub-study of HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL (Randomized Evaluation of the Effects of Anacetrapib through Lipid modification): A large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled trial of the clinical effects of anacetrapib among people with established vascular disease (NCT01252953) which is coordinated by OXFORD CTSU. No treatment will be received on this sub-study, therefore only participants who have been enrolled in HPS3/TIMI55 REVEAL in which participants received anacetrapib with atorvastatin or placebo will be considered for this trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>REVEAL-Vasc is an investigator led sub-study of HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL. Participants who previously enrolled on HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL and received treatment will be invited to participate in this sub-study. Participants will attend a screening and an assessment visit during which Pulse Wave Velocity/ Pulse Wave Analysis and Flow Mediated Dilation will be carried out to assess blood vessel function and stiffness. A blood sample will also be taken from participant to assess CRP and lipid profile. Since participants will have received treatment on the main trial HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL, no treatment will be received on this sub-study.</detailed_description>
