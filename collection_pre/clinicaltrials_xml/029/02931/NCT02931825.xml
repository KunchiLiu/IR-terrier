	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer is one the most frequent cancer in developed countries. In France, it rank third with 43000 new cases in 2015. French Health Authority recommended colonoscopy screening for people with a high risk for colorectal cancer. But this compliance with colonoscopy is low (20-40%), it is therefore necessary to develop new strategies to improve compliance. The purpose of this project is to to offer and evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of a specific surveillance system for high risk people for colorectal cancer The project will be divided into 2 phases: Objectives of the first phase: - Identify high risk people for colorectal cancer in the department of Indre-et-Loire, - Fill in as completely as possible their colonoscopic history in the past 5 years, - Estimate the proportion of high risk people for colorectal cancer in the target population for colorectal cancer screening in Indre-et-Loire (Men and women aged from 50 to 74 years). Objective of the second phase: Compare the performed colonoscopy rate of high risk people for colorectal cancer without notion of colonoscopy in the past 58 months following or not (control group) the sending of a letter reminding the importance of compliance with colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
