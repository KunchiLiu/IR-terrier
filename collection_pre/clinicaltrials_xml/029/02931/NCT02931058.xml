	<brief_title>Quadriceps Exercise Before Total Knee Arthroplasty (The QUADX-1 Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA) have decreased knee-extension strength and suffer from knee pain. Strengthening of the knee-extensor muscle is a key element in conservative treatment for patients with knee OA. However, the most effective exercise dosage for knee-extension strength exercise is unknown. In this trial the investigators investigate the efficacy of three different dosages of knee-extension strength exercise. Patients eligible for total knee replacement are offered home-based pre-operative knee-extension exercise and are randomly allocated to one of three exercise dosage groups. There is no control group. The knee-extension exercise is performed with an elastic exercise band mounted with sensor (BandCizer) which registers when the patients exercise, how much they exercise and how they exercise. The intervention time is 12 weeks and the primary time point of interest is after exercise/just before surgery. Secondary time points of interest are shortly after surgery and three months after surgery. The patients are given detailed exercise instruction at trial entry and hereafter they exercise unsupervised at home for 12 weeks. At week 4 and 8 they receive follow-up instruction. Embedded in the trial is a qualitative study. Focus group interviews will be performed with the participating patients about their experienced enablers and barriers related to adherence to the home-based intervention, once the post-operative outcome assessment has been completed. Likewise, the orthopedic surgeons and physiotherapists allocated to the trial will undergo focus group interviews, once the trial is completed, to explore their experienced enablers and barriers related to administering the home-based intervention.
