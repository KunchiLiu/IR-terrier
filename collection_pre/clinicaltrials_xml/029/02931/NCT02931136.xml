	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is based on the Flutemetamol-PET senile plaque imaging to investigate the peripheral blood biochemical and brain MRI imaging biomarkers and to research completely independent intellectual property rights neuropsychological test tool for the MCI due to AD. At the same time, the investigators will study the efficacy and safety of early treatment of MCI due to AD by Huperzine A in 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
