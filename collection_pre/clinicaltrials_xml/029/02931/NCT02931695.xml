	<brief_summary>QT interval prolongation, corrected for heart rate (QTc), either spontaneous or drug-induced, is associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death. Women are at higher risk of torsades de pointes, particularly during post-partum and the follicular phase. The aim of this study is to explore if QTc duration is prolonged during post-partum as compared to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Sex Hormones Variation During Third Trimester of Pregnancy and Post-partum on QT Interval Duration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sex steroid hormones are known to influence heart repolarization. Overall, estradiol is considered to promote QTc lengthening while progesterone and testosterone shorten QTc. New findings suggest more complex regulation of QTc by sex steroid hormones involving also follicle-stimulating hormone, which is associated to prolongation of QTc. Another important aim of this study is to study the influence of sex hormones on QTc duration.</detailed_description>
