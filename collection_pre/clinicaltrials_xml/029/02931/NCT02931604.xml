Not able to stop anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin) until the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is below 1.5. 13. Not able to stop antiplatelet (e.g., clopidogrel, aspirin, etc.) for at least 14 days prior to study procedure. 14. Not able to stop any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications and homeopathic medications for at least 14 days prior to the study procedure. 15. Pregnancy. 16. Psychiatric disease. 17. Currently participating in other drug or device studies. 18. Investigator's opinion that the subject should not be in the study such as any conditions that could compromise the wellbeing of the patient or integrity of the study or prevent the patient from meeting or performing study requirements. 19. Patient is not capable of following the study schedule for any reason.</criteria>
