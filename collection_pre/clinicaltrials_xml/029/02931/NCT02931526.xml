	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics(PK/PD) of tigecycline in critical ill patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy（CRRT）and examine whether the dosage needs adjustment. The study will observe two groups of patients respectively and compare the difference between them. Patients who need to receive CRRT when treat with high-dose tigecycline will be collected in Group CRRT. Patients who treat with high-dose tigecycline only will be collected in Group non-CRRT.</brief_summary>
