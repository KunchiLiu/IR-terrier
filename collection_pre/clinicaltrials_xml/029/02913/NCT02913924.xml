	<brief_summary>The protocol is a double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient and outpatient study, combining an inpatient model of cannabis withdrawal with a clinical treatment of cannabis use disorder using clonazepam versus placebo. 80 patients seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder will be enrolled into the inpatient phase for 5 nights. After discharge from the inpatient phase, 12-weeks of outpatient treatment will be conducted. This combined design will provide a comprehensive understanding of clonazepam's effects on individuals with cannabis use disorder across a range of outcome measures while also testing the medication's ability to prevent relapse in cannabis-abstinent patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Clonazepam on Cannabis Withdrawal and Relapse in Treatment-seeking Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients seeking treatment for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) will be enrolled into an inpatient laboratory for 5 nights, where they will be initiated on medication and be assessed for the influence of clonazepam (or placebo) on (1) cannabis withdrawal (mood, sleep, cannabis craving, food intake), ratings associated with medication abuse liability, cognitive performance, and (2) relapse to cannabis use after patients (now abstinent from cannabis) leave the inpatient setting maintained on clonazepam (or placebo) for 8 weeks (with a 4-week, medication-free follow up). This combined design will provide a comprehensive understanding of clonazepam's effects on individuals with cannabis use disorder across a range of outcome measures (safety, abuse liability, withdrawal symptoms) while also testing the medication's ability to prevent relapse in cannabis-abstinent patients.</detailed_description>
