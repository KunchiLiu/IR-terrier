	<brief_title>Latarjet Versus Modified Eden-Hybinette for Anterior Shoulder Dislocation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Latarjet technique has proven reliable for the treatment of dislocations, with lower recurrence rates (5%) even in the presence of bone lesions. This technique allows a stable fixation of the graft, with 2 screws, and the dynamic effect of the conjoint tendon, the sling effect. However, several complications are described, such as neurological injuries, nonunion and graft resorption. Hamel et al, showed that vascularization of the coracoid graft is impaired during the course of Latarjet procedure. Together with the small thickness of the coracoid, it may justify its high rate of resorption. The Eden-Hybinette surgery does not have the potential advantages of the sling effect. However, it allows a better restoration of the area of the glenoid, without the risks related to the coracoid osteotomy. All clinical studies about the different bone grafting techniques have a low quality. Furthermore, there is no comparative study of the techniques of Latarjet and Eden-Hybinette.</detailed_description>
