	<brief_summary>Exercise interventions to prevent dementia and delay cognitive decline have gained considerable attention in recent years. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that regular physical activity targets brain function by increasing cognitive reserve. Although initial studies indicate enhanced cognitive performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) following an exercise intervention, little is known about the effect of an extensive, controlled and regular exercise regimen on the neuropathology of patients with MCI. The aim of this study is to compare a 12- month aerobic exercise programme versus a stretching and toning (non-aerobic) programme versus a control group on the progression of cognitive decline in MCI. It is hypothesized that MCI-related decreases in cognitive and psychomotor functioning will show less progression or even be improved after a one-year aerobic exercise intervention compared to a group of patients undergoing stretching and toning exercise as well as to a control group provided with no intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of an Extensive Exercise Program on the Progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomised controlled clinical intervention study will take place across three European sites; the German Sport University Cologne, Germany, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands and Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Seventy-five previously sedentary patients with a clinical diagnosis of MCI will be recruited at each site. Participants will be randomised to one of three intervention arms. One group will receive a standardised one-year extensive aerobic exercise intervention (3 units of 45min / week). The second group will complete stretching and toning (non-aerobic) exercise (3 units of 45min / week) and the third group will receive usual care. Change in all outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), after six months (T1) and after 12 months (T2).</detailed_description>
