	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if patients taking Anti Arrhythmia Drugs (AAD's) after cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation, compared to patients who do not take Anti- Arrhythmic Drugs after an ablation affect Atrial Fibrillation from coming back. The study will also look at the side effects of the AAD's.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation 90 Days Post Cryoballoon Ablation With and Without Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a cornerstone ablation strategy used in the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and it is a class IA indication for anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) refractory symptomatic PAF. However, the consensus statements are vague about the utility of AAD management during the 90-day blanking window post-PVI. Moreover, there is no specific guidance to cryoballoon users on the usage of AADs during the 90-day blanking period that exists anywhere in the published literature. Simply, these studies have not been conducted with the cryoballoon procedure.</detailed_description>
