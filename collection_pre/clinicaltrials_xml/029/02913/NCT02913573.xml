	<brief_title>Effect of Pectoral Nerve Block on Post-op Pain in Patients Undergoing Mastectomy and Immediate Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing total mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction with a tissue expander or implant under general anesthesia will be randomly assigned to the addition of a pectoral nerve block or no regional block after induction of general anesthesia and prior to the start of surgery. Post-operative pain scores and post-operative pain medication usage will be recorded. Post-operative nausea/vomiting scores and post-op anti-emetic medication usage will be recorded.
