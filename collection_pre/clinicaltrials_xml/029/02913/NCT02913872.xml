	<brief_summary>What are the capacity and training needs in general practice to implement routine spirometry and eNO testing in children aged 5-16 years? Asthma is the commonest long-term disease of childhood in the United Kingdom (UK). Under-diagnosis and under-treatment of childhood asthma in general practice (GP) have been reported from several European countries including the UK. This can result in poor symptom control and increased risk of asthma related deaths. It has been suggested that both under- and over- diagnosis of childhood asthma in general practice could be improved by routinely using objective lung function testing for diagnosis and monitoring. The proposed objective lung function tests (spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide measurements - eNO) are already used routinely in UK hospitals, but are not usually available in general practice where most children are cared for. Why is it important? - Availability of these tests will help health professionals in general practice to look after children with asthma better, and hopefully improve asthma control. What will this study achieve? - Though it is believed that providing spirometry and eNO in general practice would be beneficial, there is little data on how this can be achieved. This study will employ both qualitative and quantitative measures in order to evaluate the resources required to implement routine spirometry and eNO testing for children in primary care; and to investigate the impact this would have on diagnosis in children with suspected asthma. How? - The investigators will work with general practices in and around Leicestershire, UK. Firstly, to identify what the barriers are to implementing these tests, and secondly to train the practices to perform and interpret spirometry and eNO independently in children. Children with suspected or previously diagnosed asthma will be invited for review and lung function testing. The investigators will record the time it takes to train general practices to perform and interpret spirometry and eNO independently, and the additional clinic capacity required to provide these tests.</brief_summary>
