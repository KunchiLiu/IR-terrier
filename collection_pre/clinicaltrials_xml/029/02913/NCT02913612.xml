Clinical diagnosis of superficial cutaneous or mucosal infantile hemangioma (must include all of the following): a. Superficial lesion in the dermis b. Thin &lt;2 mm in thickness c. Small &lt;5 cm2 d. Involves skin or keratinized mucosa Exclusion Criteria 1. History of previous treatment with any pharmacologic or laser therapy for IH 2. Ongoing therapy with an oral beta blocker or oral corticosteroid for an unrelated condition (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, adrenal insufficiency, upper airway obstruction, tetralogy of fallot (TOF), hypertension, reactive airways disease) 3. IH that requires systemic therapy (defined by dynamic complication scale &gt;3) 4. IH of the nonkeratinized mucosa 5. Infants with more than one hemangioma that requires therapy 6.
