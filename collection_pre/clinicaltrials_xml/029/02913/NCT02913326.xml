	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, prospective, international, randomized (1:1), open-label study with two parallel groups. This phase III study is planned to investigate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate versus dose-adjusted warfarin on a net clinical benefit endpoint of major bleeding (ISTH criteria) and new venous thrombotic event (VTE) (primary endpoint) with blinded endpoint adjudication.</brief_summary>
