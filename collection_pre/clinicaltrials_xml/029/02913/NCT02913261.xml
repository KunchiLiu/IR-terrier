	<criteria>Have undergone Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplanttaion (alloSCT) from any donor source (matched unrelated donor, sibling, haploidentical) using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood. Recipients of non myeloablative, myeloablative, and reduced intensity conditioning are eligible Clinically diagnosed Grades II to IV acute GvHD as per standard criteria occurring after alloSCT requiring systemic immune suppressive therapy. Biopsy of involved organs with aGvHD is encouraged but not required for study screening. Confirmed diagnosis of steroid refractory aGvHD (confirmed within 48h prior to study treatment start) defined as patients administered highdose systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day [or equivalent prednisone dose 2.5 mg/kg/day]), given alone or combined with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and either: Progressing based on organ assessment after 5 days compared to organ stage at the time of initiation of highdose systemic corticosteroid +/ CNI for the treatment of Grade IIIV aGvHD, OR Failure to achieve at a minimum partial response based on organ assessment after 7 days compared to organ stage at the time of initiation of highdose systemic corticosteroid +/ CNI for the treatment of Grade IIIV aGvHD,OR Patients who fail corticosteroid taper defined as fulfilling either one of the following criteria: Requirement for an increase in the corticosteroid dose to methylprednisolone ≥2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent prednisone dose ≥2.5 mg/kg/day) , OR Failure to taper the methylprednisolone dose to &lt;1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent prednisone dose &lt;1.25 mg/kg/day) for a minimum 7 days. Has received more than one systemic treatment for aGvHD, other than corticosteroids +/ CNI (prophylaxis or treatment). Presence of an active uncontrolled infection including significant bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection requiring treatment. Infections are considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of screening, no signs of progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection. Evidence of active viral infection (confirmed by peripheral blood viral load) including Cytomegalovirus (CMV), EpsteinBarr Virus (EBV), Human Herpes Virus6 (HHV6), Hepatitis Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Patients with pretransplant positive serology results indicative of high risk for viral reactivation must have negative viral load results within 28 days prior to randomization. Patients whose immune status is unknown or uncertain (e.g. serologies not obtained prior to transplant) must have viral load results confirming no evidence of active viral infection within 28 days prior to randomization. Presence of relapsed primary malignancy, or who have been treated for relapse after the alloHSCT was performed, or who may require rapid immune suppression withdrawal as preemergent treatment of early malignancy relapse. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
