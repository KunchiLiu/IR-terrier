	<brief_title>Conservative vs Surgical Treatment for Proximal Humerus Fractures in the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different methods have been used in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Usually, treatment choice depends on fracture displacement, patient age, osteoporosis, and other characteristics. Locking plate fixation has become the most widely used method among surgical techniques, while partial arthroplasty is reserved for older patients and comminuted articular fractures. Generally, nonsurgical treatment involves a brief period with sling immobilization and physiotherapy rehabilitation. A recent multicenter study showed no difference between conservative and surgical treatments, including internal fixation with locking plates. Two other randomized studies showed mixed results, with no relevant clinical differences between the methods. No previous trial has evaluated the quality of reduction in surgically treated fractures and its relation to outcomes. Our study aims to compare both techniques with a detailed radiographic and tomographic evaluation, in elderly patients. We also aim to evaluate the influence of reduction and plate positioning on clinical outcomes. This is a single center trial, in which surgeries will be performed by only two experienced surgeons.</detailed_description>
