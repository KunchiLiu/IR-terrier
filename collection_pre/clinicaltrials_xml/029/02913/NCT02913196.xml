	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, Phase I study of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate, docetaxel and prednisone in patients with metastatic mastrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This study is designed to determine the dose that apalutamide can be administered safely in combination with abiraterone acetate, docetaxel and prednisone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial of Apalutamide Plus Abiraterone Acetate, Docetaxel, and Prednisone in Patients With mCRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are enrolled in up to three 3-6-subject cohorts and are administered combination (apalutamide, abiraterone acetate and docetaxel plus prednisone) according to a dose-escalation schedule. The first dose of docetaxel infusion begins on Day 1 Cycle 1. Daily oral apalutamide, abiraterone acetate plus twice-daily oral prednisone begins on Day 1 Cycle 1. Docetaxel 1-hour infusions are administered intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W), preceded by oral dexamethasone. While a subject is receiving chemotherapy, a treatment cycle is defined as 21 days. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determination is based on toxicities observed within the initial 2 cycles defined as 6 weeks. DLT will be assessed before the start of the third docetaxel infusion. Once a combination dose is determined to be safe (i.e. no more than 2 of 6 subjects experience DLT), the next cohort will enroll. Subjects remain at their allocated combination dose until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The primary objective is to determine a safe dose combination of apalutamide plus abiraterone acetate, docetaxel, prednisone in subjects with mCRPC.</detailed_description>

Prior exposure to apalutamide. Prior exposure to abiraterone acetate and/or other CYP17 inhibitors, enzalutamide is allowed (but not preferred) only during the dose escalation period. 4.
