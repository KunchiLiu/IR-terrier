	<brief_summary>Heart surgery can evolve with complications in the postoperative phase, mainly of a respiratory nature, atelectasis and hypoxemia being the main pulmonary dysfunctions. They can lead to increased length of hospitalization, being the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the postoperative phase of heart surgery. In order to prevent or reduce such complications noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used in the postoperative period in a prophylactic and therapeutic manner. The use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is already widely spread in intensive Care Unit (ICU), being used in patients under mechanical ventilation (MV), NIV and exercises with intermittent positive pressure and has huge scientific publication reporting its benefits for the pulmonary function. The alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) consists of sustained increase of pressure in the airway using PEEP in individuals with hypoxemia, in order to minimize the deleterious effects arising from alveolar collapse, providing a more homogeneous ventilation of the pulmonary parenchyma increasing the pulmonary area available for gas exchange and, consequently, arterial oxygenation. In recent years the increase in the application of PEEP in cardiopathic patients under MV has shown great benefits and the use of NIV to improve oxygenation by the reversal of atelectasis is already widely used and recommended in hospital routine. Despite NIV being used in great proportion, the relevant literature is poor in showing studies with NIV and ARM associated in heart surgery. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate if the use of NIV associated with ARM improves oxygenation in patients in postoperative revascularization of the myocardium related to usual use without ARM, and if it can be applied in a safe manner.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Using Noninvasive Ventilation in Cardiac Postoperative With Alveolar Recruitment Maneuver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This work was a randomized clinical trial, where patients were analyzed in postoperative phase of myocardial revascularization with extracorporeal circulation respecting the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The secrecy of the location was achieved by opaque envelope and the electronic method was used for randomization. Patients, doctors and nursing team did not know to which group the patient was randomized, only the physiotherapy team which was responsible for the therapy with use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) knowing the group after randomization. All the patients were ventilated in Servo I and to execute NIV they used the total face mask. After extubation the patient who was randomized to the Control Group or Recruitment Group: Control Group use NIV for 30 minutes with pressure support for a tidal volume of 6 ml/Kg, PEEP 8 cm H2O, oxygen inspired fraction for a peripheral arterial Saturation of Oxygen (SpO2) ≥ 95%. Recruitment group use NIV with alveolar recruitment maneuver with PEEP 15 cm H2O and afterwards 20 cm H2O remaining 2 minutes in each, then being maintained in NIV for 30 minutes with pressure support for a tidal volume of 6 ml/Kg, PEEP 8 cm H2O, oxygen inspired fraction for a SpO2 ≥ 95%. The use of NIV was already routine of the institution and recommendation of the Brazilian Directives of MV and Brazilian Consensus of MV and did not have any potential risk. The execution of recruitment with NIV could have the risk of barotrauma, hemodynamic instability and arrhythmia. The medical team would be called to evaluate the patient if clinical instability occurred during or after recruitment and would take the measured required for the integrity of the patient. Safety criteria for Interruption of recruitment: - respiratory rate &gt; 35 rpm; - heart rate &gt;120 or &lt; 20 basal points; - Systolic pressure &lt; 90 or &gt; 16 mmHg; - Acute appearance of arrhythmia; - Patient's request. The patients executed NIV three times per day with the physiotherapy team of the unit as the routine until discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the gasometry and X-ray examinations were collected as sector routine. The arterial gasometry was collected after 10 minutes in ambient air or before if SpO2 &lt; 88, the X-ray being executed without NIV. All postoperative patients of the ICU had therapy with physiotherapy once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once or twice at night and only the physiotherapist installed NIV. All the patients were guided concerning how their therapy would be and, if they had queries, they were clarified before the start. Patients who worsen with respiratory rate &gt; 35 rpm, pH &lt; 7.30 and/or PaO2 &lt; 50 mmHg despite supplementary oxygen, neurological deterioration with requirements of reintubation, should be considered to be failure of extubation.</detailed_description>
