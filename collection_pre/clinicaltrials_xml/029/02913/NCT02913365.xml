	<brief_title>Etiologies, Investigations and Outcomes of Patients Presenting With Hemoptysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE: Hemoptysis, mild or massive, is worrisome for both patients and physicians. The management is different depending on the causes, which are not well defined for the North American population. Despite the fact that this symptom is commonly reported in clinic, there are only a few studies published on this subject in the North-American population. Tuberculosis was a frequent cause of hemoptysis described in populations overseas, which seems less prevalent in the investigators center. Also, there are no known official guidelines regarding the investigation and management of hemoptysis. The investigators hypothesized that the use of modern technology in a North American population may result in different findings and provide a more accurate diagnostic approach. Therefore, the study compares the different etiologies of hemoptysis and investigation modalities used in patients presenting in a North-American tertiary center. METHOD: The investigators did a retrospective analysis of medical chart from patients with hemoptysis who visited the investigators center between 2005 and 2010. Each visit has been reviewed individually to describe the characteristics of patients, etiologies of hemoptysis and investigation modalities used. All-cause mortality at 2 years was also recorded. Descriptive statistical analyses will conducted on the data available.</detailed_description>
