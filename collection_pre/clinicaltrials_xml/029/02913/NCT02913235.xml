	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present investigation is to record and compare bacterial compositions in supragingival plaque samples and saliva samples in subjects discontinuing regular oral hygiene for 10 days. The hypothesis is that the composition of the salivary microbiota might reflect local bacterial alterations in relation to discontinuation of oral hygiene.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>35 orally healthy individuals will be enrolled in this study, in which they will discontinue regular oral hygiene procedures for a period of 10 days. Clinical registrations and collection of microbiological samples (supragingival and saliva) will be performed at baseline and 4, 7 and 10 days after discontinuation of regular oral hygiene, and will be repeated 14 days after regular oral hygiene has been resumed.</detailed_description>
