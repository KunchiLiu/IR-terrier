	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of RO7051790 in participants with relapsed ED SCLC. This dose escalation and expansion study plans to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or optimal biological dose as a recommended Phase 2 dose for RO7051790, based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of RO7051790.</brief_summary>
