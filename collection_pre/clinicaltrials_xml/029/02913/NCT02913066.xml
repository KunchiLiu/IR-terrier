	<brief_title>S-1 IMRT Versus S-1 and Cisplatin Concurrent IMRT in Inoperable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will meet the inclusion criteria of patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, divided into 2 groups randomly: Experimental group: radiotherapy combined with S-1 chemotherapy; control group: radiotherapy combined with S-1 chemotherapy for first to 14 days and 29 ~ 42 days, plus cisplatin first 1~ 4 days and 29 ~ 33 days. Using IMRT radiotherapy. Two weeks after radiotherapy finish, two cycle adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 70 mg/m2 1~ 14 days, or S-1 70 mg/m2 1~ 14 days, plus cisplatin 25mg/m2 1~ 4 days, 21 days for a cycle. Primary Outcome Measure is complete remission rate. Secondary Outcome Measures are overall survival (OS) and Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) and toxicity.</detailed_description>
