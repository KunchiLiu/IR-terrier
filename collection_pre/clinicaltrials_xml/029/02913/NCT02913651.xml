	<brief_summary>Autonomic nervous system dysfunction has been described in narcolepsy with cataplexy affecting the sympathetic function. In this study the investigators analyzed whether altered diurnal and nocturnal cardiovascular control is present in idiopathic hypersomnia. Drug-free patients diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia and age-matched controls were included. Clinical data, 24-h polysomnography, heart rate variability and the heart rate response to spontaneous arousal are analyzed.</brief_summary>
