	<brief_summary>Large glucose excursions at breakfast are prevalent in type 2 diabetes and can contribute to sustained hyperglycaemia across the day. Lowering consumption of dietary carbohydrate is known to reduce post-meal glucose excursions but it is unknown whether lowering the carbohydrate at breakfast only will impact subsequent post meal glucose excursions throughout the day. The aim of this study is to examine, under free living conditions and using typical dietary patterns, whether eating a breakfast low in carbohydrate can lower daily post-meal glycemia when compared to consuming a low-fat breakfast (per the current diabetes guidelines).</brief_summary>
