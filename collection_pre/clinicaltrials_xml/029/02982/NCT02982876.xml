	<brief_summary>Silicone stents are used as standard of care to identify which patients with excessive dynamic airway collapse will benefit from a definitive surgical treatment. However, the specific way in which these stents are effective has not been tested. The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of the silicone stent when used in the airways of patients with severe symptomatic excessive dynamic airway collapse compared to patients with severe symptomatic excessive dynamic airway collapse that do not receive silicone stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Silicone Airway Stents for Excessive Dynamic Airway Collapse: A Randomized Placebo Controlled Double-Blinded Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This randomized placebo controlled double-blinded trial will be conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Standards and under IRB supervision. We plan to enroll total of 60 patients with EDAC randomized by a computer generated system to either intervention group (Silicone Stent) or Placebo group (Sham Procedure). Description of the study Previous to appointment all patients will have Airway CT scan, 6 minute walk test and pulmonary function test as per protocol and standard of care. Enrollment Patients with severe EDAC who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical management will be informed about the trial and if interested will be recruited for the study. Operative Technique All patients will undergo dynamic flexible bronchoscopy under light sedation and rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. The treatment group will undergo a bronchial wash and placement of a Y-silicone stent. Silicone stent Based on the patient's airway anatomy an endotracheal Dumon Y silicone stent (Endoxane, Novatech S.A., Aubagne-France) or a Channick Y silicone stent (Hood Laboratories, Pembroke, MA, 02359) will be used in the study. Both options are made of silicone histocompatible with tracheal bronchial tissue. These devices are FDA approved for benign airway disease such as tracheobronchomalacia. During Stent Trial After the bronchoscopy all patients in the intervention and placebo arm will receive a standardized protocol using mucolytic and expectorant (nebulizer treatments using mucolytic (N-acetylcysteine) for 15 minutes BID, Guafenesin (MucinexÂ®) 1200 mg BID, codeine as needed and Flutter valve BID) by blinded health provided. Follow-up The patients will be scheduled for a follow-up visit in the next 7-10 days after rigid bronchoscopy in the outpatient clinic, 6MWTs and PFTs. The outcomes will be measured and then all patients (placebo and treatment group) will be un-blinded. Stent removal The patients will be scheduled, at no more than 14 days after stent insertion, for removal in the operating room.</detailed_description>
