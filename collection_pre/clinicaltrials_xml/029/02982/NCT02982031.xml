	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare ultrasound visibility of the lumbar plexus at the intertransverse space between paramedian transverse scan and shamrock technique. Moreover obtaining a clear image of relevant structures is imperative. Thus, the secondary objective was to assess ultrasound visibility of each relevant structure and overall visibility between these two methods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Visualization Between Shamrock Technique and Paramedian Transverse Scan in Lumbar Plexus Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block (USG LPB) is regarded as a form of advanced ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (USGRA). One of the key challenges of USG LPB is visualization of the lumbar plexus. That are currently in use for ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus blockade - paramedian transverse scan (PMTS) and shamrock technique. Method: Twenty-three healthy adult volunteers aged â‰¥ 18 years were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Ultrasound visualization results were compared between methods.</detailed_description>
