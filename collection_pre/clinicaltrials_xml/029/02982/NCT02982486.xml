	<brief_title>A Phase II of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Non-resectable Sarcoma and Endometrial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The expected duration of this study is 36 months (18 months accrual period and 18 month follow up period). Enrollment into the screening or treatment phase of the study will be stopped when the actual subject numbers have been achieved. This single arm single institution, open label, prospective, phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in patients with nonresectable/metastatic sarcoma or endometrial carcinoma with somatic deficient MMR as a selection tool.patients. Number of patients in the study will reflect the reconciliation between statistical requirements and incidence. Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision. All screening requirements must be completed within 28 days of the visit (except for Patients will be examined on cycle 1 day-1 and every 2 weeks, including complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry, until disease progression. CT/MRI imaging (contrast) will be performed every 6 weeks for response evaluation for the first 48 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Clinical benefit as well as individual categories of response (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) will be determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST). Response duration endpoints, including median PFS, PFS at 12 and 24 weeks and OS will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity (AEs) will be recorded using the NCI- Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects v 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE). Screening procedures will include immunostaining for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 all performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. In addition tumor DNA, extracted from FFPE tissue (after choosing optimal area by a Pathologist), will be submitted to FoundationOne for a later exploratory analysis.</detailed_description>

Patients must have histologically confirmed bone or soft tissue sarcoma by pathology review or a diagnosis of FIGO grade 3 endometrioid cancer, serous, clear cell, or mixed high grade endometrial cancer. 6. Measurable disease of sarcoma or endometrial carcinoma defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan or MRI, as &gt;20 mm by chest xray, or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam by RECIST 1.1. 7. Locally advanced nonoperable or metastatic disease 8. &gt;= 1 prior systemic therapy for sarcoma or endometrial carcinoma, including adjuvant systemic therapy 9.

Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 14 days prior to first drug dose WBC ≥ 2000/μL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/μL Platelets ≥ 100 x103/μL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (if using the CockcroftGault formula below): Female CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL Male CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) Serum electrolytes: baseline serum potassium &gt; 3.5 mmol/L (potassium supplementation may be given to restore the serum potassium above this level prior to study entry) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits (WNL); supplementation is acceptable to achieve a TSH WNL; in patients with abnormal TSH if free T4 is normal and patient is clinically euthyroid, patient is eligible 12. Patients should have resolution of any toxic effects of prior therapy (except alopecia) to NCI CTCAE, version 4.0, grade 1 or less 13. Patients may be rescreened and reenrolled in the study if they failed screening or were enrolled but did not receive study drugs in this case they will have to sign a new informed concent form. 14. Palliative (limitedfield) radiation therapy is permitted, if all of the following criteria are met: Repeat imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases.
