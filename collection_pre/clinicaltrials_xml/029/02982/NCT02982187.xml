	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multi-centre, open-label, placebo-device, cross-over study, with a 2x2 complete block design in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to assess the benefits of delivering triple therapy using a single ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) (closed triple therapy) versus delivering triple therapy using two different types of DPI (open triple therapy). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the proportion of COPD subjects who make critical errors when using a single ELLIPTA DPI versus those using combinations of DISKUS® with HANDIHALER®, or TURBUHALER® with HANDIHALER. At Visit 1, all subjects will demonstrate the use of ELLIPTA DPI, and HANDIHALER DPI in combination with either DISKUS DPI (in sub-study 1) or TURBUHALER DPI (in sub-study 2), based on the treatment sequences. At the end Visit 1, subjects will complete the inhaler preference questionnaire (PQ). There is no active treatment and subjects will continue to take their own prescribed COPD medication for the duration of the study.

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Age &gt;=40 years at Visit 1 Diagnosis of COPD with a documented history of COPD, in accordance with the definition by the European Respiratory Society. Current COPD Therapy: Currently receiving maintenance therapy with a fixed dose combination of a longacting beta 2agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Subject may also be receiving longacting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA; also known as a longacting anticholinergic). Subjects must be able to continue using their currently prescribed COPD maintenance inhaler therapy throughout the study and as needed short acting betaadrenergic agonist (SABA) and/or short acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) for rescue use. Has been on current maintenance ICS/LABA COPD treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to V0 and evaluated as unlikely to change treatment within 4 weeks of Visit 1. Current or former (defined as subjects who have quit smoking for at least 3 months prior to V0/V1) cigarette smokers with a &gt;10 packyear smoking history (Number of pack years=[number of cigarettes per day ÷ 20] x number of years smoked [e.g., 10 packyears is equal to 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years]). Males or females who are not pregnant or not planning a pregnancy during the study or not lactating Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol. Exclusion Criteria Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD. Subjects who used any ELLIPTA inhaler (participated in a clinical study of GW685698, GW642444, GSK573719 [fluticasone furoate, vilanterol, umeclidinium bromide], or any combination thereof, or placebo in an ELLIPTA inhaler study) within 24 months prior to Visit 0. Subjects who used any capsule system inhaler (e.g. Spiriva HANDIHALER, SEEBRI®/ULTIBRO® BREEZHALER®, or participated in a clinical studies of these, including placebo inhalers) within 24 months prior to Visit 0. SEEBRI, ULTIBRO, and BREEZHALER are registered trademarks of Novartis AG. Dependent on which substudy a subject is included on they should not have any recent experience, within 24 months of V 0 of the following inhaler for the sub study included on: Sub Study 1: DISKUS inhaler (e.g., Seretide DISKUS or placebo DISKUS) and Sub Study 2:TURBUHALER (e.g. Symbicort TURBUHALER or placebo TURBUHALER) Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at Visit 1 which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol requirement A history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study inhaler (e.g., lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates participation will also be excluded. Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to read and/or would not be able to complete a questionnaire and understand verbal instructions.</criteria>
