	<brief_summary>The participant is being asked to be a subject in this research study because the participant may have a disorder that can cause optic nerve damage and impairment of his/her visual function which is called optic neuropathies (ON). Optic neuropathy refers to damage to the optic nerve (a "cable" connecting the eyes and the brain to transmit the visual signals) due to any cause.In this study, the investigator is using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ophthalmic measures such as optic coherent tomography(OCT), which are non-invasive imaging tests to measure the changes in eye globe shape ,the flow of blood and brain fluid. It is hoped that this study will provide new knowledge that may allow the investigator to better understand the cause of symptoms associated with optic neuropathy and ways to better monitor what is happening.</brief_summary>
