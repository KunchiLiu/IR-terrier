	<brief_summary>The presence of pain, reduced range of motion and decrease of muscle strength of the upper limb in the early postoperative period are some of the major deficiencies of the breast cancer patients. The objectives of this study were to evaluate muscle strength, range of motion (ROM), pain, perimetry of the upper limbs and applied questionnaires of the upper lim function and quality of life, in patients after surgical treatment of breast cancer in different postoperative periods and different groups following rehabilitation: traditional postoperatively exercise to perform at home versus traditional exercises associated with weekly physiotherapy sessions to strength training for shoulder movements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Upper Limb Muscular Strengthening in the Rehabilitation of Patients Submitted to the Breast Cancer Surgical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical trial, randomized, blinded study. The groups were divided according to the type of rehabilitation (weekly sessions of Physiotherapy-F and Orientation -O). The surgical type (M-Mastectomy and Q-Quadrantectomy) was also taken into account. Were not included in the study those patients who underwent previous surgeries of breast cancer, breast reconstruction, those with some neurological deficit or acute orthopedic shoulder injury, such as tendonitis or bursitis, patients with previous histories of shoulder fracture with limited range of motion and tumor stage T4b or N3 or patients with bone or brain metastases. All patients underwent preoperative evaluation and guidance of general care; then returned after one, two, three and six months postoperatively for reassessment and reorientation. The physiotherapy group, in addition to receiving guidance, had, weekly, physical therapy sessions with the goal to increase muscle strength in the upper limbs, between one and three months after surgery.The exercises performed were active-free, with the aid of a stick or resistance by elastic bands and dumbbells for flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, external and internal rotation of the shoulder, and elbow flexion and extension, besides activities to enable movements functional. The mode of execution of the exercises was isotonic, done slowly and within the joint amplitude reached by the patient, using resistance according to the muscular capacity of each patient. All evaluations were performed by the physiotherapy team; the professionals were not aware of whether the patient belonged to the physiotherapy group or to the guidance group, constituted by a single evaluator (blinded study). The evaluations were: muscular strength of the shoulder, evaluated by means of a manual isokinetic dynamometer, which records the peak of force, in kilograms, during five seconds of muscle contraction duration; range of motion of the shoulder: measured by a goniometer; function of the upper limb: ascertained by the application of a specific questionnaire, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) assesses functional capacity in upper limb diseases and measures the abilities to perform certain activities; pain: evaluated by the application of the Verbal Numerical Pain Scale (NVA); perimetry: evaluated with a tape measure in eight distinct points in the upper limbs and quality of life, analyzed by a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life C30 (QLQ-C30) questionnaire with a Specific module for breast cancer (BR) 23 - Breast Specific Module.</detailed_description>
