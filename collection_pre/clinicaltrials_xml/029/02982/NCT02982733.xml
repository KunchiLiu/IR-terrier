	<brief_summary>In 2008 Goker et al, introduced Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) as a new hemostatic drug. Recently, ABS has been shown to produce local hemostasis by implementing topically after major arterial vessel injury. Reducing the compression time during patent hemostasis by facilitating hemostasis may decrease RAO. To test this hypothesis the investigators planned a three arm randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ankaferd blood stopper in adjunct to short-time compression, compared to either short-time compression with conventional sterile gauzes or with a TR band after transradial diagnostic procedures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All consecutive patients undergoing transradial elective diagnostic coronary procedures between November 2016 and November 2017 at the catheterization laboratory of Acibadem University Kocaeli Hospital were considered to be enrolled in the study. The only exclusion criteria were an abnormal Barbeau's test before puncture and failure to provide written informed consent.</criteria>
