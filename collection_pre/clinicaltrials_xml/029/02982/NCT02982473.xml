	<brief_summary>The "Registry of Malignant Arrhythmias and Sudden Cardiac Death - Influence of Diagnostics and Interventions (RACE-IT)" represents a mono-centric registry of patients being hospitalized suffering from malignant arrythmias (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Detailed findings of patients' clinical outcome regarding mortality and co-morbidities related to the presence of invasive diagnostics or therapies including coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), electrophysiological testing (EP), catheter ablation and implanted cardiac devices (e.g. implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) will be documented. Patients will be included when being hospitalized from the year 2004 until today.</brief_summary>
