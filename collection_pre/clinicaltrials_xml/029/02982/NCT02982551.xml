	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effects of changing insulin levels on brain activity. Participants will complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during fasting conditions, then during an insulin infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Modulation of fMRI Connectivity in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin is a hormone released by the pancreas in response to increases in glucose levels that result from food intake. In addition to stimulating glucose uptake in the periphery, insulin signals the central nervous system to induce satiety and inhibit feeding behavior. To begin to identify the specific effects of circulating insulin on brain networks, the current study will recruit healthy participants who will undergo two functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. One scan will be performed in the fasted state, and the alternate scan will be conducted during an isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. This project will allow us to identify the specific effects of circulating insulin on brain reactivity to palatable food.</detailed_description>
