	<detailed_description>Of high mortality and morbidity, severe stroke is associated with devastating damages in neurologic, respiratory, circulatory and many other systems. The outcomes of patients with severe stroke depend largely on medical strategies on acute stage, especially on blood pressure (BP) management. Unfortunately, so far no ideal BP range has been scientifically determined for patients with acute severe stroke. The CHASE study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of individualized anti-hypertension strategy in patients with acute severe stroke (target recruitment 250) compared to standard guideline-based management of BP (target recruitment 250). Patients presenting with acute (&lt;72h) severe stroke (GCS ≦ 12 or NIHSS ≧ 11) and elevated BP (systolic blood pressure ≧150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≧ 100 mmHg) will be randomly assigned to individualized anti-hypertension treatment or guideline-based treatment for 7 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Severe stroke occurred in 72 hours. GCS ≤12 or NIHSS≥11. Systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg on admission. Able to be 'actively' treated and admitted to a monitored facility. Informed consent. Received intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Concurrent severe heart failure. Concurrent acute myocardial infarction. Concurrent unstable angina. Concurrent severe systemic diseases. Other serious or lifethreatening disease before the stroke. Clear indication, in the clinician's view, for antihypertensive therapy during the acute phase of stroke (i.e. multiple cerebral artery stenosis, apparent cerebrovascular malformation or aortic dissection, or other situations). Patient unavailable for followup (e.g. no fixed address).</criteria>
