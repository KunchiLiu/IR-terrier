	<brief_summary>The current study is designed to measure and evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiling of acetaminophen in the young obese patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tylenol Levels in Bariatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a descriptive study carried out by study staff from the anesthesiology department. The patient population will include obese patients scheduled for robot-assisted or laparoscopic bariatric surgery. There will be no change in our usual anesthetic care for these patients. Volume of distribution and elimination half-life of acetaminophen in serum samples are the primary measurements of the study. If detected, a significant reduction in opioid requirements may lead to improved patient satisfaction and decreased opiate side effects.</detailed_description>
