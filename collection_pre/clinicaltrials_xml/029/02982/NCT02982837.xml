	<brief_summary>To assess whether PEG-INF (Peglyated - interferon) Add-on therapy in patients of CHB who have achieved a maintained viral suppression (HBV DNA PCR( polymerase chain reaction) &lt;200 for last 3-6 month) with NA's can result in increased rate of HBV infection eradication (HbsAg is undetectable by serological blood testing with or without seroconversion to HBs antibody).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Study the Effect of Adding on Pegylated Interferon (PEG-INF) Therapy for Patients Diagnosed With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health care problem with more than one third of world's population having serological evidence of been exposed to the virus and about 5% of global population ( 350-400 million) being chronically infected. About 15-40% of Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection develop complications of liver cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) in their life time , resulting in an estimated of 500,000 to 1.2 million deaths each year. In Saudi Arabia, chronic hepatitis B remains a serious medical problem, despite the implementation of mandatory HBV vaccination of children since 1989. According to a recent study conducted in Saudi hospital, HBV accounts for 49% of the hepatitis cases . Persistent viral replication is associated with disease progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and development of HCC. Currently two classes of drugs are available for treatment of CHB namely immunomodulatory therapy (conventional &amp; pegylated interferon (Pegasys) PEG-IFN) and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues(NA). Interferon(IFN)-α with its dual immunomodulatory and antiviral effects was the first drug (recombinant standard IFN- α) licensed for Chronic hepatitis B treatment in the 1990's followed by introduction of nucleos(t)ide analogues(NA) in 1998 that directly inhibit HBV polymerase and provide an effective on treatment maintained viral suppression . With the introduction of pegylated interferon- α (PEG-IFN) in 2005 that allows a convenient once a week dosing interval and of equal or superior treatment efficacy than conventional (IFN), the interferon based therapy has markedly improved its utility. Due to its predominant immunomodulatory effect peginterferon (PEG-IFN) offers the advantage of higher sustained off treatment response rate compared to NA thus allowing a finite duration of treatment. The NA act by directly inhibiting HBV polymerase resulting in effective on treatment maintained viral suppression (HBV DNA PCR &lt;200 for last 3-6 month)). However, long term NA therapy has the problems of emergence of viral resistance, long -term safety, cost and patient compliance.</detailed_description>
