	<brief_summary>This study provides Hepatitis C virus screening to the members of the World Trade Center Health Program followed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai born during 1945-1965, and linkage to care for those found infected. The study will also determine if exposure to human remains, blood and/or bodily fluids during the World Trade Center Health Program activities are associated with Hepatitis C virus infection. These findings would be relevant to the larger United States population, especially to persons born during 1945-1965 who are at high risk of Hepatitis C virus infection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the project is to determine if the World Trade Center Health Program cohort is at an increased risk of Hepatitis C virus infection, determine if human exposure to human remains, blood and/or body fluids during the World Trade Center recovery activities is associated with increased risk of Hepatitis C virus infection, and to determine if referral to a co-located site for Hepatitis C virus care is associated with improved linkage to Hepatitis C virus care in the members of the World Trade Center Health Program born during 1945 through 1965.</detailed_description>
