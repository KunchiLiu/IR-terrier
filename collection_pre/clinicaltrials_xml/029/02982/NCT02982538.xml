	<brief_summary>This randomized study examines how prolonged exposure (PE) therapy, an evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be successfully disseminated and implemented in the Army. The study compares two PE training models: Standard PE training, comprised of a 4-day workshop only, and Extended PE training, comprised of a 4-day workshop plus expert case consultation. In addition, patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms receiving psychotherapy from participating providers will be invited to participate. After completing PE training, use of PE components with patients reporting PTS symptoms and clinical outcomes of these participating patients will be monitored for up to 18 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will examine how evidence-based therapies (EBTs) such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be successfully disseminated and implemented in the Army by comparing two PE training models: Standard PE training (workshop only) and Extended PE training (workshop plus consultation). Up to 180 mental health providers at three medium-to large Army installations will be randomly assigned to either Standard PE training or Extended PE training. All providers will complete a 4-day PE workshop, along with the distribution of training materials and treatment manuals, conducted at the military site by the Overall Study PI, Dr. Edna Foa, and her team. Following the 4-day workshop, participants randomized to the Extended PE training will receive weekly phone consultation with a PE expert on two PE therapy cases. Participants randomized to the Standard PE training group will not receive any additional consultation following the workshop. Providers will not be required to use PE therapy with their patients with PTS symptoms; using PE will be optional. A major outcome of this study is the proportion of the providers PTSD patients that are offered PE or PE components. The mental health outcomes of providers' PTS patients will also be monitored as a second major outcome. Patients seeking treatment from participating providers will be recruited, consented, and assessed by independent evaluators at two time points to prospectively assess their response to treatment.</detailed_description>

FOR PROVIDERS: 1) Definite plans to terminate their position or relocate from the Army base at some point during the first year following training. 2) Extensive previous training in Prolonged Exposure (PE), defined as participation in a 4day PE training workshop at any point prior to the start of the study, and selfreported use of PE (including both imaginal and in vivo exposure techniques) to treat 4 or more patients with PTS symptoms in the past year. FOR PATIENTS: 1) Current bipolar disorder I or psychotic disorder (as determined by the MINI). 2) Evidence of a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (as determined by the inability to comprehend the baseline screening questionnaires). 3) Current suicidal ideation severe enough to warrant immediate attention (as determined by the MINI and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation).</criteria>
