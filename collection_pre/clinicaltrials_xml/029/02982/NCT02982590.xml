	<brief_title>Apixaban Versus Warfarin in Patients With Left Ventricular Thrombus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment for left ventricular thrombus is anti-coagulant or blood thinning agent known as warfarin. Recently at least three novel oral anticoagulant agents were used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Novel oral anticoagulant drugs will require no blood taking for INR monitoring, hence less visit and more convenience to patients. Latest studies also showed lesser rate of bleeding as compared to warfarin and hence relatively safer.</detailed_description>
