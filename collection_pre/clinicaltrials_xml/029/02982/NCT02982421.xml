	<brief_summary>Art Therapy is a health profession in which art making is utilized as a means of expression and communication within a therapeutic and supportive relationship [1]. Art therapy has been shown to reduce psychological (anxiety, negative mood) and physical (pain, fatigue) symptoms which accompany many breast cancer patients and survivors [2-7]. Qualitative studies provide an initial understanding of the mechanisms through which art therapy facilitates symptom reduction [8]. Breast cancer patients have reported that art therapy provided them with access to emotional material otherwise inaccessible [9]. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of art making within a therapeutic framework on emotional awareness and acceptance.</brief_summary>
