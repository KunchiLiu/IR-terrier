No prior systemic therapy for RCC except for one prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for completely resectable RCC 4. Measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1. Subject must have extracranial metastasis as measurable disease 5. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of at least 70% for Cohort 1, 2, and 3; KPS of 5060% for Cohort 4 6. Tumor tissue need be received by the central vendor (block or unstained slides). Note: Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)and bone metastases samples are not acceptable for submission. 1. Medical Conditions 1. Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or a history of known autoimmune disease 2. Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured 3. Known HIV or AIDSrelated illness 4. Any positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus indicating acute or chronic infection. 2. Prior/Concomitant Therapy 1. Prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting with Vascular epithelial growth factor(VEGF) or VEGF receptor targeted therapy 2. Prior treatment with an antiProgrammed Death (PD) 1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, anticluster of differentiation 137 (CD137), or anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen 4(CTLA4) antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways. This includes the utilization of these agents in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. 3. Anticancer therapy less than 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug or palliative, focal radiation therapy less than 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
