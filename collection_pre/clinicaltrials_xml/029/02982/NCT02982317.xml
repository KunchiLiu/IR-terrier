	<brief_title>Automated UltraSound Software for Identification of Lumbar Vertebral Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of ultrasound is one of the most accurate ways to identify the correct vertebral level for needle insertion in spinal/epidural anesthetics, however this is not commonly used. A novel automated ultrasound software system has been developed by the UBC Department of Engineering which identifies for the practitioner the intervertebral spaces in the lumbar area. This study aim to investigate whether this new technology has a greater accuracy of identifying intervertebral spaces that manual palpation.</detailed_description>
