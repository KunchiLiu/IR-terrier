	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II, randomized, blinded and placebo-controlled study to test the safety and efficacy of LMCSs for improving vaccine immune response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (LMSCs) on Vaccine-Specific Antibody- Response in Subjects With Aging Frailty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A pilot phase will consist of a 3 subject safety run-in, followed by 20 subject randomized phase to evaluate influenza vaccine response at 1 week and 4 weeks post infusion of LMSCs. This will be followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled phase.</detailed_description>
