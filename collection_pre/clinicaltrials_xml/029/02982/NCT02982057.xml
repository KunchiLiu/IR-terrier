	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to compare the evolution of non culprit lesions after treatment by BVS versus optimal medical therapy at 2-years follow- up</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Culprit Lesion Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives and hypothesis: scaffolding a non culprit /vulnerable coronary plaque with BVS could facilitate the stabilization process into the atherosclerotic plaque with modifications of plaque morphology, especially the lipid content which is considered as one of the main factor leading to recurrent MACE after an ACS. The interaction between the polymer Platform and the vessel wall, the effect of the everolimus on neointima growth and cellular response into the media could reduce the inflammatory process into the vulnerable plaque could be different Under OMT and BVS implantation.</detailed_description>
