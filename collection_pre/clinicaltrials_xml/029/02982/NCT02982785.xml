	<brief_summary>The aim is to assess if physiotherapists attending inpatients at elective orthopaedic wards can predict the future course (post hospitalisation) of recovery of patients undergoing KA. The prediction is made at hospital discharge using a 1-10 numerical rating scale (1=poor prognosis; 10=best prognosis). To identify candidate prognostic factors, the therapist are asked to qualify their prognosis narratively, by listing at least 3-5 factors that they consider important for their projected prognosis score. There will be no maximum number of factors the physiotherapist can list.</brief_summary>
