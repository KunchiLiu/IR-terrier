	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of different renal sympathetic denervation methods (radiofrequency main vs. branches + main vs. ultrasound based) in a cohort of patients with therapy refractory arterial hypertension and large renal arteries</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison of Ultrasound Versus Radiofrequency Denervation in Patients With Therapy Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this trial is a prospective, randomized comparison of three different techniques for catheter based renal sympathetic denervation. Patients with larger (&gt;5.5 mm) renal arteries are randomized to a treatment with a radiofrequency based catheter of the main renal artery, the main renal artery, its side-branches and accessories or an ultrasound-based denervation of the main renal artery only. The primary endpoint is the change in daytime blood pressure acquired in ambulatory blood pressure measurement at 3 months.</detailed_description>
