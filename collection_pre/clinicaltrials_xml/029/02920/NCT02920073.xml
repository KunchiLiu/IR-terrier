	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to evaluate gut microbiota changes in undernourished patients with anorexia nervosa under enteral nutrition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intestinal Metagenome of Undernourished in Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, comparative, non-interventional study involving one clinical nutrition unit in France. Gut microbial will be evaluated with feces between patients and healthy volunteers. Main investigations: - Presence of gut microbial deviation compared to healthy volunteers; - Presence of a significant statistical association between this deviation and metabolic disorders. For each patient under the routine care a clinical examination and a blood sample will be done for standard biology report and nutrition. The age, gender, weight, height (for calculation of BMI), type of anorexia nervosa will be also collected with the pathological behavior associated (physical and intellectual hyperactivity, potomania, ongoing supplements drug taking including vitamins and trace elements). Eating and psychological disorders will be evaluated with EDI (eating disorder inventory) questionnaire. Only the age, gender, height, weight (BMI), medical antecedents and ongoing treatment taking will be collected.</detailed_description>
