	<brief_title>Study of Anaesthesia Costs and Recovery Profiles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sevoflurane and propofol are two basic drugs in the maintenance of anaesthesia. In this study we compared the perioperative hemodynamic parameters, recovery profiles and cost containment of sevoflurane and propofol based general anaesthesia for otorhinolaryngeal surgery. Patients were equally divided into four anaesthetic subgroups. In groups A and C anaesthesia was based on sevoflurane or propofol, respectively, without bispectral index (BIS) and train-of-for monitor (TOF) monitoring. In groups B and D anaesthesia was based on sevoflurane or propofol, respectively, with BIS and TOF monitoring. Drug consumption, recovery profiles and anaesthesia costs were analysed. ECG, main arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, oxygen saturation of peripheral haemoglobin (SpO2), pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide was monitored continuously and registered at 5 min intervals during anaesthesia. Each group received propofol for anaesthesia induction. In group A and B anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, in groups C and D with propofol. In groups B and D the depth of anaesthesia (BIS® Quatro Brain Monitoring Sensor, Covidien) and the neuromuscular blocking status (Infinity®, Trident® NMT SmartPod®, Dräger Medical) were monitored too. BIS and TOF values were recorded at 5 min intervals.</detailed_description>
