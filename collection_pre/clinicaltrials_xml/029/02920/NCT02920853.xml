	<brief_title>Enhanced Biofeedback for Musculoskeletal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relaxation is a low-cost treatment for managing pain with little or no side effects. The proposed study will use a novel biofeedback treatment to try and enhance the capacity of relaxation to engage pain inhibitory circuits. Specifically, a biofeedback system (Biofeedback Training for Conditioned Pain Regulation, BT-CPR) will be used to monitor the participant's level of sympathetic arousal and will use this to control the intensity of painful stimulations delivered to the participant during biofeedback training. Thus, when the participant successfully relaxes (and reduces their arousal), the intensity is lowered and produces pain relief. Efficacy of the treatment will be tested in a small, randomized controlled trial in which individuals with a verified diagnosis of chronic musculoskeletal pain will receive 10 treatment sessions, or 10 sessions of a control condition (traditional biofeedback, to control for the effects of relaxation on pain). The aim will be to assess whether the treatment results in improvements in clinical pain outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, quality of life, pain interference) and psychosocial variables (e.g., coping, self-efficacy, mood).</detailed_description>
