	<brief_summary>The procedure currently recommended for the treatment of irreversible pulpitis is the endodontic treatment, i.e. the complete elimination of the pulp, disinfection and obturation of the whole root canal system. The emergency procedure consists of a pulpotomy, followed at an ulterior appointment by the root canal treatment. The purpose of the present pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing the pulpotomy as a permanent treatment in mature molars. If hemostasis can be achieved after removing the coronal part of the pulp, a tricalcium silicate cement will be directly applied on the remaining pulp at the root canal entrances. A short-term follow-up will be performed at one week by evaluating the pain relief of the patient. Long-term success will then be evaluated every year by verifying the absence of periapical radiolucency on the x-ray as well as the absence of clinical symptoms and signs. A standard root canal procedure will serve as control.</brief_summary>
