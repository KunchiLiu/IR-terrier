	<brief_summary>In this study, people who suffer from strong self-critical tendencies will be randomized to two study conditions. The first group receives an account to an internet-based self-help intervention. The second group is a waiting control group. In both conditions additional care or treatment is allowed. The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of an internet-based self-help intervention on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms compared to a waiting list. Assessments are at baseline, 8-week and 6-months post-randomization. After 8 weeks, participants in the waiting control group get also access to the intervention and fill out questionnaires after 8 weeks again.</brief_summary>
