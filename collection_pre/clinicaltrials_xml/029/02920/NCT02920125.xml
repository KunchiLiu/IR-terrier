	<brief_title>Study the Clinical Outcome of Ayurvedic SUVED and Reimmugen (Colostrum), in Patients of Vascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: A non-invasive, effective, compatible, Integrative treatment option to address the growing burden of Vascular disease; Importance: Ayurvedic SUVED (cardio tonic, continuous clotlysis, endothelial repair, powerful rejuvenator, antioxidant) and Reimmugen (Cow Colostrum - IgG, GF) provides sustained Functional, symptomatic relief with clinical reports of regression of disease. No adverse interactions reported. Application: Addition of SUVED &amp; REIMMUGEN helps in: - Acute MI, Thrombotic stroke, DVT, hastens symptomatic recovery, reduces hospitalization time, mortality, helps dissolve clots / soft thrombus; reversal of atherosclerotic plaques; improves functional life - Improvements in Cardiac Function : LVEF; Global perfusion - Rejuvenation of endothelium, vascular function. - Improved physical strength: digestion; GI function; immunity; accelerated internal healing - Secondary prevention to avoid incidences in post event treatment. Health condition/problem studied Vascular disease, esp CVA, IHD, CAD, DVT, PAD Volunteers taken from OPD and IPD of SKNMC &amp; GH with prior consent for participation. Intervention is Medicament based given in addition to conventional ongoing therapy under the guidance of SKNMC doctors. Study type Clinical trial: Double Blind placebo controlled trial.
