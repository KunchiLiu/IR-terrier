	<brief_title>Evaluation of Changes in Prescribing Behavior of ER/LA Opioid Prescribers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study will be performed to evaluate changes in prescribing behavior of prescribers. 1. For products that are indicated for use in opioid-tolerant patients only (i.e., fentanyl transdermal patches, extended-release hydromorphone pills and extended-release morphine pills &gt;90mg), describe trends in the proportion of prescriptions for these products to opioid-non-tolerant patients in the year preceding the availability of REMS-compliant CE courses and compare the proportion of prescriptions to opioid non-tolerant patients pre- versus post-REMS CE course availability 2. For products whose labels indicate that higher dosage strengths should only be used in opioid-tolerant patients, describe trends in the proportion of prescriptions prescribed to opioid non-tolerant patients with a high starting dosage strength; compare the proportion of prescriptions for such products that are prescribed to opioid non-tolerant patients with a high starting dosage strength pre- versus post-REMS CE course availability 3. Describe trends in the proportion of prescriptions for ER/LA opioids prescribed to patients that have early refills of prescriptions and compare this proportion pre- versus post-REMS CE course availability. 4. Compare the concomitant use of benzodiazepines with ER/LA opioids before and after REMS implementation.</detailed_description>
