	<brief_summary>Although mesh fixation has been associated to an increased incidence of nerve injury and involves increased operative costs, many surgeons feel that fixation is necessary to reduce the risk of hernia recurrence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic herniorrhaphies performed with and without mesh fixation at our institution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized prospective study was conducted. Four groups of patients were constituted: (1) TEP with mesh fixation (2) TEP without fixation, (3) TAPP with mesh fixation, (4) TAPP without fixation. 120 patients were randomized to each group. The principal outcomes assessed were postoperative chronic groin pain assessed by visual analogue pain scale (VAS), hernia recurrence, other morbidity rates and hospital costs. Patients were reviewed in outpatient unit at 1 week and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months.</detailed_description>
