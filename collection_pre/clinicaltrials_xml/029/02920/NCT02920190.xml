	<brief_summary>Background Antigen-driven selection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathies. Patients with Gaucher's disease have an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies and symptomatic myeloma. Clonal immunoglobulin in patients with Gaucher's disease and in mouse models of Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathy are reactive against lyso-glucosylceramide (LGL1), which is markedly elevated in these patients and mice. A recent report indicates that clonal immunoglobulins in 33% of sporadic human monoclonal gammopathies may also be specific for the lysolipids LGL1 and lysophosphatidylcholine. Substrate reduction ameliorates Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathy in mice. This principle (that antigen removal can induce tumor regression) has been proven in other hematologic malignancies, where H. Pylori eradication causes lymphoma regression is a significant group of patients. Thus, as longterm immune activation by lysolipids may underlie both Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathies and some sporadic monoclonal gammopathies, this may represent a focus for treatment. Epicardial fat (EAT), the visceral fat of the heart, is highly enriched in genes involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism; it activates local and systemic inflammation and innate inflammatory response. EAT is rich in saturated fatty acids and has high protein content, and the greatest capacity for free fatty acids release and uptake among any other visceral fat depots. Of interest, EAT is highly enriched in sphingolipids, including ceramide. EAT clinical measurability with an ultrasound technique, first developed and validated by Iacobellis, and its rapid responsiveness and reduction to medications targeting the visceral fat, such as the glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues (GLP1A), as ongoing clinical trials are demonstrating, is of growing and remarkable interest. Study Hypothesis To target EAT, as marker of visceral fat, with GLP1A treatment to modulate/reduce/remove the antigen(s) (lipid/inflammatory/immune) stimulation for patients with monoclonal gammopathies that are lipid targeted. Study Design Interventional, single-group, open label pilot study. The investigators will identify monoclonal gammopathy patients whose antibodies are lipid/visceral fat targeted (goal is 10 initially as a pilot) and who are overweight/obese (BMI &gt; 27). Eligible patients will be started on Liraglutide up to 1.8 mg sc once daily, as adjunct weight loss treatment for 12 months. Study Endpoints - Ultrasound measured EAT reduction by at least 20% - Improvement in the monoclonal immunoglobulin profile Reduction in plasma ceramide and lipidomics levels Parameters will be monitored at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.</brief_summary>
