	<criteria>1. Healthy male volunteers aged from 18 to 50 years. 2. A health profile devoid of organic or physiological disorders. 3. The ECG and general blood and urine laboratory tests performed before the study should be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted if, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are not clinically significant, are not lifethreatening for the subjects and do not interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their nonrelevance will be justified in writing specifically. 4. Body mass index (BMI=weigh/height2) will range between 19 and 27 Kg/m2 and weight between 50 and 110 kg. 5. Understanding and accepting the study procedures and signing the informed consent form. 1. Non compliance of the inclusion criteria. 2. Having suffered any organic disease or major surgery in the three months prior to start this study. 3. A prior history of or presence of significant cardiovascular, neurological, haematological, psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine, immunologic or renal disease that, in the investigator's opinion, considering the current state of the art, they are clinically significant, are lifethreatening for the subjects and could interfere with the product assessment; or which may lead to suspecting a disorder in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion, or that suggest gastrointestinal irritation due to drugs. 4. History or clinical evidence of psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse, or regular use of psychoactive drugs. 5. History of hypertension, seizures, endocrine disorders (such as diabetes and hypothyroidism), coagulation disorders, kidney and/or liver disease. 6. Subjects for which the drug involved in the study is counter indicated. 7. Smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day. 8. Taking more than 35 g of alcohol per day. 9. Drinking more than 5 drinks containing xanthines per day. 10. Regular use of any drug in the month prior to the study sessions. The treatment with single or limited doses of symptomatic medicinal products in the week prior to the study sessions will not be a reason for exclusion if it is calculated that it has been cleared completely the day of the experimental session. 11. Have taken part in studies with blood donation in the last 8 weeks prior to start this study. 12. History of allergy, idiosyncrasy, hypersensitivity or adverse reactions to the active substance or any excipients. 13. Have been volunteer in another study with drugs in the last 3 months prior to start this study. 14. Subjects with positive serology for hepatitis B, C or HIV. 15. Subjects unable to understand the nature, consequences of the study and the procedures requested to be followed.</criteria>
