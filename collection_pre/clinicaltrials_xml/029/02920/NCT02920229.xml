	<brief_summary>Single-center, prospective, diagnostic trial in radically treated patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. Patients with radically treated prostate cancer with biochemical relapse and negativity of all traditional morphological and functional imaging (transrectal ultrasound, bone scan, 18F-FMC PET/CT, CT/MRI) or doubtful imaging of 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] (18F)-fluoromethylcholine (FMC) PET/CT will receive a Gallio-68 (68Ga)- Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) scan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-PSMA HBED-PET/CT in the Evaluation of the Biochemical Relapse in Patients With a History of Prostate Cancer Radically Treated</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-center, prospective, diagnostic trial. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA PET /CT defined as the ratio between the number of 68Ga-PSMA PET /CT positive patients and the number of prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse and negative standard imaging. The secondary objectives are: - Sensitivity for different Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) values (ranges) - Sensitivity for different lesion sites - Treatment response assessment with a second PET - False positives detection during Follow Up (FUP) (with other standard methods and eventually optional biopsy) for patient without any treatment - safety 67 evaluable patients will be injected with 100-200 megabecquerel (MBq) 68Ga-PSMA intravenously</detailed_description>
