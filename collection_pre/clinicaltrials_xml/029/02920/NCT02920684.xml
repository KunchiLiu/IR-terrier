	<brief_summary>Despite several positive studies, benefits of early rehabilitation on recovery and motor performance improvement need to be demonstrate. A recent study finds that despite early rehabilitation, 1 survivor of 2 (52%) acquired an ICU weakness. The low intensity exercises applied in intensive care is common and most patients stay in bed. Under these conditions, the optimal choice of the rehabilitation technique for bedridden patient and its intensity should be studied. The objective of the study is to evaluate the cardiovascular and metabolic response of patients during four interventions: Passive legs mobilization, Passive cycloergometter, Quadriceps neuromuscular electrical stimulation and Functional electrical stimulation.</brief_summary>
