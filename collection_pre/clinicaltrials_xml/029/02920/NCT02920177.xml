	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical response of intra-articular platelet rich plasma (PRP) versus corticosteroid injection in patients affected by femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet-rich Plasma Versus Corticosteroid Injection for the Treatment of Femoroacetabular Impingement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will determine if PRP treatment of FAI improves (i) patient reported outcome scores and (ii) hip functional stability compared to standard corticosteroid treatment and if PRP treatment of FAI reduces (i) radiographic and (ii) biochemical markers of joint inflammation and cartilage degradation.</detailed_description>
