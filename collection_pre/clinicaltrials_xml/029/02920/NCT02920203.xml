	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to better identify hereditary cardiac causes of sudden unexpected death in young subjects through Next-Generation Sequencing of autopsy tissue</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Autopsy and Sudden Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monitoring : For index cases group, all the data will be monitored. For the relatives group, only the informed consent will be monitored Statistical analysis : - Evaluate the additional elucidation rate of unexpected sudden death - Evaluate causes obtained by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) ( in comparison with conventional autopsy (macroscopic and / or microscopic) - Descriptive study of the causes of sudden unexpected death, identified hereditary cardiac causes percentages compared via various diagnostic approaches - Cost-effectiveness analysis Data Management : A database is created for the AGEMOS study with control of the discrepancies. All the index cases' data entered in the data base will be double checked</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Index cases : Subjects of more than 2 years old and less than 41 years old Sudden unexpected death from natural and nontraumatic causes Macroscopic autopsy performed within 72 hours after death and without signs of body decomposition No extracardiac obvious causes, including toxicological analysis when available No significant coronary cause after autopsy (such as tight coronary stenosis, congenital abnormality of the arteries, coronary vasculitis) Informed consent of the close relation (family/reliable person) and / or legal representative Relatives : To be a first degree relative (parents, sister, brother, child) of a deceased subject included in the AGEMOS study and accept to perform medical examination and transmit results of examination</criteria>
