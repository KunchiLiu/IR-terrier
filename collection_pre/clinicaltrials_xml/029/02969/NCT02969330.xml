	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are twofold: (1) to develop an innovative approach for studying brain glucose metabolism using functional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and BOLD fMRI in humans; (2) to evaluate the effect of short peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) treatment on brain and brain-stem targets, associated with control of food intake and energy expenditure, in response to glucose stimuli, in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
