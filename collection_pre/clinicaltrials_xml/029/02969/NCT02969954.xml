	<brief_summary>Racial and ethnic minorities with type II diabetes in the US are more likely to develop complications and die from the disease than the general population. The foreign-born subset of this population is less likely to adhere to diabetes care recommendations than US-born patients, thereby placing them at higher risk for complications. In our previous pilot project, eight stories were assessed through preliminary multi-site intervention for acceptability and efficacy in diabetes management among Latino and Somali patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes. The goal of this project is to evaluate a new format for delivery of a culturally tailored digital storytelling intervention by incorporating a facilitated group discussion following the videos, for management of type II diabetes in Latino communities.</brief_summary>
