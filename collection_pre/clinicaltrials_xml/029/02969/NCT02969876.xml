	<detailed_description>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved vortioxetine to treat major depressive disorder in 2013. Researchers believe vortioxetine may improve pattern separation and pattern completion (i.e., a neurological function) in people with major depressive disorder; thus, this research study aims to determine how vortioxetine increases a person's ability to think. The current study is an open label trial, therefore, all participants will receive vortioxetine. Furthermore, participants receive the vortioxetine at no cost. It will take participants 6 weeks to complete this study. Participants are asked to come to the Mass General Hospital campus for 1 screening visit which includes a full psychiatric evaluation, and 5 additional study visits. During study visits, participants will meet with a clinician and then complete computer based cognitive tests.</detailed_description>
