	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate product performance of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Conditional Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) following 3 tesla (3T) MRI exposure. This will be achieved by evaluating the changes in pacing capture threshold (PCT) measurements following 3T MRI scan exposure. This study is required by FDA as a condition of approval of 3T MRI compatible labeling of applicable CIED systems. This study is conducted within Medtronic's post-market surveillance platform, the Product Surveillance Registry (PSR).</brief_summary>
