	<brief_summary>This is a 12-week, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the relationship between ABS eMDPI and clinical asthma exacerbation (CAE) in adult patients at least 18 years of age with exacerbation-prone asthma. The ABS eMDPI dose will be 90 mcg, 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 hours as needed, but patient dosing will not be limited to this dosing regimen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between albuterol dosing and CAE.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient has had at least 1 episode of a severe CAE over the past 12 months before screening. The patient must be able to demonstrate appropriate use of albuterol from the ABS eMDPI. The patient is using at least moderatedose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (equivalent of fluticasone propionate 440 mcg daily) and any additional asthma controller at a stable dose for 3 months prior to the screening visit. The patient's baseline asthma therapy regimen, including oral corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, 5lipoxygenase inhibitors, longacting beta agonist (LABA), longacting muscarinic agent, or cromolyn, biologicals, theophylline, or mepolizumab, is allowed. The patient must be willing and able to comply with study requirements as specified in the protocol, including the use of a wearable accelerometer for the subset of patients who consent to use of the device. The patient is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance shortacting beta2 agonist (SABA or antimuscarinic agents and replace them with the studyprovided ABS eMDPI for the duration of the trial. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or â‰¥2 years postmenopausal) must have exclusively samesex partners or use a highly effective method of birth control and must agree to continue the use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of the investigational medicinal product (IMP). Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information The patient has any clinically significant medical condition (treated or untreated) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with participation in the study. The patient has any other confounding underlying lung disorder other than asthma. The patient has used an investigational drug within 5 halflives of it being discontinued or 1 month, whichever is longer. The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman, or plans to become pregnant during the study. Note: Any woman becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study. The patient is known to be allergic to albuterol. The patient has a history or presence of "silent" infections, including positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
