	<brief_summary>The number of metastases in a patient with primary or recurrent prostate cancer has major prognostic implication. The purpose is to compare, in a pilot study, the diagnostic performance of 18F-NaF-PET/MR with respect to the results of the scintigraphy 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT (routine exam) for determining the presence or absence of bone lesions in prostate cancer patient, with up to five metastases (oligo-bone metastatic) based on scintigraphy 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT. The gold standard will be a combination of clinical follow-up, additional imaging and biopsy, as indicated by the multidisciplinary discussion at the tumor board. The findings from whole-body 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT, 18F-NaF-PET/MR, and the combination of the 2 modalities will be categorized by 2 teams of 2 readers as benign or probably benign, equivocal, or malignant or probably malignant and compared with the results of follow-up for JAFROC and ROC analysis.</brief_summary>
