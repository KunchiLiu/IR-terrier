	<brief_title>Staying Strong and Healthy During Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) for Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer is a very treatable cancer but those treatments can have long-lasting effects. A kind of hormone therapy called Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is often used along with other treatments like radiation and has been shown to improve survival. However, ADT can have negative effects especially on the heart and metabolism (the body's system for using and storing energy). Participation in this study will last for up to 12 months. The study is looking at two different approaches to treating men who are undergoing ADT: 1. Staying Strong &amp; Healthy Intervention + Usual Care 2. Usual Care All participants will have blood drawn and be asked questions about how they are feeling during their participation. The men in the Staying Strong &amp; Healthy Intervention group will also take part in a diet and exercise program and receive counseling from a member of the study team.</detailed_description>
