	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to use functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to understand the brain systems affected when hypnosis and hypnotic analgesia are augmented with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation to 100 people with fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition. The investigators will measure the effect of rTMS- augmentation on the brain networks underlying hypnotizability, as well as the effect of rTMS-augmentation on hypnotic analgesia networks. The investigators hope to demonstrate that a combination of these psychological and neuromodulatory treatments will be more effective than hypnosis alone, thereby enhancing the depth of hypnosis, range of hypnosis and the efficacy of hypnotic analgesia and hopefully creating a new treatment modality for individuals suffering from pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Augment Hypnotic Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design. The investigators propose to develop a combinatory approach where an integrative technique (hypnosis) is augmented with a neurotechnology (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). This application seeks to utilize the previously established brain-based mechanisms of both hypnosis and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as biomarkers to assess the potential synergistic mechanism of this combinatory approach. 100 low-moderately hypnotizable subjects with fibromyalgia will be identified. The subjects' response to rTMS-augmentation of hypnosis will be measured. The volunteers will be randomized to active or sham rTMS. Two scan sessions will be performed for each subject, with the first scan session investigating the effect of rTMS-augmentation on hypnosis and hypnotizability (120 min scan session) and the second scan session focused on the effect of rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia (120 min scan session). The intent of the first scan session is to measure the effect of rTMS on the trait of hypnotizability and on the state of hypnosis. The investigators will assess changes in functional connectivity between DLPFC and dACC as the connectivity between these two brain regions has been suggested to be a neuroimaging surrogate of hypnotizability. The first scan session will also involve hypnosis assessments that will allow for a determination of the effects of rTMS directly on hypnosis. The second scan session intends to assess the effect of active rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia on the hypnotic analgesia network. Additionally, the effects of rTMS- augmentation of hypnotic analgesia on pain thresholds will be assessed and compared to pre-rTMS augmentation baselines. Experimental design. Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking any analgesic medication for 24 hours prior. Before each MRI scan session, participants will undergo a preparation session, where hypnotizability and psychological testing will be conducted. At this time, thermal pain training, the determination of laser thresholds will also be done. Volunteer subjects will then participate in 2 MRI scan sessions on two separate days, each lasting approximately 120 mins. Session 1 (rTMS-augmented hypnosis session) will consist of 4 control conditions followed by a post-treatment assessment. Session 2 (rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia) will consist of 3 experimental conditions followed by a post-treatment assessment. Baseline Mood, Cognitive, and Health Assessments The following will be assessed after screening/consent: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) The Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP) Hypnosis Intensity Scale (HIS) TASS 2010 Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria Antidepressant Treatment History Form The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Edinburgh Handedness Inventory The Opioid Risk Tool The Brief Pain Inventory Ishihara Test (?) MRI Safety Screening Form Ishihara Color Vision Test Participants (n=100) will then be randomized to active (n=50) versus sham (n=50) rTMS and undergo MRI scanning over two days (Session 1 and Session 2). There will be four conditions during Session 1 and three conditions on Session 2. Session 1: The first session will address Aim 1. Participants will receive the Hypnotic Induction Profile prior to any scanning. Participants will then receive 1) [Session 1] a baseline scan, whereby high-resolution anatomical images will be collected. This will be followed by a 10-minute resting-state fMRI scan, whereby participants will be instructed to close their eyes, not think about anything in particular, and refrain from repetitive thoughts such as counting. Next participants will receive a 2) [Session 1] baseline scan with hypnosis where participants will all receive a hypnotic induction while the subject is in the scanner though the use of headphones and a pre-recorded induction script. Hypnotic instructions will be standardized, and will involve a simple induction instruction used in our prior research on the brain signature of the hypnotic state and in clinical care. 3) [Session 1] Next the participant will receive a Hypnotic Intensity Profile to assess baseline hypnotic depth. 4) [Session 1] rTMS session occurs after the baseline scans and consists of 40 seconds of cTBS followed by 15 min spacing followed by 40 seconds of cTBS as has been previously described. The stimulation will be delivered at 80% of the motor threshold. 5) [Session 1] Post rTMS baseline scan will be performed where the participant will have received rTMS in #5 then receive a post rTMS scan. 6) [Session 1] The study will then proceed to rTMS-augmented hypnosis where the participant will be placed in the scanner again after the hypnotic induction and scanned during active hypnosis. Hypnosis will be induced while the subject is in the scanner through the use of headphones and a pre-recorded induction script. Hypnotic instructions will be standardized, and will involve a simple induction instruction used in our prior research on the brain signature of the hypnotic state. The participant will then repeat the Hypnotic Intensity Scale inside the scanner as well as the Hypnotic Induction Profile outside the scanner. Finally, the participant will be asked whether they believed that they received active or sham rTMS. There will be at least a week between the first scan and the second scan to wash out any effects. Session 2: The participant will return and receive pain threshold testing. The participant will then receive 1) [Session 1] a baseline scan (similar to above). 2) [Scan Session 2] Next, in the baseline scan with pain condition, all participants will passively experience and rate laser pain. In this condition, laser stimulations will be delivered to different areas at two distinct temperatures. The temperatures will correspond to each participant's heat-pain threshold (HPTpre) (i.e., the temperature that elicits a pain intensity rating of "1" on the NRS) and suprathreshold (i.e., the temperature at which the participant gives a pain intensity rating of 5/10, NRS). 3) [Session 2] rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia. The participant will be read a script that includes suggestions related to hypnotic analgesia. 22 painful laser stimulations will be delivered again in two runs, and participants will be asked to rate the pain intensity and unpleasantness. Participants will also rate pain intensity and unpleasantness in this condition. 4) [Session 2] rTMS session will be the same as described above. Participants will also rate pain intensity and unpleasantness in this condition to determine the analgesic effect of rTMS alone on analgesia. 5) [Session 2] Post rTMS baseline scan will be performed in the same manner as above. 6) [Session 2] rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia. The participant will be read a script that includes suggestions related to hypnotic analgesia. 22 painful laser stimulations will be delivered again in two runs, and participants will be asked to rate the pain intensity. Specifics: rTMS administration. Using single pulse TMS the scalp position of lowest motor threshold will be determined. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive active DLPFC rTMS (n=50) or sham rTMS (n=50). The investigators will then perform 40 seconds of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) form of rTMS followed by 15 min spacing followed by 40 seconds of cTBS as has been previously described. The standardized treatment DLPFC location for the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be determined by Localite Neuronavigation and targeted at the posterior middle frontal gyrus. The baseline structural scan obtained during the scan 1 will be utilized for this localization process. Sham rTMS will have the same neuronavigation targeting methods. SHAM: Both active and sham DLPFC rTMS will receive simulation from a specially designed coil, the Cool-B65 AP Butterfly coil. This coil is capable of delivering either active rTMS or sham rTMS in a manner, which is randomized by the system itself and therefore blinded to the treater. The sham setting on this coil looks and sounds similar to the active setting, but has a hidden aluminum plate blocking actual stimulation. Hypnosis induction procedures. Hypnosis will be induced while the subject is in the scanner though the use of headphones and a pre-recorded induction script. Hypnotic instructions will be standardized, and will involve a simple induction instruction used in our prior research on the brain signature of the hypnotic state and in clinical care. The ability to enter and maintain the hypnotic state through such an induction mechanism in the fMRI environment has been previously demonstrated. Pain induction assessment procedures. For the pain task, participants will passively experience and rate laser stimuli applied to different regions of the dorsum of their fingers/hands using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS). Ratings will be made for both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness.. Decreased pain ratings will determine the strength of any analgesic effect of treatments. Subjects will be asked to rate their laser-evoked pain following each stimulus during each scan. They will separately be asked to rate their fibromyalgia-related pain during each scan using the same scale. Physiologic data acquisition: Throughout the scanning procedure we will monitor peripheral autonomic physiology using MRI compatible EKG leads and a chest belt that monitors respiration. This will allow us to compute respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which provides a good estimate of vagal tone, which, in turn, is associated with better cardiac health and self-soothing. Customized algorithms developed here at Stanford for simultaneous fMRI/EEG to remove MRI scanner artifact from the EKG tracing will be applied.</detailed_description>
