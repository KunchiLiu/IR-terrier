	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the treatment of migraine pain using low energy laser light to quench migraine signals issuing from the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Low-level Laser Therapy in the Acute Treatment of Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blinded, two arm study, comprising a sham laser and a treatment laser. The sham laser emits approximately 1/1000 the energy of the treatment laser. It is presumed that pain relief from the treatment laser is achieved by exhausting the release of neurotransmitters from the SPG following laser stimulation. Subjects will be treated and subsequently queried at time intervals for their self-assessment of pain score (VAS). The time intervals include queries at 5 minutes through 2 hours post treatment. Subjects will be further contacted 24 hours and one month post treatment. Adverse events will be monitored and recorded.</detailed_description>
