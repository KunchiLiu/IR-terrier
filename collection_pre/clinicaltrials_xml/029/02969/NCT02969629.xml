	<brief_title>The Effects of Apomorphine on Experimental and Clinical Pain in Patients With Chronic Radicular Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the efficacy of dopaminergic interventions in reducing pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed to explore the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on spontaneous pain intensity and evoked cold clinical and experimental pain in patients with lumbar radicular neuropathic pain (NP). Data was collected from 35 patients (18 men, mean age 56.2Â±13.1 years). The following five pain measures were tested before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 min subsequent to subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo in two separate sessions: spontaneous pain intensity, threshold and tolerance to cold pain in the most painful site in the affected leg and in a remote healthy site in the dominant hand.</detailed_description>
