	<brief_summary>This study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide with myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation With Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide in MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Conditioning regimen for lower risk diseases A) Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day i.v. daily for 2 days (days -6 and -5) B) Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v. daily for 5 days (days -6 to -2) - Conditioning regimen for higher risk diseases A) Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day i.v. daily For 4 days (days -6 to -3) in patients aged &lt; 55 years For 2 days (days -6 and -5) in patients aged ≥ 55 years B) Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day i.v. daily on days -6 to -2 (for 5 days) - Harvest and infusion of donor hematopoietic cells Harvested peripheral blood mononuclear cells of donors via leukapheresis will be infused to recipients on day 0. Additional infusion on day 1 can be made based on the judgement of attending physician. - GVHD prophylaxis A) Cyclophosphamide 25 mg/kg/day i.v. daily on days 3 and 4 (for 2 days) B) Cyclosporine: 1.5 mg/kg i.v. every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and changed to oral dosing when oral intake is possible. The dosage will be tapered beginning between day 30 and 60.</detailed_description>
