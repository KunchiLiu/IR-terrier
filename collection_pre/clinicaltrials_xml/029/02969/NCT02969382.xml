	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SEP-363856 in Acutely Psychotic Adults With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, flexibly-dosed, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SEP-363856 in acutely psychotic adult subjects with schizophrenia using SEP-363856 (50 or 75 mg/day [ie, once daily]) versus placebo over a 4-week treatment period. Primary hypoathesis to be tested: H0: μSEP = μPBO versus H1: μSEP ≠ μPBO, where μSEP and μPBO are the mean changes from Baseline at Week 4 in PANSS total score for the SEP-363856 and placebo arms, respectively. Subjects who complete study SEP361-201 may be eligible to enroll in the open-label extension study SEP361-202.</detailed_description>

Male or female subject between 18 to 40 years of age (inclusive) at the time of consent. 4. Subject meets DSM5 criteria for a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia as established by clinical interview (using the DSM5 as a reference and confirmed using the SCIDCT). The duration of the subject's illness whether treated or untreated must be ≥ 6 months. 5. Subject must have a CGIS score ≥ 4 (moderate or greater) at screening and Baseline. 6. Subject must have a PANSS total score ≥ 80 and a PANSS subscale score ≥ 4 (moderate) on 2 or more of the following PANSS subscale items: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, and unusual thought content at screening and Baseline. 7. Subject has an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (no longer than 2 months) and marked deterioration of function from Baseline (by history) and subject has been hospitalized for the purpose of treating an acute psychotic exacerbation for 2 consecutive weeks or less immediately before screening. Subjects who have been hospitalized for more than 2 weeks for reasons unrelated to acute exacerbation can be included with concurrence from the Medical Monitor that such hospitalization was other than acute relapse. For example, subjects in a longterm hospital setting who have an acute exacerbation and are transferred to an acute unit are eligible for the study. 8. Subject has had no more than 2 prior hospitalizations for treatment of acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (not including the current hospitalization). 9.

Female subject of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use adequate and reliable contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug has been taken. In the Investigator's judgment, the subject will adhere to this requirement. 1. Adequate contraception is defined as continuous use of either two barrier methods (eg, condom and spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) or a hormonal contraceptive. Acceptable hormonal contraceptives include the following: a) contraceptive implant (such as Norplant®) implanted at least 90 days prior to screening; b) injectable contraception (such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) given at least 14 days prior to screening; or c) oral contraception taken as directed for at least 30 days prior to screening. 2.

Subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, generally healthy based on screening medical history, PE, neurological examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory values (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel, coagulation panel, thyroid panel, and serum prolactin). 16. Subject has had a stable living arrangement at the time of screening and agrees to return to a similar living arrangement after discharge. This criterion is not meant to exclude subjects who have temporarily left a stable living arrangement (eg, due to psychosis). Such subjects remain eligible to participate in this protocol.

Subject does not tolerate venipuncture or has poor venous access that would cause difficulty for collecting blood samples. 3. Subject is currently participating, or has participated in, a study with an investigational or marketed compound or device within 6 months prior to signing the informed consent, or has participated in 2 or more studies within 24 months prior to signing the informed consent. 4. Subject has previously received SEP363856. 5. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical condition or any clinically significant chronic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in the study: 1. Hematological (including deep vein thrombosis) or bleeding disorder, renal, metabolic, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, urological, cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic, or allergic disease (except for untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). 2. History of cancer or significant neoplasm. 3. Disorder or history of a condition, or previous gastrointestinal surgery (eg, cholecystectomy, vagotomy, bowel resection, or any surgical procedure) that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, gastrointestinal motility, or pH, or a clinically significant abnormality of the hepatic or renal system, or a history of malabsorption. 4. Subject has Alcohol or Substance Abuse Disorder (DSM5 criteria). The only exceptions include caffeine or nicotine. 5. Subject has a clinically significant abnormal 12lead ECG that may jeopardize the subject's ability to complete the study or a screening 12lead ECG demonstrating any one of the following: heart rate &gt; 100 beats per minute, QRS &gt; 120 ms, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 ms (males), QTcF &gt; 470 ms (females), or PR &gt; 220 ms. 6. Subjects with known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity 6. Female subject who is pregnant or lactating. 7.
