	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicentric, randomized, open labeled superiority trial This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of oral activated charcoal for improving elimination of direct oral anticoagulants ( Rivaroxaban, Dabigatran, Apixaban) in case of an unscheduled invasive procedure delayed to this anticoagulant treatment. The primary outcome is the anticoagulant's half life. Plasma concentration will be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for the main analysis (pharmacokinetic) Pharmacodynamics are also determined with specifics anti-Xa levels (Rivaroxaban / Apixaban) or dilute thrombin time (Dabigatran). A total of 72 patients will randomly be assigned to the charcoal or control group, stratified according to their anticoagulant drug.</brief_summary>
