	<brief_summary>Patients with OSA receive manometry measurements with Apneagraph (AG) during one night of sleep. All patients are simultaneously evaluated with polysomnography. Patients who are not eligible for CPAP therapy are additionally studied with drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). The frequency and obstructions patterns in different sleep stages are assessed. In addition obstruction patterns detected with AG are compared with DISE examination in the selected cases.</brief_summary>
