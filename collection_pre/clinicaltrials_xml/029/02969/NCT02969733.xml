	<brief_summary>Recent clinical studies in abdominal surgery have shown that the use of Xylocaine® parenterally intraoperative at plasma concentrations below the toxic threshold of 5 .mu.g / ml, had an analgesic effect and decreased postoperative morphine consumption. This study aims to evaluate the activity of Xylocaine® and ketamine separately administered parenterally, in terms of postoperative morphine consumption and decrease incidences of postoperative chronic pain at 3 and 6 months after laparoscopic colectomy compared the placebo group. The evaluation of the intensity of postoperative pain, hyperalgesia perished skin surface scarring) and pain perception threshold by Pain Matcher® confirm or not the predictive nature of these criteria in the occurrence of chronic pain.</brief_summary>
