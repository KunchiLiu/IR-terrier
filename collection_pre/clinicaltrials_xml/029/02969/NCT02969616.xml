	<brief_title>Trinity Elite in Posterolateral Lumbar Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, post-market, open label clinical study. Up to 10 sites across the United States, with a total enrollment of approximately 120 subjects, will be enrolling subjects. The primary objective of this study is to measure the posterolateral fusion rate at 24 months when posterolateral arthrodesis is performed using Trinity Elite with or without local bone and with supplemental pedicle screw fixation. The primary endpoints are radiographic evidence of posterolateral fusion and the absence of serious adverse events attributable to Trinity ELITE. The secondary objectives of this study are to measure the clinical and economic outcomes when posterolateral arthrodesis is performed using Trinity Elite and/or local bone with supplemental pedicle screw fixation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must be 18 years of age (â‰¥ 18 years) or older at the time of consent. 2. Subject must have a documented diagnosis of DDD. DDD is defined by back and/or radicular pain with degeneration of the disc as confirmed by medical history, physical examination, and radiographic studies that may include CT, MRI, plain Xray film, discography, myelography, etc. with one or more of the following findings: Instability as defined by &gt;3mm translation or &gt;5 degrees angulation Osteophyte formation of facet joints or vertebral endplates Decreased disc height, on average by &gt;2mm, but dependent upon the spinal level Scarring/thickening of ligamentum flavum, annulus fibrosis, or facet joint capsule Herniated nucleus pulposus Facet joint degeneration/changes; and/or Vacuum phenomenon 3. Subject may have up to a Grade I Spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine with clinical manifestations of one or more of the following phenomena: Radiculopathy Sensory deficit Motor weakness Reflex changes 4. Subject must require lumbar posterolateral arthrodesis at 14 contiguous levels (L1S1). 5. The number of levels decompressed must equal the number of levels fused. 6. Subject must have been unresponsive to conservative care for at least 6 months prior to fusion surgery. 7. Subject must agree not to use electromagnetic adjuncts to enhance bone fusion during the course of the study 8. Subject must be willing and able to sign an informed consent document. 9. Subject must be willing and able to return for all followup visits, agree to participate in postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations and comply with the required study regimen. 1. Subject is under 18 years of age (&lt;18) at the time of consent 2. Subject has had prior lumbar spine fusion surgery at any level 3. Subject has greater than grade 1 spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine 4. Subject is currently undergoing treatment for malignancy or has undergone treatment for malignancy in the past 5 years (benign skin cancer is permitted) 5. Subject is pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the two years (24 months) following arthrodesis 6. Subject has an active local or systemic infection or is undergoing adjunctive treatment for local or systemic infection 7. Subject requires supplemental interbody arthrodesis. 8. Subject has an allergy to DMSO. 9. Subject is a prisoner.</criteria>
