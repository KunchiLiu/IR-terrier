	<brief_summary>This study will be a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study where newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma requiring systemic chemotherapy will be eligible for enrollment. A total of 55 subjects will be enrolled. Time to progression or death will be calculated from the date of first treatment on protocol until the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients can expect to participate between 12-24 cycles. The primary endpoint will be the rate of response by next generation gene sequencing at the end of 8 cycles among non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Initial Treatment With Elotuzumab, Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective • The primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of sCR and/or the rate of negative MRD by next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT (Adaptive Biotechnologies) at the end of 8 cycles among non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer transplant Secondary Objectives - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of elotuzumab in combination with KRd, when administered to subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. - To determine the rate of MRD by next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT (Adaptive Biotechnologies) and by multi-color flow cytometry (MFC) at the end of Cycle 4, 8,and 12 for all subjects, and end of C18 (for subjects who are MRD+ at the end of C8 but MRD- at the end of C12 only), 24 months after C1D1, and yearly after that. - To estimate time to event, including duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Exploratory Objectives - GEP, proteomics, and gene sequencing to evaluate the correlation between treatment outcome and pre-treatment subject profile. - Immunologic correlative studies including FcγRIIIa V genotype.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in this study. No enrollment waivers will be granted. 1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated myeloma requiring systemic chemotherapy a. Prior treatment of hypercalcemia or spinal cord compression or active and/or aggressively progressing myeloma with corticosteroids and/or lenalidomide and/or bortezomib/PIbased regimens does not disqualify the subject (the corticosteroid treatment dose should not exceed the equivalent of 160 mg of dexamethasone in a 4 week period or not more than 1 cycle of lenalidomide and/or PIbased therapy) 2. Both transplant and nontransplant candidates are eligible. 3. Diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma as per current IMWG uniform criteria prior to initial treatment 4. Monoclonal plasma cells in the BM 10% or presence of a biopsyproven plasmacytoma 5. Measurable disease, prior to initial treatment as indicated by one or more of the following: 1. Serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL 2. Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours 3. If serum protein electrophoresis is felt to be unreliable for routine Mprotein measurement, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels are acceptable (≥ 1 g/dL) 6. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 21 days prior to enrollment WBC ≥ 2000/µL Platelets ≥ 75 x103/µL ANC &gt;1000/µL Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min 1. Use the CockcroftGault formula below): o Female CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL o Male CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL 2. Alternatively to CockcroftGault formula of CrCl, 24hr urine CrCl can be used AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) or ≤ 2 x ULN if lenalidomide is being prescribed. 7. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age 8. ECOG performance status of 01 9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have 2 negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to initiating lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 1014 days before and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days). 10. FCBP must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. 11. Male subjects must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 12. All study participants in the US must be consented to and registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS. 13.
