	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effect of standardized aerobic exercise (AE) compared to rest on clinical recovery from sport-related concussion (SRC) within the post-acute phase of injury. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: (1) Aerobic Exercise Group: participants will complete a total of eight exercise sessions over the course of 11 days, starting at Day 6 post-injury; (2) Usual Care Group: individuals will undergo a period of physical rest until symptoms spontaneously resolve. For the purposes of this study, "rest" will be defined as the avoidance of any activities beyond those of daily living, including participation in sport and physical activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-acute Structured Exercise Following Sport Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of physical, cognitive, somatic, and emotional symptoms commonly occur following sports-related concussion. The current return to play (RTP) protocol advises complete physical and cognitive rest following SRC until patients are completely free of these symptoms (i.e. asymptomatic) in order to avoid making symptoms worse and furthering the injury. While this initial, post-injury rest period is generally assumed to be beneficial, there is currently no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation. In fact, a growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged rest may actually hinder the recovery process. Emerging research is beginning to show that light-to-moderate aerobic exercise (AE) actually provides a positive benefit on the injured brain, thereby helping the recovery process. Research has shown this benefit in concussion and other injuries such as stroke, whiplash, and low back pain. In fact, a standardized aerobic exercise protocol has been shown to improve recovery for individuals with persistent symptoms for an extended period of time. While preliminary human investigations using AE interventions after concussion have shown promise, these studies are either retrospectively designed, or have focused on individuals with persistent symptoms (&gt; 3 weeks). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a standardized, subacute AE intervention in adolescents after SRC, on time to recovery compared to usual care. This study will provide meaningful information regarding the utility of AE intervention after concussion. Findings from these works may inform future usual care procedures post-injury, potentially providing the first known treatment to improve recovery after concussion.</detailed_description>
