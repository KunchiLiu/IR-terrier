	<brief_title>Management of Third-stage of Labor After Second Trimester Medical Pregnancy Termination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complication of third stage of labor in second trimester medical pregnancy termination is not well studied. Accord to publications, the placental retention rate is 30 to 40% in these situations. Placental retention may be associated with increased blood loss, increased requirement for blood transfusion anesthetic and operative complications, and infectious morbidity. The high incidence of retained placenta is an area of clinical concern. Publications reveal a wide variation in practices but there are only few studies about third stage of labor in second trimester medical pregnancy termination. The study is a prospective randomized trial. Two third stage management strategies are compared: 10 units of intra venous oxytocin (group 1) and no additional medication (group 2) after fetal expulsion. It concerns pregnancies between 14 and 28 weeks gestation.</detailed_description>
