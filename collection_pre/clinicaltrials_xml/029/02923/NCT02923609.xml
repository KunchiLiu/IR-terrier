	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of transendocardial CD34+ cell therapy in patients with HFpEF by evaluating changes in myocardial structure and function, myocardial perfusion and electrical activity, biomarkers of neurohormonal activation, patient exercise capacity and clinical outcome. The secondary objective of the study is to better define the patophysiological background of HFpEF by the use of multimodality imaging platform, which will include data from electro-anatomical mapping, cardiac MRI, 2D and 3D echocardiography, high resolution electrocardiography, and cardiac catheterization</brief_summary>
