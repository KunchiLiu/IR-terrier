	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to understand the role of antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in primary prevention patients indicated for ICD therapy and programmed according to current guidance of higher rate cut-offs and therapy delays. The time to first all-cause shock will be tested in subjects with standard therapy (ATP and shocks) compared to subjects programmed to shock only to assess equivalency.</brief_summary>
