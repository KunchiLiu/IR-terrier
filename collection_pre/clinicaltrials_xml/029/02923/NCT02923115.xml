	<criteria>Male or female subjects, age 18 to 75 years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute PE categorized as low risk or intermediaterisk or submassive PE and for whom catheterbased therapy is not planned; Subjects must have a CTA scan confirming the PE diagnosis and with at least one measurable index lesion in a segmental or larger pulmonary artery prior to randomization; Subjects should be in otherwise satisfactory health in the opinion of the Investigator; Subjects must be able to provide written informed consent. Subjects with acute PE categorized as highrisk or massive, or who are hemodynamically unstable, evidenced by a heart rate &gt; 120 /min and a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &lt; 90 mmHg for more than 15 consecutive minutes or a drop in SBP of &gt; 40 mmHg since presentation; Subjects for whom use of a thrombolytic, either systemic or via catheter, is planned; Subjects with PE lesions only in the subsegmental or smaller arteries; Subjects receiving any vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) prior to randomization or receiving more than 36 hours treatment with LMW(low molecular weight Heparin) in therapeutic doses prior to randomization; Subjects who had a prior intracranial hemorrhage, known arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm, head trauma, or evidence of active bleeding; Subjects who within 48 hours of randomization have used an antiFactor IIa agent such as dabigatran or an antiFXa agent such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban; Subjects who within 21 days prior to randomization have had gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding; Subjects who within 14 days prior to randomization have had major surgery or a lumbar puncture (or epidural steroid injection); Subjects with diagnosed active liver disease or with elevation of liver enzymes/bilirubin.</criteria>
