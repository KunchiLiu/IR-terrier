	<brief_title>Whole Brain Vessel Wall Imaging in Stroke Patients (WISP): An International Multi-Center Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The registry will focus on investigating the utility of whole-brain intracranial vessel wall MRI techniques in assessing the etiologies in patients with ischemic stroke. Patients with stroke onset within 2 weeks and confirmed by diffusion weighted MRI will be recruited for whole-brain intracranial vessel wall MRI scans. It is anticipated that a total of 1000 subjects will be recruited from Oct 2016 to Mar 2018. A total of 12 centers in US and China will participate in the registry study. MRI vessel wall images will be analyzed for detection and characteristics of various vessel wall pathologies and association between vessel wall imaging findings and patient's clinical information.</detailed_description>
