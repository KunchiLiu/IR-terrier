	<brief_title>Evaluation of MF4637 for Correcting the Omega-3 Nutritional Deficiency in NAFLD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver (simple steatosis) confirmed within the last year by ultrasound or other imaging modality will be recruited to the study. Subjects will be randomized to a treatment arm of high concentrate capsules or placebo for a 6 month treatment period.Omega-3 content of red blood cells (omega-3 index) will be measured for primary endpoint assessment. Quantitative MRI will be performed to determine the effect on liver fat content.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Documented history of clinical diagnosis of NAFLD by ultrasound, MRI or biopsy within one (1) year prior to screening (V1). If the diagnostic test date is greater than one (1) year, abdominal ultrasound will be repeated at (V1) and must confirm a diagnosis of NAFLD. 2. Men or women, ≥18 years of age. 3. BMI between 18.0 and 39.9 kg/m2. 4. Nonsmokers (&gt;3 months of nonsmoking). 5. If on a statin regimen, history (&gt; 1 month stable dose) of taking a statin medication (HMGCoA reductase inhibitor example: Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor, Pravachol, Lescol, Livalo, etc). 6. Able to understand and cooperate with study procedures, and have signed a written informed consent prior to any study procedures. 1. Diagnosis of NASH. 2. Bilirubin &gt;2x ULN. 3. Other causes of liver inflammation including Hepatitis A, B or C, HIV, confirmed or suspected cirrhosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis, pancreatitis, or prescription medications known to cause liver damage, or known to be hepatotoxic. 4. Subjects with a history of bariatric surgery. 5. Significant weight loss (&gt; 5% body weight) or rapid weight loss (&gt;1.6 kg/week), within six months of screening. 6. Current or recent (within six months of screening) history of significant gastrointestinal, renal, pulmonary, hepatic or biliary disease, endocrine diseases or other invasive weight loss treatments (Type II Diabetes permitted, and stable (&gt; 3 months) thyroid disorders). 7. Individual taking prescription or overthecounter medications (including dietary supplements, see Appendix 1) known to alter lipid metabolism, within four (4) weeks of randomization. These medications include (but are not limited to) the following: bile acid sequestrants, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, niacin or fibrates, 8. Individuals taking prescription omega3 fatty acids. 9. Use of supplements including Omega3s and Omega6s, other oilbased supplements, phytosterols, Vitamin E, prebiotics and probiotics, or any weight loss supplements within four (4) weeks of randomization (multivitamins and minerals containing Vitamin E are permitted). 10. Use of systemic corticosteroids, androgens (except androgens for hypogonadism to restore normal levels), phenytoin, erythromycin and other macrolides, thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone), and thyroid hormones (except stabledose thyroid replacement therapy for four (4) weeks prior to enrollment). 11. Use of the anticoagulants warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto). NOTE: Antiplatelet agents such as Plavix are allowed. 12.

History of significant cardiovascular or coronary heart disease (CVD or CHD) as defined by having had a coronary artery bypass procedure, coronary stent or angioplasty, or myocardial infarction in the previous six (6) months. 14. History of cancer, other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and basal cell carcinoma, within the previous five years. 15. Poorly controlled or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥95 mmHg). 16. Recent history of prolonged alcohol (&gt;3 months) use (within past 6 months) or excessive alcohol use, defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (one drink = 12 oz. beer, 4 oz. wine, 1.5 oz. hard liquor). 17. Exposure to any investigational agent within four (4) weeks prior to Visit 1. 18. Subjects planning to undergo surgery during the study period or up to 1 month after the study 19. Any serious psychiatric disease or disorder, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subject from participating in the study. 20. Any known intolerance to the investigational ingredients of this medical food. 21. Has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the evaluation of the subject, or may put the subject at undue risk during the course of the study, including potentially abnormal lab results, due to a traumatic event.</criteria>
