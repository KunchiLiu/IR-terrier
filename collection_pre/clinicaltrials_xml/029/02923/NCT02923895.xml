	<brief_summary>This single centre study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an experimental stannous fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) after short term use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Investigate the Efficacy of an Occluding Dentifrice in Dentinal Hypersensitivity (DH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single centre, three day, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected test teeth), controlled study, in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet all the criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) visits. DH will be assessed at baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and after 3 days twice daily use.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Demonstrates understanding of the study and willingness to participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent and has received a signed and dated copy of the informed consent form. Aged 1865 years. Good general and mental health with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically qualified designee: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history or oral examination and absence of any condition that would impact on the participants safety or wellbeing or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and restrictions. At Visit 1 (Screening): Selfreported history of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) lasting more than six months but not more than 10 years; Minimum of 20 natural teeth; Minimum of 2 accessible nonadjacent teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), preferably in different quadrants, that meet all of the following criteria: Signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or abrasion (EAR), tooth with MGI score =0 adjacent to the test area (exposed dentine) only and a clinical mobility of ≤1, tooth with signs of sensitivity measured by qualifying evaporative air assessment (Y/N response) At Visit 2, Baseline (Pretreatment): Minimum of two, nonadjacent accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), that meet all of the following criteria: Tooth with signs of sensitivity, measured by qualifying tactile stimulus (Yeaple ≤ 20g) and evaporative air assessment (Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2) A woman who is known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. A woman who is breastfeeding. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. Participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit, previous participation in this study and any participant who was randomised for inclusion in study 205710 Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse. An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family. Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes and any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes xerostomia. Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of Screening, tongue or lip piercing, desensitizing treatment within 8 weeks of Screening (professional sensitivity treatments and nondentifrice sensitivity treatments), Gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery) within 12 months of Screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of screening and vital teeth bleaching within 8 weeks of Screening. Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay within 12 months of Screening, tooth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, dental implants, teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine and sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthecounter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator. Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentine hypersensitivity within 8 weeks of screening (participants will be required to bring their current oral care products to the site in order to verify the absence of known antisensitivity ingredients). Daily doses of medication/treatments which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the perception of pain. Examples of such medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that cause marked or moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquilisers, antidepressants, moodaltering andantiinflammatory drugs, currently taking antibiotics or has taken antibiotics within 2 weeks of Baseline and daily dose of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, is causing xerostomia. Any participant who, in the judgment of the investigator, should not participate in the study.</criteria>
