	<brief_title>Ocular Adaptation and Visual Performance for Accommodative Contact Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the proposed study we plan to recruit presbyopes (people who might have a significant loss of their ability to accommodate their crystalline lens in the eye) to wear a test lens and perform typical clinical tests of visual acuity with different luminance levels and viewing distances/angles. These are similar to the typical examinations conducted for regular contact lens wearers. Results of this testing will be used to evaluate the efficacy of test lenses and to provide additional information for revision of test lenses. If shown to provide adequate eye comfort and intended vision correction, this lens design has the potential of allowing tens of millions of presbyopes to adapt to contact lenses and significantly improve their vision and well-being.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Be between 40 and 65 years of age. Have normal/correctedtonormal monocular acuity of better than 20/25 for both eyes. Have pupil diameter in regular lighting â‰¥ 2.5 mm. Willing and able to wear multifocal contact lenses in both eyes. Have a current optical prescription (obtained less than 2 years ago). Have spherical equivalent correction equal to or higher than 1.00 Diopter and equal to or less than +0.50 Diopter. Have cylindrical correction equal to less than 0.50 Diopter. Have no prismatic correction. Without any eye infection, inflammation, disease, or abnormality that contraindicates contact lens wear within the past 6 months.
