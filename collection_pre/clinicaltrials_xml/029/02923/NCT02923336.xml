	<brief_title>Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Transit Pre and Pos Treatment With Non Selective Betablocker in a Population of Cirrhotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is some evidence that cirrhotic patients have increased gastrointestinal transit time, this issue may favor bacterial owergrowth, and consequently bacterial translocation. Translocation of bacterias and its products are linked to vascular and hemodynamics alterations that produce descompensation on the disease. There is evidence , in animal models , that the use of beta blockers favors the gastrointestinal movement; decompensated cirrhotics had significantly longer small bowel transit time as compared with compensated cirrhotics, there have described that this alteration is related to de cirrhosis severity as assessed by Child Pugh score. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the gastrointestinal transit time before and after treatment of non selective betablockers, we are going to evaluate the gastrointestinal time before and after of 4 weeks of non selectivebetablocker treatment, in decompensated cirrhotics. The gastrointestinal time is going to be evaluate by the ingestion of a device known as "smart pill", that allow ambulatory monitoring of gastrointestinal transit.</detailed_description>
