	<brief_summary>The translation study aims to refine and package intervention and training materials essential to translating an efficacious Emergency Department (ED) based Brief Intervention (BI) for violence (SafERteens) for two delivery methods: by ED staff on site or by therapist remotely. The study will take place in two phases. During the Effectiveness phase, we will determine the effectiveness of the interventions [on-site therapist delivered BI + text messages (n=133); remote therapy delivered BI + text messages (n=133)], as compared to a usual care control (brochure; n=133), on violence outcomes at 3 months. Note that tailored text messages will be delivered daily for the first month post-discharge, and three times per week in the second month post-discharge to the BI groups. During the Implementation phase, components of the RE-AIM model will be assessed over a 4-month period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants who screen positive for the study during the effectiveness phase, will be randomized to either the therapy or control at a rate of 2:1. Whether the participant receives the on-site therapist or the remote therapist will depend on day of week or shift. Over the course of the study, the proportion of shifts covered by on-site verses remote therapists will be balanced for seasonality and time of day (evening vs. day time).</detailed_description>
