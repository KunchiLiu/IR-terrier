	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of X4P-001 plus nivolumab is safe and tolerable. Secondly, the study will investigate if adding X4P-001 to nivolumab treatment has an effect on the body and the cancer tumor, in patients receiving nivolumab but not exhibiting a radiological response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition of X4P-001 to Nivolumab Treatment in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, may result in the generation of anti-tumor immune responses. However, the objective radiological response in advanced RCC patients was only 21.5%. Therefore, it is important to identify additional therapies that could augment the anti-tumor immune activity of checkpoint inhibitors, resulting in an increase in the number of patients able to achieve a radiological response to treatment. While checkpoint inhibitors facilitate activation of cytotoxic T cells, the agents do not impact T cell trafficking. X4P-001, a CXCR4 antagonist, is hypothesized to impact the trafficking of immune cell types, for example, decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increasing cytotoxic T cells at the tumor. Giving X4P-001 treatment in combination with nivolumab is hypothesized to increase the clinical response to by providing an influx of T cells that can be further activated by the checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, CXCR4 plays a role in trafficking of endothelial progenitor cells which mediate angiogenesis. RCC is known to be responsive to anti-angiogenic agents, and thus X4P-001 targets a second mechanism of tumor growth inhibition.</detailed_description>
