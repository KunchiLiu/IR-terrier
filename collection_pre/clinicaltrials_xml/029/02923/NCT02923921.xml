	<brief_title>Study of AM0010 With FOLFOX Compared to FOLFOX Alone Second-line Tx in Pts With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of AM0010 in combination with FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have progressed on one prior gemcitabine containing regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The presence of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma 2. Measurable disease per RECIST v.1.1 3. Patient must have documented tumor progression during or following a gemcitabine containing regimen to treat metastatic disease as established by CT or MRI scan 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 1 5. Patient must have completed prior chemotherapy at least 2 weeks (washout period) prior to randomization and recovered from toxicity to Grade 1 or baseline 6. Patients must not have received previous radiation therapy or investigational therapy for the treatment of advanced metastatic disease. 7. Patients having received cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine or any other chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting are not eligible for this study 8. No peripheral neuropathy 9. No known history of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency 1. Diagnosis of pancreatic islet neoplasm, acinar cell carcinoma, non adenocarcinoma (i.e., lymphoma, sarcoma), adenocarcinoma originating from the biliary tree, or cystadenocarcinoma 2. Patient on Coumadin and not willing to change to LMWH or oral Factor II or Xa inhibitor with halflife of less than 24 hours. 3. Patient has received prior treatment with AM0010 or fluoropyrimidine/platinum containing regimen 4. Patients who were intolerant of a gemcitabine containing regimen. 5. History of positivity for human immunodeficiency virus 6. Chronic active or active viral hepatitis A, B, or C infection 7. Clinically significant bleeding within two weeks prior to randomization (e.g., gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage) 8. Pregnant or lactating women 9. Patients with a history of immunemediated neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, GuillainBarré or inflammatory CNS/PNS disorders 10. Clinically significant ascites defined as requiring ≥ 1 paracentesis every 2 weeks 11. Major surgery, defined as any surgical procedure that involves general anesthesia and a significant incision (i.e., larger than what is required for placement of central venous access, percutaneous feeding tube, or biopsy),within 28 days prior to randomization or anticipated surgery during the study period 12. Prior history of receiving immune modulators including, but not limited to, antiCTLA4, antiPD1, antiPDL1</criteria>
