	<brief_summary>The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC or kidney cancer) in men exceeds that of pancreatic cancer or leukemia. In women, the incidence of RCC is similar to that of leukemia, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer; thus, RCC is significant health issue. This study focuses on identifying specific molecules [biomarkers] of RCC that can be used to develop a reliable low-cost screening method at the point of service. If successful, our method would provide a diagnostic test to distinguish benign kidney masses from malignant ones, eliminating the need to surgically remove a kidney with a benign tumor.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients 18 years of age and older undergoing surgery. Patient samples are divided into 2 groups based on their surgery: Patients with an imaged renal mass, encompassing about 300 patients/year (about 1200 total) of both malignant (about 8085% of time) and benign (about 1520% of time), and patients with nonkidney cancers, encompassing about 6,000 patients/year (about 24,000 total), Age &lt;18 years and prisoners.</criteria>
