	<brief_title>The Clinical Application of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells on Facial Rejuvenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a prospective study of patients who undergo adipose-derived stem cells therapy for facial rejuvenation at the hospital of Xuzhou medical university. The therapy involves injection of patient's own adipose-derived stem cells, which are separated from vacuumed fat obtained through liposuction of abdomen, hip, thigh and so on. It was confirmed the adipose-derived stem cells can be induced differentiation into fat cells, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, muscle cells, endothelial cells and so on under the corresponding condition in the current literature. The therapy has evolved as a less invasive technique for facial rejuvenation compared to more traditional techniquesï¼Œsuch as fat cells injection, sodium hyaluronate injection. Through the use of pre and post treatment photos, three-dimensional skin CT, in addition to the therapeutic evaluation, patient satisfaction questionnaire and a clinician assessment, it is our hope that the investigators will confirm the rejuvenating capabilities of adipose-derived stem cells therapy.</detailed_description>
