	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects of talimogene laherparepvec and radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma that can be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, photons. electrons, or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving talimogene laherparepvec and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talimogene Laherparepvec and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Soft Tissue Sarcoma That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pathologic complete response rate (the number of patients with &gt;= 95% necrosis divided by the number of evaluable patients) following preoperative treatment with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with radiation in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma including a pre-planned safety analysis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity of T-VEC in combination with radiation in localized soft tissue sarcomas, during neo-adjuvant treatment and post-surgical resection wound complications. II. To determine the rate of radiologic response, prior to surgery, and extent of surgical resection. III. To estimate time to surgery, time to progression, time to recurrence, and death. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the clinical outcomes within three distinct histologic subtypes: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. II. To characterize the percentage of tumor necrosis in treated tumors. III. To determine if the combination of preoperative T-VEC with radiation will increase the expression of PD-L1 in soft tissue sarcomas. IV. To determine the impact of preoperative T-VEC with radiation on the tumor infiltrating and circulating immune cells in patients with soft tissue sarcomas. OUTLINE: Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Beginning 8-10 days after start of talimogene laherparepvec, patients undergo radiation therapy at weeks 2-6. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then every year for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
