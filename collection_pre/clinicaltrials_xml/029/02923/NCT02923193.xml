	<brief_summary>Shockwave Medical Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized (1:1) study of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB versus standard balloon angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries. Assuming that roughly 15% of the subjects will be lost-to-follow-up, a total of 334 subjects (167 per treatment arm) will be enrolled in the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Shockwave Medical Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized (1:1) study of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB versus standard balloon angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries. The Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty System is indicated for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilatation of calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. Up to 334 subjects at 45 sites in Europe, the United States and New Zealand. Subjects will be followed through discharge, 30 days, and 6, 12 and 24 months. DUS assessments will be completed at 12 and 24 months. Procedural success defined as residual stenosis &lt;30% prior to DCB or stenting by angiographic core lab.</detailed_description>

Subject has at least one patent tibial vessel on the target leg with runoff to the foot, defined as no stenosis &gt;50%. 14. Calcification is at least moderate defined as presence of fluoroscopic evidence of calcification: 1) on parallel sides of the vessel and 2) extending &gt; 50% the length of the lesion.

History of prior endovascular or surgical procedure on the index limb within the past 30 days or planned within 30 days of the index procedure. 5. Subject has a known coagulopathy or has bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 100,000/microliter. 6. Subject in whom antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated. 7. Subject has known allergy to contrast agents or medications used to perform endovascular intervention that cannot be adequately pretreated. 8.
