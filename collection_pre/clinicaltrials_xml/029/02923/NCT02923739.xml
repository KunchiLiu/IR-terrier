	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding emactuzumab to the combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab can help to control relapsed or refractory ovarian, Fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The safety and side effects of this drug combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Discontinuation Trial of Emactuzumab Following Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in Patients With Platinum-Resistant, Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer - REDIRECT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join the study. Up to 9 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 112 participants will be enrolled in Part 2. You are in Part 1, you will receive paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and emactuzumab to check for the highest tolerable dose. Study Drug Administration: Every study cycle will be 28 days. You will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, of each cycle. You will receive bevacizumab and emactuzumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Bevacizumab will be given over about 90 minutes the first time it is given. Doses after this will be given over a shorter time if no side effects are seen. Emactuzumab will be given over about 30 minutes each time it is given on this study. If the disease gets worse and you agree, you will have a core biopsy, be taken off study, and offered other treatment options. Length of Study: You may continue receiving the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Study Visits: On Day 1 of every cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing, to check your, heart function, and for tumor marker testing. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before and after the dose for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures how much study drug is in the body at different time points. On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every 8 weeks after that, you will have either a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. On Days 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn before the dose for pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker testing. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have an EKG at any time during the study. End of Treatment: After you stop receiving the study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart function, and for tumor marker testing. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have either a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PD testing. Follow-Up Visit: About 30 days (+/- 5 days) after receiving your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and tumor marker testing. Information about your health status will continue to be collected from your medical record for up to 5 years after you leave the study. This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab and paclitaxel are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancer. This drug combination is approved for the treatment of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer. Emactuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. The addition of emactuzumab to the combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel is investigational and is currently being used for research purposes only. The doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 9 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of this multicenter study. All will take part at MD Anderson. Up to 112 participants will be enrolled in Part 2 of this study. Up to 74 will take part at MD Anderson. Part 2: Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join the study. Up to 9 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 112 participants will be enrolled in Part 2. You are in Part 2. You will begin the study by receiving paclitaxel and bevacizumab for up to 8 weeks. After that, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study arms. - If you are in Arm 1, you will receive paclitaxel and bevacizumab. - If you are in Arm 2, you will receive paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and emactuzumab. Study Drug Administration: Every study cycle will be 28 days. You will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for up to 2 cycles and you will receive bevacizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 for up to 2 cycles. This will be called Part 2A. The status of the disease will then be checked. If the disease gets worse and you agree, you will have a core biopsy, be taken off study, and offered other treatment options. If the disease improves, you will continue to receive the same treatment as in Part 2A and will not continue onto Part 2B. If the disease is stable, you will have a core biopsy and continue onto Part 2B. - If you are in Arm 1 of Part 2B, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle and you will receive bevacizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. - If you are in Arm 2 of Part 2B, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle and you will receive bevacizumab and emactuzumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

On Days 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are in Part 2A, on Day 22 of Cycle 2, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn before the dose for PD testing. If you are in Part 2B, on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 5, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn before the dose for PD testing. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have an EKG at any time during the study. End of Treatment: After you stop receiving the study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart function, and for tumor marker testing. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have either a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. - If you are in Part 2B, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PD testing.
