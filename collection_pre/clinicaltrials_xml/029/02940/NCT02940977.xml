	<brief_summary>1. To elucidate the role of CTC detection in the evaluation of risk level in PCa patients, and establish a mathematic model for predicting the pathological status. 2. To explore the possible subtle change in CTC condition after radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Establishment and Clinical Assessment of a Prostate Cancer (PCa) Risk Model Based on the Updated Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Detection Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Detect and evaluate the CTC status (a total of 5 times: 1 day before sugery, 3/6/9/12 after surgery) for all of the PCa patients enrolled. Analyze the CTC result with PSA level, needle biopsy and radiological imaging information. 2. Analyze the difference in CTC amount/Epithelial-Mesenchymal ratio between patients in different D'Amico risk level(low/intermediate/high). 3. Establish a mathematic model based on the CTC results and pathological condition observed in operation (OC, organ confined; EPE, extraprostatic extension; SVI, seminal vesicle invasion; LNI, lymph node invasion), and compare this model with the latest version of Partin table. 4. Detect and compare the CTC and PSA level in every 3 months (3/6/9/12) after surgery. Evaluate the radiological condition in 12 months after blood draw.</detailed_description>
