	<brief_summary>Background: Obesity treatment should be individualized since some calorie restricted diet doesn't work for some individuals. Objective: we assess the effect of two different calorie restriction with MediterrAsian diet on weight loss of FTO rs9939609 carriers with overweight. Methods: we recruit 80 healthy overweight participants aged 20-45 years that randomly allocated in two interventional group [group 1: Mediterrasian diet according to adjusted ideal body weight with 500 calories restriction (RD) and group 2: without 500 calories restriction (NRD)+ Moderate physical activity]. Anthropometric indices will be assesses for all participants weekly for two month. The criteria for weight loss is 250-500 grams weekly. Metabolic indices, physical activity and psychologic aspects will be assesses at baseline and the end of the intervention. Dietary adherence will be checked by 24hr recalls at day 0, 30 and 60. At the end of the study, we compare carriers with different alleles (AA+TA and TT) in two intervention groups to find out which calorie restriction is appropriate for each genotype. Significant p-value is less than 0.05.</brief_summary>
