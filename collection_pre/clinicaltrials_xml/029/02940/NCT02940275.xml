	<brief_summary>This is an observational clinical study, patients with systemic diseases will be enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will received the examination of sublingual microcirculation by using incident dark field video microscope (Cytocam，Braedius Battery Powered Transilluminator). The microcirculation data includes total small vessel density, perfused small vessel density, microvascular flow index, and heterogeneity index. The patients will be divided into right groups according to their systemic diseases as follows: group 1 hypertension (60 patients), group 2 diabetes mellitus (60), group 3 hypertension and diabetes mellitus (60), group 4 end stage renal disease with hemodialysis (60), group 5 kidney transplant recipients (60), group 6 coronary artery disease (60), and group 7 peripheral arterial occlusive disease (60).</brief_summary>
