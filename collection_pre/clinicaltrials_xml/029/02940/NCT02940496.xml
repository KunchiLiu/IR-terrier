	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Length of Study: You may receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (about 2 years). You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycle 1: You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic testing; to test for hepatitis B and C (if the doctor thinks it is needed); and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure how some genes (DNA, genetic material) in your body may react to pembrolizumab; and to check the status of the disease, and to check for signs of inflammation. You will have an MRI or CT scan. If you can become pregnant, part of the above blood sample will used for a pregnancy test. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, this sample will also be used to check for hepatitis B and C. - At Cycle 2, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) will be drawn for PD testing. - At Cycles 2, 5, and 6, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to check for signs of inflammation. - If you can become pregnant, part of the above blood sample will used for a pregnancy test. On Day 1 of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 9 weeks after that, you will have an MRI or CT scan. After 1 year, you will have an MRI or CT scan every 12 weeks. On Day 1 of even-numbered cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), urine will be collected for routine tests. After you have received the study drug for about 6 weeks (at about Cycle 2), you will have a biopsy to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing. End-of- Study Visit: As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests; genetic and PD testing; to check for signs of inflammation; and to check the status of the disease. - Urine will be collected for routine tests - You may have a CT scan or MRI. - If you can become pregnant, part of the above blood or urine sample will used for a pregnancy test. Follow-Up Visit: About 30-90 days after your last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, this sample will also be used to check for hepatitis B and C. - Depending on when your last scan was performed, you may have a CT scan or MRI. - If you can become pregnant, part of the blood sample or a urine sample will used for a pregnancy test. Long-Term Follow-Up: Every 9 weeks after your last dose of study drug, you will have an MRI or CT scan. If you stopped taking the study drug because the disease appeared to get worse or because you wanted to start a new anti-cancer therapy, you will be called by the study staff every 12 weeks to ask how you are doing. This call should last about 10-15 minutes. This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Be =/&gt;18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 4. Have histologically or cytologically documented HCC (documentation of original biopsy for diagnosis is acceptable if tumor tissue is unavailable) or clinical diagnosis by AASLD criteria in cirrhotic subjects is required. For subjects without cirrhosis histological confirmation is mandatory. 5. Have Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C disease or BCLC Stage B disease not amenable to locoregional therapy or refractory to locoregional therapy, and not amenable to a curative treatment approach. 6. Have a ChildPugh A liver score within 7 days of first dose of study drug. 7. Have a predicted life expectancy of greater than 3 months. 8. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as confirmed by the blinded MD Anderson radiology. Target lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. Note: the same image acquisition and processing parameters should be used throughout the study for a given subject. 9. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale within 7 days of first dose of study drug. 10. Have documented objective radiographic progression after stopping treatment with sorafenib or else intolerance to sorafenib. Intolerance to sorafenib is defined as: CTCAE Grade =/&gt;2 drugrelated adverse event(s) which both a) persisted in spite of comprehensive supportive therapy according to institutional standards and b) persisted or recurred after sorafenib treatment interruption of at least 7 days and dose reduction by one dose level. Patients treated on sorafenib as the last treatment may start pembrolizumab at least 14 days after the last dose of sorafenib. 11. Subjects with chronic infection by HCV who are treated or untreated are allowed on study. Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection, defined as having a negative HBsAg test and a positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test and negative HBV DNA test at screening, are eligible for the study. In addition, subjects with successful treatment (defined as sustained virologic response [SVR12] or SVR24) are allowed as long as 4 weeks have passed between completion of HCV therapy and start of study drug. 12. Have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication (Cycle 1, Day 1) (female subjects of childbearing potential). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 13. Be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (male and female subjects of childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are as follows: A) Single method (one of the following is acceptable): a) intrauterine device (IUD); b) vasectomy of a female subject's male partner; c) contraceptive rod implanted into the skin B) Combination method (requires use of two of the following): a) diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide); c) cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only); d) contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only); e) male condom or female condom (cannot be used together); f) hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/ progestin pill or progestin only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection 14. (Continuation of inclusion criteria #13) Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region. 15. Demonstrate adequate organ function. All screening laboratory tests should be performed within 7 days of treatment initiation: a) Hematological Absolute neutrophil count =/&gt;1200/µL; Platelets =/&gt; 60,000/µL; Hemoglobin =/&gt; 8 g/dL without transfusion or EPO dependency within 7 days; b) Renal Creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance) =/&lt;1.5 × ULN OR =/&gt;60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt;1.5 × institutional ULN. Note: Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard; c) Hepatic Total bilirubin =/&lt;2 mg/dL, or direct bilirubin =/&lt;ULN for those with total bilirubin &gt;2×ULN; AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) =/&lt;5 × ULN ; Albumin =/&gt;3 g/dL; d) Coagulation INR or PT aPTT =/&lt;1.5 × ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. 1.

Has had esophageal or gastric variceal bleeding within the last 6 months. All subjects will be screened for esophageal varices, unless such screening has been performed in the past 12 months before first dose of treatment. If varices are present, they should be treated according to institutional standards before starting study treatment. 3. Subjects with ALT &gt;5x ULN at Day 1 are not eligible for enrollment. 4. Subjects with Total Bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL at Day 1 are not eligible for enrollment 5.
