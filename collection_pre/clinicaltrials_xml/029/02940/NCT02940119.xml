	<brief_summary>Pain in the neck and shoulders is a musculoskeletal disorder that affects a significant number of individuals.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of PBMT (with a device that combines low level laser therapy and light emitting diode therapy) in chronic pain relief of musculoskeletal origin in the neck and shoulders area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neck and Shoulder Pain Research Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Seventy-two patients with chronic pain in neck and shoulder were recruited and randomized into two groups (n = 36 each group), one group received active PBMT and another group received placebo PBMT (with a device with same appearance of the actual laser, including any visible light). Patients were treated at 9 different sites of 3 zones in the neck and shoulders area, twice a week during 3 consecutive weeks with a PBMT device manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical™ (Solon - OH, USA). Primary outcome was intensity of pain using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM) of the neck and shoulders and patient satisfaction with therapy employed.</detailed_description>
