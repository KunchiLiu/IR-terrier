	<brief_title>Effects of Fish Oil and Physical Activity on Fatigue in Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Regorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. - If participant is in Group 1, participant will take a fish oil supplement by mouth twice a day and perform physical activity for 8 weeks. - If participant is in Group 2, participant will take placebo by mouth twice a day and perform physical activity for 8 weeks. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect. - If participant is in Group 3, participant will take placebo twice a day and perform only stretching exercises for 8 weeks. Participant will meet with an exercise specialist during the first week who will teach participant different stretches. Fish Oil/Placebo Administration: After participant's baseline tests, participant will be given an 8-week supply of the fish oil/placebo to take home. Starting the next morning, participant will take 2 capsules twice a day by mouth for 8 weeks. Participant should take the capsules with food and a cup (8 ounces) of water at around 8 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Participant should store fish oil capsules at room temperature. Physical Activity: If participant is in Group 1 or 2, participant will complete resistance exercises and a walking program at home for 8 weeks. For the resistance exercises, participant will use color-coded tubes that have 3 levels of resistance: light, moderate, or hard. Participant will move up in resistance as participant gains strength. Participant will begin with 2 sets of 12 repetitions. Participant will complete these exercises 3 days a week with at least 48 hours between each session. Participant will also be asked to walk at least 5 days a week. The study staff will recommend how long each walk is and how many times a day to walk. Participant will also be given a log where participant should record the number of steps participant takes each day. Participant must bring this log with participant to each study visit. If participant is in Group 3, participant will meet with an exercise specialist during the first week to learn different stretching exercises. Participant will complete these stretching exercises 3 days a week for 8 weeks. Length of Study Participation: Participant may continue receiving the fish oil/placebo and participating in the physical activity for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, depending on what group participant was in, participant may choose to continue receiving the fish oil supplement for an additional 4 weeks. If participant was receiving the placebo, participant may begin taking fish oil for 4 weeks. If participant chooses to continue or to begin receiving fish oil, participant will also take part in the physical activity described above for Groups 1 and 2 for 4 weeks. Participant will no longer be able to take the fish oil/placebo or participate in the physical activity if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after participant has completed the follow-up visit. Study Visits: On Days 8 (± 3), 21 (± 3), 36 (± 5), and 50 (± 5), participant will complete 1 questionnaire about any symptoms participant may be having. If participant cannot make it into the clinic, this may be completed with a phone call. The phone call should last about 10 minutes. On Days 15 (± 3) and 43 (± 5): - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will be asked to complete the same 7 questionnaires that participant completed at baseline. If participant cannot make it into the clinic, these questionnaires can be completed by phone call. On Day 29 (+/- 3 days): - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will be asked to complete the 7 questionnaires that participant completed at baseline. If participant cannot make it to the clinic, these questionnaires can be completed by phone. - Participant will complete the 6-minute walk test. - Participant will complete the 30-second chair-stand test. - Participant's BMI and REE will be measured. Participant will receive 1 phone call each week during which participant will be asked about participant's progress and helped with any problems participant may be having completing the program. These calls should last about 10-15 minutes each. End-of-Study Visit: At Day 57 (+/-5 days): - Participant will have a physical exam. - If not done in the past 15 days, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will be asked to complete the same 7 questionnaires that participant completed at baseline and 1 additional questionnaire that asks if participant's symptoms are better or worse after starting the new treatment. - Participant will complete the 6-minute walk test. - Participant will complete the 30-second chair-stand test. - Participant's BMI and REE will be measured. - Participant will return the accelerometer and the pedometer to the study staff. Follow-Up Visit: One (1) month (+/-5 days) after the End-of-Study visit: - Participant will be asked to complete the same 7 questionnaires that participant completed at baseline. - Participant will complete the 6-minute walk test. - Participant will complete the 30-second chair-stand test. This is an investigational study. Fish oil is commercially available for use as a dietary supplement. The use of fish oil in combination with physical activity is currently being studied. The study doctor can explain how the study supplements are designed to work. Up to 96 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
