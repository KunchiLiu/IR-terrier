	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or has not responded to treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the complete response (CR) rate with ibrutinib at the standard dose of 560 mg daily in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks up to 16 infusions in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) with ibrutinib and nivolumab in combination in patients with relapsed or refractory classical HL. II. To determine safety and toxicity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. III. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL treated with combined ibrutinib and nivolumab. IV. To determine the duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL treated with ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on the distribution of T-, B-, and NK cells in the peripheral blood. II. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on Th1/Th2 cytokines profile and correlate this with treatment response. III. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on Th1/Th2 ration and specific IgG sub-isotypes. OUTLINE: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and nivolumab IV continuously over 60 minutes on day 1.Treatment with nivolumab repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses and treatment with ibrutinib continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
