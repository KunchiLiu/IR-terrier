	<brief_title>Effect of Continuous Apomorphine During the Night on Sleep Disorders in Insomniac Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disorders are very common in Parkinson's disease (PD). They are present in almost all patients. They have an important impact on quality of life. To improve the comfort of patients, neurologists typically offer either dispersible form of levodopa, prolonged release dopaminergic agonists treatments or deep brain stimulation surgery. Unfortunately these treatments are too short-acting for the dispersible form of levodopa or not always sufficient for the oral or transdermal dopamine agonist or are very heavy to implement as surgery. Some sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements, and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, seem to be more frequent in PD patients than in general population and could be improved by a continuous dopaminergic treatment the night. Finally, daytime sleepiness is a major problem in PD patients. Although it seems most often linked to dopaminergic treatments given during the day, it could also be, in some patients the result of a very bad night's sleep, leading to a rebound of sleep during the day. The main objective is to demonstrate that compared with placebo, nocturnal continuous apomorphine treatment improves sleep quality assessed by the patient on the PDSS-2 scale in fluctuating parkinsonian patients with complaints of insomnia. The secondary objectives are to measure the effectiveness of nocturnal continuous apomorphine on sleep quality : total sleep time, sleep efficiency, arousal index, ventilatory events and legs movements indexes, to measure the relative proportion of sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, Rapid Eye Movement ou REM sleep), position changes during sleep index and the percentage of time spent in the supine position, percentage of time with SpO2 &lt;90%), sleepiness (Epworth and Multiple Sleep Latency Test) and their consequences on quality of life (EuroQol 5), depressive symptoms (Beck II), anxiety (STAI), overall cognition (MOCA), pain and engine condition after waking up.</detailed_description>
