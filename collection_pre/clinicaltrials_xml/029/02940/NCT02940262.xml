	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in detecting prostate cancer that has come back in patients after initial therapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as 68Ga-PSMA-11PET/CT, may help doctors detect tumors that have come back after initial therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Detecting Recurrent Prostate Cancer in Patients After Initial Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate 68gallium (Ga)-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated PSA and non-contributory bone scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OUTLINE: Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand glutamic acid (Glu)-urea-lysine (Lys)(Ahx) intravenously (IV) and after 45-60 minutes undergo PET/CT. After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histopathological proven prostate adenocarcinoma. 2. Rising PSA after definitive therapy with prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy). a. Post radical prostatectomy (RP) AUA recommendation i. PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more than 6 weeks after RP and, ii. Confirmatory persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL b. Postradiation therapy ASTROPhoenix consensus definition i. Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA 3. Able to provide written consent. 4. Karnofsky performance status of 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent). 1. Investigational therapy for prostate cancer. 2. Unable to lie flat, still or tolerate a PET scan. 3. Prior history of any other malignancy within the last 2 years, other than skin basal cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma that has not metastasized and superficial bladder cancer. 4. Contraindication to furosemide administration including prior allergy or adverse reaction to furosemide or sulfa drugs. (Note: This exclusion criteria can be removed if Furosemide is omitted as part of the PET imaging protocol if a secondgeneration scatter correction is available for the used PET device).</criteria>
