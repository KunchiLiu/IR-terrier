	<brief_title>Clinical Pregnancies After Cryopreservation of Donor Oocytes With an Open or Closed Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oocyte cryopreservation was optimized by the use of a new technique: vitrification. Vitrification can be performed using either open devices (where the oocytes are in direct contact with the liquid nitrogen) or closed systems (where the oocytes are never in contact with liquid nitrogen). Previous studies have associated the use of open devices to higher oocyte survival rates and better embryo development. However, any beneficial effect on clinical pregnancy rates is yet to be proven. Hence, the objective of this study is to compare the clinical pregnancy rates of open and closed oocyte vitrification devices.</detailed_description>
