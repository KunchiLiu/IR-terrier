	<brief_title>Efficacy Evaluation of Normothermic Perfusion Machine Preservation in Liver Transplant Using Very Old Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mean donor age for liver transplantation in Tuscany, Italy, is increasing and is actually 71 years. Old donors are a valuable resource but their use has been related to a major incidence of primary non function (PNF), delayed graft function (DGF) and ischemic type biliary lesions (ITBL). Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a major reason for the development of these complications and and old grafts are more susceptible than younger ones. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is a novel and promising technique that allows preservation in a more physiological environment. It is our belief that the use of NMP might reduce the impact of ischemia-reperfusion injuries in older grafts thus reducing the incidence of complications and providing a better outcome.</detailed_description>
