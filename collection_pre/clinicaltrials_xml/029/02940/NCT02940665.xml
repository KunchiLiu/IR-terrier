	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this prospective cohort study is to compare protein intake and adequacy between patients receiving Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols with patients receiving conventional care. The study will also compare energy intakes, gut function, and clinical outcomes between groups. The ability of nutritional parameters, including preoperative malnutrition risk and postoperative protein intake, to predict length of hospital stay will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
