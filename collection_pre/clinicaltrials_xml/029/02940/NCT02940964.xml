	<brief_summary>Abstract Introduction Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can more than double the patient's chance of survival in Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In Singapore, bystander CPR rate was low. Recent studies have proposed and validated the use of popular songs as aids in performing CPR. These songs may not be widely known when applied to a different population, and further, may lose popularity over time. "Count on me Singapore" (COMS) is believed to be known to over 90% of the Singapore population. Pilot data indicated that CPR performed using COMS as a mental metronome (COMSCPR) can achieve guideline-compliant rate of chest compression with lower fatigue level than CPR guided by the conventional "one-and-two-three-and" (Standard CPR). The investigators hypothesize that COMSCPR is non-inferior to Standard CPR in achieving guideline-compliant rate of chest compression. Methodology The investigators planned a prospective, randomized, crossover non-inferiority trial comparing COMS CPR and Standard CPR. 80 eligible volunteers will be recruited from a convenience sample of camp personnel from a military training camp. After a 15 minutes familiarization session, they will be randomized into two groups (A and B). Group A will proceed to perform one cycle (two minutes) of Standard CPR, while group B will proceed to perform one cycle of COMS CPR. participants will cross over to perform one cycle of the other method of CPR. After completing this second cycle, a survey form will be administered. The Laerdal SkillReporter will be used to measure the CPR performed. After a 7-14 days interval, participants will be recalled to attend a test scenario. Statistical analysis will be used to compare the two arms.</brief_summary>
