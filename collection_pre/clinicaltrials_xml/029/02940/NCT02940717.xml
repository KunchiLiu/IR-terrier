	<brief_summary>Patients need laminate veneer for their teeth usually use Emax CAD as an etchable ceramic. Yet fracture may occur so a stronger material is needed. Vita Suprinity is a recent material with glass ceramic enriched with zirconia (approx. 10% by weight) that offer practices and laboratories a high-strength, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramic (ZLS) and can be used to fabricate laminate veneers but the investigators have to know clinically it is fracture resistance, so the investigators are going to have Parallel groups in a randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
