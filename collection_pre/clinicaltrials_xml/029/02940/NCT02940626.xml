	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the prevention of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated subjects heavily colonized with S. aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogenic bacterium that causes severe infections, including pneumonia and sepsis. Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) caused by S. aureus, including ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) in mechanically ventilated subjects, is a significant public health threat despite efforts to optimize antibiotic treatment. ASN100 is an investigational monoclonal antibody product that targets the toxins produced by S. aureus to protect subjects from developing S. aureus pneumonia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of S. Aureus Pneumonia Study in Heavily Colonized, Mechanically Ventilated Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, single-dose, placebo-controlled study of ASN100 for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated subjects who are heavily colonized with S. aureus. This will be a global study conducted at approximately 65 sites to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ASN100. Eligible subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be screened by semi-quantitative culture of an endotracheal aspirate (ETA) to identify those who are heavily colonized with S. aureus (3+ to 4+). Upon determination of eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups, ASN100 or placebo.</detailed_description>
