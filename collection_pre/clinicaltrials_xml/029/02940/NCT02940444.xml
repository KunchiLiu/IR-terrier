	<brief_summary>Thromboembolism is an important perioperative complication in major thoracic surgery, even though current guidelines have recommended postoperative administration of heparin or LMWH for thromboprophylaxis for those high-risk patients, there are still many cases of thromboembolism. Therefore, as the guideline itself writes, the investigators believe the rational of dose and timing of heparin in thoracic surgery are still not well established. Therefore, the investigators aimed to conduct this randomized controlled study to explore the safety and efficacy of preoperative Administration of Heparin as Thromboprophylaxis in Major Thoracic Surgery.</brief_summary>
