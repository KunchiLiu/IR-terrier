	<brief_title>Laryngeal Mask Position in Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Properly inserted laryngeal mask (LMA) with good clinical performance can be misplaced (on radiological imaging) but with not know effect on clinical practice. The percentage of the misplaced LMAs are relatively high, but the exact number in paediatric population is currently not clear. The aim of this prospective observational cohort study is to describe the percentage of misplaced LMAs during elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in paediatric patient. After approval of the local ethical committee all elective paediatric patients in study interval (10/2016-3/2017) indicated for elective MRI of the brain or elective MRI of the brain and cervical spine will be included to the trial. Demographic characteristics - age, weight, comorbidities, anesthesia management - education of anesthesiologist, type of LMA, number of insertion attempts, clinical performance of the LMA, presence/absence of leak, the peak inspiratory pressure (mechanical ventilation), volume of air in cuff, complications during anesthesia and LMA soil after extraction - blood, saliva, mucus, gastric content. The clinical performance will be compared to the LMA position on MRI - position of the proximal and the distal site of the LMA cuff according to the cervical vertebrae, displacement of the epiglottis, distance between proximal LMA cuff and vocal cords, distance between distal LMA cuff and vocal cords.</detailed_description>
