	<brief_summary>SC10914 is a potent selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. This study aims to determine the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics profile of increasing doses of SC10914 when administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of SC10914 in patients with advanced solid tumors and negative expression of ATM or BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation will be evaluated in expanded cohorts to establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose(RP2D).</brief_summary>
