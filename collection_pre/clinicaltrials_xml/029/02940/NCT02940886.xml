	<brief_title>Iron Isomaltoside and Iron Sucrose for the Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IDA is highly prevalent in subjects with cancer and gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, menstruating or pregnant women, and subjects who have undergone bariatric procedure. IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and treatment of these subjects includes controlling the bleeding and replenishing lost iron. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside compared to iron sucrose in subjects suffering from IDA.</detailed_description>
