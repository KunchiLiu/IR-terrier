	<detailed_description>Dry eye can be caused by many variable factors. Some examples include hormonal changes due to aging, or living in an environment of low humidity for long periods of time. Dry eye is a complex disease that may result in symptoms like discomfort, visual disturbance, and dryness. Patients with dry eye often have damage on the surface of the eye. In previous studies, RGN-259 has been shown to promote healing of the surface of the eye and decrease inflammation. It suggests that RGN-259 has a significant potential to be an important new safe and effective therapeutic in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.</detailed_description>
