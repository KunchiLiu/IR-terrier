	<brief_title>Somatosensory Stimulation to Alleviate Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enrolls 20 adult subjects. This project will develop and test a device with the ultimate goal of providing a patient operated device to alleviate phantom sound perception, or tinnitus, based on patient-feedback for stimulus presentation. The device, an electrical-acoustical stimulus timing, is based on physiological findings of stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory and auditory nuclei,that when aberrant, contribute to tinnitus.</detailed_description>
