	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a routine individualized antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation by evaluating "on-treatment" platelet reactivity with Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA, MultiplateÂ® Analyzer). IDEAL-PCI Extended is the continuation of the IDEAL-PCI registry with additional focus on bleeding events and net clinical benefit</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Determination of platelet reactivity in patients with percutaneous coronary Intervention as described in the IDEAL-PCI registry. In the IDEAL-PCI Extended Registry an additional deescalation arm with reduction of the standard dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) dosis in case of low platelet reactivity to P2Y12 Inhibition or Aspirin with or without bleeding is implemented.</detailed_description>
