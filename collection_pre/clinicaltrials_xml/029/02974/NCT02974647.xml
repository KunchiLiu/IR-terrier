	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib works by blocking a protein called JAK. JAK works along with another protein called STAT and is important for survival of many T or NK-cell lymphomas. By blocking JAK, ruxolitinib may cause T or NK-cell lymphomas to shrink.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed T or NK cell lymphoma at the enrolling institution. For CTCL, patients with stage IB disease or greater are eligible. Relapse or refractory disease after at least 1 systemic therapy Age ≥ 18 ECOG ≤ 2 Measurable disease defined by: Lugano Classification for systemic lymphoma or Absolute atypical lymphocytes ≥ 1000 cells/μL for diseases characterized by leukemic disease mSWAT &gt; 0 or Sezary count ≥ 1000 cells/μL for CTCL Previous systemic anticancer therapy must have been discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to treatment. Glucocorticoids aimed at controlling lymphomarelated symptoms are allowed as long as they are tapered down to 20mg or less by the time of ruxolitinib initiation. Topical steroids for CTCL are permitted. Patients must meet the following lab criteria: ANC ≥ 1.0/mm^3, platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L or ≥ 75 x 10^9/L (if related to lymphoma), Hgb ≥ 8g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); ≤ 3 x ULN if due to lymphoma involvement; AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN; ≤ 5 x ULN if due to lymphoma involvement Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min For patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody or surface antigen, hepatitis B PCR must be negative and prophylaxis with entecavir or equivalent is required. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled diabetes, clinically significant pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. ECOG performance status &gt;2 Prior therapy with ruxolitinib Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments. °Patients with more than one type of lymphoma may be enrolled after discussion with the MSK Principal Investigator Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 12 months prior to initiating study treatment. Women of reproductive potential† must have a negative Serum ß human chorionic gonadotropin (ßHCG) pregnancy test. A female of reproductive potential is a sexually mature female who: has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).</criteria>
