	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to study the sphincter activity during ejaculation in patients with spinal cord injury in order to detect an ejaculatory dyssynergia. For this purpose, using a catheter the protocol plans to measure the sphincter pressures during ejaculation. Moreover, cardiovascular parameters will be measured continuously during the ejaculatory test.</brief_summary>
