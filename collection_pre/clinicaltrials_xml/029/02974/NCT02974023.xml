	<brief_title>Efficacy of "Pain Gear" in Patients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PainGear [ActiPatch®] (BioElectronics Corporation, MD, USA) has been recently introduced as an 'topical' analgesic for localized musculoskeletal pain. PainGear is a noninvasive, low power, easy to use, pulsed shortwave therapy device for localized musculoskeletal pain. The device does not produce heat or any sensation. There are two basic requirements to use the device, switching it on via an on/off switch, and affixing the device over the target area of the body. The area of treatment is confined to the area within the 11.5-cm diameter loop antenna covering an area of 100 cm2, the antennae is circular, soft and flexible and can be shaped to fit the area/location being treated as required. The device can be used up to 24 h per day and is placed over the area of localized pain either using medical tape or a specifically designed wrap. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with radiographic evidence of knee OA (osteoarthritis) and persistent pain higher than 40mm on the visual analog scale (VAS) were recruited. The trial consisted of 12 h daily treatment for 1 month in 60 knee OA patients. After 1 month, PainGear induced a significant reduction in VAS pain and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores compared with placebo. Additionally, pain tolerance and physical health improved in PainGear -treated patients. Twenty-six per cent of patients in the PainGear group stopped NSAID/analgesic therapy. No adverse events were detected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic musculoskeletal pain of more than 6 month duration Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial. In the Investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements. Male or female ages 1880 years old A current VAS pain rating ≥5/10 Able to complete and tolerate treatment for the study period. Pregnant Woman Current implanted cardiac demand pacemakers, defibrillators, cardiac pumps, spinal stimulators or other implanted electronic devices. Patients using personal home based electrical stimulation devices Active psychiatric disorders (as evidenced by use of antipsychotic or medication). Patients diagnosed with history of significant mood disorder will be excluded (depression or anxiety with adequate control would be acceptable). Scheduled elective surgery or other procedures requiring general anesthesia during the trial. Participant with life expectancy of less than 6 months, or inappropriate for placebo medication. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the trial. Participants who are not able to understand verbal or written English, and for whom adequate translation/interpretation cannot be readily obtained</criteria>
