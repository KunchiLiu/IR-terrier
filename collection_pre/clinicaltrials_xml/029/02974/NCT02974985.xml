	<brief_summary>Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are tested in-vitro to measure their lifting capacity, viscosity, cohesivity, and rheologic properties, and their lifting capacity has been tested in animal models. To date, there are no studies that measure the lifting capacity of fillers in an in-vivo human model. The intention is to study the lifting capacity of fillers in a group of patients by comparing pre and post-procedure two and three-dimensional photographs using analytic software. Specifically, the PI is interested in determining the amount of tissue elevation created by injecting HAs Restylane-LyftÂ®, (Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Fort Worth, TX) to the midface and to the lower face, both in the anterior-posterior direction and in the vertical direction using analytic software. The research group has identified a reliable and reproducible quantitative assessment of midfacial position called WIZDOM (Width of the InterZygomatic Distance Of the Midface) to quantitatively evaluate the midface. It can be used as an objective tool to assess midfacial rejuvenation, whether with fat, fillers, or midface or facelift surgery. The Distance from WIZDOM to inner canthus, the WIZDOM -IC measurement increases with aging as the face deflates and descends, and, in the practice, is also a means of assessing the midface in youth and in aging. The PI's findings have been submitted to the Aesthetic Surgery Journal. The practice will attempt to utilize this metric as a measure of midface aesthetic lifting capacity. The practice will also employ 3 D photography and analytic software to determine degree of lift in mm in the y and z axis. (vertical and AP increase in dimension) pre and post- injection. (Vectra, Canfield, Fairfield, NJ) A secondary goal of this study is to measure duration of efficacy and patient satisfaction at various endpoints. A standardized rating system will be used - the Medicis Midface Volume Scale (MMVS) -measured by three independent physicians and the subjective Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) -measured by the subject and three independent physicians -to monitor outcomes at follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Lifting Capacity of Fillers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All fillers will be injected in locations where the FDA has approved it for on-label indications (the cheek, subcutaneously and supraperiosteally, the dermis and subdermis for the correction of wrinkles and folds such as the nasolabial fold) and placed as usual and customary using techniques as practiced by the authors and as are accepted widely. Additional steps prior to injection for this study are temporary sterile magic marker markings markers on the face and detailed photography that will be taken before, during, and after injection, and the segmentation of injections such that the midface will be injected prior to and separately from the lower face. Follow-up will also be more rigorous than routine, on an approximately q 3 month basis for up to 2 years. Patients will be allowed to have additional HA fillers placed in the perioral area subsequent to the initiation of the study to augment/define the lips and to treat perioral rhytids during their follow-up period. These treatments area allowed outside of the study and not part of this study. The PI assumes that the addition of fillers in these locations will have no impact on the midface or the jawline, but will be of added aesthetic benefit to patients. All filler will be administered through the office by the PI.</detailed_description>
