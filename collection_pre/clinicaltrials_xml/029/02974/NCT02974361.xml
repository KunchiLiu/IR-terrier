	<brief_summary>This study is to help development of a new version of Ibuprofen, called Ibuprofen-LDH. Ibuprofen-LDH will be used as a treatment for muscular pains, headache, fever etc. This new version of ibuprofen is expected to produce fewer stomach/intestine related side effects when compared to many existing marketed formulations of Ibuprofen. This study is split into 3 parts. Part A is a 7 way crossover, Part B is a maximum of a 6 way crossover and Part C is a maximum of a 4 way crossover. The size of Parts B &amp; Part C and allocated interventions will be confirmed after review of data from Parts A and/or B respectively. A total of 30 subjects will take part in the study; 10 per study part. The key objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics properties of Ibuprofen-LDH, with and without a selection of different excipients. The pharmacokinetic properties will include how quickly the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream and also the maximum concentration of drug that reaches the bloodstream.</brief_summary>
