The study will test GED-0301 compare to placebo for 12 weeks. The study treatment is blinded which means that patients and the study doctor will not know which treatment has been assigned.

In addition, subjects with colonic strictures that are not passable with an ageappropriate colonoscope, or strictures in the ileum or ileocecal valve that are fibrotic in nature, will be excluded Intestinal resection within 6 months or any intraabdominal surgery within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit Ileostomy or a colostomy Subject has a history of any clinically significant medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would prevent the subject from participating in the study Adolescents with delayed growth or pubertal development who are on corticosteroids at baseline and who should not continue treatment with the same dose of corticosteroids until the Week 12 visit.</criteria>
