	<brief_title>Neem Lotion With Combing for Lice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neem oil has had a long reputation for killing a wide range of insects, including head lice. Several products are marketed with this oil as a named active ingredient, e.g. Nice 'n Clear neem-based conditioning lotion. This product was developed as an aid to combing out head lice for eliminating infestation but it has been considered possible that the neem oil could act to kill lice and inhibit their eggs from hatching. This study was designed to compare use of Nice 'n Clear neem-based conditioning lotion when used with two different types of comb. One arm of the study was planned so that participants were combed using a plastic louse detection and removal comb (wet combing with conditioner method), in which it was expected the combing process would play a major role in efficacy. The other arm was planned so that participants were combed using a regular grooming comb, which would normally have little effect for removing head lice from the hair. Comparison of the efficacy outcome in the two groups would determine whether the Nice 'n Clear neem-based conditioning lotion exhibited any effect to eliminate infestation independent of the combing</detailed_description>
