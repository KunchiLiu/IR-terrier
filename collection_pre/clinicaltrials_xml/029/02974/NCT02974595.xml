	<brief_summary>Background: Some diseases cause chronic inflammation with intermittent flares in the body. These are called autoinflammatory diseases. They can cause fevers, rashes, ulcers, and other problems. Researchers want to learn more about the causes and effects of these diseases. They hope this will improve how the disease is managed in the future. Objectives: To understand the underlying immune dysregulation To identify the genetic cause To translate our findings into novel treatments that improve patients disease outcomes Eligibility: Patients with known NOMID/CAPS, DIRA, CANDLE, SAVI, NLRC4-MAS, Still's Disease, and with other yet undifferentiated autoinflammatory diseases. Unaffected relatives of participants with a known or undifferentiated autoinflammatory disease Healthy adult volunteers at least 18 years of age Design: Participants will be screened with blood sample and medical history. They may provide copies of their medical records. Enrolled participants will be evaluated at the NIH for 2-5 days. All participants will have a detailed medical history, physical exam, blood tests, and other evaluations depending on the extent of their autoinflammatory disease. Participants may also expect the following assessments: 1. Clinical tests that help assess organ damage and function such as hearing, vision, memory, and learning tests. 2. Imaging studies to characterize organ involvement of the inflammatory disease including: X-rays, CT scans, special MRIs, and bone scans. 3. Laboratory evaluations including clinical markers of disease activity, research samples &lt;TAB&gt;for genetic studies, blood samples for cytokine/biomarker assessment, and gene expression profiling.&lt;TAB&gt; 4. Questionnaires to assess disease activity and quality of life. 5. If indicated, other procedures may be administered that include: a lumbar puncture if CNS inflammation is suspected, a skin biopsy if skin inflammation is present, and/or gastrointestinal and pulmonary procedures if they are clinically indicated. Participants may return for a single follow-up visit or for long-term follow-up visits depending on their disease and willingness to return. Long-term follow-up may occur for up to 15 years on this protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Outcome of Autoinflammatory Diseases (NOMID/CAPS, DIRA, CANDLE, SAVI, NLRC4-MAS, Still'S-like Diseases, and Other Undifferentiated Autoinflammatory Diseases)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoinflammatory diseases are a group of immune dysregulatory diseases that are characterized by recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation as well as organ-specific inflammation that can involve the skin, eyes, joints, bones, muscles, lungs, serosal surfaces, inner ear, brain, and other organs. The prominent role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders first became evident through the discovery of mutations in the gene NLRP3/CIAS1. Since then, we have identified additional mutations that cause autoinflammatory diseases, including mutations in proteasome components and in TMEM173/STING that suggest a role of increased type I IFN signaling as a contributor to the disease pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. In this natural history study, we seek to comprehensively evaluate people with autoinflammatory diseases from clinical, genetic, immunologic, and endocrinologic perspectives. Other rare diseases not mediated by IL-1 or type I IFN and presumed to be autoinflammatory diseases with unknown genetic causes are also eligible under this protocol. In addition, we intend to evaluate long-term outcomes and biomarkers over time. We plan to follow most participants for the duration of this study (15 years). Relatives who do not have autoinflammatory disease as well as healthy volunteers will also be recruited to serve as controls for biomarker, genetic, and other molecular analyses.</detailed_description>
