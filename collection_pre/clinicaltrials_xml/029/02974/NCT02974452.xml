	<brief_summary>A cross-sectional descriptive study, in which the surface electromyographic activity of five shoulder muscles was compared in three populations: older adults, middle-aged adults and young adults. The evaluation of the electromyographic data offers a suitable foundation to understand aging process. This supports that surface electromyography provide information about the aged shoulder muscles. Loss of functionality is suffered by a high percentage of older adults, which greatly limits their physical activity. In this sense, this paper presents findings that might be related with possible therapeutic approaches in subsequent studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present work was to assess neuromotor abnormalities in aging shoulder. Twenty young adults (20-42), 20 middle-aged adults (43-67) and 20older adults (&gt;68) were recruited. A comparative electromyography (EMG) study was performed on the upper and lower trapezius, middle deltoid, infraspinatus and serratus anterior. The EMG measurement (root mean square (RMS)) and onset time of isometric contractions were analyzed. Body mass index and strength were also tested.</detailed_description>
