	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well cediranib maleate and olaparib work compared to bevacizumab in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back. Cediranib maleate and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate and Olaparib Compared to Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the antitumor activity of cediranib maleate (cediranib)/olaparib versus reference bevacizumab monotherapy, as measured by progression-free survival at 6 months (PF6), in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival (OS), and objective response (ORR) in patients with recurrent GBM treated with cediranib/olaparib versus bevacizumab. II. To assess the safety of the combination of olaparib and cediranib in patients with recurrent GBM III. To evaluate the association of blood based biomarkers involved with angiogenesis using the Biomarker Review Committee-approved Plasma Angiome Panel (bFGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-2, SDF1-α, Collagen IV, PlGF, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, VEGF, Il-1β, Il-6, Il-8, TNF-α, CAIX) with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib. IV. To evaluate the association of tissue biomarkers involved with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair using the Biomarker Review Committee-approved BROCA panel with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib. V. To identify genomic alteration by whole exome sequencing in GBM tumor specimens that correlate with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib. VI. To evaluate the association of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging parameters (vascular permeability, tumor perfusion and oxygenation, brain tumor cellularity) with the biological response of cediranib/olaparib. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib maleate PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. ARM B: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>
