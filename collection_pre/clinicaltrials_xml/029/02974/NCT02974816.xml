	<brief_title>Glooko Enabled Remote Monitoring for Insulin-treated Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigator wants to evaluate if diabetes self-management supported by a mobile application, which captures a subject's blood glucose readings, lifestyle and medication information and shares it with the subject's certified diabetes educator (CDE) to enable remote monitoring, improves their glycemic control compared to standard of care.</detailed_description>
