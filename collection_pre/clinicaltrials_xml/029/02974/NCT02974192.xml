	<brief_summary>Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of stroke cases and constitutes a major cause of death and disability in industrial world. Inflammation has been reported to constitute a major component of ischemic stroke pathology. The brain responds to ischemic injury with an acute andprolonged inflammatory process. Few studies have investigated the relationship between acute biomarkers of inflammation and functional outcome following stroke</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This case -control observational prospective study will be conducted on 100 patients with first -ever acute onset ischemic stroke within 24-48 hours. Their ages ranged-years old (mean age ±years). All participants will be subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical and neurological examination. Complete neurological examination where the following clinical and demographical data will be taken; age sex, stroke etiology, presence of stroke risk factors (as smoking history , hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus , history of hypertension, history of transient ischemic attacks, history of myocardial infarction or any cardiac problems). Stroke subtype will be classified according to the criteria of Trial of Org 10172 in acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification. The clinical stroke syndrome will be determined by applying the criteria of the Oxfordshire Community Stroke project (OCSP). Stroke severity will be assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be measured at the time of admission. Brain imaging (either CT scan and /or MRI) will be performed after admission. Electrocardiography (ECG), Echocardiography (ECHO), Carotid and vertibrobasilar Duplex will be done for all patients. Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of complete blood picture (CBC), Random blood glucose levels, renal function tests (RFT), liver function tests (LFT), thyroid function tests (TFT), Lipid profile, Soluble CD40 Ligand and Neopetrin by using standard laboratory methods on the first day of admission.</detailed_description>
