	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out a serum marker for the evaluation of blood brain barrier damage based on animal experiments and investigate the effect of NBO（Normobaric hyperoxia）on blood brain barrier in the acute ischemic stroke patients who received r-tPA thrombolytic therapy.</brief_summary>
