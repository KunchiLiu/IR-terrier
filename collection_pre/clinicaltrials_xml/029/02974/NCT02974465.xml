	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a specific protocol of sEMG-BFB in upper limb hemiparesis added to conventional physical therapy on changes in upper extremity functionality, motor recruitment pattern and range of motion (ROM) compared to the single application of conventional physical therapy. It aims to find a 22.22% difference between both interventions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upper limb hemiparesis is a common consequence after brain damage. Objective: To evaluate the effect of a specific protocol of surface electromyographic biofeedback (sEMG-BFB) and conventional physical therapy in upper limb functionality, muscle recruitment changes, and glenohumeral range of motion compared to the single application of conventional physical therapy. Design: randomized controlled clinical trial. Sample: 40 participants from State Center of Attention to Brain Injury were recruited. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups where the experimental group received sEMG-BFB for the upper trapezius and middle deltoid muscles of the upper limb with hemiparesis and the control group received a placebo of the same technique. Both treatments were applied for 6 weeks. The score of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity" for functionality and shoulder range of motion were objectified. Root mean square (RMS) value was assessed as a secondary measure Data were collected before and after intervention. A protocol of sEMG-BFB in upper limb may have an important role in the recovery of subjects with upper limb hemiparesis.</detailed_description>
