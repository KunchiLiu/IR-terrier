	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo and active-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-152 in Triple Combination (TC) with tezacaftor (TEZ; VX-661) and ivacaftor (IVA; VX-770) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function (MF) CFTR mutation not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy (F508del/MF), or who are homozygous for the F508del mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (F508del/F508del).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment pan, study restrictions, laboratory tests, contraceptive guidelines, and other study procedures. Body weight ≥35 kg. Sweat chloride value ≥ 60 mmol/L from test results obtained during screening. Subjects must have an eligible CFTR genotype: Cohorts 1A, 1B, 1C: Heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation known or predicted not to respond to TEZ and/or IVA. Cohorts 2A, 2B: Homozygous for F508del. Subjects must have an FEV1 ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and height at the Screening Visit. Stable CF disease as judged by the investigator. Willing to remain on a stable CF medication regimen through the planned end of treatment or if applicable the Safety Followup Visit. History of any comorbidity that in the opinion of the investigator might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. History of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Risk factors for Torsade de Pointes. History of hemolysis. Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency assessed at Screening. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at screening. An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy for pulmonary disease within 28 days before the first dose of study drug. Lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status. An acute illness not related to CF within 14 days before the first dose of study drug. A standard digital ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at screening. History of solid organ or hematological transplantation. History or evidence of cataract or lens opacity determined to be clinically significant by the ophthalmologist or optometrist, based on the ophthalmologic examination during the Screening Period. History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past year, including but not limited to, cannabis, cocaine, and opiates, as deemed by the investigator. Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study with certain exceptions. Use of commercially available CFTR modulator within 14 days before screening (applies only to Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 1C). Pregnant or nursing females: Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and Day 1.</criteria>
