	<brief_summary>The Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression (ATLAS) study is being conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants with current viral suppression on a regimen with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a third agent, remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM) long-acting (LA) regimen of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). This is a Phase 3, multi-phase, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority study in HIV-1, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-adult participants who are stably suppressed on a current antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This study is designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared with maintenance of current ARV regimen containing 2 NRTIs plus an INI, NNRTI, or a PI. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue current ART or switch to initiate oral therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for 4 Weeks followed by Q4 weekly (monthly) CAB LA + RPV LA injections. Following the Maintenance phase at Week 52, participants who were randomized to continue their current ART regimen will be given an option to switch to CAB LA + RPV LA injections. Those participants would transition to LA dosing, beginning with 4 weeks oral CAB + RPV therapy at Week 52, and receive the first IM CAB LA + RPV LA injections at Week 56.</brief_summary>

Acceptable stable (initial or second) ARV regimens prior to Screening include 2 NRTIs plus: INI with the exception of ABC/DTG/3TC (either the initial or second cART regimen); NNRTI (either the initial or second cART regimen); Boosted PI (or atazanavir [ATV] unboosted) (either the initial or second PIbased cART regimen). Documented evidence of at least two plasma HIV1 RNA measurements &lt;50 c/mL in the 12 months prior to Screening: one within the 6 to 12 month window, and one within 6 months prior to Screening; Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Screening; A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screen and a negative urine hCG test at Randomization), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with either Documented tubal ligation; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication throughout the study, and for at least 30 days after discontinuation of all oral study medications and for at least 52 weeks after discontinuation of CAB LA and RPV LA. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that participants understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Eligible participants or their legal guardians must sign a written Informed Consent Form before any protocolspecified assessments are conducted. Participants enrolled in France must be affiliated to, or a beneficiary of, a social security category. All participants participating in the study should be counseled on safer sexual practices including the use and benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (example: male condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected partner.

Any drug holiday during the window between initiating first HIV ART and 6 months prior to Screening, except for brief periods (less than 1 month) where all ART was stopped due to tolerability and/or safety concerns. Any switch to a second line regimen, defined as change of a single drug or multiple drugs simultaneously, due to virologic failure to therapy (defined as a confirmed plasma HIV 1 RNA measurement &gt;=400 c/mL after initial suppression to &lt;50 c/mL while on first line HIV therapy regimen). Abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, (ABC/DTG/3TC) as current ART regimen.

Participants with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Any preexisting physical or mental condition (including substance abuse disorder) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the participant's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations or which may compromise the safety of the participant. Participants determined by the Investigator to have a high risk of seizures, including participants with an unstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder. A participant with a prior history of seizure may be considered for enrolment if the Investigator believes the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrolment. All participants will be screened for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]). Participants with untreated syphilis infection, defined as a positive RPR without clear documentation of treatment, are excluded. Participants with a positive RPR test who have not been treated may be rescreened at least 30 days after completion of antibiotic treatment for syphilis. Participants who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicide risk. Participant's recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation should be considered when evaluating for suicide risk The participant has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus region which may interfere with interpretation of injection site reactions. Evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on the results of testing at Screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc), Hepatitis B surface antibody (antiHBs) and HBV DNA as follows: Participants positive for HBsAg are excluded; Participants negative for antiHBs but positive for antiHBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded. Note: Participants positive for antiHBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for antiHBs (past and/or current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not excluded. Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will not be excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment within 12 months must be excluded (HCV treatment on study may be permitted post Week 48, following consultation with the medical monitor). Participants with HCV coinfection will be allowed entry into phase 3 studies if: Liver enzymes meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate workup, and is not advanced,and will not require treatment prior to the Week 48 visit. Additional information (where available) on participants with HCV coinfection at screening should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment. In the event that recent biopsy or imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the Fib4 score will be used to verify eligibility.
