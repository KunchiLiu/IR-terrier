	<brief_summary>The specific aims of this study are to compare patient experience with and without a proparacaine drop after povidone iodine. To ensure the extra drop does not interfere with antisepsis, conjunctival cultures will be obtained from patients undergoing intravitreal injection before and after the application of the extra eye drop. Patients will be randomized to undergo additional topical analgesia during intravitreal injection vs. the standard amount of topical analgesia. Cultures of the eyelid/conjunctiva will be taken to ensure that the additional topical analgesia does not interfere with antisepsis.</brief_summary>
