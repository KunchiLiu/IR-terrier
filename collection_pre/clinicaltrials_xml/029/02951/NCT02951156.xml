	<brief_summary>Study B9991011 is a multi-center, international, randomized, open label, 2 component (Phase 1b followed by Phase 3), parallel-arm study of avelumab in combination with various agents for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avelumab In Combination Regimens That Include An Immune Agonist, Epigenetic Modulator, CD20 Antagonist and/or Conventional Chemotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (R/R DLBCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The target study population of this Phase 1b/3 registrational study is patients with R/R DLBCL who have completed at least 2 (but not more than 4) lines of prior rituximab-containing multi-agent chemotherapy, and/or in whom autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has failed, or who are not candidates for ASCT or who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy must have received at least one prior rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy regimen. The study will assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity of the 3 avelumab-based combination regimens tested, and collect patient reported outcome (PRO) data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Relapsed or refractory DLBCL following at least 2 lines (and a maximum of 4 lines) of prior rituximab containing multiagent chemotherapy which may include an autologous stem cell transplantation unless patients are not considered suitable for intensive secondline chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy,must have received at least one prior rituximabcontaining combination chemotherapy regimen. Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy, must have received at least one prior rituximabcontaining combination chemotherapy regimen. Baseline measurable disease with at least 1 bi dimensional lesion &gt;1.5cm on CT scan which is FDG avid on PET scan. A biopsy (archived or Screening/recent) will be collected at Screening. At least 18years of age (or â‰¥20 years in Japan). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1. Key Transformed lymphoma or Burkitt's Lymphoma. Active/symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma based on clinical evaluation. Prior organ transplantation including prior allogeneic SCT. Prior therapy with an anti PD 1, anti PD L1, anti PD L2, anti CD137, or anti cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA 4) antibody (including ipilimumab, tremelimumab or any other antibody, or drug specifically targeting T cell co stimulatory or immune checkpoint pathways).</criteria>
