	<brief_summary>Tobacco regulatory policies can have unanticipated consequences; therefore, methods that would permit prospective estimates of the effects of potential tobacco regulations are necessary for the development of tobacco regulatory science. The goal of this project is to experimentally assess how smokers purchase and consume reduced-nicotine cigarettes. In experiment 1, we will investigate how purchasing/consuming reduced-nicotine cigarettes is related to nicotine content and absorption. In experiment 2, we will investigate how purchasing/consuming changes when other nicotine products are available in an experimental marketplace setting. The proposed projects can directly inform tobacco regulation by providing estimates of the real-world effects of novel policies.</brief_summary>
