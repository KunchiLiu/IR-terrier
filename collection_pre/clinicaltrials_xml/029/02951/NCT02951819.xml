	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate complete response plus (+) very good partial response (CR+VGPR) rate following 4 cycles of induction therapy of daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-CyBorD), in previously untreated subjects, and in relapsed subjects with multiple myeloma, as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with documented multiple myeloma (MM) as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2015 criteria: Clonal bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10 percent (%) or biopsyproven bony or extramedullary plasmacytoma and any one or more of the following CRAB (calcium level, renal dysfunction, anemia, and destructive bone lesions) features and myeloma defining events as in the protocol Subjects with previously untreated myeloma or relapsed myeloma with one prior line of therapy including an induction regimen which may be followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and single agent maintenance therapy. For previously untreated subjects an emergency course of steroids (defined as no greater than 40 milligram (mg) of dexamethasone, or equivalent per day for a maximum of 4 days) is permitted. In addition, radiation therapy is permitted prior to study entry, during screening, and during Cycles 12 of study treatment as needed for lytic bone disease Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum (beta (Î²) human chorionic gonadotropin) or urine pregnancy tests during screening, the first one within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug and the second within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study drug A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control example, either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of study drug Refractory to any proteasome inhibitor (PI) or the combination of PI and immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) agents (such as lenalidomide), defined as failure to respond or progression within 60 days of the end of PI therapy Exhibiting clinical signs of or has a known history of meningeal or central nervous system involvement by multiple myeloma Has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than (&lt;) 50 percent (%) of predicted normal Has known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or currently has uncontrolled asthma of any classification Is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus, known to have hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, or known to have a history of hepatitis C</criteria>
