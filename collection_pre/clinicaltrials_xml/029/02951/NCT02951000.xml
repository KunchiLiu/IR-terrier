	<brief_title>Platysma Trial - Platysma Suturing Versus no Sutures for Wound Closure After Primary Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Does a running platysma suture after primary thyroid resection alter direct postoperative pain, wound healing and long term cosmetic results. Primary outcome measure is if the lack of a platysma-Suture decreases the postoperative pain (detected by the visual pain score 0-10) and reduces the pain medication (detected by the cumulative NSAID and opioid treatment per patient). The second Question to be answered is if the cosmetic scar result (detected by the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Score) 6 month after thyroidectomy is better in the intervention group (no Platysma-Suture) or not.</detailed_description>
