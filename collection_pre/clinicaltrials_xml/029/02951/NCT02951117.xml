	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of venetoclax and ABBV-838 combination therapy with dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have received 2 or more prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). The study will consist of 2 arms: Arm A and Arm B (if applicable). Each arm will have a dose escalation and dose expansion portion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Venetoclax and ABBV-838 Combination Therapy With Dexamethasone in Participants With Multiple Myeloma Whose Cancer Has Come Back or Had No Response to Recent Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of 2 arms: Arm A and Arm B (if applicable). Arm A dose escalation will investigate up to 3 doses of ABBV-838 at 3-week dosing intervals (Q3W) in combination with venetoclax and dexamethasone. Arm A dose expansion portion will investigate the ABBV-838 Q3W dosing interval with venetoclax and dexamethasone at the recommended phase two dose (RPTD) combination defined from the Dose Escalation portion. Based on data from the ongoing ABBV-838 monotherapy study (Study M14-467) Arm B dose escalation may be conducted, if deemed necessary. If conducted, Arm B dose excalation will investigate up to 3 doses of ABBV-838 at either weekly (Q1W) or bi-weekly (Q2W) dosing intervals in combination with venetoclax and dexamethasone. Arm B dose expansion portion will investigate either the ABBV-838 Q1W or Q2W dosing interval in combination with venetoclax and dexamethasone at the RPTD combination defined from the Dose Escalation portion.</detailed_description>

Documented relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma on or after any regimen or is refractory to the most recent line of therapy. Received at least 2 prior therapies including an IMiD and a proteasome inhibitor. Documented relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma on or after any regimen or is refractory to the most recent line of therapy. Eligible for and agree to bone marrow (BM) aspirate prior to treatment start and at designated times per protocol. Measurable disease at Screening, defined as at least one of the following M component in serum (greater than or equal to 0.5 g/dL) and/or urine (greater than or equal to 0.2 g excreted in a 24 hour collection sample) or serum free light chain greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL with an abnormal κ/λ ratio of less than 0.26 or greater than 1.65. Received any antimyeloma therapy (other than monoclonal antibodies), including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological, immunotherapy or an investigational therapy, including targeted small molecule agents within 5 halflives (or 14 days if halflive unknown) prior to first dose of first dose of venetoclax, ABBV838, and dexamethasone. Received antimyeloma monoclonal antibodies within 6 weeks prior to first dose of venetoclax, ABBV838, and dexamethasone.
