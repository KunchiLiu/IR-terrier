	<brief_title>The Effect of Frequency and Duration of Breaks in Sitting Time on Metabolic Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen (n=15) sedentary adult overweight males will be included in the study. All participants will undergo the four interventions in a randomized cross-over design. Wash out between intervention will be minimum four days. Control (CON): Participants will be sedentary. Sedentary time will be spent sitting in a chair, restricted to sedentary behaviors (working on a computer, reading, watching TV, etc.), with a target MET below 1.5 (i.e. 1.5 times REE). Participants will only be allowed to stand or walk to go to the toilet. Breaker: Participants will be breaking up prolonged sitting with 2 min intervals of low intensity walking. Intermediate: Participants will be breaking up prolonged sitting with 6 min intervals of low intensity walking Prolonger: Participants will be breaking up prolonged sitting with 12 min intervals of low intensity walking All interventions will be matched for total physical activity as well as sitting. Thus, we aim for the active interventions to be iso-caloric.</detailed_description>
