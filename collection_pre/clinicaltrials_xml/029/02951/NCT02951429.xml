	<brief_summary>This Phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sildenafil or placebo added to pirfenidone (Esbriet) treatment in participants with advanced IPF and intermediate or high probability of Group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH) who are on a stable dose of pirfenidone with demonstrated tolerability. Participants will be randomized to receive 1 year of treatment with either oral sildenafil or matching placebo while continuing to take pirfenidone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of IPF for at least 3 months prior to Screening Confirmation of IPF diagnosis by the investigator in accordance with the 2011 international consensus guidelines at screening Advanced IPF (defined as a measurable carbon monoxide diffusing capacity [DLCO] less than or equal to (&lt;=)40% of predicted value at Screening) and intermediate or high probability of group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH) Participants receiving pirfenidone for at least 12 weeks, at a dose in the range of 1602 to 2403 mg/day for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and must not have experienced either a new or ongoing adverse event of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (version 4.03) Grade 2 or higher and considered by the investigator to be related to pirfenidone, or an interruption of pirfenidone treatment of greater than (&gt;)7 days for any reason WHO Functional Class II or III at Screening 6MWD of 100 to 450 meters at screening Women of childbearing potential and for men who are not surgically sterile agreement to remain abstinent or use of contraceptive measures History of any of the following types of PH: Group 1 (PAH); Group 1 (pulmonary venoocclusive disease and/or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis); Group 2 (leftheart disease); Group 3 (due to conditions other than interstitial lung disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], sleepdisordered breathing, alveolar hypoventilation, high altitude, or developmental abnormalities); Group 4 (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension); Group 5 (other disorders) History of clinically significant cardiac disease History of coexistent and clinically significant COPD, bronchiectasis, asthma, inadequately treated sleepdisordered breathing, or any clinically significant pulmonary diseases or disorders other than IPF or PH secondary to IPF History of use of drugs and toxins known to cause PAH, including aminorex, fenfluramine, dexenfluramine, and amphetamines FEV1/FVC ratio less than (&lt;) 0.70 post bronchodilator; SpO2 saturation at rest &lt;92% with &gt;= 6 liters (L) of supplemental oxygen at Screening Extent of emphysema greater than the extent of fibrotic changes (honeycombing and reticular changes) on any previous highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, in the opinion of the Investigator Smoked tobacco within 3 months prior to screening or is unwilling to avoid tobacco products (cigarettes, pipe, cigars) throughout the study Illicit drug or significant alcohol abuse Electrocardiogram (ECG) with a heartrate corrected QT interval (corrected using Fridericia's formula [QTcF]) &gt;=500 milliseconds (ms) at screening, or a family or personal history of long QT syndrome Exclusion criteria based on pirfenidone reference safety information: 1. participants with a history of angioedema due to pirfenidone; 2. concomitant use of fluvoxamine Exclusion criteria based on sildenafil reference safety information: 1. coadministration with nitric oxide donors or organic nitrates, phosphodiesterase5 (PDE5) inhibitors, guanylate cyclase stimulators, and most potent of the Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors; 2. loss of vision in one eye because of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); 3. use of an alphablocker; 4. participants with bleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration; 5. known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa; 6. galactose intolerance</criteria>
