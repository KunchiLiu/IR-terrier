	<brief_summary>The study assessed the safety and ability of several doses of an orally inhaled medicine [ie, Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution = GIS] to improve airflow in the lungs when delivered with an electronic eFlow nebulizer system in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study was conducted in 12 patients in 2 parts. Part 1 was designed to find the once-a- day GIS dose that produced the highest improvement in lung airflow. Part 2 tested the GIS dose with the highest improvement in lung airflow and a placebo (ie, no drug) delivered by a general purpose nebulizer. The airflow improvements of the same GIS dose were compared between the two nebulizer systems to determine what effect the device had on GIS delivery.</brief_summary>
