	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate pain level experienced by patients who have a break of the top of their shinbone and have either blood removed from the joint alone or have blood removed and medicine injected into the joint.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Local Anesthetic Injection and Hemarthrosis Aspiration on Pain and Narcotic/Opioid Analgesia Use-Tibial Plateau Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 will receive aspiration of the joint alone in which a needle will be introduced into the knee joint to withdraw the blood that collects within the knee after fractures. Group 2 will receive aspiration of the knee joint (the same as Group 1) and will receive an injection of 20cc bupivacaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine, which is a local anesthetic commonly used for the numbing of skin. Group 3 will receive no injection or aspiration therapy; instead will be treated as normally treated for this type of fracture. After the aspiration or the aspiration and injection: Initial pain score will be recorded immediately. Subsequent pain scores will be recorded at time points 0 (5 minutes after intervention), 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours after initial work-up. If patient treated as an outpatient then patent will be asked to self-record pain scores on a scale of 0-10 (0= no pain and 10= worst pain you have ever had). In all cases patients will be managed appropriately for the injury.</detailed_description>
