	<brief_summary>Negative symptoms, which include the loss of motivation, social withdrawal and reduced emotional expression are prominent in youth at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. These negative symptoms lead to significant functional impairment and enduring disability in these youth. At present, there are no established treatments for negative symptoms. Recent evidence from independent studies, however, suggests two promising novel treatment approaches for negative symptoms, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and computerized remediation strategies. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if tDCS combined with a virtual reality-based computerized remediation (VR) is effective for treating negative symptoms in CHR youth, thereby mitigating the enduring functional disability these symptoms cause.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS Coupled With Virtual Rehabilitation for Negative Symptoms in At-Risk Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Negative symptoms, which include amotivation, social withdrawal and diminished emotional expression are prominent in youth at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Negative symptoms lead to significant functional impairment and enduring disability in these youth regardless of subsequent conversion to psychosis. At present, there are no established treatments for negative symptoms. Recent evidence from independent studies, however, suggests two promising novel treatment approaches for negative symptoms, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and computerized remediation strategies, both of which have revealed significant therapeutic effects on negative symptoms in schizophrenia (SZ). tDCS involves delivery of a low intensity continuous electrical field to the frontal cortex. tDCS is very safe and well tolerated, and is currently being investigated as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders. tDCS is also Health Canada approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if tDCS combined with a virtual reality-based computerized remediation (VR), administered three times per week for four weeks, is effective for treating negative symptoms in CHR youth, thereby mitigating the enduring functional disability these symptoms cause.</detailed_description>
