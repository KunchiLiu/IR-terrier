	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study are to assess the relative bioavailability of the BIIB074 direct compression formulation (DCF) to the BIIB074 roller compaction formulation (RCF) and to determine the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the BIIB074 DCF. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 administered as the DCF following single oral dose administration in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
