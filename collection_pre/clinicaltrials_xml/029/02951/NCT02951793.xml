	<brief_summary>Investigators are seeking to determine the impact of recent alcohol, smoking or psychotropic drug use prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission on incidence of delirium and sedation requirements. Study design: A prospective observational study, in a medical ICU of a tertiary university hospital. Methods: For all new ICU admissions, a 1-page questionnaire including Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), smoking history and prior medication use was given to the patient or closest family members.
