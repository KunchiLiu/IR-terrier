	<detailed_description>Aim The aim of this study is to conduct a pragmatic evaluation of ICBT for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders and OCD within routine health care in a rural area. Research questions - Is ICBT an acceptable method for the patient group? - Is ICBT effective in a clinical setting? - Is further treatment needed after ICBT? - What are the long-term effects of ICBT? - What predicts treatment outcome? - How does ICBT work in a clincal setting? (time spent, negative effects etc)? Design This is a uncontrolled intervention study where included families and children will be recruited consecutively during two years from a routine care CAMHS unit. All participants will be offered ICBT and assessed pre- and post-treatment, and at three-month follow-up through clinician ratings and self-report measures. The primary outcome measure is clinician rated severity of principal disorder at three-month follow-up. Long-term results will be assessed through study of medical records two years after completed ICBT.</detailed_description>
