	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine plus nub-paclitaxel (GA) regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and represents a new standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. GA is one of the high response rate treatment regimen, the investigators considered as a promising treatment as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On the other hand, incidences of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were significantly higher in the g group compared with gemcitabine group. Therefore, it was decided to consider the balance of safety and efficacy on survival time as a preoperative chemotherapy, the investigators use the NAC-GA regimen includes only two cycles (three times weekly and one week rest) of GEMABR regimen. The investigators also evaluate Recurrence free survival from the first day of protocol therapy, safety of the protocol therapy(Adverse effect), morbidity based on Clavien Dindo classification of more than Grade 3, response rate, preoperative/postoperative tumor marker (CA19-9, CEA), rate of mornalization, reduction rate of SUVmax value on PET-CT (limited only for PET-CT available institutions), chemotherapeutic effect grade based on Evans classification, resection rate, R0 resection rate, surgical data (operative time, blood loss, transfusion, postoperative hospital day), the overall morbidity rates (Reoperation, rate of re-admission, mortality), number of patient rate in postoperative adjuvant therapy (entry rate, completion rate), dose intensity for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
