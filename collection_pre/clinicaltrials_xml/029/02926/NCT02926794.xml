	<brief_summary>Two hundred and ninety-three college students who reported drinking in the past month were randomly assigned to condition in a 2 (self-affirmation: values vs. control writing task) x 2 (implementation intentions: formed vs. not formed) between-subjects factorial design. Participants first completed a self-affirmation or control writing task, then read an article describing the risks of drinking. Next, all participants reported their common drinking behaviors and contexts, and then selected two harm-reduction strategies making either general intentions to use the strategies or making implementation intentions to use the strategies. Alcohol consumption was measured 1 and 2 weeks after the experimental session.</brief_summary>
