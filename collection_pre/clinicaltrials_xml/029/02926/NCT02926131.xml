	<brief_summary>This is an observational prospective study. The main purpose is to evaluate the stability of the Bilistick system in a humid and hot climate compared to the quantitative test for serum bilirubin (SBR) measurement currently used, the BR-501 total bilirubin meter, kept in a controlled environment. The secondary aim is to assess the operational feasibility of the Bilistick system in a tropical limited-resource setting, when used by locally trained nurses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate a New Jaundice Stick Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study procedure: 1. SBR will be measured in parallel with two tests during three distinct seasons. (Cold, hot, rainy). The Blood is from an extra capillary sample taken from a single heel prick done for routine SBR) BR-501 total bilirubin meter, the quantitative test for SBR currently used, will be kept in a controlled environment while the new bilirubin test (Bilistick system) will be exposed to tropical conditions. 2. Trained nurses will use the Bilistick system observed by a qualified laboratory technician; Usability of the Bilistick system by the trained nurses will be evaluated via a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire and focus groups discussions.</detailed_description>
