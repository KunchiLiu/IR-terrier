	<detailed_description>The investigators will collaborate with Austin High School, Wiggs Middle School, and Guillen Middle School of the El Paso Independent School District to implement smoke free youth coalitions as an after school activity. The coalitions will follow the Teens Against Tobacco Use (TATU) model developed by the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Heart Association. Participating youth will be trained to develop and deliver anti-tobacco presentations to younger students. Each school will have a separate youth coalition operating under the guidance of an adult coordinator. High school youth will present to middle school classes, whereas middle school youth will present to 4th and 5th graders. To evaluate the efficacy of the TATU program, we will randomly assign students in physical education classes to receive TATU presentations or a control condition. Confidential surveys about tobacco will be administered at the beginning and end of the school year. Analyses will compare intervention and control students on smoking susceptibility, perceptions of harm from tobacco use, tobacco industry perceptions, and social norms on tobacco use.</detailed_description>
