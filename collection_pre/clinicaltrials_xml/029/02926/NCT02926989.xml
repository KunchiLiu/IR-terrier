	<detailed_description>The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk of hypokalemia (low plasma potassium concentration) following administration of a Plasmalyte Glucos 50 mg/mL solution compared to a 0.45% saline in 5% dextrose solution in acutely ill hospitalised children, who need intravenous fluid therapy. The secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk of hyponatremia (low plasma sodium concentration) and the risk of hypernatremia (high plasma sodium concentration) following administration of isotonic solution compared to hypotonic solution.</detailed_description>
