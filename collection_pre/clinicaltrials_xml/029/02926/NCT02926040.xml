	<brief_summary>A. Pancreatic cancer background In 2012, 1,172 new pancreatic cancer patients were diagnosed in Switzerland. Only 20% of the patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer are candidates for surgical resection, the only potential treatment for cure. Over 30% of the patients initially present with locally advanced disease. Patients with locally advanced disease have no evidence of metastatic spread to the liver, lung, and peritoneum but present with local involvement of vital structures that prohibits reasonable tumor resection. Currently, those patients are evaluated for palliative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy. However, even with best conventional medical therapy, median survival of patients with locally advanced disease is mostly below 1 year. Over the last years, loco-regional therapies gained increased attention including radiofrequency-, cryo-, and microwave ablation as well as electrochemotherapy. However, all those entities are criticized by their complication rates leading to morbidity and mortality, limited area of application given the complex anatomical structures around the pancreas, and ill-defined improvements in overall survival. B. Irreversible electroporation (IRE): Irreversible electroporation is an emerging ablative modality that gained enormous interest over the last five years. For locally advanced pancreatic cancer, it was introduced in 2009. IRE is mainly non-thermal and primarily works through apoptosis. Its well studied safety profile allows ablation also within the context of locally advanced pancreatic cancer given it mainly spares vessels from destruction. Increasing evidence shows that IRE for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is effective compared to historic controls with a significant prolongation of local progression free survival, distant progression free survival and overall survival. The improvement in overall survival is about double the amount of what is seen with best new chemotherapy and chemoradiation regimens used at the present time. Those results are even more impressive given the discouraging improvements among palliative systemic options. The NanoKnife IRE device (Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY) is commonly used to perform IRE procedures in pancreatic cancer patients and is commercially available since 2009 and got Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510K clearance for soft tissue ablation in October 2011 in the United States. C. Quality of life and nutritional status/long term outcomes Given the overall poor long-term outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are of utmost importance when treatment recommendations are discussed with patients. This is especially true for patients with more advanced staged disease where definitive surgical resection with curative intent is not possible. However, HRQoL reports for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing IRE are very limited. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, no other specific investigations exist that assessed HRQoL measures for patients undergoing IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, no specific assessment exists that focuses on nutritional status for this patient group. In addition, impact on local and distant recurrence as well as cancer-specific and overall survival are still ill-defined and further information is needed.</brief_summary>
