Thirty subjects without AD matched for sex, age and coronary artery disease risk factor with the AD subjects will also be included. All subjects will undergo the following imaging procedures: a 18FDG-PET to quantify vascular inflammation in the ascending aorta and carotids and a MDCT to calculate the Agatston score. Skin and blood biomarkers will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
