	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single dose of ZX008 (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) when added to standard of care and when added to Adjunctive Antiepleptic therapy to Stiripentol treatment in children and young adults with Dravet Syndrome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Two-Part Study to Investigate the Dose-Ranging Safety and Pharmacokinetics, Followed by the Efficacy and Safety of ZX008 (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) Oral Solution as an Adjunctive Therapy in Children â‰¥2 Years Old and Young Adults With Dravet Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, two-cohort trial to assess the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of a single dose of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride) oral solution when added to Dravet syndrome treatment regimen containing VPA and CLB, with or without STP (Cohort 1), followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ZX008 as adjunctive therapy for seizures in children and young adults with Dravet syndrome (Cohort 2). Cohort 2 will not be dosed until the PK and safety data from Cohort 1 have been collected and evaluated. The PK and safety data from Cohort 1 will determine the dose of ZX008 to be used in Cohort 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Subject must be male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female, age 2 to 18 years (inclusive) Subject must have documented medical history to support a clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, where convulsive seizures are not completely controlled by current antiepileptic drugs. Subject must be receiving a therapeutically relevant and stable dose of CLB, VP, and STP for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and are expected to remain stable throughout the study (Cohort 2 only). Subject must be receiving a stable dose of CLB and VPA, administered twice daily, to be eligible for Dose Regimen 1 and 2 or subject must be receiving a stable dose of CLB, VPA, and STP, administered twice daily, to be eligible for Dose Regimen 3 (Cohort 1 only). Key Subject has a known hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in the study medication. Subject has pulmonary arterial hypertension. Subject has a current or past history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, such as cardiac valvulopathy, myocardial infarction or stroke. Subject has a current or recent history of anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or depression within the prior year that required medical treatment or psychological treatment for a duration greater than 1 month. Subject has a current or past history of glaucoma. Subject is receiving concomitant therapy with: centrallyacting anorectic agents; monoamineoxidase inhibitors; any centrallyacting compound with clinically appreciable amount of serotonin agonist or antagonist properties, including serotonin reuptake inhibition; triptans, atomoxetine, or other centrallyacting noradrenergic agonist; cyproheptadine, and/or CYP 2D6/3A4/2B6 inhibitors/substrates. Subject is currently taking carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin, or has taken any of these within the past 30 days, as maintenance therapy. Subject has a positive result on urine THC Panel or whole blood CBD at the Screening Visit. Subject has a clinically significant condition, or has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness in the 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, other than epilepsy, that would negatively impact study participation, collection of study data, or pose a risk to the subject.</criteria>
