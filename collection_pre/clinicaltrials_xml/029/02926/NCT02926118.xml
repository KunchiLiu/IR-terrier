	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring During Diets That Differ in Glycemic Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine the suitability of a continuous glucose monitor to detect the impact of a dietary intervention on postprandial blood glucose levels in normal, healthy, free living subjects. We will compare a dietary intervention of meals with a high glycemic load (high post-meal blood glucose) versus meals with a low glycemic load (low post-meal blood glucose) in a cross-over study. In addition, the glucose profiles obtained both via venous blood sampling and via continuous glucose monitor following a standard carbohydrate load will be compared.</detailed_description>
