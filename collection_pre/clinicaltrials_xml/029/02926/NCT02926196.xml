	<brief_title>Adjuvant Treatment for High-risk Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients With the Anti-PD-l1 Antibody Avelumab: A Phase III Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer (all comers, unselected for PD-L1 status) who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy, and (if indicated) radiotherapy. - to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared to observation in PD-L1-positive (as determined by a companion diagnostic test under development) patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy, and (if indicated) radiotherapy. - to determine whether Avelumab improves overall survival (OS) compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy, and (if indicated) radiotherapy. - to assess the overall safety of Avelumab administered as adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor, neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy, and (if indicated) radiotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged &gt; 18 years Signed written informed consent before any trialrelated procedure is undertaken that is not part of the standard patient management Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 Nonmetastatic, histologically confirmed primary invasive breast carcinoma Triple negative breast cancer: hormone receptor negative (ER &lt; 10% and PgR &lt; 10%) and HER2 negative (IHC 0/1+ or ISH nonamplified), as defined by the local pathology laboratory. In case of discordance between preoperative corebiopsy and the surgical sample, the receptor assessment performed on the surgical sample has to be considered for inclusion criteria evaluation. Availability of a formalinfixed, paraffinembedded block containing tumor tissue or at least 7 unstained tumor slides. Patients must have completed treatment with curative intent including: surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and (if clinically indicated as per local policy) radiotherapy. Adequately excised: patients must have undergone either breastconserving surgery or mastectomy/nipple or skinsparing mastectomy. The margins of the resected specimen should be free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (no ink on tumor). In the case of breastconserving surgery patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection. For patients who undergo mastectomy, patients with a microscopic positive deep margin are eligible, provided they have received radiotherapy on chest wall. Pathological node staging (Union for International Cancer ControlAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer [UICC/AJCC] 7th edition): patients must have had axillary lymph node dissection for evaluation of pathologic nodal status. Only patients with &gt; 4 metastatic axillary node will be eligible (&gt;pN2). Patients must have completed adjuvant chemotherapy including at least 3 courses of an anthracycline agent and 3 courses of a taxane agent. Patients who received dosedense regimens and those who received carboplatin as part of the adjuvant treatment are eligible. Patients for whom radiotherapy is clinically indicated as per local policy must have completed radiotherapy prior to study enrolment. No more than 8 weeks may elapse between the completion of last adjuvant treatment (adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy if indicated) and randomization. Normal organ and marrow function 1. White blood count (WBC) greater than or equal to 2.5 x109/L 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x109/L 3. Absolute lymphocyte count greater or equal to 0.5 x109/L 4. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x109/L 5. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL 6. Serum creatinine less or equal to 1.25 x the upper limit of laboratory normal range (ULN) 7. Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level less or equal to 1.5 x ULN range and AST and ALT levels less or equal than 2.5 x ULN for all subjects. For patients with known Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin levels less or equal than 2 x ULN range (with direct bilirubin less than ULN) will be accepted. Highly effective contraception (i.e. methods with a failure rate of less than 1 % per year) for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists (Note: The effects of the trial treatment on the developing human fetus are unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception, defined in Appendix A or as stipulated in national or local guidelines. Highly effective contraception must be used 28 days prior to first trial treatment administration, for the duration of trial treatment, and at least for 60 days after stopping trial treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this trial, the treating physician should be informed immediately). Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent. Clinical stage at presentation: T14, N03, M0 (Exception: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors at presentation will not be eligible). Pathologic evidence of residual invasive carcinoma in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes on the surgical specimen obtained after preoperative therapy (ypT1micN0, ypT1micN0i+, ypT0N0i+ will be excluded) Exclusion Criteria Stage IV breast cancer. 3 or less positive axillary lymphnodes at pathological examination of surgical specimen.
