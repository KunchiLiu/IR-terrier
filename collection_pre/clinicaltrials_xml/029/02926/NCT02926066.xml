	<brief_summary>This clinical trial expansion is to offer patients, who are not enrolled into the Phase I/II trial, a chance of treatment, to extend the experience in this gene therapy, and to increase the dosage slightly to waive the drug dilution procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial for Treatment of Aromatic L-amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) Deficiency Using AAV2-hAADC - An Expansion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: AAV2-hAADC viral vector has been produced by a GMP facility. Single dose toxicity test for AAV2-hAADC in rat has been competed by a GLP facility which revealed no acute toxicity. Viral vector will be injected directly to bilateral putamens by stereotactic surgery. The safety of the surgery will be monitored by both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Efficacy of the treatment will be monitored by positron emission tomography (PET), cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitter levels, and motor and mental developmental scales.Expected achievement: Since motor dysfunction causes the major morbidity in patients with AADC deficiency, restore of AADC activity in the putamens should relieve their motor symptoms, as demonstrated by our compassionate treatment. This study is the only chance of treatment for patients with AADC deficiency. The investigators expect a high chance to complete this trial and then proceed to the drug approval Phase III pivotal trial. The conduction of a clinical trial on human gene therapy will also trigger the advance of biotechnology in Taiwan.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A definitive diagnosis of AADC deficiency, such as a CSF study showing decreased levels of HVA, 5HIAA, an elevated LDOPA level or the presence of at least one AADC gene pathologic mutation etc. 2. Typical clinical manifestations of the disease, such as oculogyric crisis, hypotonia and delayed development. 3. Over 2 years of age, or having adequate head circumference for surgery. 4. The patient must not older than 72 months of age. 5. Participating patient must be fully cooperative for assessments and tests conducted before and throughout the entire trial. 6. The parents or guardians must sign the Informed Consent Form to give their consent. 1. Obvious brain structural change in the judgment of the investigator. 2. The subject will be excluded if there is any health or neurological concern which might increase the risk of surgery. The principal investigator has the right to assess whether the subject is eligible for this trial based on the subject's health condition. 3. Patients with antiAAV2 antibody titer higher than 1,200, or &gt;1 O.D. value by ELISA will be excluded. 4. Subject participating in this trial must not take any drug that might compromise this clinical trial.</criteria>
