	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of using immersive Virtual Reality (VR) during labor. We will also explore whether VR distraction is helpful for reducing subjective pain during labor, even if this pain is severe or excruciating. We predict that VR is feasible in this setting and that VR distraction will reduce acute pain and anxiety during labor.</brief_summary>
