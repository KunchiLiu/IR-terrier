	<brief_summary>Simulated environment allowed safe learning of critical events and knowledge of appropriate response and treatment. Anesthesiology resident education curriculum in Lyon plans several high fidelity simulation session with a large panel of critical events. Anticipation of critical events before they may occur and planification of team resources and priority in the treatment strategy may help to improve team performance during the scenario. The investigators' goal is to compare individual and team performances with or without an optimization personal potential training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Potential Optimization Training in Simulation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to compare the individual and team performances for resident who were taught personal optimization skills (positive reinforcement, personalized psycho-physiological relaxation, mental rehearsal) and those who didn't. The investigators are going to compare groups of anesthesiology residents going through same scenarios of simulated critical events in high fidelity simulation session. Scenarios will be recorded to be analyzed by 2 reviewers independently. A specific checklist of appropriate treatment and a non technical skill checklist will be use to cote team performance (OTTAWA and TEAM scales). Stress of the participants will be assessed by visual analogic scale of participants anxiety and stress. The two groups will be compare to see if improvement in team performance is associated with the intervention.</detailed_description>
