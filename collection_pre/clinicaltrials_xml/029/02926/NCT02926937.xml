	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who have inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise. Secondary Objectives: - To compare sotagliflozin versus placebo based on: - Change from baseline in 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a mixed meal; - Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG); - Change from baseline in body weight; - Change from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for patients with baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg; - Change from baseline in SBP for all patients; - Proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt;6.5%, &lt;7.0%. - To evaluate the safety of sotagliflozin versus placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to 34 weeks, including a Screening Period consisting of a Screening Phase of up to 2 weeks and a 2-week single-blind placebo Run-in Phase, a 26-week double-blind Treatment Period, and a 4-week post-treatment Follow-up visit to collect safety information.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients (male and female) with T2D, who are treated with diet and exercise only during the 12 weeks prior to screening. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 years at the Screening Visit. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hemoglobin A1c &lt;7% or &gt;10% via central laboratory test at Screening. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt;15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) measured by the central laboratory at screening (Visit 1) and confirmed by a repeat test (&gt;15 mmol/L [270 mg/dL]) before randomization. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Treated with an antidiabetic pharmacological agent within the 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Previous insulin use &gt;1 month (at any time, aside from for treatment of gestational diabetes). History of gastric surgical procedure including gastric banding within 3 years before the Screening Visit. History of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg (systolic) or &gt;95 mmHg (diastolic). History of hypertensive emergency. Patients with severe anemia, severe cardiovascular (including congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) III/IV), respiratory, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, or active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease or patients with short life expectancy making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult. Aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase: &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range. Total bilirubin: &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome). Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical or ophthalmic application or inhaled forms) for more than 10 consecutive days within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit. Patient who has taken other investigational drugs or prohibited therapy for this study within 12 weeks or 5 halflives from screening or randomization, whichever is longer. Pregnant (demonstrated by serum pregnancy test at Screening) or breastfeeding women. Severe renal disease as defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m² at screening by the 4 variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Patient is unwilling to perform selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and complete the patient diary as required per protocol. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
