	<brief_summary>This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to increase the availability of buprenorphine treatment slots in specialty addiction treatment organizations to treat opioid use. The intervention being tested is a bundle of buprenorphine prescriber capacity building practices called the Physician Recruitment Bundle (PRB). For the study, 70 organizations will be identified and recruited, and those organizations will then be randomized into one of two arms: 1) control, and 2) PRB: organizations implementing the PRB using the Network for Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) Organizational Change Model. The primary research question is to test the impact of the PRB, relative to the control, on increasing the number of assigned physician buprenorphine slots in specialty addiction treatment organizations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention to Expand Buprenorphine Prescribers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overdoses due to non-medical use of prescription opioids and other opiates have become the leading cause of accidental deaths in the United States. Buprenorphine is a key evidence-based intervention available to specialty addiction treatment organizations for treating the increase in opioid use disorders and overdose deaths. However, organizations' efforts to provide buprenorphine have been hindered by limited success in recruiting physicians licensed to prescribe the medication. The addiction field does not naturally attract physicians, and limits on access are compounded by the medication's unique regulatory situation, in which physicians must apply for a waiver that allows them buprenorphine prescribing slots to treat 30 patients in the first year and 100 in the following years. This study will address this emerging need to increase access to buprenorphine by testing a bundle of practices, called the Physician Recruitment Bundle (PRB), which aims to recruit physicians licensed to prescribe buprenorphine to work with specialty addiction treatment organizations. The PRB consists of the following elements, a) candidate identification, b) physician education forums, c) physician friendly buprenorphine delivery model, d) academic detailing (an evidence-based tool to influence physician decision making), e) telemedicine, and f) organizational leadership support. In this mixed methods analysis, the primary research question is to test the impact of the PRB, relative to the control, on increasing the number of assigned physician buprenorphine slots in specialty addiction treatment organizations. The secondary research is to test if the PRB mediates changes to factors for found to be associated with physician recruitment, including: resources dedicated to physician recruitment, physician recruiter motivation, and current employed physician satisfaction. Lastly, qualitative methods will be used to study the context and processes that influence PRB adoption and fidelity and to understand and develop a deeper understanding of how the PRB influences recruitment beyond the existing study variables.</detailed_description>
