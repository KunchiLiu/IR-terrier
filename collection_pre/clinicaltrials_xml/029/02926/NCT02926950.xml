	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin. Secondary Objectives: - To compare sotagliflozin versus placebo for: - Change from baseline in 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a mixed meal. - Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG); - Change from Baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for patients with baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg; - Change from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for all patients; - Change from baseline in body weight; - Proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt;6.5% and &lt;7.0%. - To evaluate the safety of sotagliflozin versus placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with diet and exercise and on metformin at a stable dose ≥1500 mg/day for at least 12 weeks. However, patients on metformin at a dose &lt;1500 mg/day at the time of enrollment (stable dose for at least 12 weeks before enrollment) may be eligible for screening if documentation of lack of tolerance of a metformin dose ≥1500 mg/day can be provided. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 years at the screening visit. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hemoglobin A1c &lt;7% or &gt;10% via central laboratory test at screening. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt;15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) measured by the central laboratory at screening (Visit 1) and confirmed by a repeat test (&gt;15 mmol/L [270 mg/dL]) before randomization. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Treated with an antidiabetic pharmacological regimen other than metformin ≥1500 mg per day (or maximum tolerated dose) within the 12 weeks preceding the Screening Visit. Previous insulin use &gt;1 month (at any time, aside from for treatment of gestational diabetes). History of prior gastric surgical procedure, including gastric banding, within 3 years before the Screening Visit. History of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg (systolic) or &gt;95 mmHg (diastolic). History of hypertensive emergency. Patients with severe anemia, severe cardiovascular (including congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) III/IV), respiratory, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, or active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease or patients with short life expectancy making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult. Aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase: &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range. Total bilirubin: &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome). Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical or ophthalmic application or inhaled forms) for more than 10 consecutive days within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit. Patient who has taken other investigational drugs or prohibited therapy for this study within 12 weeks or 5 halflives from screening or randomization, whichever is longer. Pregnant (demonstrated by serum pregnancy test at Screening) or breastfeeding women. Patient is unwilling to perform selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and complete the patient diary as required per protocol. Contraindication to metformin as per local labeling. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
