	<brief_title>Lingual Tonsil Hypertrophy Grading and Its Relation to Sociodemographic Factors and Clinical Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups of people were interviewed during this research - the LTH group and the control group - a total of 100 subjects. The first group was comprised of 50 individuals, who visited the otorhinolaryngologist at Lithuanian University of Health Sciences hospital, regarding dysphagia, and were diagnosed with LTH during endoscopy. The second group consisted of 50 healthy individuals without dysphagia, who did not have enlarged lingual tonsils during assessment using videolaryngoscopy. All subjects filled out the questionnaires, composed of RSI (Reflux Symptom Index) and DSQ (Dysphagia Screening Questionnaire) questionnaires, validated and verified for use in Lithuania, together with a questionnaire created specifically for this research for gathering sociodemographic data. The LTH grade of all subjects was determined using DelGaudio and Friedman grading systems.</detailed_description>
