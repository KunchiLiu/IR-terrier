	<brief_summary>Based on the evidence, a pre-post test pilot study design will be implemented to clarify the benefits of an acupuncture intervention before and after treatment. The initial assessment will contain a brief demographic interview and a review of medical records, and both pre and post-intervention evaluations will comprise an imaging protocol that includes RS-fMRI, pCASL, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and a brief cognitive assessment, as described in greater detail below. Several quantitative measures within DMN regions will be generated and compared between pre- and post-acupuncture therapy. These include 1) RS-fMRI measures such as connectivity strength and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF); 2) regional CBF measured with pCASL; 3) water diffusion measures for microstructural changes with DKI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pilot sample of 5 individuals with left CVA's will participate in a 6 session acupuncture intervention. Pre and post fMRI and cognitive data will be compared. The objectives of this study are 1) to determine the effects of acupuncture in improving cognitive performance in a pilot sample of 5 individuals who have experienced a left CVA and 2) to clarify the mechanism of improvement via functional brain imaging.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants must have experienced a left Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) at least one year prior to study participation and the injury timeframe is 110 years post stroke Be able to participate in the cognitive testing that has been validated with Englishspeaking samples Be right hand dominant Have an educational level between 1418 years Evidence history of cognitive decline poststroke without significant impairment Have adequate vision, hearing, communication, and motor skills Evidence cognitive impairment that would negatively impact capacity to understand and participate in this study Be participating in active therapeutic treatments that may independently improve cognitive function Have had a change in medication over two weeks before the start of study procedures or through the study protocol Have contraindications for acupuncture or MRI. Contraindications to fMRI include: having a pacemaker, defibrillator or wires other than sternal wires. Metallic foreign body in the eye these might move or heat during scanning resulting in serious eye injury. Deep brain stimulator SwanGanz catheter Bullets or gunshot pellets near great vessels or vital organs, such as the lungs, heart or brain, Cerebral aneurysm clips if magnetic, can move. Also not scanned if type unknown. Cochlear implant malfunction. Magnetic dental implants loss of magnetic hold to keep the implant in place. Certain Drug infusion devices Main contraindications for acupcunture in this study include: Pregnancy, IV anticoagulant therapy, uncontrolled coagulation blood disorders like haemophilia, malignant tumors, and fear of needles.</criteria>
