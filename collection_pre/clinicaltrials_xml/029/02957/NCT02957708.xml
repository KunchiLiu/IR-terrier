	<brief_title>Constraint-induced Movement Therapy and Self-regulation for Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children diagnosed with hemiplegic CP are involved. A within-subject design is used with children acting as their own controls. The study is scheduled at three-week intervals. All children undergo conventional occupational therapy (OT) and modified constraint-induced movement therapy plus self-regulation (mCIMT + SR) program in a random order. Both programs last for three weeks. Each program is followed by a three-week no-treatment period to measure the carry-over effect. The OT program consists of training on unimanual and bimanual tasks for 1 to 2 hours a week with daily home exercise. The mCIMT + SR program involves restraint of the unaffected upper limb of children using a cotton sling for 6 hours per day for 15 days. A one-hour structured task practice with the use of SR is provided during each 6-hour restraint. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function, the Caregiver Functional Use Survey, a hand dynamometer, pinch gauge, and modified Ashworth scale are used for evaluation. All children are assessed for five times at 3-week interval: once before and twice after the conventional OT; and twice after the mCIMT + SR at 1 week and at 3 weeks. Before and after the three-week intervention, the children participate in event-related potentials (ERP) sessions with a choice reaction task. Event-related potentials (ERP) technique is used to capture the changes in neural mechanism after intervention.</detailed_description>
