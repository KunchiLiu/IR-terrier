	<brief_title>Effects on Liver Cirrhotic Patients' by a Nurse-led Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of liver cirrhosis in Sweden increase mostly due to life style factors. A large need of care is common in the end stage of the disease. Nurse-led clinics for other groups of patients, e.g. coronary heart disease, have shown high quality which has resulted in an established part of the follow-up. This study is a randomized controlled study at five Swedish hospitals to study the effect of a changed follow-up process for liver cirrhotic patients by adding a nurse-led clinic to follow up by physician. The intervention implies a larger extend of nursing interventions at the outpatient clinic to increase the patient's quality of life, quality of care and reduce the need of inpatient care. A few hospitals in Sweden offers a nurse-led clinic for liver cirrhotic patients, the interest in other hospitals are raising. Though there is a lack of evidence in nursing intervention within this population and it is still unknown what the effects are for the individual or on the health economy.</detailed_description>
