	<brief_title>Validation of Brain Function Assessment Algorithm for mTBI From Injury to Rehabilitation in College Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Performance will be assessed by comparing the output of the algorithms, which were developed by correlating changes in brain electrical activity (EEG) and other measures of brain function to mTBI (e.g. concussion) in the sports environment. Injured athletes will be studied during the season at time of injury, and then longitudinally weeks after injury. Matched controls will be tested following the same schedule as the injured athletes.</detailed_description>
