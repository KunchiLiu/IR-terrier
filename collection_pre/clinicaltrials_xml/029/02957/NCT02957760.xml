	<detailed_description>introduction : The central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a major cause of ocular morbidity, depending in particular on the occurrence and extent of retinal ischemia by capillary occlusion. There is no effective systemic treatment of this condition. An increase in the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium was observed for patients with CRVO, correlated with overexpression of membrane phosphatidylserine. Hypothesis : Hydroxycarbamide (HC) by reducing the erythrocyte adhesion to the endothelium may prevent or delay the onset of retinal capillary non-perfusion in patients with CRVO. Primary objective: To assess the efficacy at 3 months of treatment with HC on retinal capillary perfusion in patients with a recent CRVO. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the treatment, the efficacy to 6 months on retinal perfusion of the treatment with HC (HC peak effect on the red cell adhesion in vitro), and the biological effects of HC, in particular on adhesion to endothelium and erythrocyte hemorheological parameters.</detailed_description>
