	<brief_summary>Through this study, the investigators seek to identify the benefits (improved survival) and harms (more procedures, more treatment, side effects, and quality-of-life impact) from different surveillance frequenciesâ€”every three vs. six vs. 12 months. Using the National Cancer Database and quality-of-life data from a large group of prostate cancer survivors, the investigators aim to compare survival, procedures/tests, treatments, and side effects in prostate cancer survivors who are followed with alternative surveillance frequencies and compare quality-of-life outcomes. The overall goal of the study is to provide high-quality data that will allow development of a personalized, risk-based tailored approach to post-treatment surveillance for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
