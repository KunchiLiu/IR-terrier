	<brief_summary>The following are hypothesized: 1. The Diabetes Engagement and Activation Platform (DEAP) can be integrated into primary care workflow to facilitate the care of patients with type 2 diabetes. 2. The DEAP intervention will be feasible and acceptable to patients with type 2 diabetes. 3. The DEAP intervention will enhance patient activation and improve type 2 diabetes self management and glucose control</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetes Engagement and Activation Platform</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1: To evaluate how primary care practices adopt and integrate DEAP into routine workflow including identification of barriers and facilitators to support acceptable, feasible, and sustainable use of the system. - Sub-aim 1.1: Measure the proportion of clinicians and care team members who engage patients through the DEAP intervention as well as the types of patient support activities they address; assess the representativeness of participating clinicians and care team members in relation to all practice staff; and assess how they integrated DEAP into the care of type 2 diabetes patients. - Sub-aim 1.2: Assess how practices redesign workflow, overcome barriers, and enhance facilitators in order to integrate DEAP. - Sub-aim 1.3: Determine processes for sustaining DEAP beyond the project funding period . Aim 2: To compare, relative to usual care, the effectiveness of the DEAP intervention. - Sub Aim 2.1: Measure the proportion and representativeness of eligible patients who choose to enroll; access the DEAP curriculum; complete the DEAP curriculum; and contact care team members. . - Sub Aim 2.2: Compare the change in the average glycosylated hemoglobin (primary outcome), Body Mass Index, systolic blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) medications and patient activation (secondary outcomes) from baseline to 3 months and from 3 to 6 months for patients randomized to DEAP versus usual care. Sub Aim 2.3: Assess the clarity, readability and acceptability of the DEAP curricula materials for T2D patients enrolled in the intervention.</detailed_description>
