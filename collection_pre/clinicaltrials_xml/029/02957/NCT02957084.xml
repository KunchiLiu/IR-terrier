	<brief_summary>In this prospective, open cohort study the diagnostic value of tests based on neck anatomy in predicting difficult laryngoscopy was assessed. The anatomic features of the neck measured were head extension, mouth opening, upper lip bite, Mallampati class, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, ratio of height to thyromental, neck circumference, thyrosternal distance, hyomental distance at full head extension (FHE) and at neutral position (NP), ratio of neck circumference to thyromental distance and ratio of hyomental distance FHE to hyomental distance NP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anatomic Features of the Neck and Preoperative Tests as Predictive Markers of Difficult Laryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Difficult airway assessment is based on various anatomic parameters of upper airway, much of it being concentrated on oral cavity and the pharyngeal structures. The diagnostic value of tests based on neck anatomy in predicting difficult laryngoscopy was assessed in this study . The sample consisted of adult patients scheduled to receive general anaesthesia. Anatomic features of the neck were measured pre-operatively. The anatomic features of the neck measured were thyromental distance, sternomental distance, ratio of height to thyromental, neck circumference, thyrosternal distance, hyomental distance at full head extension (FHE) and at neutral position (NP), ratio of neck circumference to thyromental distance and ratio of hyomental distance FHE to hyomental distance NP. The commonly used predictive tests head extension, mouth opening, upper lip bite test and Mallampati class were also measured. The laryngoscopic view was classified according to the Cormack-Lehane Grade (1-4). Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Cormack-Lehane Grade 3 or 4. Years of experience of the anaesthesiologists were recorded, as well as the number of tries needed to intubate the patient. The optimal cut-off points for each predictive tests were identified by using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for each test. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression, including all variables, was used to create a predictive model. Comparisons between genders were also performed to explore possible differences in diagnostic value and cut-off points. Finally, the years of experience of the clinician and the number of tries needed to intubate the patient were compared to assess risk of bias.</detailed_description>
