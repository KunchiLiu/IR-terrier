	<brief_summary>Metoclopramide (Reglan) is a common agent used for relief of headaches in the emergency department (ED).In this study the investigators seek to explore another option for treatment of headaches in the ED, one that may be more efficacious and efficient. Haloperidol (Haldol), a butyrophenone class of medication, is thought to act by affecting the dopamine 2 receptor in the brain. By exploring haloperidol as an option for treatment, the investigators hope to discover a more efficient and effective medication for the treatment of non-traumatic headaches, thereby decreasing a patient's length of stay in the department and decreasing the rate of return visits for continued discomfort from the same headache. This study could lead to the increased usage of haloperidol as a first line agent in the treatment of prolonged headaches presenting to the ED.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Haloperidol vs. Metoclopramide for Treatment of Acute Headaches and Migraines in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At this time, choice of medications for the treatment of headaches in the ED is still based on personal and patient preferences because no properly constructed trials have been carried out that would allow identification of a superior agent. Metoclopramide (Reglan) is a common agent used for relief of headaches in the ED. Uncontrolled studies have shown successful relief of migraine with metoclopramide of 75%. Further studies have reported success rate of 67% with IV metoclopramide. In this study the investigators seek to explore another option for treatment of headaches in the ED, one that may be more efficacious and efficient. Haloperidol (Haldol), a butyrophenone class of medication, is thought to act by affecting the dopamine 2 receptor in the brain. These receptors are relatively abundant in the brainstem nuclei and sympathetic ganglia and nerves, through which they may regulate autonomic visceral, gastrointestinal, and hemodynamic responses frequently associated with migraine. One study, demonstrated that 4 out of 5 patients felt significant relief in pain intensity with the use of haloperidol, even when other medications had failed. Relapses were rare, and several patients reported that haloperidol interrupted the prolonged, intractable migraine spiral they had suffered for days. Furthermore, a case series of six cases of migraine treated with 5mg of haloperidol IV after a 500 to 1000ml bolus of IV fluids reported complete or substantial relief within 25 to 65 minutes and side effects were reported as minimal. The investigators hypothesize that Haloperidol is more efficacious than metoclopramide in the treatment of an acute headache or migraine in the ED in regard to a self-reported pain rating scale (Numeric Pain Intensity Scale), need for additional medication, emergency department return rates, and resolution of symptoms.</detailed_description>
