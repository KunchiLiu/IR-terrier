	<brief_summary>Lifestyle strategies that include dietary modification, such as consumption of a plant-based diet, are well recognized in disease prevention and may improve type 2 diabetes. Various components of a plant-based diet may contribute to its beneficial health effects, but there has been keen interest in the possibility that plant polyphenols may have a role. Blueberries are dietary sources of polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins. To date there are few human clinical trials evaluating the beneficial health effects of blueberries in populations with type 2 diabetes. The objective of the study is to determine if freeze-dried blueberries compared to a blueberry placebo will improve cardiometabolic parameters in men with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
