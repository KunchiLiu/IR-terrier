	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy or Conservative Treatment in the Acute Cholecystitis of Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increasing age is one of the main risk factors for developing complicated gallstone disease. Currently, there is lack of good quality studies comparing risks and benefits of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the elderly patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the only curative treatment for gallstone disease of acute calculous cholecystitis. Aim: The purpose is to find out the most effective treatment (laparoscopic cholecystectomy vs. conservative) with the least morbidity for elderly patients with acute cholecystitis. Study design: multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patient allocation: Elderly patients with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis will be randomly allocated to either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or treatment with antibiotics. Reasonably healthy elderly patients (ASA 2-3) are included in this study, excluding the patients with ASA-class above 4. Interventions: The study group of patients will undergo early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 48 hours after hospitalization. The other group will be managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and elective cholecystectomy will not be scheduled later. Primary outcome: Assessment of morbidities and individual quality of life. Secondary outcomes include number of hospital admissions, length of hospitalization, pain, complications, mortality and cost analysis. Sample size and data-analysis: Based on data of previous studies the recruitment of 200 patients in total is expected. Follow-up will be for 12 months.</detailed_description>
