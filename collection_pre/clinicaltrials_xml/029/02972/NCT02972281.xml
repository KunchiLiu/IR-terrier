	<brief_summary>Antibody deficiencies and complement deficiencies are the most frequent Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) in adults, and are associated with greatly increased susceptibility to recurrent and/or severe bacterial infections - especially upper and lower respiratory tract infections and meningitis. The literature data suggest that PIDs are under-diagnosed in adults. The current European and US guidelines advocate screening adults for PIDs if they present recurrent benign especially upper and lower respiratory tract infections, or if they have experienced at least two severe bacterial infections and/or have a recurrent need for intravenous antibiotics. The objective of the demonstrate the interest of PIDs screening in adult patients who present such recurrent infections and/or after the first severe bacterial infection, especially when the patients do not present with known, etiologically relevant comorbidities.</brief_summary>
