	<brief_title>Goal Achievement After a Change to Vortioxetine in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested to treat depression in people who have major depressive disorder. This study will look at effectiveness of treatment with vortioxetine in participant's goal achievement for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The study will enroll approximately 120 patients. Participants will receive: • Vortioxetine 10 to 20 mg All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study. The participants will receive a starting dose of 10 mg. The dose may be up-titrated to 20 mg. The dose may then be decreased by 5 mg based on participant's response and tolerability to higher dose as judged by the Investigator. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Unites States. The overall time to participate in this study is 19 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone for 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
