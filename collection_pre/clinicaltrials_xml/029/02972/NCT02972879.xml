	<brief_title>Therapeutic Modalities Versus Corticosteroid Injection for Trigger Finger: A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are several forms of nonsurgical treatment for trigger finger, the most used are: - Oral nonsteroidal and steroidal antiinflammatory's drugs use to resolve the inflammatory process - Corticosteroids local injection: that proposes to control the inflammation, these injections have shown good effectiveness for trigger finger treatment. - Orthotic: with the aim of to immobilize the affected joint until the resolution of the inflammatory process. - Electrotherapeutic modalities: - Paraffin that increases cellular metabolism and promotes peripheral vasodilatation, favoring the transduction tissue fluid, lymph flow, hyperemia and consequent absorption of exsudato. - Therapeutic Ultrasound (US) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing edema, improving cellular metabolism, and proliferation of precursor cells and fibroblasts. Although the non-surgical treatment is often used there is no evidence in the literature of which is the most effective conservative treatment for trigger finger. Thus, it is necessary use appropriate methodology to define the benefits and harms of each treatment modality and assess the effectiveness of these nonsurgical treatments, and may define which one has a higher resolution and lower rates of trigger finger recurrences in short, medium and long term.</detailed_description>
