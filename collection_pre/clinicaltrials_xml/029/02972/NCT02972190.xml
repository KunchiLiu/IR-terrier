	<brief_summary>Laminectomy with PLIF has been shown to achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes, but it leads to potential adverse consequences associated with extensive disruption of posterior bony and soft-tissue structures. The investigators plan to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of bilateral decompression with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and laminectomy with posterior lumbar interbody fusion in the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis.</brief_summary>
