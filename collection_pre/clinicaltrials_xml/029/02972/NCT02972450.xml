	<brief_title>An HIV Vaccine Trial in Individuals Who Started ART During Primary or Chronic Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EVHA T01 is an international, multicentre, double-blind study which will be a two-arm prospective 1:1 randomisation comparing active vaccines with placebo control. Randomisation will be stratified according to the stage of infection when antiretroviral therapy (cART) was commenced either during primary infection or chronic infection. Screening will take place during the 6 weeks prior to randomisation. Eligible participants will be enrolled at week 0 and randomised to either vaccine or placebo. They will continue on cART during the 12 week vaccination period and for 12 weeks beyond. Treatment will then be interrupted and resumed when the viral load rebounds to 10,000 or more copies/ml, or the CD4 falls to 350 or less cells/mm3, or there is evidence of disease progression, or they have completed 24 weeks interruption.</detailed_description>
