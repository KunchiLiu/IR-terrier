	<brief_summary>There is growing awareness that environmental factors, behaviors and diet are intimately related to patient health and may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of glaucoma. Evidence from recent years has shown that some behaviors and environmental factors can affect the intraocular pressure, the primary risk factor for glaucoma. This study aims to investigate whether simple and common lifestyle inteventions such as sleeping with a head elevation, a high fiber diet, moderate aerobic exercise and moderation in caffeine intake could affect intraocular pressure and other outcomes.</brief_summary>
