	<brief_summary>Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a frequently performed test for the diagnosis and/or exclusion of coronary artery disease (CAD) in appropriately selected patients. The performance of non-contrast computed tomography for the detection and quantification of coronary calcification is typically performed prior to CCTA in an effort to identify significant calcification which may influence subsequent data acquisition during the CCTA. However, performance of calcium scoring adds significant radiation and most coronary calcification is proximal in its location, potentially visualized using a focused non-contrast scan. The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the usefulness of a modified non-contrast CT, using a significantly shorter scan length and lower radiation parameters, as compared to standard coronary artery calcium scanning for the detection of coronary calcification that may influence subsequent CCTA performance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Consenting adult patients ≥ 50 years of age; 2. Suspected but without known prior history of CAD. Prior CAD is defined as a history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or ≥ 50% coronary lumen stenosis on prior coronary angiography 3. Scheduled for nonemergent clinically indicated coronary CT angiography 1. Prior coronary bypass graft (CABG) surgery 2. Suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (MI or unstable angina) 3. Known complex congenital heart disease 4. Evidence of ongoing or active clinical instability, including chest pain (sudden onset); cardiogenic shock; unstable blood pressure with systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg; and severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV); or acute pulmonary embolism 5. Atrial fibrillation 6. Abnormal renal function (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min; Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL) 7. Concomitant participation in another clinical trial in which patient is subject to investigation drug or device 8. Pregnancy or unknown pregnancy status 9. Allergy to iodinated contrast agent 10. Contraindications to nitroglycerin 11. Unwilling or unable to give consent 12. Inability to comply with study procedures 13.
