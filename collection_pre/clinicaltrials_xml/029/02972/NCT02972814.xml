	<brief_summary>The investigators prospectively want to compare 3 clinical tests for measuring blood troponin levels in patients presenting to the emergency room with thoracic pain probably related to a myocardial infarction with regard to the time necessary to obtain the test results. The tests are one laboratory based test and two point of care tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time Gain in the Diagnosis Myocardial Infarction by Troponin Point of Care Testing in the Emergency Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracic pain can be caused by a myocardial infarction. The diagnosis of a myocardial infarction can be made by an ECG (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI). However, some myocardial infarctions can also occur without ST-elevations on the ECG (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-STEMI). In the latter case, a quick acquisition of blood troponin levels is necessary to coin the diagnosis and initiate treatment. Therefore, the investigators prospectively want to compare 3 clinical tests for measuring blood troponin levels in patients presenting to the emergency room with thoracic pain probably related to a non-STEMI with regard to the time necessary to obtain the test results. The 3 tests are: 1. A laboratory based test: Roche Cobas E 602 2. A point of care test: Radiometer AQT 90 Flex 3. A point of care test: Philips Minicare I-20 The measured timeframe is the time between venipuncture to the point the test results are known.</detailed_description>
