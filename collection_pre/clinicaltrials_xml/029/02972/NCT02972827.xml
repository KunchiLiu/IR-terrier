	<brief_summary>Comparison of noninvasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM, Cheetah Medical) with Edwards FloTrac minimally-invasive cardiac output monitor in predicting fluid responsiveness in sepsis and septic shock.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Devices in Prediction of Fluid Responsiveness in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study will evaluate ability of passive leg raise test to predict fluid responsiveness in patients in septic shock, on vasopressors, using both the NICOM and FloTrac devices. An increase in CI, SVI, or Pulse Pressure of &gt;10% in response to the passive leg raise will be considered a positive passive leg raise test, and the same indicators will be considered a significant response to a fluid challenge with either crystalloids or colloids.Each device will be evaluated independently, but simultaneously.</detailed_description>
