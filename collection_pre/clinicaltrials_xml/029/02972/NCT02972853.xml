	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to 1) determine whether Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (see study "MINDFUL-PC: Integrating Mindfulness Into the Patient-Centered Medical Home - A Pilot Study") improves chronic disease management and 2) changes brain activation in neuroimaging tasks before compared to after the training. Neuroimaging fMRI tasks probe mechanisms related to self-regulation, such as attention/inhibition, emotion regulation, self-compassion, interoception and pain regulation. The study will also look at whether successful chronic disease management relates to the observed brain activation changes after compared to before the mindfulness intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindful Self-Regulation fMRI Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to test brain activation changes related to potential self-regulation targets (attention/inhibition, emotion regulation, self-compassion, interoception and pain regulation) that are influenced by mindfulness training within primary care (compare Mindful-PC study). The study will also look at whether successful chronic disease self-efficacy relates to the observed brain activation changes after compared to before the mindfulness intervention. The study will examine the relationship between mindfulness training within primary care and medical regimen adherence (initiation and maintenance) as well as the underlying neural correlates associated with changes in self-regulation. This is a single-arm pilot trial, recruiting from a randomized controlled trial (see Mindful-PC study). Following the completion of this pilot trial, the study will be modified to include the most promising self-regulation targets, and will be integrated into a subsequent study (with a different clinicaltrials.gov ID #) which will test changes in brain activity related to this intervention in a controlled trial with a larger sample.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults 2160 years old enrolled for participation in the MINDFULPC study. During baseline visit, patient has a history of either major depressive disorder, dysthymia, or generalized anxiety disorder, OR has current mild to moderate symptoms of depression (score range of 1020 on DASS21 Depression subscale) or anxiety (score &gt;7 on DASS21 anxiety subscale). Participant does not have a substance use disorder nor intoxication at the time of scanning. Participants must report no more than infrequent recreational cannabis use (i.e., no more than two times a month) and must report capacity for abstinence from both cannabis and ethyl alcohol for the 72 hours prior to the scan. Normal or correctedtonormal vision, and correction must be with contact lenses. Righthanded as defined by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Current severe panic disorder, active severe PTSD symptoms, or psychosis. Current suicidality OR severe depression as evidenced by a score of 20 or higher on the DASS21 Depression subscale. Standard direct exclusion criteria for undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures for research purposes (safety standards), i.e., Meniere's disease, epilepsy, strong claustrophobia, currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to conceive or breastfeed during the study, cardiac pacemaker, prosthetic heart valve, neurostimulator, implanted pumps, nonMRcompatible implants or devices. A history of neurological disease or injury, including a history of seizures or significant head trauma (i.e., extended loss of consciousness, neurological sequelae, or known structural brain lesion), or previous brain surgery. Severe skin disease, skin allergies, or multiple reactions to topical preparations, dressings or tapes. Current meditation or intense yoga practice or extensive previous experience. Participants with vascular disease, such as peripheral vascular disease, varicose veins, or lymphedema, in both lower limbs.</criteria>
