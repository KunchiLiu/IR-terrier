	<brief_title>Transbronchial Ablation for Peripheral Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navigation bronchoscopy guided transbronchial ablation for treating inoperable patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer . The study is designed as a single-center prospective trial. The participating centers are Department of pulmonary medicine and endoscope, Shanghai Chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Patients are divided into two groups, including radiofrequency ablation group and microwave ablation group.Eighty patients are expected to be enrolled into the study with 40 patients in each group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients discovered with peripheral lung nodules that have demonstrated to be nonsmall cell lung cancer by pathology with the clinical stage of IA. 2. The tumors are solid or partsolid peripheral lung nodules and the lengthdiameter of the nodules are more than 8mm and no more than 30mm. 3. Patients are unsuitable for surgery assessed by multimodality treatment and agree to the primary treatment of ablation. 4. Patients have good compliance and sign the informed consent. 1. Patients cannot receive bronchoscopy for the severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and other indications. 2. Patients have contraindications of general anesthesia. 3. Chest CT suggests that navigation bronchoscopy technology cannot guide treatment equipment to reach the peripheral lung lesion. 4. Chest CT or bronchoscopy shows that the bronchial lumen occlusion or deformation leading to the guided and treatment equipment cannot reach the peripheral lung lesion. 5. There are large blood vessels or important structures adjacent to peripheral lung lesion. 6. Researchers consider the patient do not fit for the study.</criteria>
