	<brief_title>Chemoradiation Versus Esophagectomy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: More than half of global esophageal cancer cases came from China, but the report about definitive chemoradiation (CRT) compared with esophagectomy in Chinese patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is limited. Aim: to compare outcomes in Chinese patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell cancer who have received either surgery or definitive chemoradiation (CRT). Methods: 176 ESCC patients with T1bN+M0, T2-4aN0-2M0 will be randomized to CRT group or Surgery group.In the CRT group, patients will be given intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) with 50Gy/25 fractions , and current chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) basic regimens. In the surgery group, patients will received standard esophagectomy. 5 years follow-up for both groups patients. Primary endpoints: 2 year and 5 year Disease free survival, Overall survival Second endpoints: treatment-related adverse events; the quality of life</detailed_description>
