	<brief_summary>Levels of overweight and obesity have reached alarming proportions in Qatar and other Gulf nations. In Qatar, the need to establish national strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity has been recognized in the new Qatar National Health Strategy 2011-2016, which stresses the need for prevention. In fact, the Qatar National Nutrition and Physical Activity Action Plan 2011-2016 calls for nutrition and physical activity interventions for the prevention of obesity and related chronic diseases such as diabetes. The treatment and prevention of childhood obesity is largely through lifestyle changes- encouraging health eating and physical activity and discouraging sedentary behavior. However, changing such behaviors is complex and requires a combination of integrated approaches to tackle such a multifaceted problem. Herein, the investigators set out to implement and evaluate a novel weight management program for Qatari school children at the vulnerable age of 9-12 years. The project incorporates a cognitive-behavioral approach that involves developing social and emotional competences, promotion healthy dietary habits, development of physical literacy, and use of activity monitoring devices to promote increased activity while enlisting family involvement in an attempt to maintain weight loss in the long term. This project seeks to also take things further by integrating a range of interventions that use cutting edge insights from the behavioral sciences through the use of MINDSPACE approach (MINDSPACE: Messenger, Incentive, Norms, Default, Salience, Priming, Affect, Commitment, Ego) in conjunction with technology tools for monitoring activity and providing ongoing support through the use of social media. The intervention involves a multi-cohort intervention involving 500 Qatari children over 5 years to be conducted in three phases (1) intensive weight loss camps, (2) after-school clubs as supplement/consolidation, and (3) maintenance through web and social/family support.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adapted Cognitive Behavioral Approach to Addressing Overweight and Obesity Among Qatari Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific objectives of the project are to: 1. Adapt and pilot a school-based intervention that combines behavioral and cognitive approaches to promote healthy lifestyle among 9-12 year old children in select Qatari schools in the first year; 2. Integrate behavioral economics and cognitive behavioral therapy (MINDSPACE) in a multi-cohort prevention/intervention study targeting at risk Qatari school children at the vulnerable age range of 9-12; 3. Select and use technological tools for enhanced outcomes and adoption of the intervention nationally; 4. Package study findings into a lifestyle change intervention for national implementation in collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation and the Supreme Education Council. Data from this project could provide the basis for a national program to stem the rise of obesity in Qatar through lifestyle changes and reduce related health conditions.</detailed_description>
