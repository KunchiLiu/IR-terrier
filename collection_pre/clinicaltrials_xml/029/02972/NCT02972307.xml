	<brief_summary>There has been only minimal research on wheelchair skills by the caregivers of manual or powered wheelchair. There are no published data on the extent to which caregivers can enhance the mobility of powered wheelchair users. The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that caregivers enhance the wheelchair skills capacity, confidence and performance of the powered wheelchair users to whom they provide assistance. Our secondary objective is to add to the literature on the measurement properties of the wheelchair skills test (questionnaire and capability version) for powered wheelchair users and their caregivers.</brief_summary>
