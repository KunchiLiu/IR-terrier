	<brief_title>A Comparison of Two Thoracic Manipulation Techniques to Improve Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted at the Musculoskeletal clinical facility in the Dept. of Physical Therapy and Athletic Training, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff AZ. The investigators aim to test a maximum of 76 participants in this study. A phone screening will determine initial eligibility. If the participant meets the inclusion criteria and is not excluded after the phone screen, an appointment will be scheduled. Final eligibility will be determined in the initial session after the participant completes the outcome measures and is evaluated by a licensed physical therapist. Participants will be involved in the study over a 4 week period. Each participant will be asked to attend 4 sessions, with one week in between each session as follows: Week 0 = baseline assessment and treatment 1; Week 1= treatment 2; Week 2 = treatment 3; and week 4 = follow-up assessment. After completion of the baseline assessment, qualified participants will be randomly assigned to either a supine or prone thoracic spine thrust manipulation intervention.</detailed_description>
