	<brief_summary>More than 1.5 million HIV-infected women become pregnant each year. Approximately half have access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but all are at increased risk of preterm birth (PTB). Vaginal progesterone (VP) is a promising and cost-effective intervention to prevent PTB that should be studied in this high-risk population. This pilot study will provide critical insight into the feasibility of a phase III trial by determining whether women are willing to participate, to adhere to study drug, and to complete follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of Vaginal Progesterone to Reduce HIV-Associated Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a mixed method study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a trial of VP to prevent PTB among HIV-infected Zambian women. To assess the feasibility of a full-scale clinical trial, the investigators will implement a pilot two-arm, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of VP among HIV-infected women in antenatal care in Lusaka, Zambia. Participants will be randomly assigned to either daily self-administered VP or indistinguishable placebo prior to 24 weeks gestational age. In this pilot study, the investigators will be able to estimate study uptake, adherence to study product and protocol, and study retention. To assess the acceptability of a trial to test VP among HIV-infected women in Zambia, the investigators will employ a qualitative approach of longitudinal semi-structured interviews among women agreeing to trial participation and one-time semi-structured interviews (SSIs) among those who decline to participate.</detailed_description>
