	<brief_title>Ph1b Study of Oraxol in Comb. w. Ramucirumab in Patients w. Gastric, Gastro-esophageal, or Esophageal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a sequential-group, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral Oraxol in combination with intravenous ramucirumab. After a screening period of up to 28 days subjects will be enrolled into the treatment phase of the study. Each cycle of therapy will last 4 weeks. Subjects may continue in the study until they experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Three to six subjects will be enrolled at each dose level. Once the tolerability of a dose level has been determined, an additional 3-6 subjects may be enrolled at a higher dose level, to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Safety will be monitored through recording of adverse events, serious adverse events, monitoring of laboratory tests including hematology, blood chemistry, urinalyses, physical examinations and electrocardiograms. Subjects will undergo radiographic assessments for tumor response at specified time points. Blood samples will also be obtained in the first cycle of therapy at multiple time points for determination of the amount of paclitaxel and metabolites and HM30181 in the circulation. After the treatment period, there will be a follow-up period during which the subject or family may be contacted every three months for follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study: 1. Signed written informed consent 2. ≥18 years of age 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced stage gastric, gastroesophageal, or esophageal cancers in whom ramucirumab and paclitaxel are reasonable treatments 4. Have documented testing for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2neu) overexpressing, and for those with tumors overexpressing HER2neu, have documented progression on Trastuzumabcontaining therapy 5. Measurable disease on computed tomography (CT) scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis per RECIST v1.1 criteria 6. Able to swallow oral medication as an intact dosage form 7. Adequate hematologic status as demonstrated by not requiring transfusion support or granulocytecolony stimulating factor (GCSF) to maintain: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500 cells/mm3, Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L, Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL 8. Adequate liver function as demonstrated by: Total bilirubin of ≤1.5 mg/dL or ≤2.0 mg/dL for subjects with liver metastasis, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤5 x ULN if liver metastasis is present, Alkaline phosphatase ≤3 x ULN or ≤5 x ULN if bone or liver metastasis is present 9. Adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance calculation ≥60 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula 10. Normal prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 11. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 12. Life expectancy of at least 3 months 13. Women must be postmenopausal (&gt;12 months without menses) or surgically sterile (ie, by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy) or must be using effective contraception (ie, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, double barrier method of condom and spermicide) and agree to continue use of contraception for 30 days after their last dose of study drug 14. Sexually active male subjects must use a barrier method of contraception during the study and agree to continue the use of male contraception for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study: 1. Unresolved toxicity from previous anticancer treatments, including investigational products (subjects must have recovered all unacceptable toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] toxicity). This does not extend to symptoms or findings that are attributable to the underlying disease 2. Received investigational products within 14 days or 5 halflives of the first study dosing day, whichever is longer 3. Are currently receiving other medications or radiation intended for the treatment of their malignancy 4. Central nervous system metastases, including leptomeningeal involvement 5. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding 6. Currently taking a concomitant medication, other than a premedication, that is: A known Pglycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitor or inducer. Subjects who are taking such medications but who are otherwise eligible may be enrolled if they discontinue the medication ≥1 week before dosing An oral medication with a narrow therapeutic index known to be a Pgp substrate within 24 hours prior to start of dosing in the study Medications known to be clinically significant inhibitors (eg. gemfibrozil) or inducers (eg. rifampin) of CYP2C8 or medications known to be strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (eg. ketoconazole) or inducers (eg. rifampin or St. John's Wort). Subjects who are currently taking such medications but who are otherwise eligible may be enrolled if they discontinue the medication 1 week before dosing and remain off that medication during treatment with Oraxol. 7. Require therapeutic use of anticoagulants other than daily aspirin or low molecular weight heparin 8. Require therapeutic use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 9. Unable to receive iv contrast for required CT scans 10. Systolic blood pressure &gt;140mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg 11. Grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 3 months prior to screening 12. Arterial thromboembolic event including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months of enrollment 13. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus which require use of oral anticoagulants or, if on low molecular weight heparin, have not been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks 14. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, poorly controlled diabetes or diabetes with established vascular complications, chronic pulmonary disease requiring oxygen, known bleeding disorders, or any concomitant illness or social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements 15. Major surgery to the upper GI tract, or have a history of GI disease or other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with oral drug absorption 16. History of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel, not attributed to a hypersensitivity type reaction to Cremophor®, or history of hypersensitivity type reaction to polysorbate 80 or other components of the formulation of Oraxol 17. History of developing any condition during prior treatment with ramucirumab for which ramucirumab must be permanently discontinued according to the ramucirumab label.</criteria>
