	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Eyetronix Flicker Glasses to the Treatment of Anisometropic Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 176 children with anisometropic amblyopia, aged 4 to 13 years, will randomize to receive patching or Eyetronix Flicker Glasses treatment in a 1:1 ratio.Eyetronix Flicker Glasses, a lightweight spectacle frame with liquid crystal lenses that provide direct square-wave alternating occlusion, will be used at a pre-programmed temporal frequency. Patching is a traditional treatment of amblyopia. The best corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, binocular function,visual evoked potential and functional MRI will be measured at baseline and follow-up visits to assess the improvement of amblyopia.Feedback information from the questionnaires will be used to evaluate the compliance and adverse effects.</detailed_description>
