	<brief_summary>This is an investigation of adult individuals with epilepsy, and involves educational and behavioral interventions intended to enhance treatment adherence and self-management. The investigators are adapting a self-management intervention that they developed in a previous study to individuals with epilepsy and a history of negative health events (NHEs), such as accidents and emergency department (ED) visits, diminished quality of life and poor mental well-being. The intervention "Self-management for people with epilepsy and a history of negative health events (SMART)" is intended to reduce NHEs and improve quality of life in people with epilepsy associated with historically disadvantaged groups.</brief_summary>
