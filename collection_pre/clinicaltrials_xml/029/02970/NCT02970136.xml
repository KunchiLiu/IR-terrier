	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine the best way to increase screening for cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, HIV, and Hepatitis C among underscreened Hispanic, Haitian and African-American individuals in Hialeah, South Dade, and Little Haiti. The investigator will compare home testing led by a community health worker (CHW) versus clinic testing guided by a CHW. Community Health Workers are people who have undergone several weeks of community outreach and health education training. During the study period the participant will continue to receive all of their regular medical care from their regular health care providers. If the participant does not have a health care provider, the Community Health Workers would be able to help in referring the participant for care at a local health care clinic located in their community.</brief_summary>
