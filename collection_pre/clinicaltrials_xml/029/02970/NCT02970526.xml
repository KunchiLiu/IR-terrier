	<brief_summary>This project will evaluate the neurotoxic effects of oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is considered the most neurotoxic chemotherapy, and at the origin of peripheral neuropathies. These neuropathies remain a problem in oncology because currently no prevention strategy has proved effective and only duloxetine seems to have a therapeutic benefit in improving symptoms. In the case of oxaliplatin, neuropathy forced oncologists to reduce the dose or to stop the chemotherapy, potentially degrading the oncological prognosis. Objective of this study will be to assess, on a large number of patients (n&gt; 500) who completed adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), the intensity of neuropathic disorders out of 5 years after the end of chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study should enable an assessment of the relationship between the intensity of neuropathy and comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression and health related quality of life of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Effect of Oxaliplatin Treatment in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin remains the reference treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and more broadly of digestive cancers, incorporated in the FOLFOX protocol (folinic acid, 5-Fu, Oxaliplatin). But oxaliplatin chemotherapy is certainly the most neurotoxic, as on average 90% of patients develop acute neuropathic disorders (within hours or days of the infusion) and 30% to 50% of patients develop a chronic neuropathy with repeated cycles of chemotherapy. The neuropathic grade and duration of symptoms remain variable across studies. Although symptoms improve with time, long-term studies suggest a persistent neuropathy beyond 24 months. Moreover, Vatandoust and colleagues suggest that chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is more frequent and severe over the long term (≥ 12 months) than in previous works published. In cancer survivors, neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin has a deleterious impact on their quality of life. But, few studies are available on the consequences of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in these patients, while these patients remain, in 2003, the third largest group of cancer survivors. Only 7 studies have specifically evaluated neuropathic disorders induced by oxaliplatin after chemotherapy. Moreover, as pointed Vatandoust and colleagues, there is a real need to understand the long term effects of this chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. More specifically, only two studies have evaluated the effects of neuropathy on quality of life and comorbidities of patients. Objective of this study will be to assess, on a large number of patients (n&gt; 500) who completed adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), the intensity of neuropathic disorders out of 5 years after the end of chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study should enable an assessment of the relationship between the intensity of neuropathy and comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression and health related quality of life of patients.</detailed_description>
