All subjects undergo bioelectrical impedance analyses to investigate body composition and magnet resonance imaging to measure fat mass and fat fractions of abdominal organs, at three time points: first before the program, then at the end of the six weeks of formula diet and finally, at the end of the program after 15 weeks. Laboratory data are measured before and after the program.</detailed_description>
