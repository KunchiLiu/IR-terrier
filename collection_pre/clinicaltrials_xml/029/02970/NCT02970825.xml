	<detailed_description>The investigators wish to document the benefit of an intensive exercise program in youth with the aim to identify the most effective programs that can improve psychological well-being, especially reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and improving self-esteem. This study targets participants aged 9 to 30 years and included in an education program (from 4th Grade to undergraduate university or college). The investigators propose to perform a prospective, randomized, clinical study involving participants with mood disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for medical coding: ICD-10-CM F32.9), anxiety (ICD-10-CM F41.9), specific learning disabilities (ADHD hyperactivity (ICD-10-CM F90.2), dyslexia-dyscalculia-dyspraxia (ICD-10-CM F81.0, F81.2, F81.81)) and healthy subjects equally distributed for confounding variables (age, gender, subclinical depressive symptoms). The participants will be enrolled either in an experimental, intensive aerobic exercise regime or in a active control activity of stretching and relaxation conducted in parallel. The effects of this program will be assessed for i) psychological symptoms, using questionnaires, ii) cognitive function, particularly attention skills and executive functions, in neuropsychological tasks, and iii) physical abilities (through physical testing). To investigate the therapeutic value of exercise in the prevention of depressive and anxiety symptoms and in the treatment of mood disorders in the young student is a necessity imposed by the current outbreak of depression among adolescents and young people at school. To promote the exercise medicine based on the level of evidence in this specific domain, rigorous experimental studies must be performed. Depending on the results, a medical imaging will be proposed to participants at the end of the behavioral study. This will be a functional magnetic resonance imaging in physiological activation condition (performing a behavioral task such as a Stroop task suited to the subject's age), performed before and after intensive physical training.</detailed_description>
