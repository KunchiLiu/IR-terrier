	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of bosentan on the myocardial metabolism and the dependent endothelial coronary vasomotoricity in patients presenting a PAH. Hypothesis : Bosentan may improve right ventricular function by decreasing myocardial stress and glucose metabolism. Patients may benefit from images with 18F-FDG PET / CT and 82Rb PET / CT for an earlier assessment and optimal management of PAH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bosentan in Myocardium Metabolism and Perfusion Measured by 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and Rubidium-82 (82Rb) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CTs) on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) or Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refered to the hospital for a right heart catheterization for a PAH suspected at the echocardiography will be presented with the protocol.If inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled all the procedures will be planned. At the screening visit the patient will have a right heart catheterization and an echocardiography. After a maximum of 4 weeks each patient will have 18F-FDG and 82Rb PET/CTs before start of treatment with Bosentan. These PET/CTs together with an echocardiography will be repeated at 6 and 12 weeks after start of treatment with bosentan. Finally a right heart catheterization will be planned at 12 weeks after start of treatment with bosentan as a routine procedure.</detailed_description>
