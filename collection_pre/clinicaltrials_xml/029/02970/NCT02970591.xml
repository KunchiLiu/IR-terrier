	<brief_summary>Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a common disease to which there is no curable treatment. Diet is considered to trigger symptoms associated with the clinical picture of IBS, and dietary treatment is thus believed to relieve the symptoms of IBS. As the disease is very heterogeneous in its manifestation, different treatment options might be indicated depending on the predominant symptom. To investigate the response to different dietary treatment options, a randomized controlled intervention trial will be carried out in adult patients (&gt;18 y) with IBS according to Rome III criteria. The aim of this study is to compare the response to two different dietary treatments or optimized medical treatment.</brief_summary>
