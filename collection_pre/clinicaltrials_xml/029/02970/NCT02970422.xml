	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to distribute a questionnaire created for individuals living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to assess their activities, participation, and healthcare and COPD-related research priorities. The data collected will be compared across diagnosed COPD stages and disease severity to determine the extent to which adults with COPD participate in the listed activities and identify their primary research and healthcare related priorities. The questionnaire was originally developed based on past research then verified by a panel of COPD and participation experts; as well as, individuals living with COPD in the form of focus groups. The questionnaire will now be administered to 200 individuals living COPD (50 in each GOLD stage) at three sites across Montreal where clinical data for each participant will be available. This phase will help establish the reliability of the questionnaire.</brief_summary>
