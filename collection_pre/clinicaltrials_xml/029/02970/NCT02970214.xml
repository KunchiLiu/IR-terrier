	<brief_summary>Follow-up of two hospital-based patient cohorts (heart failure, metabolic comorbidities in CVD), recruited at baseline by the GANI_MED-project (Greifswald Approach to Individualized Medicine). Standardized protocols will be used for the assessment of medical history, laboratory biomarkers, and the collection of various biosamples for bio-banking purposes. Comparisons with the general background population will be performed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>5-year follow-up of two hospital-based patient cohorts (heart failure, metabolic comorbidities in CVD), recruited at baseline by the GANI_MED-project (Greifswald Approach to Individualized Medicine). Subjects will be comprehensively phenotypes using standardized protocols for the assessment of medical history, laboratory biomarkers, and the collection of various biosamples for bio-banking purposes. A multi-omics based biomarker assessment including genome-wide genotyping, transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome analyses complements the multi-level approach of GANI_MED. Comparisons with the general background population as characterized by the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) will be performed.</detailed_description>
