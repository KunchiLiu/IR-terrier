	<brief_summary>Participants with a traumatic sensory nerve injury in the hand will be recruited to the study. Participants found to have a nerve gap of at least 5 mm and no greater than 20mm will undergo repair with the Polynerve. Participants will be followed up regularly, observed for device-related complications and to assess the return of sensory innervation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial of a Novel Synthetic Polymer Nerve Conduit 'Polynerve' in Participants With Sensory Digital Nerve Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral nerve injuries are a common occurrence, with approximately 9000 cases in the United Kingdom (UK) occurring each year. Most are in a predominantly young and working population. Where surgical reconstruction is required to repair the peripheral nerve injury, techniques employed have changed little in the last 50-60 years with many factors influencing the outcomes, such as age of patient, timing, level and extent of injury, method of repair and the surgeon's skill . Despite advances in microsurgical nerve repair techniques, functional recovery is often poor e.g. resulting impaired hand sensation, reduced motor function and frequent pain and cold intolerance. This can have a profound and permanent impact on the patient's recovery and subsequent quality of life. Nerve repair has significant health, social and cost implications with the treatment and rehabilitation of an employed person, estimated to be EUR 51,238. Peripheral nerve injury usually presents with nerve stumps that can be approximated in surgical repair: direct, end-to-end suture repair of the epineurium (neurorrhaphy). Excessive tension over the suture line leads to poor results; therefore when the nerve stumps cannot be approximated without tension, an alternative surgical method is required. Where the nerve gap exceeds more than 5 mm, there are two fundamental options, either 'nerve grafting' or 'tubulisation' using a bridging material. This trial will examine the first-in-man use of a new nerve conduit device 'Polynerve' to repair small nerve gaps in digital sensory nerves of the hand. Polynerve is a degradable co-polymer of Poly Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) and Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLA) which is shaped as a cylinder with a novel internal lumen consisting of a specific micro-grooved architecture.</detailed_description>
