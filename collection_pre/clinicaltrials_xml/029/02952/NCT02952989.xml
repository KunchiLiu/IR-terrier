	<brief_title>A Safety Study of SGN-2FF for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the safety profile of SGN-2FF given orally to patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients may continue treatment until progression of their disease or intolerable side effects. The primary goal of the study is to identify the optimal biological dose that does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of SGN-2FF will also be evaluated in the study.</detailed_description>
