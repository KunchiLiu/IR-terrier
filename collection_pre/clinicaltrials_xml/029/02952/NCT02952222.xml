	<brief_title>The Synergistic Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Propofol for Sedation for Pediatric Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both propofol and dexmedetomidine may be used to achieve adequate sedation conditions. Propofol has been described to produce successful conditions for completion of the intended study in almost 99% of the patients. However, in a study that reviewed outcomes when using propofol for almost 50,000 pediatric procedures, propofol was associated with stridor, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, wheezing or central apnea at a rate of 1 in 65 sedations. The need for airway and ventilation interventions which include oral/nasal airway placement, positive pressure mask ventilation and tracheal intubation occurred at a rate of 1 in 70 sedations. Hemodynamic and respiratory fluctuations of a minimum of 30% fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure or respiratory rate occurred at a rate of 1 in 165 sedations. Another recent study cited similar incidences of hemodynamic variability with propofol as well as inhalational anesthesia in the outpatient pediatric setting. Until 2015, dexmedetomidine had been one of the standard drugs administered for sedation in children who require radiologic diagnostic imaging studies (MRI, CT and Nuclear Medicine) in the Department of Radiology at BCH. Over 17,000 infants, children and developmentally compromised young adults had been sedated with dexmedetomidine in BCH without a cardiac or respiratory arrest, or a need to provide positive pressure assisted ventilation. This study will determine if administration of dexmedetomidine with propofol administration will result in lower doses of the latter, which may mean safer outcomes in sedation for upper and lower endoscopic procedures.</detailed_description>
