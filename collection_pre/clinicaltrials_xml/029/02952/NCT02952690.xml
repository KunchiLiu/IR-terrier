	<brief_title>Clinical Comparison of Different Stylet Angles for Orotracheal Intubation Using GlidescopeÂ® Video Laryngoscope in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric patients aged 1-5 year old are randomly assigned to one of two groups; standard curve (S) and tip-manipulated curve (T) groups. After routine anesthetic induction, endotracheal intubation is performed with GVL. Size of GVL blade is selected according to weight; GVL 0: &lt;1.5kg, GVL 1:1.5-3.6kg, GVL 2: 1.8-10kg, GVL 2.5: 10-28kg). Before intubation, stylet curve is differently manipulated according to group. The style is curved in accordance with the curve of GVL blade in S group, whereas the distal tip of style is additionally bended to the left (15-20 degree) in T group. Time from visualization of glottis with GVL to approaching of endotracheal tube to glottis, and time to completion of intubation are measured. In addition, the easiness of intubation is assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (0: extremely easy, 10: extremely difficult) and will be compared in both groups.</detailed_description>
