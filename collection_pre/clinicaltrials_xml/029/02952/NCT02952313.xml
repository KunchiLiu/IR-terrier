	<brief_title>Spirox Latera™ Implant Support of Lateral Nasal Wall Cartilage (LATERAL-OR) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Nasal Obstruction</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. The subject has NOSE Score ≥55. 2. The subject has dynamic lateral nasal wall insufficiency as confirmed by Positive Modified Cottle Maneuver22. 3. The subject is ≥18 years of age. 4. The subject is willing and able to provide informed consent and comply with the study protocol. 5. The subject is seeking treatment for nasal airway obstruction due to Nasal Valve Collapse (NVC) and is willing to undergo nasal Implant procedure alone or with septoplasty and/or a turbinate reduction procedure in an operating room setting. 6. The subject has appropriate nasal and facial anatomy to receive Latera Implant. 7. The subject agrees to followup examinations through twelve (12) months post operatively. 8. The subject has failed a trial of appropriate maximal medical management [e.g., nasal steroids (at least 4 weeks); antihistamines; oral decongestants; nasal strips, stents, or cones]. Failure of maximal medical management may be from lack of effectiveness or inability of subject to tolerate. 1. The subject is having a concurrent Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) or sinuplasty. 2. The subject has had rhinoplasty within the past twelve (12) months. 3. The subject is planning to have other concurrent rhinoplasty procedure. 4. The subject is planning to have other rhinoplasty procedures or will use external dilators within twelve (12) months after the index procedure. 5. The subject has had septoplasty and/or inferior turbinate reduction within the past six (6) months. 6. The subject has, in the view of the clinician, inappropriate fixation on their nasal airway. 7. The subject plans to have any surgical or nonsurgical treatment of their nasal valve, other than the index procedure, within twelve (12) months of the study. 8. The subject has a permanent Implant or dilator in the nasal area. 9. The subject has concomitant inflammatory or infectious skin conditions or unhealed wounds in the treatment area. 10. The subject currently has active nasal vestibulitis. 11. The subject has a history of nasal vasculitis. 12. The subject is a chronic systemic steroid or recreational intranasal drug user. 13. The subject has had a cancerous or precancerous lesion and/or has had radiation exposure in the treatment area or chemotherapy. 14. The subject has polyps or pathology other than septal deviation and/or turbinate hypertrophy and/or lateral wall insufficiency that would contribute to airway obstruction. 15. The subject has a history of a significant bleeding disorder(s) that would prevent healing of the treatment area post procedure. 16. The subject has a known or suspected allergy to PLA or other absorbable materials. 17. The subject has a significant systemic disease such as poorly controlled diabetes which, in the investigator's opinion, could predispose the subject to poor wound healing. 18. The subject is currently using nasal oxygen or CPAP. 19. The subject is not a candidate for procedures conducted under general anesthesia, managed anesthesia care (MAC) or conscious sedation. 20. If female, subject is known or suspected to be pregnant or is lactating.</criteria>
