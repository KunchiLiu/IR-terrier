	<brief_summary>This prospective pilot study will assess the feasibility of remote participant monitoring using digital technology in participants with MS and healthy controls. At the enrollment visit, the participants as well as the healthy controls will be provided with a remote patient monitoring solution which includes preconfigured smartphone and smartwatch. The configured smartphone and smartwatch pair will contain application software that prompts the user to perform various assessments, referred to as active tests and passive monitoring. Active tests will include Hand Motor Function Test (HMFT), gait test, static balance test, electronic version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (eSDMT), Mood Scale Question (MSQ), MS Impact Scale (29-item scale) (MSIS-29) questionnaire, MS Symptom Tracking (MSST). Passive monitoring will be done to collect metrics on gait and mobility throughout the daily life of participants in a continuous and unobtrusive manner.</brief_summary>
