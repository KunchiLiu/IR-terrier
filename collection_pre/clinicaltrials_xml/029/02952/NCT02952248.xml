	<brief_summary>The main objective of the dose-escalation part of the trial is to determine the safety and tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), biomarkers, and efficacy, and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BI 754091 on the basis of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients with selected advanced solid malignancies. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAE), and laboratory parameter abnormalities, as well as changes to vital signs. Secondary objectives are the determination of the PK profile of BI 754091 after single and multiple doses of BI 754091, and the preliminary assessment of antitumour activity. In the dose-expansion part of the trial, the main objectives are to further assess the safety, efficacy, PK profile, and biomarkers of BI 754091 at the RP2D.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Provision of signed and dated, written Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any trialspecific procedures, sampling, or analyses. If a patient declines to participate in the voluntary pharmacogenetics component of the trial, he/she will not be excluded from other aspects of the trial. Patients ≥18 years of age at the time of signature of the ICF Phase Ia (doseescalation) patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic solid tumours (any type). Phase Ib (dose expansion patients with a confirmed diagnosis of select advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic solid tumours (Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, Triple Negative Breast Cancer, and Renal Cell Carcinoma). All patients must have measurable lesions according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 and ImmuneRelated Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (irRECIST). Patients who are antiPD1 naïve but have failed conventional treatment (excluding antiPD1 treatment), or for whom no therapy of proven efficacy exists, or who are not amenable to standard therapies. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score: 0 to 1 For the Phase Ib doseexpansion portion: patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST criteria, must have at least 1 tumour lesion amenable to biopsy, and must be medically fit and willing to undergo a biopsy before first treatment and, unless clinically contraindicated, after 6 weeks on therapy. Patients in the Phase Ia portion may agree to have optional paired biopsies. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks after the start of the treatment according to the Investigator's judgement Females of childbearing potential willing to use adequate contraceptive measures from the time of screening until 6 months after trial discontinuation, who are not or will not be breast feeding, and agree to have pregnancy tests prior to the start of dosing and at regular visits during the trial. Females not of childbearing potential must have evidence of such by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening: Postmenopausal: defined as more than 50 yearsofage and amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not tubal ligation. Women under 50 yearsofage would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following the cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments, and have serum folliclestimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution. For women of childbearing potential using a contraceptive pill, an additional barrier method is necessary. A list of adequate contraception methods is provided in the patient information. Male patients must be willing to use barrier contraception (i.e., condoms) for the duration of the trial and for 6 months after trial treatment discontinuation. Exclusion criteria: Major surgery (major according to the Investigator's assessment) performed within 12 weeks prior to first trial treatment or planned within 12 months after screening, e.g.,hip replacement Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial Previous enrolment in this trial Any investigational or antitumour treatment within 30 days prior to the initial administration of BI 754091. History within the last 5 years of an invasive malignancy other than the one treated in this trial, with the exception of resected/ablated basal or squamouscell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other local tumours considered cured by local treatment. Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (i.e., without evidence of Progression of Disease by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment, and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), and there is no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases Inadequate organ function or bone marrow reserve as demonstrated by the following laboratory values: Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5 x 10^9/L (&lt;1500/mm3) Platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L Haemoglobin &lt;90 g/L (&lt;9 g/dL) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or &gt;5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.5 times ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or &gt;5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN, except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who are excluded if total bilirubin &gt;3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN Creatinine &gt;1.5 times ULN or creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation); confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is &gt;1.5 times ULN. Any of the following cardiac criteria: Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting Electrocardiograms, e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 yearsofage, or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval Ejection fraction &lt;55% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional standard. History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal Antibodies Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of BI 754091 Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection or an active hepatitis B or C virus infection Interstitial lung disease Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, makes him/her an unreliable trial subject, unlikely to complete the trial, or unable to comply with the protocol procedures.</criteria>
