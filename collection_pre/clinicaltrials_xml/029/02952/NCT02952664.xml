	<brief_summary>This study will employ two monitoring device prototypes. The devices are sensors containing accelerometers and gyroscope. The raw output data will be analyzed to determine when patients are moved or are repositioned in their beds. The data is captured within a modem which will correlate these movements with video recordings for interpretation by the research team. One sensor is wearable on the patient gown or sleepwear, and the other is placed underneath the frame of the hospital bed. The investigators propose a non-blinded trial with n=10 where all subjects will undergo the two devices. A video camera will be placed in each subject room for recording the repositioning events to correlate the monitor signals with the actual subject repositioning captured by the video. The goal of the trial is to validate the ability of each of the sensor prototypes to accurately detect when subjects are turned, in order to reduce stationary positioning which contributes to the incidence of pressure ulcers and to improve compliance with patient repositioning trials.</brief_summary>
