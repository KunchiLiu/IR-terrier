	<brief_title>"Remind-to-move" for Promoting Upper Extremity Recovery in Patients With Stroke After Subacute Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a proof-of-principle study to investigate the effects of "Remind-to-Move" (RTM) using wearable devices at home for promoting upper extremity recovery in stroke patients after discharge from subacute hospitals. A multi-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment was carried out in four hospitals. Eighty-four eligible participants who had suffered from stroke with less than 6 months and could slightly move their arms were randomly allocated to either an experimental, sham, or control group stratified by hemiplegic arm functional levels. Patients in the experimental group were treated by RTM using wearable devices, 3 consecutive hours daily, for 4 weeks. The sham group used sham devices. The control group received the usual care. A masked assessor evaluated the participants at 0, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks. Outcome measures included arm function tests, motor activity log, movement amount and percentage recorded by wearable devices. All patients allocated to treatment were included in intention-to-treat analysis.</detailed_description>
