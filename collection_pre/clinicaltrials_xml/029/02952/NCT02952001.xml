	<brief_title>Extension Study of Patients With Non-infectious Uveitis Who Participated in CLS1001-301</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-interventional extension study of up to 6 months for subjects completing the Parent study. The Parent study is a Phase 3, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of 4 mg of CLS-TA administered via suprachoroidal injection compared to a sham procedure in the treatment of subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. The study design of the Extension study includes 4 clinic visits over a maximum of 24 weeks. Subject eligibility will be established at Visit 1 during the crossover day from the Parent study to the extension study (Day 0). Follow-up visits will be conducted every 6 weeks up to 24 weeks (Visit 4). At Visit 4, subjects will have a final evaluation conducted 24 weeks following study entry (48 weeks from Parent study randomization).</detailed_description>
