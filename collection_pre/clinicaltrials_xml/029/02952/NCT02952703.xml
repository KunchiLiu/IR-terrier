	<brief_summary>This study tests whether a smoking cessation intervention for pregnant women that extends postpartum (Striving to Quit (STQ)) can be implemented and disseminated outside of the research environment that established its effectiveness (40% maintained biochemically verified 6-month abstinence). The research aim is: Is Striving to Quit more effective in achieving postpartum smoking cessation than "First Breath," the current standard of care for pregnant women in Wisconsin who smoke? 250 women will be randomized into one of two study groups. Pregnant women in Group A (n=125) will receive the existing First Breath prenatal intervention. Those in Group B (Striving to Quit (STQ), n=125) will receive all Group A interventions, plus 1 additional prenatal home visit, 3 postpartum in-home smoking cessation counseling visits, 3 postpartum phone calls, and up to an additional $100 in gift cards. The primary outcome will be biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at 6-months postpartum.</brief_summary>
