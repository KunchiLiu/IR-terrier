	<brief_title>Tissue Sealant Use in LASIK Enhancement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would exclude the participant from the study, then the participant will be informed and given an appropriate referral. If the participant is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled. The participant will undergo LASIK flap lift eye surgery. Tissue sealant will be applied at to the edge of the LASIK flap at the conclusion of the surgery. A bandage contact lens will also be placed. The bandage contact lens is used in the usual and customary fashion as in non-study LASIK flap lift surgery. The participants will be seen on the day of surgery, post op day one, one month, and three months. The participant will receive topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. The participant will receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week after treatment. The participant will also receive vigamox ophthalmic drops for seven days after treatment. All of this is within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of participants undergoing LASIK surgery.</detailed_description>
