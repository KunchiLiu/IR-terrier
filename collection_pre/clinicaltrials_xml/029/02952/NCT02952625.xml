	<brief_summary>This is a pilot non-intervention study that aims to introduce PET/MRI, a state of the art new imaging technique, into the radiotherapy treatment pathway of patients with head and neck cancer. Ultimately the investigators aim to establish appropriate scanning and image registration protocols, to allow progression to a randomized trial of adaptive radiotherapy dose escalation. The latter is thought to potentially improve outcomes in this group. Ten patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, planned for radical treatment with radiotherapy (+/-chemotherapy), will be recruited. Study participants will have two PET/MRI scans, with the radiotherapy immobilization devices in situ. The first will be done prior to the start of radiotherapy, the second half way through treatment. Image quality will be assessed by comparing to standard diagnostic scans and different registration methods will be compared to establish the best way of incorporating PET/MR image data into the radiotherapy planning system. Patient tolerability and workflow considerations will also be qualitatively assessed. Furthermore, a planning study will be conducted to establish relevant treatment protocols for a subsequent dose escalation trial. PET/MRI is an exciting new technology with a lot of potential in the context of adaptive radiotherapy dose escalation. Within this pilot study the investigators aim to address the technical challenges of using it in this context prior to proceeding to a randomized trial.</brief_summary>
