	<brief_summary>This is an open, pilot study for adults ( age range of 20-70 years old), who suffer from snoring without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and no need for CPAP treatment: with standard diagnosis of sleep study or with minor sleep disorder (AHI of less than 15 events per hour). Patients with no OSA over the last year will sign an informed consent after receiving explanations from authorized physician (Professor Asher Tal). The patient will than undergo a sleep study using a mobile device PAT (Peripheral Arterial Tomography, Itamar Medical, Israel) ,an approved device in Israel, USA and many other European countries,, approved for use by the USA FDA). This sleep study is needed in order to rule out OSA, namely AHI of more than 15 events per hour of sleep. The study duration with each patient will be 48 hours (two nights); at the first night the sleep study will be with PAT device, with snoring recording and without the "Forrest" epic device. In the second night the sleep study will be with PAT device, with snoring recording and with the "Forrest" epic device. The order of the sleep studies (with and without the epic device) will be randomly determined by computerized ahead prepared list. The research duration for patients that did not have a sleep study over the last year, will take place for 3 nights; the sleep study will be performed in order to make sure the patient does not suffer from obstructive respiratory disorder during sleep. The sleep studies will take place in a sleep laboratory (Millennium Sleep Labs LTD, Beer Sheva) or as an ambulatory study, at home. Recordings over the nights with or without the "Forrest" epic device will be carried out at the patient's home, after verification that each patient sleeps alone in his/her room. The recording and data processing of snoring will be performed through the application "SNORLAB" on IPHONE 6 mobile device. Ambulatory sleep studies with PAT device will be carried out during two nights (with and without the Forrest Device) with most patients. During the examination, respiratory index will be tested such as: obstructive respiratory events during sleep, oxygen saturation in blood at rest (measured non-invasively) during sleep: mean, lowest (nadir), and rate of time the patient sleeps in with less than 90% of oxygen saturation in blood.</brief_summary>
