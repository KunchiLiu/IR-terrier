	<brief_title>Application of 3D Printing Technique in Small Pulmonary Nodule Localization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient recruitment : The chest CT was reviewed by two experienced doctors to determine whether the patient was suitable for localization. data collection and management: The data was collected and reviewed by a specialized researcher and to reduce heterogenicity. The following data were collected: age , sex, nodule size,location,density,distance to the pleura,radiation dose, localization time,complications and pathologic results. data analysis: statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 22.0. Fisher exact test was used for comparison between two groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used for numeric variables. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</detailed_description>
