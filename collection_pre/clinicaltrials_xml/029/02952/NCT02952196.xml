	<brief_summary>Addiction to amphetamine is characterized by alternating phases of intoxication and short abstinence, followed by recurrent drug-craving episodes which result in distress and relapse. Addiction involves a number of neurotransmission systems, including the endocannabinoid system (ECBS). Cannabidiol (CBD), the second most abundant component of cannabis, is known for its broad spectrum of physiological, anxiolytic and neuroprotective properties. It has been shown to have multiple therapeutic properties for treating anxiety, schizophrenia and interestingly CBD has been shown to be potentially helpful in treating addiction, due to its effects on various neuronal circuits involved in this disorder. The investigators overall hypothesis is that CBD is an interesting pharmacological contender to decrease amphetamine craving and treat amphetamine addiction.</brief_summary>
