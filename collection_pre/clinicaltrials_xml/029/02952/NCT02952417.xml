	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of sex on relative survival and excess mortality following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a population-based cohort within a relative survival framework. Patient-level data concerning demographics, co-morbidity, cardiovascular risk factors and treatments at discharge were extracted from the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART), a population-based registry of outcomes for patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome. Patients were followed-up for their vital status after AMI hospitalisation, with censoring at the end of follow-up on the 31st of December, 2013.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Details of SWEDEHEART and data validation have been described previously. Cases of acute myocardial infarction were defined as STEMI and NSTEMI according to the current European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines and determined at local level by the attending Consultant.</detailed_description>
