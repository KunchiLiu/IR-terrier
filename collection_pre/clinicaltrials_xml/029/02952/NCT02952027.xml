	<brief_summary>Post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) have a major impact on patients and healthcare expenses. The goal of perioperative respiratory therapy is to improve airway clearance, increase lung volume, and mitigate atelectasis. Incentive spirometers (IS) are ubiquitously used to prevent atelectasis and PPCsâ€”implementation of which requires substantial provider time and healthcare expenses. However, meta-analyses have demonstrated that the effectiveness of ISs is unclear due to poor patient compliance in past studies. The goal of this investigation is evaluate the effectiveness of IS on post-operative clinical outcomes. The aims of this investigation are to evaluate 1) if IS use compliance can be improved by adding a use-recording patient reminder alarm, and 2) the clinical outcomes of the more compliant IS users vs. the less-compliant IS users.</brief_summary>
