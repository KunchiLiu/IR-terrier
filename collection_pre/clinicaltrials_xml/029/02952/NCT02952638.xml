	<brief_summary>This study aims to test the hypothesis that dietary intake of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acutely alters plasma lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) levels and autotaxin activity in normal weight and obese subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Sources of Lysophospholipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a simple glycerophospholipid that is found at biologically-relevant levels in plasma and has important effects on isolated or cultured blood, vascular and fat cells. The main enzyme responsible for generation of plasma LPA is the secreted lysophospholipase D, autotaxin (ATX). Adipocytes contribute substantially to plasma ATX levels. The investigators have demonstrated rapid production and metabolism of plasma LPA in animals. More recently, the investigators have observed that plasma LPA levels increase in mice fed a high fat ("Western") diet in comparison to levels found in mice fed normal chow. The investigators have also found that diet-induced obesity increased circulating ATX levels in mice. The investigators hypothesize that diet, and in particular dietary phosphatidylcholine (PC), may regulate the autotaxin substrate lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), from which LPA is derived. Obesity may amplify the response by increasing plasma ATX levels and/or activity. The current study will test whether dietary PC in normal weight and obese subjects acutely alters LPA levels and autotaxin activity.</detailed_description>
