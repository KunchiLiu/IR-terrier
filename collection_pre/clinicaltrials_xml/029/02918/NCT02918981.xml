	<brief_summary>Using stable isotope methodology, investigators will determine the postabsorptive and postprandial muscle protein synthetic response in 60 female adults (Age 50-79, BMI: &lt;30 kg/m2) immediately after an acute bout of resistance exercise. Participants will be divided in to 5 groups of twelve women (n=12). Each group will receive a different protein beverage or placebo to consume following the resistance exercise training. Group 1 will consume a beverage consisting of whey protein; group 2 will consume whey protein supplemented with additional leucine; group 3 will consume whey protein supplemented with additional leucine and hydrolyzed whey peptides; group 4 will consume whey protein supplemented with additional leucine and citrulline; group 5 will just consume water. During the testing, blood and muscle samples will be collected.</brief_summary>
