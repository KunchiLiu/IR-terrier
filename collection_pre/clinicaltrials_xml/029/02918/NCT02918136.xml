	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, multi-site, safety and efficacy study in subjects with rotator cuff injuries. Patients will fall into two categories: treatment group (12 subjects) and non-treatment or control group (six subjects). The treatment group will undergo a small liposuction procedure and receive rotator cuff repair treatment with an ultrasound-guided injection of 5cc adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into the point of injury. The control group will receive a 5cc cortisone injection into the point of injury</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females 3075 years of age. 2. Clinical symptoms consistent with a rotator cuff lesion including but not limited to pain, muscle weakness, or activelimited range of motion (AROM). 3. Subjects who have not responded to physical therapy treatments for at least six weeks. 4. Subjects with &gt; 70% passive range of motion (PROM). 5. Diagnosed with &gt;50% tear to supraspinatus muscle or &lt; 5mm separation assessed by MRI. 6. Diagnosed with a partialthickness rotator cuff tear 7. The ability of subjects to give appropriate consent or have an appropriate representative available. 1. Age &lt;30 or &gt; 75 2. Insufficient amount of subcutaneous tissue to allow recovery of 50cc of lipoaspirate. 3. History of systemic malignant neoplasms within last 5 years. 4. History of local neoplasm within the last 6 months and any history of local neoplasm at site of administration. 5. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). 6. Subjects who are known to be HIV positive 7. Patients who have received a corticosteroid injection in rotator cuff site within last 3 months 8. Severe arthrosis of the glenohumeral or acromioclavicular joint 9. Irreparable rotator cuff tear (including rotator cuff tear arthropathy) 10. Fatty atrophy above Grade 2 in affected shoulder 11. Previous shoulder surgeries in affected shoulder 12. History of tobacco use within the last 3 months 13. Any contraindications to MRI scan according to MRI guidelines, or unwillingness to undergo MRI procedures 14. Patients on an active regimen of chemotherapy 15. Patients with a documented history of liver disease or an ALT value &gt;400 16. Allergy to sodium citrate of any "caine" type of local anesthetic 17. Patients pregnant or breast feeding 18. Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason. This includes completion of Patient Reported Outcome instruments. 19. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed its primary endpoint. 20. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator, is unable to give Informed Consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include: Individuals with mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, persons in emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also may include members of a group with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the Sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention. 21. Uncooperative patients or those with neurological/psychiatric disorders who are incapable of following directions or who are predictably unwilling to return for followup examinations.</criteria>
