	<brief_title>Effect of Pre-op NRT on Peri-operative Complications and Long-term Abstinence: A Pilot Trial in Patients Undergoing CABG Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this project is to 1. To determine if pre-operative, (short-term) NRT, 1 to 3 weeks before surgery, improves the long-term quit rates among smokers undergoing elective CABG surgery. 2. To determine the effect of pre-operative NRT on perceived stress and symptoms of nicotine withdrawal at the time of surgery. 3. To assess, retroactively, the impact of pre-operative cessation on peri-operative complications such as infection rates, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, sepsis, shock and prolonged hospital stay. We therefore hypothesize that if NRT is given to smokers during the pre-admission period (1-3 weeks prior to surgery), they are more likely to be biochemically abstinent from cigarette smoking 6 months after hospitalization and will experience fewer peri-operative complications To assess these measures, we have designed a single site, double-blinded randomized controlled trial at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI). Patients who are identified as a smoker at their initial visit to the PAU will undergo a baseline assessment and be randomly assigned (1:1) to either active or placebo 21mg NRT patch. They will wear the patch from that baseline visit until the day of their surgery at UOHI. Following their surgery, they will receive a follow up phone call at 1 and 6 months post-discharge. They will complete a series of short questionnaires to assess their smoking status, stress levels and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Those who identify themselves as being smoke-free will be asked to complete a carbon monoxide breathing test to chemically validate their smoking status. The study protocol will be reviewed by the Research Ethics board at UOHI and all participants will provide written informed consent prior to undertaking any study activities.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient is currently smoking &gt;5 cigarettes/day for the past 30 days; there is no evidence that NRT is useful in those who smoke &lt;5cpd. 2. Patient is able to participate and willing to provide informed consent; participants will need to follow directions and adhere to the medication usage instructions as outlined in the informed consent document. 3. Patients is willing to be contacted by phone for follow up at 1 month and 6 months postdischarge; these time points will assess our final outcome of cessation at 6 months postdischarge. 1. Patient is scheduled for surgery in &lt; 7 days; most patients need to be using NRT consistently for 2 weeks for it to be fully effective. 2. Patient is currently using a smoking cessation product (i.e. nicotine containing patch, gum, inhaler, lozenge, spray or nicotine containing electronic cigarette, varenicline, buproprion) or has used a smoking cessation aid consistently for more than 72 consecutive hours with the intent to reduce cigarette consumption or quit smoking within 30 days of the baseline Preadmission Unit (PAU) visit; this will ensure the effects of the study patches will be assessed without any contamination from other cessation products. 3. Patient is willing to refrain from using any other cessation products (nicotine containing patch, gum, inhaler, lozenge, spray, nicotine containing electronic cigarette, varenicline, buproprion) prior to surgery; this will allow us to track the usage and side effects with the study patches. 4. Patient is allergic to the adhesive on the nicotine replacement therapy patch. 5. Patient is unable to read and understand English or French; study materials will only be supplied in these two languages.</criteria>
