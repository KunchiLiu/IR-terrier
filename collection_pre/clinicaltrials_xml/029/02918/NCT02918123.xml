	<brief_title>Safety of FURESTEM-CD Inj. in Patients With Moderate to Severe Plaque-type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, single center, randomized, open label, study of safety of FURESTEM-CD Inj. in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Approximately 9~18 subjects will be administrated FURESTEM-CD Inj. FURESTEM-CD Inj. is composed of allogeneic hUCB-MSC(human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Mesenchymal Stem cell). hUCB-MSCs are mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord blood. Mesenchymal stem cells are well-known for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory ability and capable of differentiating into a wide range of cell types. Therefore, FURSTEM-CD Inj. has huge possibility as cell therapy products for plaque-type Psoriasis patients.</detailed_description>
