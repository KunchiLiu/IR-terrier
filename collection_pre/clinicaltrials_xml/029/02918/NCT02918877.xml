	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the use of inhaled anesthetics, compared to intravenous anesthetics, can affect the amount of lung inflammation and postoperative respiratory complications seen after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthetics to Prevent Lung Injury in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, controlled trial involving 45 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients will be randomized to receive either inhaled anesthesia with sevoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol for the maintenance phase of their cardiac anesthetic. Assessment of lung inflammation will take place using fiberoptic bronchoscopic sampling of lung fluid as well as serum collection before and after exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass, and the incidence of compositive postoperative pulmonary complications will take place in the postoperative period.</detailed_description>
