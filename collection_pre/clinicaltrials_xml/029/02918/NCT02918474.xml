	<brief_summary>An online decision support tool will be field tested that provides patients facing a decision about contralateral prophylactic breast cancer (CPM) with evidence-based information about the expected incidence of contralateral breast cancer and the life expectancy benefit of CPM. The tool will be designed for use in clinical settings and viewed jointly by the patient and physician as part of a shared decision making process around CPM.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential participants will be recruited at their initial surgeon's appointment at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). For K-S site, potential participants will be recruited at their initial surgeon's visit if the patient is coming in with a known breast cancer diagnosis. Eligible participants' surgical treatment preferences will be assessed prior to meeting with the surgeon including level of interest in having CPM (i.e., no interest in CPM to definitely interested in having CPM). If the participant selects 3 or higher for interest in CPM (where 1 indicates no interest in CPM and 5 indicates definite interest in CPM), patient will be invited to participate on the study. Five breast cancer surgeons will be invited to participate in the study and each will be asked to field test the decision tool on 5 eligible patients who are considering CPM. The patients' acceptability and the effectiveness of the decision support tool will be assessing using questionnaires before and after the patient participates in the consultation with her breast cancer surgeon. Patients' rating of the acceptability of the decision support tool will be assessed using questions from the Ottawa Acceptability Measures, including the clarity, amount, and balance of the information provided by the tool (2). The effectiveness of the decision support tool will be assessed by the following measures administered before and after the consultation: 1) changes in patient's knowledge of CPM and 2) reductions in decisional conflict about CPM using the Decisional Conflict Scale (3) Patients will also be asked their preferences for CPM after the consultation.</detailed_description>
