	<criteria>Participants with documented multiple myeloma (MM) satisfying the CRAB (calcium elevation, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone abnormalities) criteria , monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow more than equal to (&gt;=) 10 percent (%) or presence of a biopsy proven plasmacytoma, and measurable disease Measurable disease as defined by any of the following: (a) immunoglobulin (Ig) G MM: serum monoclonal paraprotein (M protein) level &gt;=1.0 gram/deciliter (dL) or urine M protein level &gt;= 200 milligram(mg)/24 hours; or (b) IgA, IgM, IgD, or IgE MM: serum M protein level &gt;=0.5 g/dL or urine M protein level &gt;=200 mg/24 hours; or (c) Light chain MM without measurable disease in serum or urine: serum Ig free light chain (FLC) &gt;=10 mg/dL and abnormal serum Ig kappa lambda FLC ratio Participants newly diagnosed and not considered a candidate for highdose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) due to being &gt;=65 years old, or in subjects less than (&lt;) 65 years old presence of important comorbid condition(s) likely to have a negative effect on the tolerability of highdose chemotherapy with ASCT Pretreatment clinical laboratory values meeting the following criteria during the Screening Phase Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1 A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests at Screening, first within 4 weeks prior to dosing and the second within 3 days prior to dosing Participants with diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or smoldering MM Participant with plasma cell leukemia or other conditions in which Ig (immunoglobulin) M protein is present in the absence of a clonal plasma cell infiltration with lytic bone lesions Participants who have prior or current systemic therapy or ASCT for MM, with the exception of an emergency use of a short course (equivalent of dexamethasone 40 mg/day for a maximum 4 days) of corticosteroids before treatment Participants with history of malignancy (other than MM) within 5 years before the date of the first daratumumab administration Participants who have radiation therapy within 14 days of the first dose</criteria>
