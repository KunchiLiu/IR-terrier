	<brief_summary>This study compares the effect of intracervical block with 1% lidocaine and intramuscular diclofenac 75mg in decreasing pain perception during hysterosalpingography. Half of participants will receive intracervical block with 1% lidocaine, while the other half will receive intramuscular diclofenac 75mg.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a radiographic test to evaluate the contour of the uterine cavity and patency of the fallopian tubes after injection of a radio-opaque dye through the cervix. It is typically performed in the evaluation of infertility or to diagnose uterine anomalies. It is the most common method of tubal evaluation in the developing countries because it is cheap, readily available and requires less expertise. Unfortunately, HSG can cause discomfort or pain for the patient during or after the procedure, and this evokes anxiety and fear for many patients. Up to 72 % of women complain of significant discomfort with this test. Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic which exerts its effect by altering neuronal depolarization by blocking the sodium channels in the cell membrane, thereby preventing transmission of the sensation of pain to the higher neurons. Lidocaine is commonly used for infiltration and for peripheral nerve blocks if an intermediate duration is required. Diclofenac is a Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug that reduce nociception which is related to inflammation and inflammatory mediators whether from trauma</detailed_description>
