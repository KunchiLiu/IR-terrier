	<brief_summary>After surgical procedures, interventions to reduce postoperative bleeding are of great importance. In this study, the effect will be investigated of administering tranexamic acid, which is designed for injection, directly onto the raw wound surface (topical application) created during surgery. In this way only a small amount of drug is to reach a large wound area. There will be a higher drug concentration of it in the exposed wound surface than after injection, but only a very low concentration in the body, and no risk of injury from needles. The researchers have recently shown that topically applicated tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in women who had two-sided breast reduction surgery. Now it will be studied whether topically applicated tranexamic acid reduces bleeding and wound effusions from superficial wounds, using as a study model the homogenous wounds created by tangential skin excision when harvesting split skin grafts for skin transplants. Two identical wound surfaces in the same patient will serve as case and control.</brief_summary>
