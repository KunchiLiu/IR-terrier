	<brief_title>Oxytocin and Social Cognitive Skills Groups</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a proof-of-concept, combination intervention designed to address individual treatment targets presumed to influence social learning in school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This proposal builds upon prior research on an empirically supported social cognitive skills training curriculum, NETT (Nonverbal communication, Emotion recognition, and Theory of mind Training). NETT is a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) for nonverbal communication, emotion recognition, and theory of mind deficits in youth with ASD. In this two-phase, 3 year, single-blind, contact controlled study, school-aged children with ASD (n=60) will be randomized into a 12-session, parallel group design of Integrated Oxytocin and NETT (ION) or a control social group condition (facilitated play). The study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of integrating the neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), with the social cognitive curriculum, as well as to identify targets of change and pre-treatment factors predictive of response to ION-ASD. Maintenance of treatment effects will also be assessed 1 month and 3 months post-treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Male or female outpatients, 811 years of age inclusive 2. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition for Autism Spectrum Disorder. DSMV criteria will be established by a clinician with expertise with individuals with ASD. Best estimate Diagnosis will be reached using DSMV criteria, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADIR), or Autism Screening Interview. 3. Mean score of 7 or less on mentalizing items of Strange Stories Test (Highest possible score = 12, items 2125, 27). 4. Have a Clinician's Global ImpressionSeverity (CGIS) score ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at Baseline. 5. Verbal and performance scale IQ ≥ 80 (both subtests of the WISCV ≥ 70). 6. If already receiving stable concomitant medications, have continuous participation during the preceding 30 days prior to Screening, and not electively initiate new or modify ongoing medications for the duration of the study. For serotonergic agents, 6 months on a stable dose is required. 7. If already receiving stable nonpharmacologic educational, behavioral, and/or dietary interventions, have continuous participation during the preceding 3 months prior to Screening, and not electively initiate new or modify ongoing interventions for the duration of the study. 8. Have normal physical examination and laboratory test results at Screening. If abnormal, the finding(s) must be deemed not clinically significant by the Treating Clinician. 9. Ability to speak and understand English sufficiently to allow for the completion of all study assessments. 10. Ability to obtain written assent from the participant as well as written informed consent from their parent(s)/legal guardian. Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients born prior to 35 weeks gestational age. 2. Patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis other than ASD. 3. Patients with a medical history of neurological disease, including, but not limited to, epilepsy/seizure disorder (except simple febrile seizures), movement disorder, tuberous sclerosis, fragile X, and any other known genetic syndromes, or known abnormal brain MRI/structural lesion. 4. Pregnant female patients, sexually active female patients on hormonal birth control and sexually active females who do not use at least two types of nonhormonal birth control. 5. Patients with evidence or history of malignancy or any significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular (including any rhythm disorder), respiratory, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease. 6. Patients with one or more of the following: hemophilia (bleeding problems, recent nose and brain injuries), abnormal blood pressure (hypotension or hypertension), drug abuse, immunity disorder or severe depression. 7. Patients who are currently taking OXT or have taken INOXT in the past with no response. 8. Patients who have an Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale score &gt; 16 at screening 9. Patients with sensitivity to OXT or any components of its formulation. 10. Patients unable to tolerate venipuncture procedures for blood sampling. 11. Patients in foster care for whom the state is defined as a legal guardian. 12. If they have an arrhythmia present on ECG, that upon consultation with a cardiologist, is deemed to be clinically significant. 13. Patients with any of the following clinical lab results 1. ALT/AST levels of ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical jaundice occurs 2. Sodium levels of &gt; 152 mmol/L or &lt; 128 mmol/L 3. Potassium levels of &gt; 6 mmol/L in a nonhemolyzed sample 4. Glucose levels of &gt; 11 mmol/L or &lt; 2.8 mmol/L 5. Hemoglobin levels of &lt; 100 g/L 6. BUN levels of &gt; 100 mmol/L 7. Creatinine levels of &gt; 100 µmol/L 8. Osmolality levels of &gt; 330 mmol/kg</criteria>
