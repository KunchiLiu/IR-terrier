	<brief_title>TAK-071 Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Impairment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-071. This study will look at the effect of a single oral dose of TAK-071, a novel muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 positive allosteric modulator, on scopolamine-induced deficits in cognitive function in healthy adult male participants. The study will enroll approximately 32 participants, with the total of 8 participants per sequence. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment sequencesâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Scopolamine;TAK-071+Scopolamine;Placebo;Donepezil+Scopolamine - TAK-071+Scopolamine;Donepezil+Scopolamine;Scopolamine;Placebo - Donepezil+Scopolamine;Placebo;TAK-071+Scopolamine;Scopolamine - Placebo;Scopolamine;Donepezil+Scopolamine;TAK-071+Scopolamine The dose of TAK-071 that was well-tolerated in the TAK-071-1001 study (NCT02769065) will be selected, based on the safety and tolerability data from the single-rising dose (SRD) study. Each participant will also receive scopolamine 0.5 mg, injection, subcutaneously, once at the time of Screening. This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 18 weeks. Participants will remain confined to the clinic for 4 days during the each intervention period. Participants will be contacted by telephone on Day 72 for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
