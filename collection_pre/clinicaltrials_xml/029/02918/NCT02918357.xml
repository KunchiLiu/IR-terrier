	<brief_summary>The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in patients with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy and radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET in Patients With Biochemical Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning. Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled PSMA-11 in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the Ga-68-PSMA-11 compound, so that this agent will become available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients. In the biochemical recurrence population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Recurrence</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Histopathological proven prostate adenocarcinoma. Rising PSA after definitive therapy with prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy). Post radical prostatectomy (RP) AUA recommendation PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more than 6 weeks after RP and, Confirmatory persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL Postradiation therapy ASTROPhoenix consensus definition Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA Karnofsky performance status of greater than 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent). Age &gt; 18. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it. Investigational therapy for prostate cancer. Unable to lie flat, still or tolerate a PET scan. Prior history of any other malignancy within the last 2 years, other than skin basal cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma that has not metastasized and superficial bladder cancer. Contraindication to furosemide administration including prior allergy or adverse reaction to furosemide or sulfa drugs. (Note: This exclusion criteria can be removed if Furosemide is omitted as part of the PET imaging protocol if a secondgeneration scatter correction is available for the used PET device).</criteria>
