	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple orally administered doses of EDP-305 in healthy adult subjects, and adult subjects with presumptive NAFLD (i.e., obese subjects with or without prediabetes or T2DM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of EDP 305 in Healthy Subjects and Subjects With Presumptive NAFLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase assesses single ascending doses for EDP 305 (active drug or placebo) in healthy subjects. A "fasted" and "fed" two-part cohort will also assess food effect. The second phase assesses multiple ascending doses (active drug or placebo) for 14-days in healthy subjects and also in subjects with presumptive NAFLD (i.e., obese subjects with or without prediabetes or T2DM). Each cohort within each phase will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to receive EDP-305 or placebo. The cohort assessing food effect will enroll 10 subjects randomized to receive EDP-305 or placebo.</detailed_description>
