	<brief_title>Pediatric Veins Cannulation Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM OF THE STUDY The primary objective of this study is to determine the success rate at first attempt of peripheral veins cannulation in small children (&lt;5yrs) and infants (&lt;1yr) of Veinsite compared with traditional palpation method performed by skilled operators. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the time to cannulation using the two techniques, the difference in visualized veins using the Veinsite or the direct visualization and palpation of the patients' skin, cannula indwelling time and complications related to the procedure. DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled study Population It is expected to recruit 60 pediatric patients undergoing peripheral vein cannulation with known difficulties according the difficult venous access score (DIVA) (6) in the following centers: 1. Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico "C.Besta" , Milano 2. Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges√π, IRCCS, Roma Duration of study Patient will be followed from the day of peripheral vein cannulation till the peripheral cannula will be removed (max 3 days) in order to assess any cause of venous extravasation. The recruitment phase is supposed to be 6 months after achieving the ethical-administrative authorization.</detailed_description>
