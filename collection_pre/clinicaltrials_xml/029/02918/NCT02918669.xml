	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Long Term Survivorship of Coflex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, radiographic evaluation of all coflex IDE patients who presented with a spinous process fracture at 24 months as identified by independent radiographic review (using X-ray or CT). All patients were enrolled and followed through 60 months under the IDE and extended follow-up protocol. The specific objective of this CT Study is to perform a sub-analysis of the patients with 24 month spinous process fracture(s) via a CT scan at post-60 months. A CT Scan will be performed and analyzed by an independent radiographic review lab for evidence of fracture or healing at the long term timepoint.</detailed_description>
