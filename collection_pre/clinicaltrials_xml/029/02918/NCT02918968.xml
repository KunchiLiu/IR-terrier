	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy with enzalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and the combination therapy with flutamide + ADT in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer who have relapsed during combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy with bicalutamide and ADT. This study will also investigate the order of alternative antiandrogen therapy (AAT) by changing the 1st line medication after relapse of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</brief_summary>
