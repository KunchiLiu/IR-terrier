	<brief_summary>Every year in France, more than 60 000 people are operated for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This surgery is accompanied by a change or even a loss of ejaculations externalized what constitutes the main constraint for patients. Empirically, the investigators talk to the patient "retrograde ejaculation" to explain a possible loss of ejaculation. Yet the underlying mechanism of this modification or loss of ejaculation remains completely unknown. Yet the underlying mechanism of this modification or loss of ejaculation remains completely unknown. No study could not determine whether the predominant mechanism was a real retrograde ejaculation or aspermia. Moreover, technical changes are sometimes tempted to preserve antegrade ejaculation but no scientific rationale can not validate.</brief_summary>
