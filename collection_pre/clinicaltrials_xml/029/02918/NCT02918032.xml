	<brief_summary>This study aims to understand the state of onset of NLSD(neutral lipid storage disease) / TGCV(triglyceride deposit cardiovasculopathy) worldwide, background information of affected patients, and natural history of the disease, as well as exploring the prognostic factors and assessing the efficacy of disease-specific treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Registry Study of Neutral Lipid Storage Disease (NLSD) / Triglyceride Deposit Cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV) and Related Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since NLSD is a rare disease, its clinical manifestation and clinical course have not been sufficiently clarified. Also, the number of patients in each country is limited. As such, it is considered difficult to fully investigate this disease without international collaboration. Therefore, we have established the International Registry of NLSD / TGCV. Also, all patients with Jordans' anomaly of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes are established as the subjects of entry when starting the registry, to allow entry of patients with NLSD due to genes other than mutations of ATGL and CGI-58 genes. Time Perspective:This study is both Prospective (registering patients who are diagnosed with NLSD / TGCV) and Retrospective (registering only the medical record of previous patients).</detailed_description>
