	<brief_summary>To enhance the oral bioavailability of the antioxidants trans-resveratrol and trans-Îµ-viniferin from Vineatrol30 grapevine-shoot extract, the native powder was incorporated into micelles. A single dose, single blind, two arms crossover trial was conducted. Plasma and urine samples were collected at intervals up to 24 h after oral intake of native or micellar Vineatrol30 (500 mg), and resveratrol content was quantified and compared between formulations. Tolerability of the dose was also controlled by safety parameters in plasma.</brief_summary>
