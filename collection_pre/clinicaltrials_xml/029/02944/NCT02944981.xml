	<brief_summary>The intrathecal administration of morphine is gaining popularity. It is easy to do and can reduce the pain after surgery up to 24 hours. However, it causes postoperative nausea and vomiting more than other methods providing postoperative analgesia. Patients suffering from these side effects have to spend a longer period of time recovering in the hospital with high cost of medical treatment.</brief_summary>
