	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if curcumin can reverse a cervical precancerous state by looking at people who have the condition and intervening with a study drug or placebo (an inactive drug), prior to planned therapeutic loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) which is a treatment procedure for removing cervical cancer. 40 women with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) of the cervix will be enrolled to either insert 2000 mg capsule of curcumin or a placebo in their vagina daily for 12 weeks. After a 4 week long washout period the participants will then undergo removal of the precancerous cells as recommended standard of care. Participants will have regular monthly visits for the duration of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Curcumin for Precancer Cervical Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. The causative agent responsible for cervical cancer is the persistent infection with oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Rates of cervical cancer and HPV infection are increased in HIV-infected women due to immunosuppression and cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining diagnosis. Despite the promise of HPV vaccine in the prevention of cervical cancer, the widespread availability of this vaccine is limited due to cost and accessibility. Therefore, prevention strategies to reduce cervical cancer after HPV exposure entail treatment at the most severe premalignant state (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or HSIL). As this procedure is expensive and not widely available in resource-limited areas there is a need for an inexpensive, non-invasive alternative method to treat these premalignant cervical lesions. Curcumin, an extract from turmeric, a popular culinary spice, has been used in traditional Indian medicine for its anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious properties. Recent studies have shown the potential effect of curcumin to reduce tumors and precancerous lesions in animal and human cancer cells. It is postulated that curcumin achieves its effect on cancer cells by modulating different cellular pathways as well as altering HPV effect on tissue cells. This study will explore the effect of curcumin as a potential medical treatment in HIV-infected women with HSIL lesions of the cervix. 40 women with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) of the cervix will be enrolled to either insert 2000 mg capsule of curcumin or a placebo in their vagina daily for 12 weeks. After a 4 week long washout period the participants will then undergo removal of the precancerous cells as recommended standard of care. Participants will have regular monthly visits for the duration of the study.</detailed_description>
