	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies how well probiotic yogurt supplement works in reducing diarrhea in patients with kidney cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body and that are being treated with sunitinib. Studying samples of blood and stool from patients who eat probiotic yogurt and those who avoid probiotic yogurt may help doctors plan better treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotic Yogurt Supplement in Reducing Diarrhea in Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Being Treated With Sunitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if adding Activia yogurt (containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-172 010) to the diet of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) increases the level of Bifidobacterium spp in stool. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if Activia reduces the incidence of diarrhea for mRCC patients treated with sunitinib therapy. II. To compare pre-treatment levels of circulating T regulatory (Treg) cells and levels of peripheral signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) in patients with and without diarrhea with sunitinib therapy, and correlate with Bifidobacterium, other bacteria, and Activia. III. To determine if patients with the diarrhea in mRCC patients treated with sunitinib therapy have a lower baseline of Bifidobacterium spp. IV. To assess the change in global stool bacteriomic profile of patients receiving therapy with sunitinib with or without Activia. V. To better assess the feasibility of stool collection and bacteriomic profiling. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive probiotic supplement Activia yogurt twice daily (QD) during weeks 2-13 of sunitinib treatment. ARM II: Patients avoid any intake of yogurt or yogurt-containing foods and refrain from taking/consuming other probiotic supplements for 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytologically or pathologically verified diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) Diagnosis of RCC that is defined as metastatic by standard criteria (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 7th edition, 2010) Planned treatment with sunitinib treatment with sunitinib has not yet begun Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent Ability to read and write English Documented consent to participation to include the following study specific procedures: Be able to provide up to six serial stool collections at home and deliver to FedEx location that day as per standard operating procedure Have three 10ml blood samples taken during a routine clinic visit To not take probiotic supplements except as oriented If randomized to the probioticsupplemented group (the yogurtbased supplement Activia), be willing to comply with daily intake and record this intake as a component of a dietary log; the patient will be asked not to take any yogurt or yogurtcontaining foods beyond this If randomized to the probioticrestricted group, agree not to consume yogurt or yogurtcontaining foods Maintain a dietary log and stool frequency log Patients with a known intolerance to lactose or other constituents of Activia Patients with irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or other clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) related condition that might confound the sunitinibrelateddiarrhea endpoint Patients taking antibiotics or who plan to begin taking antibiotics Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)</criteria>
