	<criteria>Age 20 or older, able to sign informed consent, understand and comply with protocol requirements and instructions. Body weight between 30 to 120 kg International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) intermediate1 (int1), intermediate2 (int2) or highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by World Health Organization (WHO) or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) patients. Not previously treated with MDS and CMML therapy and require treatment with azacitidine* for the first time at 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days (7 nonconsecutive day of 611 or 522 treatment schedule is acceptable in which the drug is administered MondaySaturday and then Monday of the following week for a 611 schedule, and in which the drug is administered MondayFriday and then MondayTuesday of the following week for 522 schedule) per cycle. Treatment of the study drug, BLEX 404 Oral Liquid will begin at the same time receiving the first dose of azacitidine in this study. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 03. Adequate baseline organ function defined by the criteria below: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) except for Gilbert's syndrome or indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to hemolysis; ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN; AST ≤ 2.5x ULN; creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Women must be either of nonchild bearing potential, or women with childbearing potential and men with reproductive potential and a female partner of childbearing potential must either have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception from time of Screening Visit until the FollowUp Visit. Historical allergic events caused by mushroom. Previous treatment with hypomethylating agent or known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to drugs chemically related to azacitidine that contraindicates the subjects' participation. Patients with active infections or require treatments with immunosuppressive drugs at screening visit. However, patients require ongoing treatments with corticosteroids may be recruited. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) preceding the first dose of BLEX 404 Oral Liquid. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical condition (including any advanced malignancy other than the disease under study), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance with the study procedures. Any clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, gastrointestinal or genitourinary disease unrelated to underlying hematologic disorder. Active and uncontrolled infections of the following: hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, HBV and HCV carriers with viral load test of "not detected" or "negative" results may be recruited in this study. Lactating female and women with a positive serum or urine pregnancy test at screening assessments. (For Part II Interventional Study subjects only) No indication, in the opinion of the treating physician, for antibiotic prophylaxis within 2 weeks prior to study treatment.</criteria>
