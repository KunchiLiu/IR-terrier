	<brief_summary>East Asian patients will be required optimal dose of newer P2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel or ticagrelor) to determine the safer treatment and better outcome. Whether lower dose of these regimens are more adequate for clinical practice in Korea is unclear. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of half dose of new oral P2Y12 inhibitors in Korean patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Half Dose of Prasugrel and Ticagrelor in Acute Coronary Syndrome (HOPE-TAILOR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, newer oral P2Y12 receptor blockers (prasugrel or ticagrelor) have been strong recommendations for management of patients with ACS undergoing (PCI). These drugs provided more profound inhibitory effects than clopidogrel, which could lead to marked reduction in ischemic events, with relatively increase in bleeding complication, specific to low body weight, especially in women and East Asian patients.</detailed_description>
