	<brief_summary>The investigator is pilot testing the feasibility and impact of a low-cost intervention that uses existing gymnasiums, and therefore has the potential to be replicated across the United States. The intervention, PlayFit, is designed for adults aged 21-50. PlayFit has five key components, intended to overcome the major barriers to physical activity. First, it will assist people in finding others to play with, using the Pick-Up model of designating times to play and making those times known in the community. Second, it will overcome a lack of confidence in physical activity by including games of lower intensity for relatively unfit adults, then building up to moderate and vigorous games. Third, it will require team members of varying ages and genders to encourage intergenerational play. Fourth, it will use modified equipment (e.g., softer, lighter balls) and smaller game space to require less running, so that even relatively unfit people can feel confident participating. Fifth, it will be designed to be led by community volunteers, which will increase its disseminability. AIM - Understand the optimum design for PlayFit. To meet this aim, the investigators will come up with a list of games to play and pilot the games at a gymnasium. The investigators will observe the participants playing the games and have them complete a brief survey.</brief_summary>
