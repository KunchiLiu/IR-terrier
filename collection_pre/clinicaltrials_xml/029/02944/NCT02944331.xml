	<brief_title>3-4 Year Outcomes Following Endovenous Steam Ablation for Venous Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endovenous steam ablation (EVSA) of saphenous veins (saphenous vein reflux) is one of the endothermal methods in the modern treatment of venous insufficiency. Good results and long-term follow-up have been published for endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while long-term effects of EVSA are less documented. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of EVSA in 200 consecutive patients treated with EVSA and conduct prospective evaluations at 3-4 year follow-up. Standardized and validated measures will be compared to preoperative measures to evaluate change in patient-reported and clinical outcomes over time.</detailed_description>
