	<brief_summary>The oral absorption and urinary excretion kinetics of the bioactive ingredients from rice bran (gamma-oryzanol, tocotrienols, tocopherols and ferulic acid esters) after incorporation into an oat porridge (oat porridge) compared to unprocessed rice bran extract oil were investigated. The influence of the type of preparation (with water vs. milk) of porridge on the bioavailability of the bioactive compounds was compared. The study followed a single dose (2 g rice bran extract), randomized, three armed crossover study design with â‰¥1-week washout periods. Plasma and urine samples were collected at intervals up to 24 h after intake.</brief_summary>
