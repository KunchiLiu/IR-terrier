	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the potential benefits of participant use of a smartphone application ("App") called COPD Co-Pilot™. When used by the participant, COPD Co-Pilot™ may provide early detection of worsening COPD symptoms. Early symptom detection may allow the pulmonary providers and nurses to respond with timely medical advice and treatment. The goal for use of COPD Co-Pilot™ is to reduce the frequency and duration of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and hospital readmissions. The study will also examine the financial impact of the COPD Co-Pilot™ program to determine whether costs of hospital stays, emergency department visits, and hospital readmissions differ when patients are enrolled in COPD Co-Pilot™ than when they are not enrolled. Another purpose of this study is to measure patient satisfaction with use of COPD Co-Pilot™.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of COPD Co-Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the 6-month observational period, subjects will report respiratory symptoms using COPD Co-Pilot on a daily basis and will receive feedback and clinical recommendations from their health care provider when their symptoms change from their baseline symptoms. Final clinical recommendations, medical advice, diagnoses, and treatment are in the full and sole discretion of the provider. All subjects will receive current standard of care under the supervision of their health care provider. No experimental drugs, dosages, or treatment protocols will be administered at any stage during this trial. Subjects will receive monthly calls to determine whether any changes to the subject's medical history, hospitalization history, medications, etc. have occurred so they may be added to the subject's profile. At approximately 6 months post enrollment, all subjects will have an in person end of study visit.</detailed_description>
