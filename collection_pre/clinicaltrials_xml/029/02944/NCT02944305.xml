	<brief_title>A Predictive Model for Difficult Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To develop a scoring model from multiple airway assessment to predict difficult intubation. Methods: This will be a retrospective analytic study. All airway assessment data from medical records of patients aged more than 18 years old underwent general anesthesia in Srinagarind hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 will be used to develop a new scoring prediction model.</detailed_description>
