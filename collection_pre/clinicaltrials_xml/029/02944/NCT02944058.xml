	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to compare the management of 3 and 4 part proximal humerus fractures (PHF) with an angular stable plate (Philos) with that of an intramedullary nail (Multiloc) in light of complications, radiological, economical, functional and clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plate Fixation Versus Intramedullary Nailing of 3 and 4 Part Proximal Humerus Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial (RCT) from Akershus University Hospital in Norway. Randomization between two implants. The investigators will use deltopectoral or deltoid split as surgical access. All patients will have calcar screws and cuff sutures. When lack of bone for example after decompressing valgus compressed fractures, a bone-substitute might be used in the surgeons preference. Follow up in outpatient clinic at 6, 12, 52 and 104 weeks, but also a 5 year follow up is planned. Postoperative radiographs of both shoulders and CT of operated shoulder will be taken.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients &gt; 18 years 2. Severe displacement, defined as malposition of at least 45⁰ of angular deviation in valgus or 30⁰ in varus in true frontal projection, regardless of whether the fracture is impacted or not. Fractures with more than 50% displacement of the head against the surgical neck 3. The greater or lesser tubercles must be fractured in a 3 or 4part fracture. The degree of displacement is not critical for inclusion. Exclusion criteria: 1. Fracture more than 3 weeks' old 2. Caput humeri just a thin shell or split 3. Ipsilateral damage that will influence the recovery and scoring systems 4. Incapability to protect osteosynthesis, i.e. use of crutches because of injury to lower extremity. 5. Pathological fracture 6. Neurovascular injury 7. Open fracture 8. Noncompliance 9. Congenital anomaly 10. Ongoing infectious process around the incision site for plate osteosynthesis 11. Systemic disease that may influence healing processes or scoring systems (RA/MS) 12. Fracture dislocation 13. Substance abuse 14. Inability to read and understand Norwegian 15. Patients not residing in our catchment area 16. Patients with too small humerus diameter to use a nail 17. Patient not able to commit and understand written consent</criteria>
