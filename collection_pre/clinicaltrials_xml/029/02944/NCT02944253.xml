	<brief_summary>Two dietary approaches, very low energy diets (VLEDs) and ketogenic low carbohydrate diets (KLCDs), have the ability to suppress appetite. The suppression of appetite typically observed during these diets is believed (but not clinically proven) to be due to ketosis, a condition where circulating concentrations of ketone bodies are increased due to a higher production of ketones in the liver. Little is known about the potential mechanisms through which ketosis may lead to appetite suppression in VLEDs and KLCDs. A 'ketogenic diet' typically contains less than 50 grams carbohydrate per day, yet ketosis has been seen in subjects who consume diets with a carbohydrates ranging between 59-192 grams per day. Although an association between ketosis and appetite suppression has been established, the minimum level of ketosis and maximum carbohydrate intake that is still associated with appetite suppression remains unknown and should be explored. The ability to increase carbohydrate intake while maintaining a suppressed appetite will allow dieters to consume more carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for health without feeling more hungry. The aim of this study is, therefore, to identify the maximum carbohydrate intake that is still associated with appetite suppression in a low energy diet and to determine the impact of a higher carbohydrate intake on appetite suppression, body composition, and resting metabolic rate.</brief_summary>
