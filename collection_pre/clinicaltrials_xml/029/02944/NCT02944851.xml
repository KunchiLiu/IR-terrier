	<brief_summary>The aim of this work is determine the more successful noninvasive method by comparison of two noninvasive methods ( IVC ultrasound - noninvasive hemoglobin measurement (SpHb)) that used in the detection of patients with blood loss. The works were completed in 6 months. The study was conducted at the blood donation center. Vital parameters were measured and recorded before making the voluntary blood donation.Following Masimo brand portable device fingers SpHb value was measured.Then IVC diameter of patients in the supine position were measured using ultrasonography. Then he left to donors return in routine blood donation programme. A unit (470ml) of blood were drawn from each donor. After the blood donation process measured and recorded the vital signs again. SpHb was measured noninvasively from finger again. Following these measurements were recorded again by measuring the diameter of IVC.</brief_summary>
