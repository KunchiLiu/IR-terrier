	<brief_title>Clinical Study for Workflow and Performance Evaluation of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH速 SF-5D System for Treating Symptomatic Paroxysmal AF (QDOT-Micro)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the workflow and acute performance , during standard electrophysiology mapping and RF ablation procedures, of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH速 SF-5D catheter with temperature sensing capabilities and micro electrodes used in combination with the CARTO速 3 Navigation System with THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH速 SF-5D-module.</detailed_description>

Subjects with drugrefractory (failed at least one Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs) symptomatic documented PAF who are candidates for catheter ablation 4. Able and willing to comply with all pre, post, and followup testing and requirements (eg. Patient not confined by a court ruling) Eligibility Minimum Age: 18 Years Maximum Age: Gender: Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers?: No Criteria: Candidates for this study must meet ALL of the following criteria: 1. Age 18 or older 2. Patients who have signed the Patient Informed Consent Form (ICF) 3. Subjects with drugrefractory (failed at least one Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs) symptomatic documented PAF who are candidates for catheter ablation 4. Able and willing to comply with all pre, post, and followup testing and requirements (eg. Patient not confined by a court ruling) Candidates for this study will be EXCLUDED from the study if ANY of the following conditions apply: 1. Atrial fibrillation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or reversible or noncardiac cause. 2. Previous ablation for atrial fibrillation. 3. Previously diagnosed with persistent AF. 4. Documented Left Atrial thrombus 5. Any carotid stenting or endarterectomy 6. LA size &gt;50mm 7. LVEF &lt;40% 8. Uncontrolled heart failure or NYHA function class III and IV 9. History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities or contraindication to anticoagulation( heparin, warfarin, or dabigatran) 10. History of a documented thromboembolic event (including TIA) within the past 12 months. 11. Previous PCI/MI within the past 3 months 12. Previous cardiac surgery (e.g CABG) or valvular cardiac surgical/percutaneous procedure (e.g ventriculotomy, atriomy, valve repair or replacement, presence of a prosthetic valve). 13. Awaiting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery within the next 6 months. 14. Unstable angina 15. Significant pulmonary disease (eg, restrictive pulmonary disease, constrictive or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or any other disease or malfunction of the lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms. 16. Acute illness, active systemic infection, or sepsis. 17. Presence of intracardiac thrombus, myxoma, tumor, interatrial baffle or patch or other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation. 18. Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access. 19. Presence of implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) 20. Significant congenital anomaly or a medical problem that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude enrollment in this trial. 21. Currently enrolled in an investigational study evaluating another device, biologics, or drug. 22. Women of child bearing potential whom are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the clinical investigation (as evidenced by pregnancy test if of child bearing potential). 23. Life expectancy less than 12 months. 24. Presenting contraindication for the devices used in the study, as indicated in the respective instructions for use.</criteria>
