	<brief_summary>This randomized prospective study compared three ablation strategies in patients with longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (LPeAF). It also explored the best procedural endpoint from among the following: circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)+left atrial (LA) linear lesions (roof line, mitral isthmus)+complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation, PVI+LA linear lesions +cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation +CFAE ablation, and PVI+CFAE ablation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients were randomized into three ablation groups: group A (n=100): PVI+LA linear ablation (roof line and mitral isthmus) +CFAE ablation; group B (n=100): PVI+linear ablation (roof line, mitral isthmus, and CTI) +CFAE ablation; group C (n=100), PVI+CFAE ablation.</detailed_description>
