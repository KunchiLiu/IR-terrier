	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major disease of harm public health seriously. Although different treatment methods / programs (Western medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Integrative Medicine) exist and are being developed to relieve symptoms and reduce mortality in COPD, most have only been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Most RCT study patients usually require a single disease, the use of standard treatment and a single intervention to evaluate interventions in an ideal state can achieve maximum effect,that is theoretical effect, it is difficult to provide the evidence of practical clinical efficacy or effectiveness. Secondly, RCT often require strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in inadequate representation of the study, thus limiting its conclusions spread to overall. There are some challenges for different treatment methods on the actual effect of the patients in the evaluation of conventional medical practice with RCT. Real World Research based on clinical practice pay close attention highly in response to these problems, and the registry study had been applied widely in clinical practice. With the comparative effectiveness research methods and hospital registration study approach, based on the classes of medications recommended by 2014 GOLD and Chinese Treatment Guidelines for COPD, the purpose of this study is to objectively record the methods, efficacy and its influencing factors of COPD commonly used treatment methods/programs (Western medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Integrative Medicine) in the actual medical environment, analysis of application characteristics for the different programs, and provide the basis for its revision and promotion. This is a first registration study for COPD in China.</detailed_description>
