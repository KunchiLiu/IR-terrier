	<brief_summary>Up to date, devices capable of delivering controlled, calibrated, non-contact cold air stimuli in a MR environment are unavailable for quantitative sensory testing. This project therefore aimed at designing and constructing a novel MR-compatible, computer-controlled cold air stimulation device that produces air puffs in a broad flow and cold temperature range. By means of this device, detailed psychophysically testing and subsequent brain scanning of dentine hypersensitivity (DH) subjects will be possible to gain new insights about DH mechanisms.</brief_summary>
