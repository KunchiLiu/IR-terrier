	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how genetics play a role in psoriasis. Specifically, a genetic allele HLA-Cw6 is known to be assoicated with psoriasis, and this study aims to find out how it affects genetic and protein expression in patients with psoriasis, compared to healthy people, at a single-cell level using a novel flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing protocol.</brief_summary>
