	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a risk factor for carotid atherosclerotic whose progression is associated with an increased risk of vascular events. Investigators assessed prospectively by arterial duplex ultrasonography the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in a cohort of people with diabetes to assess the importance of progression and to analyze the impact of this progression on vascular events. The main hypothesis is that people with carotid atherosclerosis progression are at higher risk of vascular events than those without any progression.</brief_summary>
