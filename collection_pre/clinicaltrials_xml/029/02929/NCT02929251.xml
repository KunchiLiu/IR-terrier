	<brief_summary>RUBI, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to either anakinra, or tocilizumab in refractory Non Infectious Uveitis (NIU). There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory NIU. NIU can cause devastating visual loss and up to 20% of legal blindness. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of refractory/relapsing severe uveitis. The incidence of blindness in NIU has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious uveitis. Contrasting with immunosuppressors, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid's sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma. Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in uveitis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.</brief_summary>

Currently uncontrolled uveitic disease. Uncontrolled uveitic disease is defined as fulfilling of the two following criteria at Inclusion: Active inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions OR Vitreous haze grade &gt;1+ according to the SUN National Eye Institute (NEI) Scoring for Vitreous Haze 4. Are receiving prednisone ≥10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) and at least 1 other systemic immunosuppressant, or, . Are receiving IFNalpha or, To be intolerant to immunosuppressant 5. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by ETDRS of 20/20 to 20/400 (approximately 85 to 20 letters) in the study eye 6. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by ETDRS of 20/20 or better in the fellow eye (approximately 20 letters) 7.

Adequate contraceptive measures include hormonal methods used for two or more cycles prior to Screening (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly, or condom used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine methods (IUD), sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner), and abstinence. 1. Infectious uveitis, masquerade syndromes, or uveitis due to causes other than non infectious uveitis disease (idiopathic uveitis is permitted) 2. Isolated anterior uveitis 3. Presence of cataract or posterior capsular opacification so severe that an assessment of the posterior segment of either eye is inadequate or impossible 4. Contraindication to mydriasis in either eye or presence of posterior synechiae in the study eye such that mydriasis is inadequate for posterior segment examination 5. Intraocular pressure ≥ 25 mmHg by Goldmann tonometry or advanced glaucoma (e.g., cuptodisc ratio &gt; 0.9, split fixation on visual field, or need for &gt; 3 intraocular pressure lowering medications to keep Intra Occular Pressure (IOP) &lt; 22 mmHg) in either eye 6. Monocular patient 7. Active tuberculosis or history of untreated tuberculosis 8. Known positive syphilis serology, HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen or antinucleocapsid antibody of hepatitis B virus, and/or hepatitis C antibody. 9. History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Inclusion other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix or adequately treated, nonmetastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 10. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibodies 11. Infectious disease: Fever or infection requiring treatment with antibiotics within 3 weeks prior to Inclusion History of recurrent infection or predisposition to infection 12. Known immunodeficiency 13. History of multiple sclerosis and/or demyelinating disorder 14.

Live seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccines are permitted ≥ 2 weeks prior to Inclusion. 16. Use of the following ocular treatments during the specified periods: Previous anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) intravitreal therapy within 3 months prior to Inclusion, or anticipated use during the study period Treatment with dexamethasone intravitreal implant [Ozurdex®]) within 6 months prior to Inclusion Intravitreal corticosteroids within 3 months prior to Inclusion.
