	<brief_summary>The cycloergometer is a mechanical device consisting of a bicycle frame fixed on a support base, designed to measure the amount of muscle work performed during exercise and the resistance to pedaling. The cycloergometer has been already employed in many fields of medicine. However, up to date, a little use of cycloergometer in the management of chronic joint diseases has been documented and scientific studies have not clarified if cycloergometer is effective in these diseases and, particularly, in Rotator Cuff Tear patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cycloergometer and Rotator Cuff Tear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effects of cycloergometer on pain during activities (primary outcome) and shoulder functionality, the investigators performed a prospective randomized controlled study (pilot study) in patients with a symptomatic full-thickness RCT. Since cycloergometer works through a continuous active and passive joint mobilization, the investigators expect it can reduce pain and improve shoulder functionality becoming a useful tool for physicians in the management of RCT patients.</detailed_description>
