	<brief_summary>These last years, it has been proven that the solicitation of a muscle using vibration may lead to positive effects on the neuromuscular function. Thus, the aim of the current study is to assess if the addition of local vibration training sessions on the quadriceps muscle to the classic readaptation program (i.e. physiotherapist sessions) may allow a better recuperation 2 months after the surgery and the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. The aim of the vibration training proposed in the current study is to allow a better recuperation 2 months after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction when compared with conventional physiotherapy alone.</brief_summary>
