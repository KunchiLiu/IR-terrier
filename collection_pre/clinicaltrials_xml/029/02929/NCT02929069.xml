	<brief_summary>The intent of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a principle-based, transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention that addresses the pathways through which minority stress compromises young gay and bisexual men's (YGBM) co-occurring mental (e.g., depression), behavioral (e.g., substance use), and sexual (e.g., condomless anal sex) health problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Unified Intervention for Young Gay and Bisexual Men's Minority Stress, Mental Health, and HIV Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men) is a 10-session skills-building intervention designed to reduce young gay and bisexual men's (YGBM) co-occurring health risks by reducing the underlying cognitive, affective, and behavioral pathways through which minority stress impairs YGBM's health. ESTEEM is based on the Unified Protocol, a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach with efficacy across mental health and risk behaviors. In an initial study to create ESTEEM , the Unified Protocol was adapted by conducting interviews with 21 YGBM-expert mental health providers and 20 depressed, anxious YGBM at high risk for HIV infection. In a preliminary trial (NCT02448186), ESTEEM significantly reduced YGBM's spectrum of interrelated health threats, making it the first evidence-based intervention to simultaneously improve mental health, substance use, and sexual health outcomes among YGBM. Important questions remain in order to validate the efficacy and potential cost-effectiveness of ESTEEM. Accordingly, we propose a 3-arm RCT that would examine (1) whether ESTEEM (arm 1) demonstrates significant improvements compared to existing LGBT-affirmative community mental health treatment (CMHT; arm 2) or standard HIV/STD voluntary counseling and testing (VCT; arm 3) for high-risk depressed and anxious YGBM and (2) whether it improves outcomes through reducing hypothesized cognitive, affective, and behavioral minority stress processes.</detailed_description>
