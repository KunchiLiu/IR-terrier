	<brief_title>Satiety and Glucose Indices in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are randomly assigned (double blinded) to 300 mg SC, 500 mg SC or placebo using a cross-over design on three different days (1 month wash out). Subjects consuming a capsule containing placebo or treatment(s) are examined before and after a fixed breakfast meal (50% carbohydrate; 30% fat; 20% protein). Subjective appetite sensations are rated using visual analog scales (VAS) for hunger, satiety, fullness, and prospective food intake. In addition, the desire for specific tastes is analyzed and measurements are taken twice before breakfast (fasting baseline). After baseline screening and blood draw, postprandial appetite and taste perception ratings and blood will be obtained at multiple time points during the 3 hour postprandial period (30, 60, 90, 120,180 min). Blood will be analyzed for glucose/insulin, gut peptides, and other markers in response to the meal.</detailed_description>
