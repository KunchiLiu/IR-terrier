	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed study is to assess the clinical effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT)using LED on dentin with carious lesions in permanent teeth. Patients with molars exhibiting deep carious lesions on the occlusal surface indicated for restorative treatment will be randomly allocated to two groups: Group 1 -Control after incomplete caries removal,indirect pulp treatment with calcium hydroxide(CH); Group 2 - PDT + CH after incomplete caries removal,disinfect the residual dentin with PDT(LED + methylene),then indirect pulp treatment with CH. Dentin samples will be removed before and after PDT for microbiological analysis. The microbiological samples will be cultured in Brucella blood agar, Mitis Salivarius-bacitracin agar and Rogosa Selective Lactobacillus agar. The teeth will then be restored using resin with clinical and radiographic follow up at six, 12 and 24 months. The data will be submitted to descriptive statistics.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria consisted of good general health, without syndromes or chronic systemic diseases. They should also have at least one molar with deep carious lesion (2/3 of dentin) without pain symptomatology and compatible with reversible pulpits. People who refused to sign the informed consent document,who was allergic to photosensitizer, whose teeth had the treatment choice changed (pain or evolution to irreversible pulpits), who did not attend to the appointments for the scheduled treatments, or who needed antibiotics treatment for other medical reasons were excluded from the study without prejudice.</criteria>
