	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm clinical registry investigating the safety and efficacy of polymer-free sirolimus-eluting coronary stent system (NANO plus) in patients with coronary artery disease . In total, we plan to recruit 2500 patients in real world setting. The patients will be followed clinically at 1-, 6- month and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year. All clinical data will be collected and managed by statistical center, clinical endpoint adjudication committee.</detailed_description>
