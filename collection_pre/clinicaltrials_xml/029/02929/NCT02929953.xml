	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are: 1. To assess the prevalence of prematurity, especially early prematurity, among T1D patients, and compare it to the prematurity prevalence among the non-diabetic general population in Israel. 2. To characterize epidemiological and clinical factors that differ between premature-born patients that developed T1D and those that have not, including the nutritional and therapeutic properties in NICU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prematurity Prevalence Among T1D Patients and Its Characteristics Compared With Premature-born Non-diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A national cohort study, including linkage of data from 13 pediatric diabetes centers and Israeli National Registries, including all patients with T1D born during 1990-2013. Data collected includes: ethnicity, gestational age, birth season, age and season at T1DM diagnosis, and presence of autoimmunity in family. The prevalence of prematurity among T1D is compared to the non-diabetic general population registry of 2000-2013. Additional comparisons are between T1D patients born term and preterm, aimed to unveil specific influencing clinical and epidemiological factors. In the latter part of the study, a multi-centered, paired case-control study is performed. Preterm born T1D patients will be paired to matched non-diabetic children at a ratio of 3:1, according to medical center, sex, gestational week of birth, season and year of birth. Data collected includes: ethnicity, family history of autoimmune diseases, age and type of first enteral nutrition, and pharmacological exposures.</detailed_description>
