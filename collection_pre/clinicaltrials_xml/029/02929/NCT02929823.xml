	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of SJP-0035 Ophthalmic Solution in Patients With Moderate to Severe Corneal Epithelial Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are currently no approved products available anywhere worldwide for the treatment of corneal epithelial disorders that directly affect the epithelia. A Phase 1 study, Study SJP-0035/1-01, was conducted in healthy volunteers to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution, and to determine the appropriate dose to be evaluated in patients with moderate to severe corneal epithelial disorders. A Phase 2a study, Study SJP-0035/2-01, was conducted in patients with corneal epithelial disorders to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SJP-0035. This Phase 2a study (Study SJP-0035/2-02) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution in patients with corneal epithelial disorders. The study will evaluate if SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution is able to promote corneal epithelial wound healing in patients with corneal epithelial disorders using 2 doses of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution (0.0002% and 0.001%) that are lower than what was used in the previous Phase 2a study (Study SJP-0035/2-01; 0.005%).</detailed_description>
