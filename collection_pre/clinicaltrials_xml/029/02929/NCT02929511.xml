	<brief_summary>In this study, the researchers will investigate the effect of single-file reciprocating versus single-file rotational file systems on the postoperative pain in adult patients who have necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis. The participants will be assigned by chance to separate groups that compare 2 different treatments, reciprocating single-file system (Reciproc Blue) and rotational single-file system (OneShape).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reciprocation vs Rotational Single-file Systems in Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The infected root canal treatments will be performed using one-visit approach with either a reciprocating single-file system or a continuous rotational single-file system. (Reciproc Blue reciprocating single-file system vs OneShape rotational single-file system). The root canals will be completed in single-visit. The patients will record their postoperative pain during the follow-up period using a VAS scale.</detailed_description>
