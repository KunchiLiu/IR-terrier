	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy males aged 30 to 65 years. Body mass index 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2. Genotyped with regard to their CYP2D6 status. Participation in a clinical research study within the previous 3 months Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background radiation but including diagnostic xrays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5 mSv in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 5 years. No occupationally exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, shall participate in the study. Regular alcohol consumption in males &gt;21 units per week. Current smokers and those who have smoked within the last 12 months. Evidence of renal impairment at screening, as indicated by an estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) of &lt;90 mL/min using the CockcroftGault equation. Use of CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers in the 28 days prior to IMP administration</criteria>
