	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators are looking at how people make decisions about reward-related items, both monetary and food related after taking either the dopamine agonist bromocriptine or the COMT inhibitor tolcapone, in healthy control subjects. Subjects will fill self-report questionnaires and undergo an MRI scan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dopaminergic Modulation of Frontostriatal Function With a Dopamine Agonist and COMT Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to understand how the brain's dopamine system impacts monetary and food-related decision making. The investigators aim to use tolcapone and bromocriptine due to the temporary change in the levels of dopamine in the brain. The investigators also aim to determine if genetics, personality traits, or a family history of alcoholism change how these drugs affect decision making.</detailed_description>
