	<brief_title>Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management (GOULD) a Registry of High Cardiovascular Risk Subjects in the United States</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multicenter observational cohort study with retrospective component/chart review of ASCVD subjects that is designed to describe practice patterns of cholesterol management in such subjects in the US. Up to 1 year of retrospective lipid treatment, lipid measurement patterns, and CV data in subjects with ASCVD meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at enrolled clinical sites will be captured. The retrospective data collection is being performed for the following reasons: - Capture relevant factors related to subject's CV risk and pertinent medical history. - Capture changes in LLT over time as related to the subject's clinical condition and medical history and adverse events to LLT Eligible subjects will be invited to enroll in chronological order of attending the clinic. The study will enroll 3 subject cohorts with the following rationale: 1) the first cohort will consist of approximately 500 subjects on PCSK9i at the time of enrollment. The goal is to include a large enough cohort of patients receiving PCSK9i in real world clinical practice; this will allow (for the first time) to better understand the characteristics of those patients whose treatment is escalated to include PCSK9i, the therapeutic effects of PCSK9i outside of the randomized clinical trial settings, and over a prolonged duration of follow up; 2) the second cohort will enroll approximately 2000 subjects with LDL-C levels. 100 mg/dL. The purpose is to include a large group of patients with established ASCVD and suboptimal LDL control. - To better understand the treatment patterns and rates of CV events in this group; 3) the third group will enroll approximately 2500 subjects with LDL-C levels between 70 and 99 mg/dL. The purpose is to include a large group of patients with established ASCVD and more optimal control of LDL. - To better understand patient characteristics, lipid-lowering treatment management, rates of CV events, and potential opportunities for further LLT optimization in this group. Interactive voice response system will be used to track the number of subjects in each cohort. Once a cohort is filled, no more subjects may be enrolled into it. After the first subject is enrolled and annually thereafter, physicians will fill out a questionnaire on their general use of LLT type and dose and their overall goals of lipid management. The study specific data collection points are aligned with the standard of care physician scheduled visits. Each subject will be followed through a systematic series of medical chart reviews conducted at participating clinical sites. Initial chart reviews will occur at subject enrollment with subsequent scanning of charts occurring at the site every 6 months thereafter. In addition, questionnaires will be administered to subjects every 6 months via a CATI system (wherein an interviewer will ask the subject a series of standard questions) to determine general perceptions and attitudes towards LLT. The order of questions in the questionnaire will be based on subject response. This will facilitate reports of the number of inpatient visits, outpatient visits, outpatient procedures, diagnostic tests, prescription and nonprescription medication use in the prior 6 months. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires even if they do not routinely see the enrolling physician or if they have switched providers.</detailed_description>
