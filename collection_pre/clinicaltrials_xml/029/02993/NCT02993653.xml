	<brief_title>Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Protocol in Cervix Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy 1. intensity-modulated radiotherapy of whole pelvis: 60 Gy in 30 fx Re-simulation with pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging at 46 Gy in 23 fx and intensity-modulated radiotherapy on the gross cervical and nodal tumor (initially Positron emission tomography-positive), 14 Gy in 7 fx 2. intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost of gross cervical tumor or Intra-cavitary radiotherapy (ICR) - Re-staging pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging , if complete response occurs Intra-cavitary radiotherapy to A point, 25 Gy in 5 fx for 2 weeks - Re-staging pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging I, partial response or stable disease occurs intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost , 10 Gy in 4 fx to the gross cervical tumor for 1 week</detailed_description>
