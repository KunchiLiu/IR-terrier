	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the CYD dengue vaccine when administered concomitantly or sequentially with Gardasil速 (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16, and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant). Primary objectives: - To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of geometric mean titers[GMTs]) to Gardasil after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of Gardasil. - To demonstrate that the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with Gardasil measured 28 days after the last dose of the CYD dengue vaccine. Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of seroconversion) to Gardasil after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of Gardasil - To describe the humoral immune response to Gardasil at baseline and after each dose of Gardasil in each and any group - To describe the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine at baseline and after each dose of the CYD dengue vaccine in each and any group - To describe the safety of Gardasil and the CYD dengue vaccine after each and any dose in each group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All study participants will receive 3 doses of the CYD dengue vaccine and 2 doses of Gardasil administered either concomitantly or sequentially, They will be assessed for CYD immunogenicity and human papilloma virus (HPV) immunogenicity and safety up to 6 months after the last injection.</detailed_description>
