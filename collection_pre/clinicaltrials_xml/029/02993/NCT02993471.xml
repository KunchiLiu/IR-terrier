	<brief_summary>This study is known as a "drug interaction study." The purpose is to learn about how ixekizumab may affect the blood levels of a mixture of commonly used drugs (caffeine, omeprazole, warfarin, dextromethorphan, and midazolam) that are metabolized by cytochrome P450. Each participant will complete two study periods. Participants will take the mixture of commonly used drugs (plus vitamin K) by mouth on 3 occasions (prior to treatment with ixekizumab and after 1 and 12 weeks of treatment with ixekizumab). The study will last about 17 weeks, including follow-up. Screening must be completed prior to study start.</brief_summary>
