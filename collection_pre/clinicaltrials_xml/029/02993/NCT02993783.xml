	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the initial activity, tolerability, safety and to identify a recommended dose and regimen of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) administered for treatment of steroid-refractory acute intestinal GvHD in participants who have undergone allo-HSCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose-Finding Study of Vedolizumab for Treatment of Steroid-Refractory Acute Intestinal Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GvHD) in Participants Who Have Undergone Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Allo-HSCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. This study will look at the tolerability and effectiveness of vedolizumab IV in participants with acute intestinal GvHD who have received no systemic therapy for the treatment of acute GvHD (prophylaxis acceptable) other than corticosteroids. The study will enroll approximately 38 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups: - Vedolizumab IV 300 mg - Vedolizumab IV 600 mg All participants will be infused intravenously at the same time each day throughout the study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in multiple countries. The overall time to participate in this study is 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Recipient of 1 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) but not more than 1 (alloHSCT). 2. Has primary steroidrefractory intestinal graftversushost disease (GvHD). Steroidrefractory disease is defined as worsening or no improvement in 5 to 7 days of treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg or equivalent or lack of a complete response (CR) after 14 days of primary treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg or equivalent. Note that participants who develop intestinal GvHD while receiving systemic therapy for other GvHD are still eligible after 5 to 7 days, even if the intestinal GvHD has not been present for the entire duration. Participants who may have received an increase in their steroid dose treatment (e.g., increased methylprednisolone from 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg) before enrollment will be eligible, provided the participant has met the definition of steroid refractory above. 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 3. 4. Evidence of myeloid engraftment defined by absolute neutrophil count â‰¥0.5*109/L on 3 consecutive days. 1. Presence of chronic GvHD at Screening (including acutechronic overlap syndrome). 2. Relapse of underlying malignant disease after alloHSCT. 3. Hyperacute GvHD defined as onset of GvHD within the first 15 days following hematopoietic stem cell infusion. 4. Received systemic agents other than corticosteroids for treatment of acute GvHD. GvHD prophylaxis agents (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) may be continued. 5. Acute steroidresistant GvHD beyond 28 days from primary treatment. 6. Life expectancy of &lt;3 weeks.</criteria>
