This includes, but is not limited to, acute hepatitis A infection (immunoglobulin M), drug or alcohol related liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, primary biliary cirrhosis, or any other nonHCV liver disease that is considered clinically significant by the investigator Evidence of hepatic decompensation as assessed with ChildPugh Class B or C or any of the following: history or current clinical evidence of ascites, bleeding varices, or hepatic encephalopathy</criteria>
