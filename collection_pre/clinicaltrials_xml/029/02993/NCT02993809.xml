	<criteria>Limb ischemia patients(e.g. arteriosclerosis obliterans,diabetic critical limb ischemia, thromboangitis obliterans) 1. 18 Years to 80 Years (Adult, Senior); 2. Have ability to understand and comply with the study requirements, and provide the written informed consent prior to any procedures ; 3. Patient meets at least one of the following diagnostic criteria for the index limb: 1. ABI&lt;0.7mmHg 2. TcpO2 &lt;40 mm Hg 3. Or, nonhealing ulcer due to local arterial compromise with no opportunity for revascularization; 4. Have no improvement after conservative treatment and are not suitable for surgical bypass surgery because no outflow tract of diseased vessel can be found by imaging; 5. Despite having good outflow artery, but the elderly and frail patients can also not tolerate revascularization or interventional surgery; 6. Unlikelihood of major amputation of the leg during the next 12 months; 7. Expected life span more than 2 years. 1. Pregnant or lactating; 2. Diabetics with poorly controlled blood glucose levels (defined as HbA1cï¼ž7% and/or proliferative retinopathy); 3. Patients with decompensated cardiac, renal or liver disease; 4. Patients with confirmed malignant tumor; 5. Subjects are with serious heart, liver, kidney and lung failure or under poor general condition that are inability to undergo bone marrow harvesting and transplantation; 6. Known or suspected disease of the immune system or osteomyelitis; 7. Inability to sign informed consent form and to comply with the schedule of the study; 8. There has reason to suspect that the patient is forced to join the study; 9. Any other condition, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the patient unsuitable for the study.</criteria>
