	<brief_summary>The main autoimmune bullous dermatoses are pemphigus and cicatricial pemphigoid. Pemphigus is an autoimmune dermatological disease characterized by the production of anti-desmoclesin antibodies 1 and 3, affecting the skin and mucous membranes.The cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune dermatological disease, characterized by the production of anti-zone antibodies of the basal membrane and characterized by a predominant mucosal involvement. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an increasingly used form of corticosteroid. Despite its increasing use, pharmacokinetics in autoimmune bullous dermatosis remain little studied.</brief_summary>
