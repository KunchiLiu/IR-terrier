	<brief_summary>Maturity level of dendritic cells (DC) plays a pivotal role in initiating and regulating autoimmunity. In Graves' disease (GD), DCs have more active immune responses than those in healthy subjects. Our previous study demonstrated immunoregulatory effects of in vitro 1,25-D3 on maturation of DC in GD patients. This study aims to evaluate the effect of oral 1α-D3 on DC maturation in GD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Oral Alfacalcidol On Maturation Of Dendritic Cells In Graves' Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Graves' disease were divided into two groups: groups receiving oral 1α-D3 in addition to propylthiouracil (PTU) and groups receiving placebos in addition to PTU. Comparison of DC maturation were performed before and after the oral 1α-D3. DC maturation was assessed based on the expression of DC markers (HLA-DR, CD80, CD40, CD83, CD14 and CD206) and the ratio of cytokines interleukin-12/IL-10.</detailed_description>
