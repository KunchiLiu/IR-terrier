	<brief_title>Impact of Melatonin on IVF/ICSI Outcomes in Prospective Poor Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prospective poor responders have been associated with lower number and poorer oocyte quality. Melatonin is suggested to have antioxidative effects which may contribute to improving the IVF/ICSI outcomes in this group of patients who expected to have poor outcomes. However, the expected beneficial effects of melatonin have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of melatonin administration on IVF/ICSI outcomes namely the total number and quality of the oocytes and embryos in the prospective poor responders. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is used to investigate the impact of melatonin on the IVF/ICSI outcomes.</detailed_description>
