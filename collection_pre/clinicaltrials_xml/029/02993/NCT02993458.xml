	<brief_title>DASH-Sodium Trial in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Camp DASH study is a controlled trial. the aim of which is to compare the effect of two dietary patterns and two levels of sodium intake on blood pressure and blood lipids in adolescents in the upper third of distribution for blood pressure. The study also assesses whether influences on blood pressure and blood lipids of dietary interventions vary according to sex, race/ethnic groups, baseline levels, and other personal characteristics. The proposed dietary interventions of DASH dietary patterns and sodium reduction have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure in adults. The two dietary patterns are based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial in adults. They are a Usual diet typical of what many American adolescents eat, and a DASH‐type diet. The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low‐fat dairy foods and low in saturated fat and total fat compared to the Usual diet. The two sodium levels are High reflecting current US consumption and Low reflecting current recommended intake levels. Weight will be held constant by adjusting energy intake. The study participants will live in a residence hall on the Purdue campus where all food and beverages will be provided, and meals and snacks will be supervised.</detailed_description>
