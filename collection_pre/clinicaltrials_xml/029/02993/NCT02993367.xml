	<brief_summary>Vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND) is very common among the aged and tends to progress to dementia, but there have been no proper large-scale intervention trials dedicated to it. VCIND caused by subcortical ischemic small vessel disease (hereinafter, subcortical VCIND) represents a relatively homogeneous disease process and is a suitable target for therapeutic trials investigating VCIND. Preclinical trials showed that Butylphthalide Soft Capsules is effective for cognitive impairment of vascular origin. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the investigators apply fMRI study the effects of Butylphthalide Soft Capsules in patients with VCIND.</brief_summary>
