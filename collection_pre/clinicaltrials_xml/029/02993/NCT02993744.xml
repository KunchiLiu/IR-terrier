	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Cortisone influences the maternal number of leukocytes and CRP of a pregnant woman. Because of that, it is difficult to know if the medical treatment of an infection was successful and accordingly if the diagnosis was justified. METHODS In this study, the blood results of 75 pregnant women under threat of preterm delivery (week of gestation 23+0 to 34+6), treated with Betamethasone will be analysed. 65 pregnant women without complications serve as control group.</detailed_description>
