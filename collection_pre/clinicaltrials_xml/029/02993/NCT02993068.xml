	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to test the effects of online genetic education alone or in combination with telephone genetic counseling in order to compare the two methods and the stress a person feels about their risk of cancer. Researchers also want to learn how these strategies may improve participant's understanding of genetics, participant's ability to complete a quiz about genetics, and participant's quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups Support and education about genetic testing is usually given before and after genetic testing is done. Researchers in this study will look at how combining different interventions before and after testing may help participants improve understanding. If participant is eligible to take part in this study and participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of the dice) to 1 of 4 study groups: - Participants in Group A will watch an online educational video before the testing, and receive an online test results report after the testing. - Participants in Group B will watch an online educational video before the testing, and receive an online test results report with telephone genetic counseling after the testing. - Participants in Group C will watch an online educational video with telephone genetic counseling before the testing, and receive an online test results report with telephone genetic counseling after the testing. - Participants in Group D will watch an online educational video with telephone genetic counseling before the testing, and receive an online test results report after the testing. Please note that if participant tests positive for a genetic mutation, participant will be prompted to speak to a genetic counselor, no matter which group participant is assigned. A study genetic counselor will be available to speak to participant if participant desires, regardless of the study group participant is in. Informed Consent Comprehension Questions: After reading this informed consent, participant will be asked 5 questions about the information in this informed consent to help ensure that participant has understood this information. Participant must answer those questions correctly in order to electronically sign this consent and begin the study. Baseline Questionnaire: If participant is approved to sign this informed consent based on the results of the above informed consent questions, participant will receive an e-mail with a link to complete the baseline questionnaire. All questionnaires will be completed through REDCap, a secure, web-based application used to collect data for research studies that participant can access from participant's phone, tablet, or computer. These will include questions about decision-making, stress and anxiety, participant's well-being, and participant's genetic and cancer- risk knowledge. The questionnaires will take about 20 minutes to complete. Participant must complete these questionnaires in order to move on to the next part of the study. The Genetic Testing and Counseling/Education Process: - After completing the baseline questionnaires, participant will receive an e-mail to connect participant to the website for Color Genomics, the company that will provide the genetic testing services for this study. - Participant will watch a welcome video, which will provide information about genetics, the genes and genetic mutations that will be tested, and possible test results. - After watching the welcome video, participant will be directed to create a personal Color Genomics account that will allow participant to enter participant's personal and family history information, keep track of participant's genetic testing kit, and receive participant's genetic test results. Participant will provide participant's contact information (including shipping address), as well as the name and contact information for participant's local doctor. Any and all information participant provides to Color Genomics will be shared with the MD Anderson research team. - Participants in Group C and Group D will then make an appointment with a genetic counselor before beginning the genetic testing process. Participants in Groups A and B will be provided with the option to speak to a genetic counselor if they want to, but will not be required to do so for this study. - Participant will be mailed an FDA-approved saliva collection kit from Color Genomics. When participant receives it in the mail, participant will use the kit's unique barcode number to activate it and link it to participant's online account. A video on the website will show participant how to provide a large enough saliva sample. It will also contain instructions for how to properly package and mail participant's kit back to Color Genomics, using a pre-paid shipping package. Getting the Test Results: It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results back from this genetic test. Participant will receive an email, letting participant know that participant's results are available for review through participant's Color Genomics account. Genetic Counseling: Participants in Groups B and C will need to make an appointment with a genetic counselor before viewing the genetic test results. Participants in Groups A and D will be able to view their results online without speaking to a genetic counselor, but participant will be given the option to speak to a genetic counselor if participant would like. Participant will be given contact information for a local genetic counselor. Depending on the results of participant's genetic testing, the study staff may attempt to schedule a post-test telephone genetic counseling call 3 times. If participant does not respond to the study staff to schedule the call within 1 week after the third attempt, the study staff will deliver the results online with a note to please call and schedule a counseling session. Participant will also be given the option to schedule a phone call with a genetic counselor on the Color Genomics website if participant wants to speak to a genetic counselor at any point during the study. Participant's genetic test results will be shared with the MD Anderson research team. Follow-up Questionnaires: Participant will be contacted by e-mail to complete quality-of-life questionnaires at 3 time- points. Participant will be asked to complete the questionnaires through the REDCap online database at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after having received participant's genetic test results. The questionnaires should be completed within 1 month (for the first one) or 3 months (for the other two) after participant receives the email. Participant will be sent reminder emails if these questionnaires have not been completed in time. It should take participant no more than 20 minutes to complete each questionnaire. Length of Study: Total participation on this study will last about 2 years, including follow-up. Participant may be contacted regarding participation in future studies. This is an investigational study. The saliva-testing kit and genetic testing done in this study is FDA approved and will be processed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory. Up to 3000 participants will be enrolled in this study.</detailed_description>
