	<brief_title>Creatine Supplementation in Patients With Intermittent Claudication.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study will be to verify the effect of creatine supplementation associated to clinical treatment of the functional capacity in patients with intermittent claudication. The sample will be composed by patients with intermittent claudication of both sexes. The patients will be ramdomized in a double-blind procedure to receive during seven days (loading) and posteriorly 49 days (maintenance) a creatine (Cr) supplementation or placebo (PLA), associated to the clinical treatment. Before ("baseline"), after "loading" period and after the maintenance period of supplementation, the patients will go through a functional capacity evaluation. The fuctional capacity evaluation will be evaluated by a six minute-walking test. For statistical analysis it will be used the ANOVA of two factors for repeated measurements, having the (Cr and PLA) group and the time (pre, post-loading and post-maintenance), and when needed the post-hoc of Newman keuls. The adopted level of significance will be P&lt;0.05.</detailed_description>
