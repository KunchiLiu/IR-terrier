	<brief_title>Effect of Alternate Therapies on Intraocular Pressure in Ocular Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>11 patients were recruited from Temple Ophthalmology between 2014 and 2016. Patients had ocular hypertension and were between the ages of 48-74. Patients were excluded if they currently performed ANB or FR, were unable to perform the task, had previous eye surgery or laser, were receiving other CAM for ocular hypertension, or were unable to complete a washout period. After a 30-day drug washout, patients completed either ANB or FR. After instruction, the assigned task was performed for 5 minutes. FR was done on a commercially available foot reflexology board (JAPAN TSUBO HH-700) focused at the base of the second and third toes of both feet. Two weeks later, patients completed the alternate task. IOP was measured before the task, immediately after the task and then every 30 minutes for two hours. Sign rank tests were used to evaluate IOP changes within and between each group.</detailed_description>
