	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using Chondro-Gide® collagen membrane either sutured or glued compared to microfracture alone in the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Chondro-Gide® to Microfracture Alone for Treatment of Knee Cartilage Defects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Prospective, randomized, active treatment-controlled, open-label multicenter study (up to 40 sites in the US and EU). - All subjects that meet preoperative screening eligibility criteria will be randomized to treatment with Chondro-Gide® either sutured or glued or Microfracture alone. - Eligible and consenting subjects are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using centralized randomization list to receive one of the following treatments: Group I: Microfracture alone; Group II: Microfracture covered with a Chondro-Gide® membrane glued with fibrin glue (AMIC glued); Group III: Microfracture covered with a Chondro-Gide® membrane sutured (AMIC sutured) - All subjects will be assessed at intervals post-procedure (6 weeks, 3 months, and 1,2 and 5 years). - Subjects will be required to follow a strict pre-specified post-surgery rehabilitation protocol specific to the defect location. - Measures to assess effectiveness and safety will be conducted at all follow-ups. - Safety will be assessed by the collection of adverse events at all timepoints.</detailed_description>
