	<brief_summary>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive and rare cancer of myeloid cells (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). Successful treatment of AML is dependent on what subtype of AML the patient has, and the age of the patient when diagnosed. Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding venetoclax to azacitidine works better than azacitidine on its own. This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment is unknown to patients and doctors) study in patients with AML who are 60 or more years old and have not been treated before. Patients who take part in this study should not be suitable for standard induction therapy (usual starting treatment). AbbVie is funding this study which will take place at approximately 150 hospitals globally and enrol approximately 400 patients. In this study, 2/3 of patients will receive venetoclax every day with azacitidine and the remaining 1/3 will receive placebo (dummy) tablets with azacitidine. Patients will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires. Blood and bone marrow tests will be completed to see why some people respond better than others. Additional blood tests will be completed for genetic factors and to see how long the drug remains in the body.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant must have confirmation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and be ineligible for treatment with a standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction regimen due age or comorbidities. Participant must be &gt;= 18 years of age. Participant must have a projected life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Participant must be considered ineligible for induction therapy defined by the following: a. &gt;= 75 years of age; or b. &gt;= 18 to 74 years of age with at least one of the following comorbidities: i. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 2 or 3; ii. Cardiac history of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) requiring treatment or Ejection Fraction &lt;= 50% or chronic stable angina; iii.

Moderate hepatic impairment with total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to &lt;= 3.0 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN); vi. Any other comorbidity that the physician judges to be incompatible with intensive chemotherapy must be reviewed and approved by the AbbVie Therapeutic Medical Director before study enrollment. Participant must have an ECOG Performance status: 1. 0 to 2 for Participants &gt;= 75 years of age or 2. 0 to 3 for Participants &gt;= 18 to 74 years of age. Participant must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a creatinine &gt;= 30 mL/min; calculated by the Cockroft Gault formula or measured by 24 hours urine collection. Participant must have adequate liver function as demonstrated by: 1. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 3.0 x ULN* 2. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 3.0 x ULN* 3. bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN* * Unless considered to be due to leukemic organ involvement i. Subjects who are &lt; 75 years of age may have a bilirubin of &lt;= 3.0 x ULN Female participants must be either postmenopausal defined as: 1. Age &gt; 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause. 2. Age ≤ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause AND an FSH level &gt; 40 IU/L; or 3. Permanently surgical sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy); or 4. Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) practicing at least one protocol specified method of birth control, starting at Study Day 1 through at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Male Participants who are sexually active, must agree, from Study Day 1 through at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug, to practice the protocol specified contraception. Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation from initial study drug administration through at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Female participants of childbearing potential must have negative results for pregnancy test performed: 1. At Screening with a serum sample obtained within 14 days prior to the first study drug administration, and 2. Prior to dosing with urine sample obtained on Cycle 1 Day 1, if it has been &gt; 7 days since obtaining the serum pregnancy test results. Participant must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent, approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any screening or studyspecific procedures. Participant has received treatment with the following: 1. A hypomethylating agent and/or chemo therapeutic agent for Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 2. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)T cell therapy or other experimental therapies. 3. Experimental therapies for MDS or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Participant has history of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Participant has the following: a. Favorable risk cytogenetics such as t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16) or t(15;;17) as per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Version 2, 2016 for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
