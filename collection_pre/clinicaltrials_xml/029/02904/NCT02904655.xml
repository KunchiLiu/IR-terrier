	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized, crossover meal-replacement pilot intervention to determine feasibility of a larger scale dietary trial in asthma and gather preliminary evidence for the impact of a healthy diet on asthma outcomes. Participants with doctor-diagnosed asthma were randomized to crossover trial of a 4-week dietary intervention or usual diet with a 4-week washout period. During the dietary intervention, all meals and snacks were provided by the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of a randomized, controlled clinical trial of a dietary intervention in a population of adults with asthma and to determine sample size estimates for a larger, more definitive trial aimed at improving asthma clinical outcomes and improving markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The study uses a feeding trial design comprised of a 4 week dietary intervention in which all meals are provided to study participants and a 4 week control diet comprised of usual dietary intake. Participants are randomized to the intervention or control diet and then cross over to the alternate assignment after a 4 week washout period.</detailed_description>
