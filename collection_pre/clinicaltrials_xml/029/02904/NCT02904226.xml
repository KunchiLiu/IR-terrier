	<brief_summary>JTX-2011-101 is a Phase 1/2, open label, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of JTX-2011 alone or in combination with a fixed dose of nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation and Expansion of JTX-2011 Alone or in Combination With Anti-PD-1 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JTX-2011 is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Inducible CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human (FIH) clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of the ICOS agonist monoclonal antibody JTX-2011 alone or in combination with a fixed dose of nivolumab in adult subjects with advanced refractory solid tumors. The study will be conducted in four parts: single agent (Part A) and combination therapy (Part B) dose escalation, and expansion cohorts of single agent (Part C) and combination therapy (Part D).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Must be willing and able to participate and comply with all trial requirements and able to provide signed and dated informed consent prior to initiation of any trial procedures; 2. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer that is recurrent, metastatic, or persistent after at least one line of therapy and with no further standard treatment options; evaluable or measurable disease, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, with at least one measurable lesion that has objectively progressed since (or on) previous treatment (unless subject has refused standard of care treatment), as assessed by enrolling physician; and meet the requirements for the intended study cohort 3. All subjects in Parts A and B must have available and consent to provide archival tumor tissue 4. All subjects in Parts A and B Expansion must have a tumor lesion that can be biopsied at acceptable risk and must agree to both a fresh biopsy between screening and Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and a second biopsy after completion of two cycles of study treatment 5. All subjects in Parts C and D must have available and consent to provide archival tumor tissue, have a lesion that can be biopsied at acceptable clinical risk (as judged by the investigator), and agree to a fresh biopsy between screening and C1D1. If the tumor site to be biopsied was previously irradiated or is the target lesion for response assessment, it must be at least 2 cm and have progressed 6. Male or Female ≥ 18 years of age 7. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 01. Subjects with PS 2 may be considered for enrollment in Parts C and D, if approved by medical monitor 8. Have a predicted life expectancy of ≥ 3 months 9. Have the following laboratory values (obtained ≤ 28 days prior to first infusion day): 1. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 × ULN or if higher than normal range, calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) must be ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (e.g., by CockroftGault formula); actual body weight must be used for CrCl unless BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 then lean body weight must be used 2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) unless prior history of Gilbert's syndrome 3. Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase ≤ 2.5 × ULN, or ≤ 5 × ULN if due to liver involvement by tumor 4. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL 5. Platelets ≥ 100 × 109 cells/L 6. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 ×109 cells/L (without the use of hematopoietic growth factors). Subjects with lower ANC may be enrolled if not the result of prior therapy, if approved by medical monitor 10. Have a corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt; 470ms for females and &lt; 450ms for males (as calculated by the Fridericia correction formula) 11. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to administration of each dose of JTX2011 12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and males with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control throughout their participation and for 3 months following the last study treatment 1. Receiving concurrent anticancer treatment (including radiation therapy), either approved or investigational 2. Have refused standard therapy 3. Have received the therapies listed below within the specified timeframe, or who have ongoing toxicity from prior therapy &gt; Grade 1 according to the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Exceptions to this are: &gt; Grade 1 toxicities which in the opinion of the investigator should not exclude the patient (e.g. alopecia, Grade 2 neuropathy, hypo or hyperthyroidism or other endocrinopathies that are wellcontrolled with hormone replacement) and are approved by the medical monitor. Major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) &lt; 6 months prior to the first day of study treatment, C1D1 1. Have undergone a major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) &lt; 6 months prior to the first day of study treatment, C1D1 2. Have received biologic therapy, including immunotherapy, &lt; 28 days prior to C1D1 3. Have received chemotherapy &lt; 21 days prior to C1D1, or &lt; 42 days for mitomycin or nitrosoureas 4. Have received targeted small molecule therapy &lt; 14 days prior to C1D1 5. Have received hormonal therapy &lt; 14 days prior to C1D1 (Bisphosphonates are permitted provided treatment was initiated ≥ 14 days prior to C1D1) 6. Have received radiation therapy &lt; 21 days prior to C1D1 7. Have undergone organ transplantation including allogeneic or autologous stemcell transplantation, at any time 4. Have a history of intolerance, hypersensitivity, or treatment discontinuation due to severe immune adverse events on prior immunotherapy, or documented presence of neutralizing antidrug antibody to nivolumab (Parts B and D). Subjects who discontinued prior immunotherapies for immune related adverse events that are wellcontrolled with appropriate treatment, and, in the opinion of the investigator, may be enrolled if approved by the medical monitor 5. Have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency, either primary or acquired, or treatment with systemic steroids or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to C1D1. Exception: inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease 6. Have an active or prior history of autoimmune disease. Exception: subjects with type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, hypo or hyperthyroid disease, or autoimmune alopecia not requiring immunosuppressive treatment 7. Have known severe intolerance to or hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies or intravenous immunoglobulin preparations; any history of anaphylaxis; prior history of human antihuman antibody response; known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations of any agent 8. Are symptomatic or have uncontrolled brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery or radiation (brain metastases that are stable and asymptomatic, either treated or untreated, will be allowed) 9. Have current second malignancy at other sites (exceptions: adequately treated in situ carcinoma (e.g., cervical), nonmelanoma skin cancer, bilateral synchronous discordant breast cancer, or indolent prostate cancer under observation). A past history of other malignancies is allowed as long as subject has been free of recurrence for ≥ 2 years, or if the subject has been treated with curative intent within the past 2 years and, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to have a recurrence 10. Have active and clinically relevant bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, including known Hepatitis A, B, or C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (testing not required) 11.

Have any medical or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might place a subject at increased risk, affect compliance, or confound safety or other clinical trial data interpretation</criteria>
