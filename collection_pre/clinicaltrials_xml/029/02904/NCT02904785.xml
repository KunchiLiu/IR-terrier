	<brief_title>Extracorporeal Focused Shock Wave Therapy for Primary Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a placebo controlled Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) in which the primary outcome is to determine whether Extracorporeal Focused Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) reduces knee pain comparing the VAS at baseline and one month after the end of the treatment. Function assessment and progression of pain along the treatment are the secondary outcomes. Function will be assessed with the Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Lequesne's Algofunctional Questionnaire for Osteoarthritis of Knee (Lequesne) and the Timed up and Go (TUG). The ESWT applications will be performed once a week for four consecutive weeks, the patients will be assessed for pain and function before the beginning of the treatment and one week after every application of the ESWT. The treatment groups will be randomized. The allocation of the patients is sealed and will not be disclosed to the patients nor to the evaluators.</detailed_description>
