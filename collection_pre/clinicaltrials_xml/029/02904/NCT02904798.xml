	<brief_summary>Polypodium Leucotomos Extract (PLE) is a tropical fern that has antioxidative, photoprotective, chemoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. The antioxidative effects of PL include inhibition and scavenging of free radicals, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Visible light (400-700 nm) causes pigmentation in melanocompetent individuals and induces DNA damage in the human skin through ROS production. The goal of this study is to determine whether the administration of oral PLE has an effect on the development of visible light induced pigmentation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Visible Light on the Skin After Administration of Oral Polypodium Leucotomos</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polypodium Leucotomos (PL), a tropical fern that is grown in Central America, has been found to contain active compounds that provide antioxidative, photoprotective, chemoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.The antioxidative effects of PL include inhibition and scavenging of free radicals, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen.Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and visible light (400-700 nm) can induce DNA damage in the human skin through ROS production. The visible spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. While many of the photodermatology studies have focused mainly on the UV portion of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum, as of lately, there have been more studies on visible light. The visible light radiation can exert various biologic effects such as erythema, pigmentation, thermal damage and free radical production. Addtionally, visible light exposure can cause or exacerbate photodermatoses such as solar urticaria, chronic actinic dermatosis (CAD) and cutaneous porphyrias. Sunscreens are the mainstay treatment for these photodermatoses, but often sunscreens offer none to weak protection against visible light. In the past, studies have studied the erythema development and pigmentary changes induced by visible light. A recent study by Mahmoud et al. reported that visible light induces dark and relatively sustained pigmentation, which has clinical relevance in the treatment of photodermatoses as well as the need for development of filters that protect against visible light. PURPOSE: To study the effects of visible light on the skin after administration of oral Polypodium leucotomos. SPECIFIC AIMS: â€¢Primary objective: Compare the effects of skin irradiated with visible light with and without oral polypodium leucotomos</detailed_description>
