	<brief_summary>This multi-center Phase I study is designed to characterize the PK and PD of F/TAF oral tablets to assess systemic and genital tract bioavailability in healthy women. The oral tablets to be used in the study are F/TAF (200/10 mg), F/TAF (200/25 mg) and F/TDF (200/300 mg, Truvada). Samples will be obtained before, during and after dosing in two study phases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PK and PD Study of Oral F/TAF for HIV Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this multi-center Phase I protocol, titled Exploratory Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of Oral F/TAF for the Prevention of HIV Acquisition is to assess local and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety characteristics of three oral tablets: F/TAF (200/10 mg), F/TAF (200/25 mg) and F/TDF (200/300 mg). The study will enroll healthy, non-pregnant, HIV negative, premenopausal women (aged 18-50) who are not at risk of pregnancy and will have two phases: a Single Dose phase (one site only) and a Multiple Dose phase (all three sites). The enrollment goal is for approximately 72 participants to complete the study. All 72 women are expected to undergo the Multiple Dose phase and the 24 women expected to complete the study at the EVMS site are also expected to undergo the Single Dose phase. In the Single Dose phase, approximately 24 women will be randomized to one of two products: F/TAF (200/25 mg) or F/TDF (200/300 mg), and will undergo blood, cervicovaginal (CV), and rectal sample collections before and after a single dose for PK and PD assessments. In the Multiple Dose phase, approximately 72 women will be randomized to one of three products: F/TAF (200/10 mg), F/TAF (200/25 mg) or F/TDF (200/300 mg), and will undergo blood, CV, and rectal sample collections for PK and PD assessments before, during and after two weeks of daily dosing.</detailed_description>

See Table 1 from the Patient Information brochure below: Current or anticipated chronic use of NSAIDs or Tylenol for the duration of the study Positive urine drug screen, or known current drug or alcohol abuse which could impact study compliance. Note: therapeutic use of benzodiazepines is acceptable; investigator may discuss with CONRAD participants that may be eligible for enrollment despite a positive drug screen (e.g., false positives, use of cold medications). Participation in any other investigational trial with use of a drug/device within the last 30 days or planned participation in any other investigational with use of a drug/device trial during the study Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormality, per the 2014 update of the Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adverse Events, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality as determined by the clinician Abnormal finding on laboratory or physical examination or a social or medical condition in the volunteer which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation in the study unsafe or would complicate interpretation of data</criteria>
