	<brief_summary>This study is the first time that K1-70 will be administered to humans. The principal aim of this study is to obtain safety and tolerability data when K1-70 is administered as an IM injection to subjects with Graves' disease. Current therapy for Graves' disease includes treatment with anti-thyroid drugs, destruction of the thyroid using radioiodine, or total surgical thyroidectomy. Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists may be used to control some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. K1-70 is a thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antagonist that may provide new in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of patients with Graves' disease, patients with thyroid cancer and patients who would benefit from controlling receptor activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>K1-70 - A Study in Subjects With Graves' Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graves' disease is one of the most common overt autoimmune disorders. Patients with Graves' disease have thyroid over activity and hyperthyroidism. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include goitre, fatigue, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss despite good appetite, shakiness, inappropriate anxiety, palpitations of the heart, shortness of breath, tetchiness and agitation, poor sleep, thirst, nausea and increased frequency of defaecation. The rationale of this study is to obtain safety and tolerability data when K1-70 is administered as an intramuscular injection to subjects with Graves' disease. This information, together with the pharmacokinetic data, will help establish the doses and dosage regimen suitable for repeat administration to patients. This is an open-label study. The expected duration of each subject's participation in the study is approximately 18 weeks (including a screening period of up to 4 weeks).</detailed_description>
