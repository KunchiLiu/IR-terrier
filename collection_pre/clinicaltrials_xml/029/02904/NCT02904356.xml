	<criteria>Primary diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSMIVTR (SCID). Subjects should have at least a moderate level of OCD severity as defined by a YaleBrown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale (YBOCS) score of â‰¥ 20. Individuals diagnosed by the investigators with the following conditions: Bipolar Disorder (lifetime), any Psychotic Disorder (lifetime), history of substance abuse or dependence within the past year (expect nicotine and caffeine). An Axis II Personality Disorder, which in the judgment of the investigator may hinder the patient in completing the procedures required by the study protocol. Individuals with a clinically defined neurological disorder including, but not limited to: stroke, tics, space occupying brain lesion, any history of seizures except those therapeutically induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), history of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack within two years, cerebral aneurysm, dementia, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Chorea, Multiple Sclerosis. Increased risk of seizure for any reason, including prior diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure (such as after large infarctions or trauma), or history of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness for &gt;5 minutes. History of treatment with rTMS therapy for any disorder. History of treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation. Cardiac pacemakers, implanted medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute, unstable cardiac disease. Intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head, excluding the mouth, that cannot be safely removed. Current illicit drug use.</criteria>
