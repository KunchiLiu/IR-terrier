	<brief_summary>The primary objective to this study is to describe bilateral auditory information processing in profoundly deaf patients with bilateral cochlear implants compared with normal hearing patients. Assumption used is that due to the central consequences of bilateral deafness on binaural auditory information central processing, time between activation of the two cochlear implants is a decisive factor in bilateral implantation compared to unilateral implantation</brief_summary>
