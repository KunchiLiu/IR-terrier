	<brief_summary>Neck pain is a complex biopsychosocial disorder often precipitated or aggravated by neck movements or sustained neck postures. The onset and course of this pain is influenced by environmental and personal factors.Many studies report that participants preferred self-care measures for the management of neck pain and they sought professional help only when those measures fail</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-administered Program in Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide causing an enormous impact on individuals and their families, communities and healthcare systems.While neck pain can be severely disabling and costly, treatment options have shown moderate evidence of effectiveness. No previous study has used foam roller in patients with neck pain. In addition, it has been suggested that neurodynamic interventions provide a peripheral stimulus, reducing the pressure existing within the nerve, improving blood flow, axonal transport and nerve conduction. It was hypothesized that a self-administered intervention focused on myofascial release of main muscles related to neck pain and upper-limb active neurodynamics could reduce the presence of active trigger points and pain, improving functionality and active mobility.</detailed_description>
