	<brief_summary>To compare two methods of post-operative pain management in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. There is a perception that the periarticular injections may not be as effective in controlling post-operative pain. Both methods are current standard of care. The investigators want to compare the outcomes of each when patients are randomized to one of the methods compared to the other method of post-operative pain control.</brief_summary>
