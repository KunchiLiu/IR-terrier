	<brief_summary>Most older adults want to stay at home for as long as possible. To reach this aim it is important to maintain their mobility and self-care abilities. However, many older adults are at risk to lose their abilities, as they have an inactive lifestyle. In this study, homecare professionals learn to motivate their clients to be more active in daily and physical activities. Examples of these activities are washing and dressing, household chores or going for a walk. The primary aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the implementation of the 'Stay Active at Home' program (process evaluation). The secondary aim is to get insight into the potential effectiveness of the program with regard to several primary and secondary outcomes measures (effect evaluation). The tertiary aim is to test the feasibility of the proposed study design.</brief_summary>
