	<brief_summary>Hemiplegia is a high prevalence pathology with 1 per 1000 habitants in France. One of these complications is shoulder pain which affects about 35 to 70% of cases. The medical care of this complication is critical because it affects the patient's quality of life and also hinders participation in rehabilitation sessions slowing the recovery of independence in activities of daily living. Literature confirmed the involvement of the scapula in the hemiplegic shoulder pain with his attitude pronounced lateral rotation. But no data to confirm that passive mobilization reduce shoulder pain. Because no data available to permit us to determine the sample size we set-up this preliminary study to check if efficiency found in these preliminary data are consistent with an estimable real efficacy in a randomized trial feasible.</brief_summary>
