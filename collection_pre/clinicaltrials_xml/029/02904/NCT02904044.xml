	<brief_title>Sport Injuries During Physical Activity Lessons in Secondary School in South of Reunion Island</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sport injuries during physical activities lessons are the first etiology of traumatism in secondary school. Epidemiological studies on individual determinants of sport injuries are very scarce and most focused on contextual or mixed determinants. TsColEPS is a multicenter case control study with one control paired to one case. A convenience sample of 500 pupils in each group was planned on the base of a range of expected odds ratios.</detailed_description>
