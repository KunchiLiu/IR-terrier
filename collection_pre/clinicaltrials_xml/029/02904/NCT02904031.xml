	<brief_summary>- Few data are available about the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy. Up today, most of the available data are from retrospective/post-hoc analyses, making them difficult to translate to everyday clinical practice. - FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line therapy option for RAS wild-type untreated mCRC patients. Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in routinary practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested. - In elderly patients, a reasonable upfront treatment is a fluoropyrimidine-based monotherapy plus bevacizumab, irrespectively of the molecular status of RAS. - BRAF mutation is a strong negative prognostic factor associated to advanced age, poor performance status (PS), extended and aggressive disease and is associated to a lack of benefit from anti-EGFR moAb. - Clinical definition of elderly (over 70 years old) CRC patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated. The cut-off of 75 years old combined with ECOG PS assessment is a reasonable approach for clearly defining candidates to different approaches31. - Several geriatric screening tools have been used to identify patients with a geriatric profile potentially predicting for overall survival and risk of toxicity. The G8 screening tool has been validated in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival; the CRASH score is able to stratify patients according an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities. On the basis of these considerations, the investigators designed the present randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy panitumumab in combination with simplified FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil, in previously untreated elderly patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable mCRC.</brief_summary>
