	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine variabel pressure gradients of the 1st toe, 2-5th toes and the metatarsal distal caput in patients who have had surgery with a partial proximal hemiarthroplasty in the 1st metatarsalphalangeal joint (MTP) between 2006-2014. Also, to examine these variables and compare them to the totalt range of motion and pain, to find out if the measured pedobar pressure can be used identify the well treated patient and the poorly treated patient. The pedobar pressure gradients will be compared with a control group with healthy feet.</brief_summary>
