	<brief_summary>This prospective controlled randomized blind clinical study investigated 44 implants displaying lack of KG in 29 subjects. Fourteen subjects received FGGs followed by oral prophylaxis. Fifteen subjects in the control group did not receive FGGs. The width of KG, gingival recession (GR), pocket depths (PD), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Changes in crestal bone levels, from baseline, were assessed at 18 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes following free gingival grafts (FGGs) around implants with limited keratinized gingiva (KG) compared to oral prophylaxis without gingival augmentation. This prospective controlled randomized blind clinical study investigated 44 implants displaying lack of KG in 29 subjects. Fourteen subjects received FGGs followed by oral prophylaxis. Fifteen subjects in the control group did not receive FGGs. The width of KG, gingival recession (GR), pocket depths (PD), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. There was a significant gain in KG with a reduction in GR in the FGG group compared to controls at 6, 12, and 18 months. The mean PI and GI were significantly lower for the FGG group at 12 and 18 months.</detailed_description>
