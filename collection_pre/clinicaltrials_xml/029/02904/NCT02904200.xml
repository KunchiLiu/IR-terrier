	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate changes on Peri-Wound skin from baseline to termination when using two different wound dressings The secondary objectives are to evaluate: •pain before and during and after dressing removal from baseline to termination</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation of Two Different Wound Dressings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized clinical investigation will be conducted at two sites in Sweden. Male or female, 18 years or older with following wound types: - traumatic, surgical or dehisced wounds, - venous leg ulcer or pressure ulcer will be included into the clinical investigation. 32 evaluated subjects (i:e 16 subjects per arm) will be followed during maximum three weeks. The treatment arm (either silicon adhesive dressing or acrylic adhesive dressing). Patients will be randomized using optimal allocation (minimization) balancing for the following baseline variables type of skin (normal/dry/flaky/oily/moist) and age. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either silicon adhesive dressing or acrylic adhesive dressing in a ratio of 1:1 provided.</detailed_description>

Subjects with decreased sensation, as judged by the investigator 8. Wounds with exposed blood vessels, anastomotic sites, organs or nerves 9. Previous NPWT treatment on the target wound ≤ 3 months at inclusion 10. Wounds with necrotic tissue or eschar 11. Significantly bleeding wounds, as judged by the investigator 12. Subject not suitable for the investigation according to the investigator's judgment 13. Subject included in other ongoing clinical investigation which could interfere with this investigation, as judged by the investigator 14.
