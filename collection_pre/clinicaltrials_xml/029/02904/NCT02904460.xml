	<brief_summary>The new progresses relative to sedation-analgesia for resuscitation unit lead to perform a light and cooperative sedation as soon as possible in order to decrease the period of mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is a central alpha-2 agonist, is the referential hypnotic in this case with a reduction of the morphine-type use. DEX was mainly studied in the bandage procedures for the burned adult. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reducing effect of DEX on the morphine use in case of severe burnings for adults, to describe the receivers of DEX and to report the procedure of this new molecule.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The new progresses relative to sedation-analgesia for resuscitation unit lead to perform a light and cooperative sedation as soon as possible in order to decrease the period of mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is a central alpha-2 agonist, is the referential hypnotic in this case with a reduction of the morphine-type use. DEX was mainly studied in the bandage procedures for the burned adult. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reducing effect of DEX on the morphine use in case of severe burnings for adults, to describe the receivers of DEX and to report the procedure of this new molecule. This study would manage to develop a protocol using dexmedetomidine to reduce the use of morphine for the sedation-analgesia. It expects a sensitization of physicians about the need to form the nurse crew for the autonomous use of a protocol before performing a new evaluation of sedation-analgesia.</detailed_description>
