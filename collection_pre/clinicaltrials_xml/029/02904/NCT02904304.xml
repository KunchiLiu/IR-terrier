	<brief_title>Desloratadine,Phenylephrine Hcl,Ibuprofen Compared to Placebo in Treatment of Symptoms Associated With Common Cold/Flu</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational product is a combination of desloratadine, phenylephrine hydrochloride and ibuprofen. The desloratadine is a antihistamine and selectively block the activity of histamine receptor-1 (H1) resulting in a non sedative and prolong antiallergic effect. The phenylephrine is a potent stimulator of the postsynaptic α receptor with minimal effect on β receptors in the heart. The ibuprofen's mechanism is not fully known. It is a non selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that is involved in prostaglandin synthesis by the route from arachidonic acid. It is believed that the pharmacological effects are due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which reduces prostaglandin synthesis involved in the mediation of inflammation, pain, fever and swelling.</detailed_description>
