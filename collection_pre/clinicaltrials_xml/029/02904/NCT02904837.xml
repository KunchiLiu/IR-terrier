The use of mental practice (MP) as a method for the acquisition and improvement of motor skills is well evidenced in the literature for healthy individuals and stroke patients, but there is still insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of this method in PD gait improvement.

	<brief_title>Mental Practice Combined With Physical Practice Training for Gait Improvement in Parkinson's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative nervous system disease that causes, among other changes, movement disorders that lead to loss of motor skills, especially in gait. The use of mental practice (MP) as a method for the acquisition and improvement of motor skills is well evidenced in the literature for healthy individuals and stroke patients. However, there is still insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of this method in PD gait improvement, as there is limited availability in MP training protocols literature for this purpose for this population. Objectives: To verify the efficiency and to evaluate the effects of a protocol based on mental practice combined with physical practice for gait training guided by cognitive strategies in patients with PD. Design: Parallel prospective, single blind, randomized clinical trial. Setting: Brazilian Parkinson Association. Participants: Seventy-five patients with PD in stages 2-3 of disease evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr Classification. Interventions: The Mental Practice training (MPT) consisted of ten gait training sessions, twice a week, for five weeks, using mental practice training associated with physical practice guided by cognitive strategies; the Physical Practice training (PPT) consisted of similar gait training as MPT, guided by cognitive strategies, but without mental practice. The Control training (CT) consisted of similar gait training as PPT, but without the support of any compensatory strategy. Primary outcome measure: Gait performance scored by the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT). Secondary outcome measure: Gait performance in terms of spatial-temporal variables (speed, cadence, step length). Randomization: Participants were randomized by ClinStat software into one of three groups: Mental Practice Group (MPG), which performed the MPT; Physical Practice Group (PPG), which performed the PPT; and Control Group (CG), which performed the CT. Statistical analysis: Gait performance in DGI, 6MWT and spatial-temporal variables before and after 10 training sessions, and after 30 and 60 days subsequent to the end of training were compared for MPG, PPG and CG using Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA).</detailed_description>
