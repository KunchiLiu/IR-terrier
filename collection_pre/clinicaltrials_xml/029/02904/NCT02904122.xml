	<brief_title>Oral Teleconsultation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using Soprocare® camera, videos of patients' oral cavity are recorded and analysed remotely. 200 patients have been included: 100 in Montpellier (France) and 100 in Kitakyushu (Japan). A classical face-to-face oral consultation is realized using ICDAS II classification. Then a student recorded 6 videos of patients' mouth: one video by sector, showing each face of molars and premolars in cario fluorescence mode of Soprocare® and one video of the maxillary and mandibular incisor-canine block in perio mode. In a third step, a remote dentist analysed videos and made a telediagnosis using the same classification. Dental hygiene and missing teeth are also noted in classical and tele diagnostic. The direct and the tele diagnostic are compared.</detailed_description>
