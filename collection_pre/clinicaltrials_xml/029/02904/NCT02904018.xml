	<brief_title>Validation Study of Oral Teleconsultation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An oral teleconsultation was proposed to the 461 residents of the public hospital of Uzès. A specifically trained nurse recorded 4 videos (1 per quadrant) per mouth with an intra-oral camera using fluorescent light (Soprocare®) and keyed in information about the resident (general state, identification,…). These data were recorded and sent onto a central secured server, through a specific piece of software (e-DENT®). The dentists from the University Hospital of Montpellier were then able to analyse the videos remotely, make a diagnosis and organise each resident's oral care.</detailed_description>
