	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to integrate a gaze training intervention (i.e., quiet eye training; QET) that has been shown to improve the throwing and catching skill of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), within an approach (i.e., group therapy) that might alleviate the psychosocial influence of these motor skill deficits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of a Group-based Gaze Training Intervention for Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with DCD will be randomly split into either QET group or a technical training (TT). The TT group will be given movement-related instructions via video, relating to the throw and catch phases, while the QET group will also be taught to fixate a target location on the wall prior to the throw (QE1) and to track the ball prior to the catch (QE2). Each group will take part in a 4- week, group therapy intervention and measurements of QE duration obtained from a mobile eye tracking system and catching performance are to be taken before and after training, and at a 6-week delayed retention test. Parental feedback on psychosocial and motor skill outcomes will also be collected at delayed retention.</detailed_description>
