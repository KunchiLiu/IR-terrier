	<brief_summary>A large (3900 patients) cohort study, undertaken in five European sites to validate in a mHealth platform to enable self-management of HIV in patients with stable disease using a tailored HTA process, Model for Assessment of Telemedicine Applications (MAST), specifically developed for the assessment of mHealth solutions. As site recruitment will be sequential and the recruitment period will last 18 months, a maximum follow-up of 35 Months will be undertaken. Study visits will take place at baseline defined as the time of mHealth introduction, months 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Number of Study Centres: 5 Duration of Study: 35 Months Criteria for Evaluation: Usability of the mHealth platform, patient self-management and empowerment, clinical safety (virological suppression maintenance, CD4 count, laboratory parameters, adverse events and adherence), quality of life and self-economy will be assessed by questionnaires and laboratory parameters. Routine data on patient demographics, treatment and investigations which will include viral load, CD4, haematology, biochemistry and urine sample. Patient Activation Measure, Quality of life, adherence questionnaire and economic questionnaires will be performed at baseline and at months 12 and 24. Satisfaction System Usability Scale will be evaluated at month 12 and 24.</detailed_description>
