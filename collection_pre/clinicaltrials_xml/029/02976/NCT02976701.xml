	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, and controlled clinical study over a total of 4-week therapy with DLBS1033 in the management of STE-ACS after a primary PCI. There will be 40 STE-ACS subjects (20 subjects in each group) planned to complete the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of DLBS1033 After Primary PCI in Patients With STE-ACS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STE-ACS patients who undergo intermediate-delayed (&gt; 3 hours after the onset of the STEMI) primary PCI will be enrolled in the study. Before the intervention, they will be given standard medication for PCI. Right after PCI, all eligible subjects will be assessed for microvascular perfusion, using a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped coronary guidewire. The day after, in addition to the dual antiplatelet therapy, i.e. 80 mg aspirin once daily and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg three times daily or its placebo will be given to the subjects for 4 weeks. Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and safety will be performed at Baseline (right after subjects undergo the primary PCI) and at the End of study (week 4th of DLBS1033 therapy).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>KEY 1. Signed informed consent. 2. Men or women of 3075 years of age. 3. Evidence of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at screening, as confirmed by all of the following: Positive plasma cardiac troponin I [cTnI]. Possible ischaemic symptoms include various combinations of chest, upper extremity, mandibular or epigastric discomfort (with exertion or at rest) or an ischaemic equivalent such as dyspnoea or fatigue. ECG presentation of STEMI. 4. The onset of the STEMI is &gt; 3 hours before undergoing the primary PCI. 5. Therapy with study medication can be started within 24 hours after primary PCI. 6. Able to take oral medication. KEY 1. Females of childbearing potential: pregnancy, breastfeeding. 2. History of hemorrhagic stroke, serious head injury within the last 3 months. 3. History of major surgery within the last 6 months. 4. History of PCI or CABG. 5. Evidence of previous myocardial infarction. 6. Ongoing long term need for oral anticoagulants, antiplatelets, fibrinolytic, or antithrombotic agents, other than the study medication. 7. Having any implanted pacemaker or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRTD). 8. Inadequate liver function 9. Moderate to high risk of bleeding (CRUSADE bleeding score of &gt; 30) 10. Known or suspected allergy to any of study medication, including other lumbrokinase products. 11. Prior experience with DLBS1033 or other oral lumbrokinase products. 12. Clinical evidence of malignancies with survival period &lt; 1 year. 13. Any other disease state, including chronic or acute systemic infections, uncontrolled illnesses or other chronic diseases, which judged by the investigator, could interfere with trial participation or trial evaluation. 14. Subjects enrolled in other interventional protocol within 30 days prior to Screening</criteria>
