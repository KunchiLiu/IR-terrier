	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of TPFinduction Chemotherapy Boundary Resectable Local Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor in China. In Asian countries, esophageal squamous carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma. Prognosis of esophageal squamous carcinoma is usually poor and surgery is the only radical treatment. However, the optimal therapy pattern for local advanced esophageal carcinoma is still unclear. Part of the patients that clinical staging as T4 and presents multiple lymph node metastasis and esophageal carcinoma with large diameters are initially diagnosed as boundary resectable, which means patients may be able to undergo R0 resection. However, for patients who are diagnosed as boundary resectable esophageal carcinoma, there are still no sufficient studies implicate that how to improve R0 resection rate by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. DDP in combination with 5-FU and docetaxel regimen(DCF) was reported as effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating esophageal squamous carcinoma. However, studies also showed that the DCF regimen caused severe adverse reaction. The mechanism of paclitaxel is similar to docetaxel while with less adverse events than docetaxel. Based on the research situation mentioned above, the investigators decided to conduct a phase II clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel in combination with DDP and 5-FU (TPF) regimen in treating locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
