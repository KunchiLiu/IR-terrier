	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of C-CAR011 Treatment in DLBCL Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 3x3 dose escalation design will be adopted in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subjects will be enrolled into low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group as below: Dose CAR+ cells/kg Low 0.8×106 Medium 2.5×106 High 5.0×106 DLT is evaluated within 30 days post C-CAR011 infusion).</detailed_description>
