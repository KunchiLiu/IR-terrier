	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that this study will show that sufficient lymphocyte stem cell can be harvested prior chemoradiation and be reinfused back after treatment, and at least 5 of the 10 patients (50%) will achieve an absolute increase of lymphocyte counts of 300 cells/mm^3 four weeks after stem cell reinfusion in high grade glioma patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed high grade glioma by pathology (WHO grade III or IV). At least 18 years of age. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60% Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hematocrit ≥ 30% Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 1000/mcl Blood transfusions are permitted to allow potential participant to meet these criteria. Postoperative treatment plan must include standard radiation and temozolomide. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Prior treatment with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic agents (including immunotoxins, immunoconjugates, antisense, peptide receptor antagonists, interferons, interleukins, TIL, LAK, or gene therapy), or hormonal therapy. Glucocorticoid therapy is allowed. AntiVEGF therapy within 6 weeks of registration. A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Currently receiving any investigational agents that might affect lymphocytes. Patients receiving Novocure are allowed on study. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to filgrastim or plerixafor or other agents used in the study. Fresh CNS bleed as evident by MRI or CT. Contraindicated for anticoagulation. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry. Known HIVpositivity.</criteria>
