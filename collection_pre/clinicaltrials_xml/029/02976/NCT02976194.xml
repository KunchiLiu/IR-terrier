	<brief_title>Intraocular Cytokine in Recurrence of Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCV is regarded as a subtype of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), but has several different features such as polypoidal terminal of new vessels, and relative resistance to anti-VEGF treatment. Other cytokines then VEGF are thought to be associated with development and progression of the disease. The aim of the this study is to investigate intraocular cytokines related to recurrence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Aqueous humor will be sampled from the anterior chamber at baseline, after loading injections of ranibizumab and at recurrence. The concentration of various cytokines will be measured in the aqueous humor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Submacular PCV diagnosed based on branching neovascular networks having polypoidal dilatation in ICGA. 2. Presence of exudative changes involving the fovea in OCT 3. Decreased visual acuity to 20/320 20/40 to be primarily the results of PCV in the study eye. 4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and studyrelated procedures, and provide a signed informed consent form. 1. Extramacular PCV. 2. Presence of pathologic changes blocking 50% or more area of the lesion in angiography. 3. Any antiVEGF treatment in the study eye within 180 days of day 1. 4. Previous photodynamic therapy in the study eye. 5. History of intraocular surgery except uncomplicated cataract surgery performed before 90 days or more from day 1. 6. Presence of exudative ARMD requiring antiVEGF treatment in the other eye. 7. Presence of other ocular disease that may compromise visual acuity in the study eye. 8. Uncontrolled systemic disease. 9. Active intraocular or periocular infection. 10. Active intraocular inflammation. 11. Hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or excipients.</criteria>
