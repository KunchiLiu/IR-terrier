	<brief_title>Comparison of Inflammatory Responses Subsequent to Different Cesarean Section Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean section is one of the most undertaken operations in women of childbearing age. However, there is not a unique cesarean surgery technique. Pfannenstiel , reported his own technique in 1897. Because of the applicability of the technique, it went down well among obstetricians. After three decades, Kerr evolved this technique, and Pfannenstiel-Kerr technique became the method of choice until late 70's. In 1972, Stark et al defined the Misgav Ladach technique and in the following years this technique became popular among obstetricians. In late 80's Misgav Ladach technique was modified and started to be more popular. But, still Pfannenstiel-Kerr technique continued to be used frequently and studies comparing clinical outcomes of these two techniques were conducted for several times. However, the inflammatory responses which occured subsequent to application of these techniques were not investigated. This is the first study investigating the inflammatory response emerged after different cesarean surgery techniques.</detailed_description>
