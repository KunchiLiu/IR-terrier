	<brief_title>A Six Week Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Study of V565 in Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a multiple-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in approximately 126 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least three months and have CD involving the ileum and/or colon. Following a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects will be randomly allocated into one of two treatment arms: either V565 or placebo using a 2:1 active:placebo ratio for a treatment period of 6 weeks. Subjects will be treated with study drug as an add-on to any permitted stable medications already being taken for CD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History of Crohn's Disease of at least 3 months duration prior to screening CDAI score of ≥220 to ≤450 during screening CRP ≥5 mg/L (or, if CRP is normal, FCP ≥250 µg/g) at screening Permitted CD medication regimen expected to remain stable during the period of the study Previous lack of response or current contraindication to an antiTNFα agent Certain complications of Crohn's Disease that would make it hard to assess response to study drug Known history or suspicion of IBD other than Crohn's disease History of TB or latent TB infection that has not been treated Any significant illness or condition which would preclude effective participation in the study GI infection as demonstrated by presence of enteric pathogens Pregnant or lactating women Abdominal surgery in the previous 6 months Unsuitable for inclusion in the study in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor for any reason that may compromise the subject's safety or confound data interpretation</criteria>
