	<brief_title>Long Follow up on Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea That Undergo Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is increasingly performed procedure, offering dynamic upper airway evaluation during artificial sleep before surgical treatment for patients with obstructed .)OSA(sleep apnea - Aim: To evaluate the value of DISE for tailoring the proper treatment for patients with snoring and OSA DISE is a safe procedure, easily practicable, valid and reliable. We consider it a fundamental clinical procedure that is essential before choosing the surgical treatment. Our results so far suggest that a multilevel collapse is significantly associated with higher apnea hypopnea index values. We think that the weight did not play a significant role in RDI (Respiratory Disturbance Index) reduction. Our results till now show tailored surgery based on DISE may leverage sleep surgeries outcome significantly presenting 70% success rate based - on our experience We therefore want to evaluate the patients in a long follow up period</detailed_description>
