	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess the impact and potential advantage of a novel synthetic patch augmentation in repair of massive rotator cuff (RC) tears, using clinical and radiological approaches. The investigators hypothesized that implanting this patch will improve individual shoulder function, while reducing re-tear rates compared to the current literature.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate this, patches were implanted into 54 shoulders and prospectively followed up clinically and radiologically.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria were age greater 18 years and a RC tear involving at least two tendons, presenting a massive RCtear as described by Gerber et al. We excluded patients older than 75, fatty infiltration grade 4 according to Goutallier, reruptures of former repairs and cases with severe osteoarthritis.</criteria>
