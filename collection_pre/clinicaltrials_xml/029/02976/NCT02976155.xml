	<brief_title>The Effect of Standardized Enteral Nutrition on Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As investigators all know, the nutrition status in critically ill patients is associated with the prognosis of these patients. And it has been confirmed that early enteral nutrition results in better outcome. However,some epidemiological investigation reported that in most intensive care unit, the phenomenon of delayed feeding or under feeding are not uncommon. In 2007, a study reported that the percentage of early enteral nutrition within 48h is 64%, based on mechanical ventilated patients in 208 intensive care unit nationally. Other study indicated that the calorie supported by the enteral nutrition only constitute 50% of the target calorie. Several studies have showed that the application of a standard enteral nutrition protocol could result in an improvement in the delivery of enteral feedings to patients. However, there is no such study in China.The goal of this study is to evaluate whether a standard enteral nutrition protocol can improve the efficiency in achieving nutritional goals and improve prognosis in critically ill patients.</detailed_description>
