	<brief_title>Hormone Deficiency in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the effectiveness of the neurohormonal model to explain the progression of heart failure and the many insights that it provided for the development of new therapies, there is increasing clinical evidence that suggests that our current models fail to completely explain the disease progression. Thus, neurohormonal models may be necessary but not sufficient to explain all aspects of disease progression in the failing heart. There is evidence suggesting that in heart failure there is a metabolic imbalance characterized by the predominance of the catabolic status over the anabolic drive. Consistent data coming from several independent groups have documented the reduced activity of most anabolic axes in HF with reduced ejection fraction. To date, no study has addressed the prevalence the presence and the prevalence of the Multiple Hormone Deficiencies in Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction.</detailed_description>
