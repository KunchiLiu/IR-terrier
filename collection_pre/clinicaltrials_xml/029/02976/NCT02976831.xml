	<brief_summary>Plaque psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, affecting 1-3% of the population in Europe and the United States of America (USA) and represents one of the most prevalent immune inflammatory diseases. AZD0284 is a potent selective inverse agonist of RORg, which is being developed for the management of psoriasis. The current Phase 1 study investigates the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of AZD0284. The study will be conducted in healthy subjects. The study will be divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), with Part 1 being split into 2 sub-parts: 1A (fasting) and 1B (fed). The results from this study will form the basis for decisions on future studies. The study will help to identify appropriate, well-tolerated doses that can be administered in subsequent studies in patients with psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of AZD0284 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plaque psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. There are 2 key abnormalities in psoriasis, hyper proliferation of keratinocytes and an inflammatory cell infiltrate, which includes; dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer (NK) T cells, mast cells, T cells and neutrophils. There is strong evidence that T cells have an important role in psoriasis, including the fact that T-cell targeted agents are effective in psoriasis therapy. This study is the first time AZD0284 will be given to humans. The current Phase 1 study investigates the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of AZD0284. The study will be conducted in healthy subjects to avoid interference from disease processes or other drugs. The study will be divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), with Part 1 being split into 2 sub-parts: 1A (fasting) and 1B (fed). The secondary and safety pharmacology of AZD0284 has been investigated using both in vitro and in vivo models. Screening of AZD0284 in a diverse set of in vitro radiolig and binding, enzyme, functional and electrophysiological assays including cardiac ion channels did not identify any off-target activities likely to be relevant in or near the therapeutic exposure range. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are defined such that the selected subjects will be free of any significant illness when included in the study. The selected starting dose for the SAD part (Part 1A) of the study is 4.0 mg AZD0284 (oral solution). The maximum allowed exposure based on the toxicology studies is 127 μmol*h/L (total AUC(0-24,ss)) or 7.35 μmol/L (total Cmax). In Part 1A (SAD study), 6 dose levels and in Part 2 (MAD study), 3 dose levels are planned. In either part, up to 2 additional doses may be added if needed. The results from this study will form the basis for decisions on future studies. The study will help to identify appropriate, well-tolerated doses that can be administered in subsequent studies in patients with psoriasis.</detailed_description>
