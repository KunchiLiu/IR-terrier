	<brief_summary>Postoperative acute renal failure is a frequent complication after a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). The current practice cannot predict Acute Kidney Injuries (AKI) early enough to prevent an organic dysfunction triggering, consequently, cortical tubular necrosis. Several recent studies in cardiac surgery have shown that sonographic criteria, the Renal Resistive Index (IRR), and a urinary biomarker, the NephroCheck™, could predict AKI promptly. These markers, sonographic and biologic, have both the advantage to be non-invasive and easy to perform. Each marker seems to have sensitivity and specificity to predict AKI promptly after cardiac surgery. Therefore, the IRR and the NephroCheck™ test could become essential tests to guide clinicians in determining rapidly whether a patient will develop AKI after a TAVI procedure. However, so far, no study has tested the NephroCheck™ in patients undergoing TAVI. Therefore, the aim of this prospective observational study will be first to determine the effectiveness of the NephroCheck™ to predict AKI at an early stage after a TAVI procedure. The secondary outcome will be to compare the NephroCheck™ with the RRI in predicting at an earlier stage than the traditional method an AKI.</brief_summary>
