	<brief_summary>To ensure a successful outcome after total knee replacement (TKR) soft tissue balance and proper implant position are very important during the surgical procedure. Soft tissues are structures in the knee including ligaments, muscles, tendons, and menisci that stabilize and cushion the knee joint. Lack of proper soft tissue balance or imprecise implant positioning may result in knee stiffness, pain, instability and limited range of motion (ROM). This may result in implant failure and the need for revision surgery. As part of standard practice orthopedic surgeons use a manual knee balancer device to help guide soft tissue balancing to achieve optimal knee balance. New sensor-assisted technology can provide surgeons with measurable information to help achieve soft tissue balancing, providing surgeons with immediate visual feedback during the surgery. This feedback, transmitted wirelessly by the sensor, gives surgeons electronic information on soft tissue balance and implant position.The purpose of this study is to determine if a sensor guided soft tissue balancing device (Verasense) is more effective at balancing the knee during surgery as compared to standard soft tissue balancing performed with a manual balancer device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional vs. Sensor Guided Soft Tissue Balancing in TKA RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is that of a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial of patients presenting for elective primary TKR to compare the outcomes of TKR using conventional soft tissue balancing with a tensiometer device versus augmenting the soft tissue balancing with the OrthoSensor VerasenseTM sensor device. The primary outcome will be rate of unbalanced TKRs based on the quantitative Verasense definition of a well balanced knee defined as a mediolateral intercompartmental loading difference of â‰¤15 pounds through ROM. Secondary outcomes include differences in clinical outcome scores and patient satisfaction among sensor guided cases and controls. Patients will be randomized to receive TKR with the Triathlon total knee system (Stryker) in the case and control group according to: (1) control group with standard balancing techniques used and sensor data obtained in blinded fashion and not used to balance the TKR implant, (2) experimental case group with sensor guided balancing where sensor data is used to balance the TKR within defined parameters.</detailed_description>
