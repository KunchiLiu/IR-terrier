Secondary objectives : - Comparison of HIV-1 RNA level in plasma (threshold 20 and 1 copies/ml) and in seminal plasma (threshold 60 copies/ml) at each visit D0, W2, W4, W8, W12, W24, W36, W48 - To assess the frequency of intermittent shedding in seminal plasma once virological suppression has been achieved and until W48 - Evolution of cellular HIV-1 DNA level in PBMC and in non-sperm cells between D0 and W48 - Comparison of dolutegravir concentration in blood plasma and seminal plasma - Study of risk factors associated with viral persistence of HIV-RNA in the seminal plasma - Analysis by deep sequencing of the viral population (quasi-species) in both compartments (blood plasma and seminal plasma) before virological suppression has been achieved (i.e. at D0 and W12) Inclusion criteria : - Patients diagnosed at the time of primary HIV infection (PHI) (i) a negative or indeterminate HIV ELISA associated with a positive antigenemia or plasma HIV RNA, (ii) a western blot profile compatible with ongoing seroconversion (incomplete western blot with absence of antibodies to pol proteins (p34, p68)) or (iii) an initially negative test for HIV antibodies followed within 3 months by a positive HIV serology - Treatment including dolutegravir (DTG 50mg) + tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC 245 mg/200 mg) initiated by the referee physician within a maximum of 15 days after diagnosis of PHI - Genotypic sensitivity to TDF, FTC and DTG - Patient with medical care insurance Exclusion criteria : - Chronic infection - Infection or co-infection with HIV-2 Study treatment : Dolutegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine Number of subjets : 20 patients (exploratory study)</brief_summary>
