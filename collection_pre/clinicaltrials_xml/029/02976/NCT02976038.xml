	<brief_title>Open-Label Extension Trial to Characterize the Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Elamipretide in Subjects With Genetically Confirmed Primary Mitochondrial Disease (PMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, non-comparative, extension trial will enroll subjects with genetically confirmed PMD who have completed the End-of-Study Visit in the SPIMM-202 trial. Subjects who do not discontinue or withdraw from the trial will receive treatment with 40 mg SC elamipretide for the shortest of the following: 260 weeks; regulatory approval and commercial availability of elamipretide in the subject's respective country; or termination of the clinical development for elamipretide in subjects with PMD.</detailed_description>
