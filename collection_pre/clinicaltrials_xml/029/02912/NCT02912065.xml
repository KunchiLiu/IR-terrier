	<brief_title>Tube Feeding Tolerance After Switch to Peptide Based Formula in Children With Developmental Delay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical records of pediatric patients with enteral feeding intolerance on standard polymeric formulas that were switched to a peptide based formula will be retrospectively analyzed. Data will be collected on caloric intake, ability to meet enteral nutrition goals, incidence of intolerance, and the use of medications to control gastrointestinal symptoms.</detailed_description>
