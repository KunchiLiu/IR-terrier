	<brief_title>Changes in Central Arterial Pressure When Comparing Nifedipine/Labetalol for Routine Hypertension Control in Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central blood pressures in addition to pulse wave velocity will be attained prior to medication, and then every 30 minutes for 4 hours (total of 9 readings). Sphygmomanometer readings will be completed at the same time (total readings 9). These readings are all related to the study. Nursing will have the opportunity to to record the routine sphygmomanometer readings for their routine vitals if they chose to do so. Their participation will be complete after the 4 hour assessment is complete.</detailed_description>
