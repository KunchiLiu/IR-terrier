	<brief_title>Exercise and Nutrition Interventions in Age-related Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal ageing is an inevitable process associated with profound morphological and functional changes that will ultimately transition an individual from independent, to dependable living, relying heavily on personal health care for survival. The United Kingdom (UK) population aged over 65 years is expected to rise from 8.8 to 11.3 million by 2025. As life expectancy increases due to advances in medical treatment, an age-related disease termed sarcopenia, has become more prevalent in the elderly. Sarcopenia, described as the loss of musculoskeletal mass, strength and/or physical functioning with age, manifests after the 6th decade and rapidly increases after the 8th decade, resulting in a deterioration of health status and quality of life. To manage the looming health and economic consequences of sarcopenia, suitable therapeutic strategies to manage the condition are warranted. Therefore, this randomised control trial (RCT) will investigate the effects of 16-weeks of exercise and nutritional interventions in inactive senior citizens (60 - 90 years old).</detailed_description>
