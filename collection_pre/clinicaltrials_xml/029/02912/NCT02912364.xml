	<brief_title>Comparison of the Cognitive and Behavioral Effects of Eslicarbazepine Acetate and Carbamazepine in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a double-blind, randomized, two period crossover design. The study consists of 6 visits over a 21 week period. Forty six (46) normal healthy subjects will be treated with both Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL, 800 mg/day) and Carbamazepine (CBZ, 800mg/day) for 6 weeks and 3 days each (maintenance 4 weeks and taper 3 days). Each antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment period will be followed by a four day taper and washout period off AED for the remainder of the month. Cognitive and behavioral testing along with safety testing will be conducted at pretreatment baseline, the end of each randomization AED maintenance period, and after the final washout period.</detailed_description>
