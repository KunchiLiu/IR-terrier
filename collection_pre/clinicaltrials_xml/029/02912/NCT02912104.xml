	<brief_title>A Therapeutic Trial of Human Amniotic Epithelial Cells Transplantation for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary ovarian insufficiency（POI) is a defect characterized by the premature depletion of ovarian follicles. Patients with POF suffer from amenorrhea, infertility, low levels of estrogen, and high gonadotropin concentration before the age of 40. The early failure of ovarian function leads to lost fertility and increases risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, which has serious impact on the patient's physical, mental health and family stability. The etiology of POI is complex, and so far there has not been any effective treatment. Recent study showed that human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs), also known as the birth waste, are newly discovered adult stem cells. The hAECs have the ability to repair nerve damage, myocardial injury, as well as liver damage. hAECs have low immunogenicity and no ethical restrictions. Therefore, hAECs are expected to become the new seed cells for regenerative medicine. Our previous study was the first to show that human amniotic epithelial cells have the ability to restore folliculogenesis in a mouse model with chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure. Our further studies demonstrated that hAECs either directly transdifferentiated into granulosa cells, or inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated granulosa cell apoptosis and reduced the inflammatory reaction in ovaries induced by chemotherapeutics, regulating VEGFA and its receptors to induce follicular growth related to paracrine activity. Therefore, it is necessary to start the clinical study of human amniotic epithelial cells transplantation in the POI disease which may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the quality of life of POI patients.</detailed_description>
