	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain Following Irrigation With Endodontic Needle, Sonic and Passive Ultrasonic Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different irrigation delivery systems are introduced to the market aiming to improve root canals disinfection. The conventional endodontic needle is commonly used because of its ease in use and good control of needle depth and irrigant volume. However it carries a higher risk of extruding the solution periapically because of positive pressure used in solution delivery. Passive ultrasonic irrigation is a noncutting irrigation technique that is done with ultrasonically activated files with continuous or intermittent flow of irrigant. It was shown that it is effective in removing remnants of pulp tissue, dentin debris and planktonic bacteria. The vibringe (Cavex Holland BV, Haarlem, the Netherlands) is an irrigation device that combines manual delivery and sonic activation of the irrigant. The aim of this study is to compare the postoperative pain after root canal treatment following irrigation by endodontic needle, sonic and passive ultrasonic irrigation techniques.</detailed_description>
