	<brief_summary>Evolving reimbursement policies are driving health systems to improve quality and efficiency. Transitioning to an electronic health record (EHR) provided Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) an opportunity to redesign staff roles and care path for Total Knee Replacement (TKR). The organization implemented a coordinated team-based care delivery model that integrated real-time measurement of: (1) compliance with trusted guidelines, (2) process of Shared Decision-Making (SdM), and (3) use of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs). The investigators present the implementation protocol and data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dartmouth-Hitchcock GreenCare Registry for Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient-reported outcome measures were completed 1 month preceding TKR and also at 1 and 12 months following surgery. The primary outcome was change in physical function from baseline to 1-year following surgery in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the Veterans-Rand (VR-12) Survey. Preoperative measures were: (1) general demographics (patient age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI); (2) treatments tried before surgery; (3) health habits (tobacco use, alcohol use); (4) pre-existing medical conditions (Charlson score); (5) physical exam findings (knee range of motion, knee laxity); (7) lab tests (hemoglobin); and (7) radiographic measures (severity of osteoarthritis on standing x-rays). Secondary outcomes included Physical Score (PS) of the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Survey (PROMIS-10), knee function (Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), safety (reoperations, readmissions, emergency visits, and infection) and measures of patient experience (Clinician Group and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems).</detailed_description>
