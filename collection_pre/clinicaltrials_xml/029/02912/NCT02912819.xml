	<brief_summary>General anesthesia and mechanical ventilation promotes atelectasis and airway closure. The open-lung approach (OLA) strategy restores the functional residual capacity. Pulse oximetry hemoglobin saturation (SpO2) using room air can diagnose shunt induced by lung collapse during general anesthesia and the SpO2 breathing air was useful to detect the lung´s opening and closing pressure during a recruitment maneuver (RM) in morbidly obese anesthetized patients. Investigators hypothesized that the SpO2 breathing air can personalize the open-lung approach.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increase in airway pressure until the SpO2 reaches 97% (lung´s opening pressure) during the incremental positive end-expiratory (PEEP) limb. Decrease in the PEEP level until the SpO2 decreases bellow 97% (lung´s closing pressure)</detailed_description>
