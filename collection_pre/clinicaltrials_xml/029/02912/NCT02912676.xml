	<brief_summary>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer in children. The survival rate has improved significantly during the last decades, but the treatment still fails to cure 15 % of the patients. Within the Nordic/Baltic countries, children are treated according to the same protocol, i.e. NOPHO ALL-2008 protocol. The longest treatment phase is maintenance therapy, which is composed of 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) and Methotrexate (MTX). The cytotoxic property of 6MP relies upon conversion of 6MP into thioguanine nucleotides (TGN), which can be incorporated into DNA instead of guanine or adenine. This incorporation can cause nuclotide mismathing and cause cell death second to repetitive activation of the mismatch repair system. At Rigshospitalet the investigators have developed pharmacological methods able to measure the incorporation of TGN into DNA (DNA-TGN). In a Nordic/Baltic study the investigators have demonstrated higher levels of DNA-TGN during maintenance therapy in participants that do not develop relapse. Preliminary studies indicate that the best approach to obtain DNA-TGN within a target range could be a combination of 6MP, MTX and 6-thioguanine (6TG), as 6TG more readily can be converted into TGN. This study aims to explore if individual dose titration of 6TG added to 6MP/MTX therapy can achieve DNA-TGN levels above a set target above 500 fmol/µg DNA, and thus can be integrated into future ALL treatment strategies to reduce relapse rates in ALL. The investigators plan to include 30 patients, and A) give incremental doses of 6TG until DNA-TGN above 500 fmol/µg DNA is obtained; and B) analyze the changes in DNA-TGN as well as cytosol levels of TGN, methylated 6MP metabolites, and MTX polyglutamates (the latter two metabolites inhibit purine de novo synthesis and thus enhance DNA-TGN incorporation), and C) occurrence of bone-marrow and liver toxicities during 6TG/6MP/MTX therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer in children. Each year approximately 220 children are diagnosed with ALL within the Nordic and Baltic countries. The survival rate has improved significantly during the last decades, but the treatment still fails to cure approximately 15 % of the patients. A significant proportion of these relapses are likely to reflect adverse drug disposition rather than resistence to antileukemic agents. This emphazises the importance of developing new dosing strategies for reduction of relapse rates. Most ALL relapses occur during or after maintenance therapy, and recent studies have indicated that almost 50% of these relapses are caused by insuffient exposure of DNA to the cytotoxic metabolites of 6MP. The cytotoxic property of 6MP relies upon conversion of 6MP into thioguanine nucleotides (TGN). TGN is a substrate for the DNA polymerase, and can be incorporated into DNA instead of guanosine or adenine (DNA-TGN). Incorporated TGN is hereafter occasionally mismatched to thymidine, which causes cell death second to activation of the mismatch repair system. During thiopurine-based therapy patients vary widely in their DNA-TGN levels and patients with low DNA-TGN levels may have an increased risk of relapse. The investigators will explore 1. If individualized addition of 6TG to maintenance therapy can increase DNA-TGN to a target of more than 500 fmol/µg DNA; 2. The toxicities encountered during 6TG/6MP/MTX therapy. The investigators hypothesize that 6TG/6MP/MTX combination therapy will achieve significantly higher DNA-TGN levels, and they will describe toxicities and thiopurine metabolite levels during MTX/6MP/6TG combination therapy. The TEAM Study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, non-controlled (except for historical controls), non-randomised, phase 1-2 clinical trial. This trial is a "proof of principle" and feasibility study planned with a modified crossover design, where participants serve as their own (historical) controls. Pharmacological target: The investigators will include 30 participants. Two weeks prior to the first addition of 6TG, the 6MP dose will be reduced to 2/3rd of the given 6MP dose to reduce levels of methylated metabolites, and thus the degree of inhibition of purine de novo synthesis. The investigators will then A) give incremental doses of 6TG (steps of 2.5 mg/meter square, max 12.5 mg/meter square) until DNA-TGN of at least 500 fmol/µg DNA is obtained; and B) analyze the changes in DNA-TGN as well as Ery-TGN/MeMP/MTXpg. The dose increments of 6TG in steps of 2.5 mg/square metre will be spaced by intervals of at least two weeks, and DNA-TGN measurements will be measured weekly during 6TG dose increments. 6TG dose increments will continue until a DNA-TGN &gt;500 fmol/µg or a maximum dose of 6TG of 12.5 mg/square metre is reached. If tolerated, the participant can then continue on that 6TG dose until the end of ALL therapy. Participants can at any time point drop out of TEAM by their own decision or by that of the treating physician. 6TG is provided as a liquid formulation to ease precise dose titration.</detailed_description>

Confirmed diagnosis with SR/IRALL, treated in accordance with NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol. 2. Patients aged 145 years at the time of diagnosis. 3. Bilirubin &lt; UNL according to age, factor 2710 &gt; 0.5 or INR &lt; 1.5 within 1 week prior to inclusion. 4. WBC &gt; 1.5 x109/L, ANC &gt; 0.5 x109/L and TBC &gt; 50 x109/L within 1 week prior to inclusion. 5. Subject, if female of child bearing potential (defined as post menarche), must present with a negative pregnancy test and must be nonlactating. 6. Sexually active females and males must use accepted safe contraception (OCPs, IUD, transdermal hormonal patch, vaginal hormonal ring or subdermal hormonal implants for women and condom for men) during therapy and until three months after study exit/early termination. 7. No live vaccines given within 3 months prior to inclusion. 8. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule. 9. Whenever appropriate, the child should participate in the oral and written informed consent process together with the parents. Involving the child in discussions and the decisionmaking process respects their emerging maturity. This process will be conducted with enough time and at the same time as obtaining the consent from the parents or the legal representative, so that the informed consent reflects the presumed will of the minor, in accordance with Article 4(a) of the Clinical Trial Directive. 10. If the study participant is unable to provide legally binding consent subject's legally authorized representative (e.i. both parent, legal guardian) must voluntarily sign and date a parental permission/ Informed Consent that is approved by the Danish Ethical Committee(EC). The subject must sign an EC approved assent, before undergoing any protocol specific procedures or assessments according to Ethical considerations for clinical trials on medicinal products conducted with the paediatric population Directive 2001/20/EC1, ICH/GCP guidelines, and the Helsinki II Declaration. 1. Patients with negative minimal residual disease at treatment day 29 (counted from diagnosis), since these patients have an excellent prognosis on current therapy). 2. Any clinical suspicion of relapse or disease progression on routine imaging or in laboratory results. 3. Previous sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) / venoocclusive disease (VOD) 4.
