	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FaseMETS for 6 consecutive months in lowering serum lipids and glucose in subjects with Metabolic Syndrome; The secondary objectives of the trial are: - to evaluate the potential benefit after 3 months of therapy (by an interim analysis) - to evaluate the safety of FaseMETS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Comparative Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the New Food Supplement FaseMETS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is designed as a multicenter, open label, non-comparative, 6 months, pilot study. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FaseMetS ® administered for 6 months treatment combined with a health management plan in reducing the serum lipidemic profile (this includes total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, small density LDL particles, triglycerides, serum glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c), insulin, and pro-insulin, HOMA index, uric acid, body mass index (BMI), creatine phosphokinase) in patients diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome and with mild to moderate Hypercholesterolemia. The secondary objectives are: - to evaluate the efficacy in reducing the serum lipidemic profile after a period of 3 months of FaseMetS ® ® treatment; - to evaluate the safety of FaseMetS ® treatment by recording AE/SAE (with particular regards for gastrointestinal symptoms); - improvement of blood clinical laboratory parameters; - improvement of weight control systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure control</detailed_description>
