Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the clinical study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration. History of: 1. Evidence in the subject's medical history or in the medical examination of any clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, haematological, central nervous system diseases or other significant acute or chronic diseases, especially hereditary fructose intolerance, which might influence either the safety of the subject or the absorption, metabolism or excretion of the active agent under investigation. 2. Subjects with clinically relevant neurologic or psychiatric illness. 3. Subjects with clinically relevant allergy (except for untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). 4. Previous exposure to pegfilgrastim. 5. Known hypersensitivity to Escherichia coliderived proteins, pegfilgrastim, filgrastim or any other component of B12019 or Neulasta® as listed in section 7.2. 6.
