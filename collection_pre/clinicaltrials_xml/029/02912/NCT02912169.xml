	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Effects of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (AD-SVF) will be infused intra-venous and Intra nasal. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately delivered back to the patient.</detailed_description>
