	<brief_title>Comparative Clinical Trial to Evaluate Bioequivalency and Safety of Monoclonal Antibody Injection and Adalimumab in Chinese Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a comparative, open, randomized clinical study. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that human recombinant anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody injection is equivalent to adalimumab in terms of pharmacokinetics and safety after single subcutaneous injection in Chinese healthy volunteers.The study will enroll 180 healthy volunteers, who will be randomized into 2 groups.</detailed_description>
