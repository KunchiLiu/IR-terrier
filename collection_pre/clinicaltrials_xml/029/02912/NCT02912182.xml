	<brief_summary>Randomized placebo controlled trial on patients suffering from acute unilateral vestibulopathy. Patients will be randomized into 3 arms; 1) Placebo only, 2) Short corticosteroid treatment (3days) 3) Longer corticosteroid treatment (11 days). Vestibular function as well as subjective symptoms will be estimated in the acute stage and regularly up to one year after the debut.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial in 3 arms to see if a short or a even shorter period of steroid treatment on patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis can be as effective as the only comparable study thus far (Strupp et al, NEJM 22, 351(4) 354-61). If a shorter treatment with a lower dose has the same outcome, then more patients might be eligible for the treatment as many are excluded due to risk for adverse effects. Corticosteroid treatment in acute unilateral vestibulopathy has recently been the subject for a Cochrane review with the conclusion of insufficient evidence for treatment effect and recommend studies with subjective symptom based evaluation together with functional testing. Patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy diagnosed within 48hrs after debut. The patients (after acceptance) will be randomized into either of 3 arms and will receive placebo/short treatment (3days)/standard treatment (in Sweden 11 days). Patients will record subjective symptoms according to Liknert scale during the acute stage and fill out enquiries after 3 and 12 months. Vestibular function will be assessed with caloric irrigation and video-Head-Impulse-Test (vHIT) as soon as possible after the debut and again after 1, 3 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
