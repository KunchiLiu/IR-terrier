	<brief_title>Investigation on Differences in Skin Sodium Content Between Normal Subjects and ICU-patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the current paradigm ICU-acquired hypernatremia is mainly an iatrogenic problem, caused by sodium overload or water deficit. In spite of several interventions to reduce sodium intake and optimize fluid balance, critically ill patients still develop hypernatremia. These patients also seem to have an inability to excrete sodium, hence develop a positive sodium balance. In animals sodium storage in the third compartment was found. Our hypothesis is that sodium storage in the third compartment is different in critically ill patients and this difference could play a role in the development of ICU-acquired hypernatremia.</detailed_description>
