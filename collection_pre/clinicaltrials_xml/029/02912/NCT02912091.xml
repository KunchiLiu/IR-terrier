	<brief_summary>This study will look at blood sugar levels in pregnant women who have been given a glucocorticoid (steroid) medication to enhance fetal lung maturity. The findings will help determine the likelihood, predictive value, adverse effects, response of patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes and time course of blood sugar elevation following steroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Steroids for Fetal Lung Maturity on Maternal Glucose Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that maternal glucose levels will be elevated in the first 72 hours after steroid administration, and that the magnitude of the peak will be predictive of a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. This is a retrospective chart review.</detailed_description>
