	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy and atezolizumab to see how well it works compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage III colon cancer and deficient deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair or microsatellite instability. Drugs used in combination chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving combination chemotherapy with atezolizumab may work better than combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Atezolizumab in Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer and Deficient DNA Mismatch Repair or Microsatellite Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether atezolizumab combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) and its continuation as monotherapy can significantly improve disease-free survival (DFS) compared to FOLFOX alone in patients with stage III colon cancers and high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether atezolizumab combined with FOLFOX and its continuation as monotherapy can significantly improve overall survival compared to FOLFOX alone in patients with stage III colon cancers and MSI-H or dMMR. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the impact of the addition of atezolizumab to FOLFOX on patient health-related quality of life (QOL), functional domains of health-related QOL, and disease- and treatment-related symptoms. II. To determine if the "immunoscore" can predict the efficacy of atezolizumab for disease-free survival among patients with stage III colon cancer. III. To assess whether circulating immune cell populations can predict the efficacy of atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer. IV. To explore the associations of genomic alterations identified in cell-free (cf)DNA with DFS in patients treated with FOLFOX with or without atezolizumab. V. To assess whether soluble markers of systemic inflammation in blood can predict the efficacy of atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer. VI. To assess the relationship between baseline plasma 25(OH) D level, change in 25(OH)D level, and DFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with stage III colon cancer receiving FOLFOX +/- atezolizumab. VII. To determine the ability of using fecal microbiota and their metabolic products to predict survival benefit from anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy in dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer patients. VIII. To determine if hypermutation or hyper-indel status is associated with response to atezolizumab. IX. To determine if unique messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression signatures are predictive of disease-free survival among patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer. X. To determine if the efficacy of atezolizumab differs among dMMR/MSI cancers due to germline MMR mutation (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) versus those with MLH1 hypermethylation and CIMP in patients with stage III colon cancer. XI. To identify overall mutational burden and number of putative tumor neoantigens in colon carcinoma specimens. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV as a bolus on day 1, then continuously over 46 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes starting on day 1 of course 1 or 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 25 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV as a bolus on day 1, then continuously over 46 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
