	<brief_summary>This feasibility study will be conducted at 4 international sites located in Asia (Dhahran, Nepal); Africa (Blantyre, Malawi and Kilimanjaro, Tanzania) and Latin America (Cochabamba, Bolivia). Each site comprises a cluster (including 3-4 health centers - 1 district hospital - 1 regional referral hospital) that service the population around the site area. Patients presenting at a health care clinic or hospital emergency department with signs and symptoms associated with high and moderate risk of developing AKI will undergo a point of care (POC) test to measure serum creatinine, saliva urea nitrogen dipstick (exclusively in Malawi), and a urine dipstick test for color, protein, glucose, blood and specific gravity. Patients who meet the study inclusion criteria will be approached for consent. Patients enrolled in the study will be followed throughout the health care evaluation and tracked through their course by location i.e. health care center, hospital, and home. Outcomes will be recorded through 6 months following the health care evaluation. The protocol will have an initial observation phase, during which relevant healthcare staff and the research team will be trained to identify patients at moderate or high risk of AKI and use of the point of care (POC) test for serum creatinine, saliva urea nitrogen dipstick (exclusively in Malawi), and urine dipstick test. During this phase patients will be tracked throughout the health care evaluation, however the teleconsultation will not be implemented and no specific guidance for managing the patient will be provided. During the subsequent intervention phase, the research team will interact with the local healthcare providers to and the teleconsultation physician, providing guidance on the management of the patient based on a standardized protocol. Protocols for patient care will be pre-specified, with minor adjustments to meet local requirements.</brief_summary>
