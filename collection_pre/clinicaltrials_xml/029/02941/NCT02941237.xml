	<brief_title>Development of a Robust and Reliable Pulse Oximeter for Children With Pneumonia in Low-income Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children under five. World Health Organization guidelines recommend measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in children with pneumonia to guide treatment. This project focuses on the design of a new 'Lifebox' pulse oximeter probe for use in children 0-5 years of age. A new oximeter probe compatible with the Lifebox oximeter has been designed to be used for children 0-5 years in all settings. The aims of the study are to: 1. to evaluate the usability of the redesigned Lifebox oximeter probe by an expert user 2. to evaluate the usability of the redesigned oximeter probe by trained healthcare workers, against defined product specifications.</detailed_description>
