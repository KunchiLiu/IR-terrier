	<brief_summary>Ultrasound guidance has been established as an effective and safe method during insertion of internal jugular vein catheter.. Needle visualization during advancement toward the vein has a great impact on both safety and success of the procedure. Clinicians have adopted variable techniques to increase needle visualization including changing needle- probe relation (in-plane vs. out-of-plane), or using specific ultrasound needles The angle between the inserting needle and the probe lying on patient skin affects both the distance to the vein and the length of the needle part travelling through the us beam</brief_summary>
