	<brief_summary>Hyperbaric oxygen has previously been tested as a possible means for pre-conditioning to enhance exercise performance. This study is designed to examine the effects of exercising in a hyperbaric chamber for improving fitness when combined with high-intensity training.</brief_summary>

This level of activity will be defined as performing mildmoderate aerobic exercise 03 times per week. VO2 max within normal limits (defined as 84120% predicted using Wasserman reference equations48). Spirometry within predicted limits. Subjects unable to complete a satisfactory VO2 max test Individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, valve disease, coronary artery disease, cardiac conduction abnormalities, etc. History of pneumothorax or chronic lung disease such as asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis Active Smokers Pregnant women Persons unable to read or understand English, not in their full mental capacity or who are blind.</criteria>
