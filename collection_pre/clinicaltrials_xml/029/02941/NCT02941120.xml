	<brief_title>Non-interventional Study With NOVOCART® Inject in the Reconstruction of the Knee Cartilage Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective and multicenter non-interventional study to evaluate safety and efficacy of NOVOCART® Inject in patients with localized full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee joint. Safety: Measuring the number of adverse drug reactions/serious adverse drug reactions since treatment and up to the present time. Efficacy: Evaluate symptoms and functional status at the present time using IKDC 2000 (International Knee Documentation Committee) and KOOS (Knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score).</detailed_description>
