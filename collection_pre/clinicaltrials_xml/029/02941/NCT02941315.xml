	<brief_title>Risk Stratification of Heart Failure in Cardiomyopathies.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiomyopathy is a category of multiple causes of myocardial injury in structure and function, of which unexplained cardiomyopathy was most worried by cardiologists. Since the etiology confirmation sometimes still lacks of effective tools, therefore it can not be treated against etiology and may gradually developing to systolic or diastolic heart failure. The development of heart failure can be in different speeds, varying degrees, inconsistent in reversibility, and distinct response to treatment of heart failure. In "real-world", ECG , cardiac ultrasound and myocardial enzymology can not be the whole to indicate the etiology of heart failure, so a strong clinical tool in the existing auxiliary examination is urgently needed and help to assess the risk of potential heart failure, therefore a reasonable treatment time window can be proposed. The investigators aimed to use CMR technique in helping diagnose the etiology of unknown cardiomyopathy. Try to make a risk stratification of susceptible heart failure based on the extent of myocardial impairment.</detailed_description>
