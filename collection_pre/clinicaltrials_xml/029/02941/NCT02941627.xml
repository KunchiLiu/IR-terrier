	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and the safety profile of the Neuro Cochlear Implant System (CIS) in adults with severe to profound sensorineural hearing disabilities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Neuro Zti Cochlear Implant System Efficacy and Safety in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new cochlear implant system is indicated in individuals with serious hearing disabilities who do not obtain benefit from appropriately fitted hearing aid(s). Cochlear implant surgery is safe, but as with any surgery, possible issues or device related issues may occur. The risk benefit balance is well known in cochlear implantation.</detailed_description>
