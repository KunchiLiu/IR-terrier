	<detailed_description>Postoperative cognitive decline is a well-known and well-described complication following coronary artery bypass grafting. Severity ranges from postoperative delirium to stroke, but the majority of patients with postoperative cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting have decline in recent and remote memory in particular. The reason for the cognitive decline is still not fully understood though many reasons have been proposed. Inflammation and oxidative stress may contribute to the postoperative cognitive dysfunction which may also be in combination with a reduced cerebral autoregulation.</detailed_description>
