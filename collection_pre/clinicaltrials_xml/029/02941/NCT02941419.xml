	<brief_summary>Induction of autologous angiogenesis in patients with critical limb ischemia using platelet lysate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of PAD by Platelet Lysate for Therapeutic Angiogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten male and female patients diagnosed with Peripheral artery disease (PAD), will be recruited. This diagnosis will be based on medical history, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and specific diagnostic tests. Patients qualified for this study, are patients with distal extremity ischemia indicated by claudication and rest pain present for a minimum of 4 weeks without evidence of improvement in response to conventional drug therapy; showed angiographic evidence of PAD in the affected limb; and were not candidates for surgical revascularization. Platelet lysate will be injected intramuscularly at different sites of the gastrocnemius muscle. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of platelet lysate injections into ischematic limbs of patients with PAD.</detailed_description>
