	<brief_summary>In patients receiving implants in the esthetic zone, would the use of new Nano hybrid ceramic crown material (Crystal Ultra) improve esthetic patient satisfaction and peri-implant tissue success when compared with Lithium Disilicate crown (E-max)?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Satisfaction and Peri-Implant Tissue Success of Hybrid Ceramic Versus E-Max Superstructures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows: Visit 1: Preoperative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, signing consents, clinical, radiographic examination and primary impression for diagnostic cast construction. Visit 2: (first stage surgery): implant placement surgical procedure and postoperative radiograph. Visit 3: After 3months (second stage surgery): re-opening of surgical site, placement of healing abutments and temporary crowns. Visit 4: After 2 weeks, removing of temporary restorations and taking of final impressions Visit 5: placement of different ceramic crown superstructures and recording different outcome values.</detailed_description>
