	<brief_summary>This will be a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio) clinical trial for patients with male-factor infertility with or without preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). Qualified 650 patients are randomized into either of two groups: group A will undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) without PGS (325 cases), Group B will undergo ICSI with PGS (690 cases). The partners of all participants will receive the same protocol for ovarian stimulation and standardized luteal phase support. The target population will be patients with male-factor infertility aged between 20 and 50 years, diagnosed by the ESHER Criteria (oligospermia and asthenspermia). Women with other reasons of infertility (eg. anovulation, endometriosis, and premature ovarian failure) are excluded. The randomization will take place before the oocyte pick-up day by a computer randomization system. The pregnancy test results, pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies, neonatal complications will be followed up by checking medical records and telephone calls.</brief_summary>
