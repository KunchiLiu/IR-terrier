	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the safety, in terms of percentage of patients with symptomatic documented hypoglycemia during Ramadan fast, of lixisenatide versus sulfonylurea (SU). Secondary Objectives: - To assess effect of lixisenatide versus SU on: - Changes in glycemic control; - Changes in body weight. - To assess overall safety of lixisenatide and SU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Assessment of Lyxumia (Lixisenatide) and Sulfonylurea as Add-on Treatment to Basal Insulin in Uncontrolled Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Who Elect to Fast During Ramadan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration per patient will have a minimum 12 weeks and maximum 22 weeks (up to 2 weeks screening period + 8-12 weeks pre-Ramadan period + 29-30 days Ramadan + 0 4 weeks post-Ramadan period). This is a phase 3b study in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh (instead of phase 4 for other countries).</detailed_description>
