	<brief_summary>In high-risk patients, it is now recommended to guide the intraoperative volume replacement via the stroke volume. Today, the most commonly used technique for estimating the stroke volume is the transpulmonary thermodilution and the arterial waveform analysis in the radial artery by PICCO®. This technique has the disadvantage of being invasive and increasing the time dedicated to anesthesia during the surgery. The future is the non-invasive monitoring of stroke volume. Thus, Edwards Life Science has developed a continuous monitoring technology and non-invasive arterial pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume using a digital sensor (ClearSight®). This continuous monitoring of blood pressure was validated in cardiothoracic surgery but studies about monitoring cardiac output or stroke volume are inconclusive and contradictory. The objective of this study is to compare the use of non-invasive monitoring of stroke volume by ClearSight® with the transpulmonary thermodilution and the arterial waveform analysis in radial artery by PICCO® in abdominal major surgery.</brief_summary>
