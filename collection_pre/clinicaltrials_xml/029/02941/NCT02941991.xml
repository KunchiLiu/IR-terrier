	<brief_title>A Follow up Study to Determine the Safety and Tolerability of Sub-retinal Transplantation of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Derived Retinal Pigmented Epithelial (hESC-RPE) Cells in Patients With Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy (SMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a long-term, extension of a Phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized, 4-cohort, multi-center clinical trial (referred to as the core trial or core protocol) in which a maximum of 12 SMD patients were transplanted with sequential doses of hESC-RPE cells, starting at a dose of 50,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted and increasing to a maximum dose of 200,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted. Eligible patients will be those who sign a consent form for the extension study, and who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The first visit of this extension protocol will correspond to the last visit of the core protocol, and will take place at 12 months post-cell implantation. During the first year after completion of the core protocol, i.e. from Year 1 to Year 2 post-transplantation, the patients will be evaluated at approximately 6-month intervals; during Year 3, Year 4 and Year 5 post-transplantation, patients will be evaluated annually. Follow-up will include obtaining information about visual acuity, ophthalmological findings and adverse events (AEs), specifically including cancer, neurological, autoimmune or hematological disorders that developed or worsened since the last visit.</detailed_description>
