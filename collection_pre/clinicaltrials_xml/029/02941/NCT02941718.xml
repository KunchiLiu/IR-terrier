	<brief_summary>Most treatment-seeking smokers will fail in their attempts to quit smoking in the early days and weeks of quitting. Poor sleep (e.g., short duration) is an overlooked, but important nicotine withdrawal symptom that can affect up to 80% of treatment seeking smokers and predicts relapse. Addressing sleep deficits could promote cessation, particularly in smokers who may be vulnerable to poor sleep in one or more sleep metrics even before quitting. This study will address this conceptual and empirical gap by conducting a 12-week proof-of-concept study to determine whether standard smoking cessation treatment can be optimized with a multi-metric sleep advancement counseling intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination of Sleep, Smoking Cessation, and Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the impact and efficacy of a sleep advancement counseling (SAC) protocol in response to standard nicotine dependence treatment (behavioral counseling + varenicline) in a sample of 90 treatment seeking smokers from the greater Newark city/Newcastle county area. Following eligibility assessment, 90 eligible and consenting treatment-seeking smokers will be randomized to either the experimental smoking cessation + SAC (N=60), or the control, smoking cessation + general health education (GHE) alone (N=30) condition. Participants will complete five behavioral counseling sessions over a 12-week treatment period (wks 1, 3, 5, 8, 12): four will be 75-minute sessions (15 mins will be sleep (experimental condition) or general health education (control condition) counseling) conducted in a small (n=7-10) group context. The fifth session will be an individual fifteen-minute booster session in week 12. Seven-day objective (actigraph) recording of sleep, physical activity and sedentary behavior will occur in weeks 1, 3 and 12 for all participants. A 12-week follow-up (24th study week) assessment will be conducted in-person to allow for the objective assessment of smoking status and cardiovascular markers.</detailed_description>
