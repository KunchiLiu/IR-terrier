	<brief_summary>Evaluate the operation of the Implantable Subcutaneous String Defibrillator (ISSD) system in patients who require an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) using an emulator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Defibrillation Performance of a Novel Can-less Shock Pathway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the operation, safety, and feasibility of the ISSD system in patients who require an ICD. An ISSD emulator will be briefly implanted and tested during the standard implantation procedure of an ICD, and then entirely removed. The emulator is not a powered medical device. This acute intra-operative protocol will test the ability of the ISSD to appropriately convert tachyarrhythmia.</detailed_description>
