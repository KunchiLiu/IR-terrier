	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of placebo to the normal treatment course of methadone in patients who are undergoing treatment for opioid use disorder. All participants will be enrolled in a methadone outpatient treatment program who have been prescribed a daily regimen of methadone. Half of the participants will be given a placebo pill (to be taken with the methadone), and the other half will be given standard treatment of care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Harnessing Placebo Effects in Methadone Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological conditioning via placebo on treatment outcomes in patients newly admitted for methadone maintenance treatment. 120 new patients entering into the Maryland Methadone Treatment Program Center will be recruited to participate in the research study, and in a randomized, controlled trial, will be assigned to groups receiving placebo (Placebo Dose Extension [PDE] group) or Treatment-As-Usual (TAU; Control group). Participants will be told that the study is designed to investigate the efficacy of methadone treatment that is enhanced via inner healing processes (pharmacological conditioning). Participants assigned to the PDE group will be given placebo pills, and will be asked to take one placebo pill for two weeks, immediately prior to receiving their methadone dose, starting on the first day of their methadone treatment (Day 0). On weeks three and four, participants will be instructed to supplement this morning placebo pill dose with a second placebo pill (evening dose), taken twelve hours later at home. The reason for this two-phase placebo pill administration protocol is that a strong association is made between the placebo pill and the methadone in weeks one and two; this strong association continues to be reinforced in weeks 3 and 4. We expect that methadone will act as an unconditioned stimulus and the placebo pill will act as a conditioned stimulus, thus evoking the conditioned responses to methadone of decreased craving and withdrawal. Participants in the Control group will receive the same amount of interaction with the investigators, and like the participants selected to receive placebo, they will be informed of the placebo effect.</detailed_description>
