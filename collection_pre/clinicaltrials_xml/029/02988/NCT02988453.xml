	<brief_title>Mentalization-based Training for Adolescents With Conduct Disorder (MBT-CD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Conduct Disorder is a severe and complex mental disorder with the highest incidence in adolescence. Previous studies have shown that family-oriented interventions are effective in the treatment of Conduct Disorder. However, most therapies focus rather on symptom management and less on etiological causes without inclusion of the family in the therapeutic process. Previous research has linked specific symptoms of Conduct Disorder with deficits in mentalization ability. Mentalization is the ability to perceive one's own and other's behavior as the product of affective and cognitive mental states. Low or missing mentalization abilities are regarded as a risk factor for the development and chronification of Conduct Disorder. Aims: The study aims to investigate the efficacy of a newly manualized psychotherapy "Mentalization-Based Training for Adolescents with Conduct Disorder (MBT-CD)" that strives to decrease symptoms associated with Conduct Disorder by increasing mentalization in adolescents and their families. Methods: The study is a single blind, randomized controlled trial, carried out in Heidelberg (Germany), Klagenfurt (Austria) and Innsbruck (Austria). 102 adolescents aged between 12-17, who meet the DSM-5 criteria for Conduct Disorder will be randomized to either MBT or TAU. Times of measurement: t0 (Screening), T1 (Baseline, at the beginning of therapy), T2 (6 months after the beginning of therapy), T3 (at the end of therapy, after 12 months), T4 (follow-up, after 18 months).</detailed_description>
