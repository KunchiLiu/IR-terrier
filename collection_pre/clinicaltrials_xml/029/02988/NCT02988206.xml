	<brief_title>Personalized Objects Can Improve the Diagnosis of EMCS From MCS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) is an important tool for the assessment of behaviors in DOC.Clinical practice has shown that self-referential stimuli, such as the patient's own name and face, are more effective to elicit the patient's response than that of non-self-referential stimuli. The item "Functional Object Use" was assessed by using personalized objects (e.g., cigarette, paper) and non-personalized objects, which presented in a random order.The rest assessments were performed following the standard protocol of CRS-R. The differences between functional use of the two types of objects was analyzed by Chi-square test. Researchers expected to see some of the patients in MCS are re-diagnosed as EMCS with the using of personalized objects.</detailed_description>
