	<brief_summary>In pediatric age groups communication difficulties very sometimes may present further obstacles in obtaining a detailed injury history and early identification of TBI symptoms. Most emergency management protocols are focused exclusively on the identification of the relatively small number of patients who may require operative intervention, as early surgery is believed to improve outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Concentration of Biomarkers S100B and NSE in Serum in Mild and Moderate Head Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>However early rehabilitation can also be effective for the much larger number of patients who do not require surgery[1] In addition, Hall and others recently reported that low doses of ionizing radiation to the brain in infancy may influence cognitive abilities in adulthood. [2] Accordingly, increased serum concentrations of, for example S100B ( a calcium-binding protein present in high concentrations in glial cells) and neurone-specific enolase ( NSE: a cytoplasmatic enzyme occuring predominantly in neurones ) have been demonstrated to reflect the presence and severity of brain tissue damage in acute head injuries. [3] In both pediatric age and adults.</detailed_description>
