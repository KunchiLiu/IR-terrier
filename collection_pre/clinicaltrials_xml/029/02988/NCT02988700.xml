	<brief_summary>Caudal analgesia along with general anesthesia is a very popular regional technique for prolonged postoperative analgesia in different pediatric surgical procedures where the surgical site is sub-umbilical. Caudal anesthetics usually provide analgesia for approximately 4-6 hours. Recently, the use of spinal anesthesia in infants and children requiring surgeries of sub-umbilical region is gaining considerable popularity worldwide. - The ease of performance and the safety regarding cardio-respiratory functions makes spinal anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia in infants and children undergoing surgeries of sub-umbilical regions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spinal Versus Caudal Analgesia After Pediatric Infra-umbilical Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The historic view that young children neither respond to, nor remember, painful experiences to the same degree as adults is no longer thought to be true. About 40% of pediatric surgical patients experienced moderate or severe postoperative pain and 75% had insufficient analgesia. -Pediatric acute pain services use techniques of concurrent or co-analgesia based on four classes of analgesics, namely local anesthetics, opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and acetaminophen (paracetamol). Caudal analgesia along with general anesthesia is a very popular regional technique for prolonged postoperative analgesia in different pediatric surgical procedures where the surgical site is sub-umbilical.
