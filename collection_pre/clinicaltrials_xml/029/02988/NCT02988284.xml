	<detailed_description>Three hundred healthy individuals will be participants of the study. Participants will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body mass, year, side and level of limb loss will be recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step length) will evaluate with Gait Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed. To eliminate the learning effect, participants practiced at treadmill to determine appropriate gait speed. Once participants implied the preferred speed, they asked to walk at their self selected speed for 6 minutes. Data was recorded between the 4nd and 6th minutes at walk.</detailed_description>
