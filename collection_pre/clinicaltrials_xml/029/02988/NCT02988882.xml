	<criteria>1. be at least 18 years of age of either sex and any race; 2. provide written informed consent and sign the HIPAA form; 3. be willing and able to follow all instructions and attend all study visits; 4. (for females capable of becoming pregnant) agree to have urine pregnancy testing performed at screening (must be negative) and at exit visit ; must not be lactating; and must agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control throughout the study duration and for at least 14 days prior to insertion of the investigational product (Visit 3b) and for one month after investigational product removal. Women considered capable of becoming pregnant include all females who have experienced menarche and have not experienced menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for greater than 12 consecutive months) or have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy); 5. have a positive history of ocular allergies and a positive skin test reaction to a perennial allergen (cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, cockroaches) and a seasonal allergen (trees, grasses, and/or ragweed) as confirmed by the allergic skin test given at the subject's Screening visit; 6. have a calculated visual acuity of 0.7 logMAR or better in each eye as measured using an ETDRS chart; 7. have a positive bilateral CAC® reaction to a perennial allergen within 10 (±2) minutes of instillation of the last titration of allergen at Visit 1; 8. have a positive bilateral CAC® reaction3 for at least two out of the three time points following challenge at Visit 2a and 2b; 9. have an average of ≥ 3 itching and ≥2.5 conjunctival redness for both eyes after postCAC® assessments at Visit 3a; 10. be able and willing to avoid all disallowed medication for the appropriate washout period and during the study (see exclusion 6); 11. be able and willing to discontinue wearing contact lenses for at least 72 hours prior to and during the study trial period. 1. have known contraindications or sensitivities to the use of any of the investigational product medication or components; 2. have any ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the subject's safety or trial parameters (including but not limited to narrow angle glaucoma, clinically significant blepharitis, follicular conjunctivitis, iritis, pterygium or a diagnosis of dry eye); 3. have had a history of refractive surgery (including LASIK procedures) within the past 2 years; 4. have a known history of retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, or active retinal disease; 5. have the presence of an active ocular infection (bacterial, viral or fungal), or positive history of an ocular herpetic infection at any visit; 6. use any of the following disallowed medications* during the period indicated prior to Visit 1 and during the study: 7 Days systemic or ocular H1 antihistamine, H1 antihistamine/mastcell stabilizer drug combinations, H1 antihistamine vasoconstrictor drug combinations; decongestants; monoamine oxidase inhibitors; all other topical ophthalmic preparations (including artificial tears); lid scrubs; prostaglandins or prostaglandin derivatives; ocular, topical, or systemic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); 14 Days inhaled, ocular or topical corticosteroids or mast cell stabilizers; 45 Days depotcorticosteroids; *Note: Currently marketed overthecounter antiallergy eye drops (ie antihistamine/ vasoconstrictor combination products such as Visine®A®) may be administered to subjects at the end of the subject's last visit, after all evaluations are completed; 7. have a congenital or ocular anomaly (including punctal or lid ectropion, entropion, trichiasis, or supernumerary puncta) or anomalies of the punctum (including lack of good punctal apposition in both eyes); 8. have a current diagnosis or history of Herpes Simplex Keratitis; 9. have a diagnosis of any significant illness [eg, an autoimmune disease, severe cardiovascular disease (including arrhythmias), or condition requiring immunosuppressives or cancer chemotherapeutic agents]. This includes but is not limited to: alcohol or drug abuse, hypertension, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, hepatitis, scleroderma, vitamin a deficiency, Sjögren's syndrome, a history of status asthmaticus, a known history of persistent moderate or severe asthma, or a known history of moderate to severe allergic asthmatic reactions to any of the study allergens; 10. have a score of &gt;0 for itching and/or &gt;1 for conjunctival redness prior to challenge (at Visit 1) in either eye; 11. have planned surgery (ocular or systemic) during the trial period or within 30 days after; 12. have used an investigational drug or medical device within 30 days of the study or be concurrently enrolled in another investigational product trial; 13. be a female who is currently pregnant, planning a pregnancy, lactating, not using a medically acceptable form of birth control throughout the study duration and for at least 14 days prior to insertion of the investigational product and for one month after investigational product removal, or has a positive urine pregnancy test at Visit 1; 14. have an intraocular pressure that is less than 5 mmHg or greater than 22 mmHg or any type of glaucoma at Visit 1; 15. have had a history of an IOP increase as a result of steroid treatment. 16. Punctum size is smaller than 0.4 mm or greater than or equal to 1.0 mm; 17. Punctum is too small to allow transient dilation to 0.7 mm prior to insertion of OTXDP or the PV.</criteria>
