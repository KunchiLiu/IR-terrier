	<brief_summary>Bipolar disorder is a major health concern. Intercritical periods are marked with residual symptoms, both thymic and cognitive, which affects quality of life of patients, but also the quality of observance. The implementation of cognitive remediation programs could be interesting. The aim of this study is to evaluate the overall performance on euthymic bipolar patients with memory complaints included in the program named "COGMED", targeting the working memory. The impact of this program on compliance, quality of life, and memory complaints will be evaluated. The investigator will measure whether there is a correlation between working memory and overall performances. Finally, the investigator will try to achieve a profile of bipolar patients in whom the Cogmed program is particularly effective on a plan of overall performance.</brief_summary>
