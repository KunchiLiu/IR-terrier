	<brief_summary>Objective 1: Determine the safety and feasibility of externally mounted magnets for extended management of chronic eyelid movement disorders by measuring visual acuity and corneal and skin integrity and comfort over 8 weeks of wear. Objective 2: Collect preliminary data on the relative efficacy of external magnetic devices by comparing them to externally mounted lid weights and ptosis crutches using rating scales and video analysis of blink biomechanics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two major types of eye lid movement disorders include lagophthalmos (incomplete closure of the eyelids) and blepharoptosis (incomplete opening of the eyelids). Both of these conditions occur because of a disruption in the normal agonist-antagonist neuro-muscular complex balance. Generally paralysis of the eyelid or facial muscles is responsible for the abnormality (the eyelids can close but not open, or open but not close). An external device, if able to generate an appropriately balanced force, could restore eyelid movement by performing the paralyzed function; for example, a ptotic (droopy) eyelid could be opened, and the functioning eyelid closure muscle could overcome the device's force. In prior work the investigators established proof-of-concept data demonstrating safety and efficacy for temporary management of ptosis up to 2 hour per day for 2 weeks. Preliminary data suggest similar safety for lagophthalmos. This study will expand on this preliminary work to examine longer wear times, home use, and feasibility for a wider range of eye lid disorders.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Presence of an eyelid movement disorder for at least one eye, moderate cognitive function or better defined as greater than or equal to 18 out of 30 on a prescreening of the MiniMental State Exam, age 5 or older. Absence of an eyelid movement disorder or presence of a corneal ulcer. Those with a corneal ulcer are at risk for permanent loss of vision and should be managed with proven methods. Age less than 5, Severe Cognitive impairment defined as Minimental score &lt;18, behaviors consistent with delirium (combinations of disorientation, hallucinations, delusions, and incoherent speech), or lethargy. These individuals must be excluded since participation requires competent selfcare, reliable responses and cooperation during fitting of the devices.</criteria>
