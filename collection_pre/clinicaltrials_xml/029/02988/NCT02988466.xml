	<brief_summary>This is a single institution phase II study of a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) followed by a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (haplo-HCT) in persons with diagnosis of hematologic malignancy. Conditioning will consists of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) preparative regimen with a melphalan dose reduction for patients ≥55 years old and those with HCT Comorbidity Index (CI) &gt;3. This study uses a two-stage phase II design with accrual goal of 44 patients, using 22 patients separately for arms A and B.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Karnofsky performance status of ≥70% or Lansky play score ≥ 70% A related haploidentical bone marrow donor with up to 2 or 3 HLA locusmismatches The donor and recipient must be HLA identical for at least one haplotype (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLAA, HLAB, HLAC, and HLADRB1. Adequate liver and renal function Absence of decompensated congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40% Diffusion capacity corrected (DLCOcorr) &gt; 40% predicted, and absence of O2 requirements &gt; 6 months after prior autologous transplant (if applicable) Agrees to use contraception during study treatment Voluntary written consent (adult or parent/guardian with presentation of the minor information sheet, if appropriate) &lt; 70 years with an available 56/6 HLAA, B, DRB1 matched sibling donor Pregnancy or breastfeeding Evidence of HIV infection or known HIV positive serology Current active and uncontrolled serious infection Acute leukemia in morphologic relapse/persistent disease defined as &gt; 5% blasts in normocellular bone marrow OR any % blasts if blasts have unique morphologic markers (e.g. Auer rods). CML in blast crisis Large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease that is progressive on salvage therapy. stable nonbulky disease is acceptable. Active central nervous system malignancy Criteria For Donor Selection: Donors must be HLAhaploidentical relatives of the patient, defined as having a shared HLA haplotype between donor and patient at HLAA, B, C, and DRB1. Eligible donors (1470 years old) include biological children, siblings or half siblings, or parents, able and willing to undergo bone marrow harvesting. For donors &lt;18 years, the maximum recipient weight (actual body weight) should not exceed 1.25 times the donor weight (actual body weight)1 In addition, bone marrow product volume should be limited to 20 ml/kg donor weight for donors &lt;18 years.</criteria>
