	<brief_summary>Twelve individuals with above knee limb loss, 12 individuals with below knee limb loss,15 healthy individuals will be participants of the study. Participants with lower limb loss will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body mass will be recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step length, time on each foot, ambulation index) will evaluate with Gait Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Gait Characteristics in Individuals With Above and Below Knee Limb Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve individuals with above knee limb loss, 12 individuals with below knee limb loss,15 healthy individuals who were referred to receive amputee rehabilitation at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Health Sciences, department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Prosthetics and Biomechanics unit, and healthy individuals will be the subjects of this study. Participants will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body mass will be recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step length, time on each foot, ambulation index, gait speed) will evaluate with Gait Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed. To eliminate the learning effect, participants practiced at treadmill to determine appropriate gait speed. Once participants implied the preferred speed, they asked to walk at their self selected speed for 6 minutes. Data was recorded between the 4nd and 6th minutes at walk.</detailed_description>
