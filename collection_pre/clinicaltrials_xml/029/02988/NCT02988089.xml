	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which infects about 50% of the global population, has been recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathologies, especially non-cardiac gastric cancer. Strongly evidence supports that H. pylori eradication is an effective approach to reduce the incidence of those pathologies.</brief_summary>
