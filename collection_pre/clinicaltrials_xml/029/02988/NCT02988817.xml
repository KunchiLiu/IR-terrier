	<brief_title>HuMax-AXL-ADC Safety Study in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial consists of two parts; a dose escalation part (phase I, first in- human (FIH)) and an expansion part (phase IIa). The dose escalation part has two dose escalation arms: the first arm investigates a once every 3 weeks (1Q3W) dose schedule and the second one investigates a three administrations over 4 weeks (3Q4W) dose schedule. The Expansion part of the trial, will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose of HuMax-AXL-ADC as determined in Part 1</detailed_description>
