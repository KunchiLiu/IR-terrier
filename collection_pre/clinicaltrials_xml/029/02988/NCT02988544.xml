	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine if collapsing an embryo (or making it fold compactly by taking away its fluid) before the transfer in the uterine cavity improves pregnancy rates in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Women coming to our ART center will be randomized in two groups : the collapsing group and a control group. Pregnancy rates will be compared in the two groups. A biomarker (cell free DNA) will also be determined in each group and correlated to pregnancy occurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artificial Shrinkage of Fresh Blastocysts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized study designed to determine if artificial shrinkage (AS) before transfer of embryos impact clinical pregnancy rate in single blastocyst embryo transfer (SBET) cycle. Women elected for SBET will be randomized on transfer day in two arms:the AS group where blastocoelic cavity is artificially reduced by a laser pulse prior to transfer and a control group. Clinical pregnancy rates will be compared. Secondarily, rate of monozygotic twin pregnancy and cell free DNA concentration in culture medium will be evaluated in the two groups.</detailed_description>
