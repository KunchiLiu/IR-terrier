	<brief_summary>Children in extreme poverty lack adequate care and face increased health risks. The earlier poverty strikes in the developmental process, the more deleterious and long-lasting its effects. There is, however, growing evidence that early interventions can prevent the negative consequences. Such interventions are effective, particularly when they are of high quality, organized at home and parents are involved. Recently, baseline assessment of developmental and nutritional status of SOS children and children in extreme poverty in Jimma region of South-West Ethiopia revealed that these children have developmental problems in language, motor, social-emotional skills and nutritional status. The impact of play-oriented stimulation activities integrated into the existing SOS basic program, on developmental outcomes, has never been investigated in this context. The main objective of the study is, therefore, to evaluate the impact of play-oriented stimulation integrated into the basic SOS program on the developmental outcomes of children living with foster families. This was done by comparing the intervention children with their age-matched children (control), not receiving the stimulation package. It was hypothesized that this package would significantly improve the developmental skills of these children.</brief_summary>
