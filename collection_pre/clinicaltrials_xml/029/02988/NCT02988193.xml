	<detailed_description>GOAL: Conduct a prospective randomized pilot clinical trial embedded within the care delivery system at University of California Medical Center (UCSF MC). It is intended to evaluate the efficacy of a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence in improving medication treatment management for patients with poorly controlled hypertension (HTN). Its primary goal is to de-risk the implementation of a subsequent randomized and powered for clinical efficacy trial. RECRUITMENT: patients with uncontrolled HTN (≥10 mmHg above BP national guidelines goal) at UCSF MC Cardiology Clinic. STUDY: Three-arms study: (a) optima4BP surveillance and treatment recommendation support (O4BP); (b) usual care (UC) - usual care seen as needed by the treating physician; (c) enhanced care (EC) - UC + raw remotely collected BP values sent to the treating physician. All patients will undergo at least 2 in-office visits, a baseline visit and an exit visit. All patients will be asked to provide every 30 days the following information: (a) adherence to current HTN treatment; and (b) experienced side-effects and severity. Health-e-Heart (HeH) automated system (https://www.health-eheartstudy.org/) will collect the Qardio® data, as frequently as the patient records them, and provide patients with a unique link to a secure web interface for reporting of side-effects, adherence, and symptoms. Every 30 days, the collection of patient information will be followed by an arm-specific action. For identified patients in need of a medication change, O4BP physicians will receive a treatment change recommendation for review. UC physicians will not receive any information, while EC physicians will receive curated BP values reported by the patient. ANALYSES: The impact of O4BP arm on coordination of care will be determined by: - evaluating interoperability between multiple platforms in collecting-structuring-exchanging data - evaluating improvement in quality of care (physician adoption) and quality of life (patient adoption) versus EC and UC care.</detailed_description>
