	<brief_summary>The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the LTRC. Collections of specimens will be linked to individual clinical data appropriate to the particular disease. The primary goal of the LTRC is to identify participants with suspected lung cancer or metastatic disease who are willing to provide informed consent for research use of their specimens and data. Secondarily, the LTRC investigators intend to collect clinical data, limited exposure data, physiologic studies, and radiographic studies from these participants.</brief_summary>
