	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with functional features of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) are advancing imaging technologies that have potential to overcome limitations of conventional staging methods, radiation treatment planning and the assessment of tumor response in esophageal or esophagogastric cancer. This study aimed to explore the value of MRI for the prediction of tumor response to chemoradiotherapy and accurate target volume delineation as compared to CT simulation for patients with unresectable or potentially resectable esophageal or esophagogastric cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The average CT texture features are also extracted before and during treatment to establish a model to predict the prognosis of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI in the Evaluation of Tumor Response and Target Volume Definition for Esophageal or Esophagogastric Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Both DW-MRI and CT simulation will be performed before chemoradiotherapy and after 18-22 fractions. Also MRI will be performed after treatment. The investigators will contour based on the MRI image and compare this with the standard CT plan before and during treatment. 2. The predictive potential of initial tumor ADC, and change in ADC during and after treatment for tumor response will be assessed. 3. The average CT texture features will be extracted before and during treatment to establish a model to predict the prognosis of patients.</detailed_description>
