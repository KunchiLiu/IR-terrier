	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mutation pattern of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other TKI targeted gene during TKI treatment of advanced NSCLC patient with liquid biopsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>cSMART Liquid Biopsy and Dynamic Monitor of NSCLC Patients in Inner-Mongolia China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the study, 200 advanced NSCLC patients will be recruited. All the patients will receive biopsy genotype assay and Circulating Single-Molecule Amplification and Resequencing Technology (cSMART) liquid biopsy. those patients who carry EGFR activating mutation and other TKI targeted activating mutation will receive TKI treatment. During the TKI treatment, every patients will take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the mutation status. the study will be ended when all the patients had a progressive disease (PD) in their targeted lesion</detailed_description>
