	<brief_title>Presenting Summary Information From Cochrane Systematic Reviews: Protocol for Research of Infographics Presentation vs. Plain Language Summary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two different formats of the same systematic review summary (Infographics, PLS). The content of these two formats is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data presentation will differ: visual presentation in plain language and plain language only. The interventions will be delivered online in November 2016, with members of the consumers' groups for pregnancy and parenting - RODA ("Roditelji u akciji", engl."Parents in action"), which gathers different types of consumers: pregnant women, young mothers and parenting and pregnancy advisors; and the members of the Association for Patients' Rights. The trial will be voluntary and anonymous. The survey will consist of 5 parts, in the following order: 1) one format of the summary (randomly assigned), 2) health numeracy, 3) demographic data 4) comprehension test of the information given in the summary, and 5) user friendliness of information and overall satisfaction with the given summary assessed by survey.</detailed_description>
