	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug, TVB-2640, is able to affect levels of certain enzymes in subject's blood and cause changes in tumor. This study is only for people who require surgery for their colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Effects of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) Inhibition With TVB-2640 in Resectable Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Purpose of study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects on metabolic endpoints (malonyl carnitine and tripalmitin levels) following short-term treatment with TVB-2640 in patients with resectable colon cancer.48 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study. The accrual rate is estimated to be 4 per month.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed, resectable colon cancer without distant metastases, who are candidates for surgical resection of the tumor. Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. Male or female who is ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (fully active, able to carry out all predisease activities without restriction) or 1 (unable to perform physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature). Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by: 1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 2. ANC count ≥ 1.5 X 109/L 3. Platelets ≥ 100 X 109/L No significant ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before the first dose of study drug and currently has adequate cardiac function, as evidenced by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 50% as assessed by multigated acquisition (MUGA) or ultrasound/echocardiography (ECHO); and corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt; 470 msec Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control, be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 90 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Male patients should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 90 days after the last dose of study therapy, or documented to be surgically sterile Willing to participate in the study and comply with all study requirements. Inability to swallow oral medications or impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter drug absorption (including, but not limited to active inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndrome). Concomitant therapy with antacids and antiemetics is permissible History of risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome). Concomitant use of medications with a low risk of QT/QTc prolongation (including, but not limited to diphenhydramine, famotidine, ondansetron) is permissible. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. Having received cancerdirected therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic or immunotherapy, etc) or an investigational drug within 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) or 5 halflives of that agent (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of study drug. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of trial treatment Inoperable on the basis of coexistent medical problems History of clinically significant dry eye (xerophthalmia) or other corneal abnormality or, if a contact lens wearer, does not agree to abstain from contact lens use from Day 1 through the last dose of study drug. Other concurrent disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion would increase the risk of participating in the study.</criteria>
