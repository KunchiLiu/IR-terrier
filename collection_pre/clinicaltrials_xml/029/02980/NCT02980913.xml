	<brief_summary>Dry eye syndrome is a highly prevalent ocular disease with an increasing incidence in the elderly population. Topically administered lubricants are the basis for treatment of this disease. Relief of symptoms in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease is usually reached by the use of artificial tears during the day. Nighttime relief is often achieved by substances known to be more adhesive to the ocular surface, such as gels.</brief_summary>
