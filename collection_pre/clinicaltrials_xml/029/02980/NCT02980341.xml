	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, three-part, non-randomized, multiple-dose study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of U3-1402 in patients with HER3-positive metastatic breast cancer. HER3 is a unique member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor, which defines a certain type of cancer. The number of patients and treatment cycles are not fixed in this study. Subjects who continue to derive clinical benefit from the study treatment in the absence of withdrawal of consent, progressive disease (PD), or unacceptable toxicity may continue the study treatment until the end of the trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Has a pathologically documented advanced/unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. 3. Documented HER3positive disease measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (IHC 2+ or 3+). 4. Has been treated with standard treatment, or for which no standard treatment is available. 5. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 01. 6. Has Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction â‰¥ 50%. 7.

Has received 6 or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens including anthracyclines and taxanes. 1. Prior treatment with a HER3 antibody. 2. Prior treatment with an antibodydrug conjugate (ADC) which consists of an exatecan derivative that is a topoisomerase I inhibitor (eg, DS8201). 3. Has a medical history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association classes IIIV) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment. 4.

Has a medical history of clinically significant lung diseases (eg, interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and severe radiation pneumonitis) or who are suspected to have these diseases by imaging at screening period. 7. Has cataracts, glaucoma, or increased intraocular pressure at baseline.</criteria>
