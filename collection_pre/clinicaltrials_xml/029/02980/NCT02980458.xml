	<brief_summary>The present study will be conducted in order to compare the bioavailability of the generic Test product (Deferiprone 500 Lipomed tablets, Lipomed AG, Switzerland) with a marketed Reference product (Ferriprox® film-coated tablets, Apotex Europe B.V., Germany) both containing 500 mg deferiprone. For this issue the pharmacokinetics will be characterised after single dose administration of each one tablet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterisation of Relative Bioavailability With Bioequivalence Assessment of Deferiprone Tablets After Oral Single Dose Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be performed in an open-label, randomised (order of treatments), single dose, 2 period cross-over design with a wash out phase of at least three treatment free days between both administrations. Sample collection will be performed over eight hours after fasted administration. This time is considered adequate for the determination of plasma concentration vs. time profiles long enough for reliable estimation of the extent of absorption, i.e. the AUC derived from measurements is expected to cover at least 80% of the AUC extrapolated to infinity for deferiprone</detailed_description>
