	<brief_summary>The purpose of this open-label, single-arm study is to evaluate the impact of venetoclax on the quality of life of participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; a type of cancer affecting the blood and the bone marrow) including those with the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation (local lab assessed) OR in CLL participants who have received prior B-Cell Receptor Inhibitor (BCRi) therapy. The starting dose of venetoclax is 20 mg once daily. The dose must be gradually increased over a period of 5 weeks up to the daily dose of 400 mg. Participants may continue receiving venetoclax for up to 2 years. After the treatment period, participants may continue on into a 2-year follow-up period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of less than or equal to 2. Participant has relapsed/refractory disease (received at least one prior therapy). Diagnosis of CLL that meets published 2008 Modified International Workshop on CLL National Cancer Institute Working Group (IWCLL NCIWG) Guidelines and: has an indication for treatment according to the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCIWG Guidelines has clinically measurable disease (lymphocytosis &gt; 5 Ã— 109/L and/or palpable and measurable nodes by physical exam and/or organomegaly assessed by physical exam) In addition, Participants: may harbor 17p deletion or TP53 mutation, assessed by a local laboratory in bone marrow or peripheral blood AND / OR may have been previously treated with a prior Bcell receptor inhibitor Adequate bone marrow function. Participant has developed Richter's transformation or Prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). Participant has previously received venetoclax. History of active malignancies other than CLL within the past 2 years prior to first dose of venetoclax, with the exception of: adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin previous malignancy confined and surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent. Active and uncontrolled autoimmune cytopenias (within 2 weeks prior to screening), including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), despite low dose corticosteroids. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.</criteria>
