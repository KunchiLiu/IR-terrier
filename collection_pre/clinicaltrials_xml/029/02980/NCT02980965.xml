	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemo-endocrine Therapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in ER-positive, HER2-negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data showed that concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with endocrine therapy was a effective option for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients. However this is still a controversial issue. The present study is an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial that aims to investigate the efficacy of concurrent NCT with endocrine therapy (AI with or without GnRH-a) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast carcinoma.</detailed_description>
