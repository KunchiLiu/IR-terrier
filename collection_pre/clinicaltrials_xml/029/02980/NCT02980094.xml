	<brief_summary>The project aims to study the effects of inclusion of sunflower oil, vitamin E and selenium in the diet of dairy cows on milk composition and the influence of modified milk on nutrition and health of elderly. To achieve those goals, two experiments will be conducted, both lasting 12 weeks. In the first one, 24 cows at the beginning of lactation will be allotted in a completely randomized block design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments, as follow: 1) control diet; 2) control diet plus selenium and vitamin E; 3) control diet plus sunflower oil diet; 4) control diet plus sunflower oil, selenium and vitamin E. This experiment seeks the development of modified milks through nutritional manipulation of cow's diet. Concomitantly, in the second experiment, 100 elderly people will receive the four different kinds of milk produced in the first experiment in a completely randomized block (gender) design. The selection of the elderly for each group shall be composed clinical evaluations. Will be conducted biochemical tests before and after supplementation of milk consumption (serum Î±-tocopherol, selenium, analysis of fatty acid profile). Assessment of nutritional status will be made body mass index (BMI) with each participant before and after the experiment of 12 weeks, including body composition by multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), evaluating the strength of pressure of the hand portable dynamometer, demographics and food consumption. The study of human nutrition and health will be held in the form of a double-blind study. The second experiment aims to study nutrition and health of elderly people, as it is expected that milk produced with better fatty acid profile, vitamin and minerals can improve the inflammatory profile of markers of the elderly. This project is important for the human population in general, particularly elderly people, health workers, human and animal nutritionists, and especially for the milk chain, as it has a potential to develop new dairy products and boost milk consumption.</brief_summary>
