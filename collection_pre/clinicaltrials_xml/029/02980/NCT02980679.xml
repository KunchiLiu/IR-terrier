	<brief_summary>A 99mTc Pertechnetate (G-PERT) scan is a nuclear medicine test that can create an image of the thyroid gland and other organs. G-PERT is approved by Health Canada for the direct imaging and measurement of thyroid uptake. Doctors and researchers at the University of Alberta have developed a new method of producing 99mTc Pertechnetate (called CTC). It is made in a cyclotron at the Medical Isotope and Cyclotron Facility (MICF) at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. This new production method will provide another source of 99mTc Pertechnetate. The aim of this study is to confirm that CTC is safe and can be used interchangeably with G-PERT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the Safety and Imaging Pattern of Cyclotron-produced Technetium (CTC) vs. Generator-produced Technetium (G-PERT) in People With Thyroid Disorders Who Need Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial will be a Phase III, prospective, crossover, image interpretation blinded, single site study. All subjects will receive Tc-99m pertechnetate (one CTC and one G-PERT administration separated by at least 48 hours) and subsequently be imaged for thyroid uptake and whole body biodistribution. The order of the scans will be randomized. The thyroid image will be interpreted for uptake / no uptake in the thyroid, and the whole body biodistribution image will be interpreted for uptake / no uptake in selected anatomical sites. Interpretation of thyroid imaging results will be compared with other clinical findings (such as pre-surgical ultrasound, fine needle aspirate, and post-surgical pathology results, when available). All imaging assessments will be conducted by 1 blinded Nuclear Medicine physician. A safety evaluation will be conducted on all subjects receiving CTC, consisting of vital signs, haematology and SMA-12 serum biochemistry profile (pre-injection and post-imaging), and, for both CTC and G-PERT, an adverse event assessment (until the subject leaves the Nuclear Medicine department) after each administration.</detailed_description>
