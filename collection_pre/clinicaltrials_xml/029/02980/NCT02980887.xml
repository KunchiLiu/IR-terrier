	<brief_summary>It is recognized that patients with various forms of heart and lung disease exhibit varying degrees of pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and right ventricular dysfunction. The genetic, molecular, and cellular processes driving these phenomena are not well understood. Rapid advances in high throughput omic methodology, combined with powerful bioinformatics and network biology capability, have created the opportunity to conduct studies that broadly search for homologies and differences across the spectrum of disease states associated with pulmonary hypertension, and determinants of the spectrum of right ventricular compensation that accompanies these conditions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics Program PVDOMICS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol is designed to lead to new understanding of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction, based on molecular, clinical, hemodynamic and radiographic characteristics. New classifications will be a product of association of these in depth phenotypic descriptions with specific molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. The protocol will be implemented to lead to identification of both sub-phenotypes of lung vascular disease and to biomarkers of disease that may be useful for early diagnosis or for assessment of interventions to prevent or treat this condition.</detailed_description>
