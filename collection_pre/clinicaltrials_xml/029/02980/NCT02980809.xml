	<brief_title>Topotecan Plus Apatinib Versus Topotecan Alone as Second-line Therapy in Small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor and most patients experienced relapse or progression after standard chemotherapy. Topotecan is active as second-line therapy for SCLC patients. However, even in sensitive patients, only 20% response rate and a median time to progression of 12 weeks are observed. New therapeutic options in SCLC are needed. Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. It has been approved in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy. The efficacy of apatinib in SCLC is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether topotecan plus apatinib are superior to topotecan alone as second-line therapy in small-cell lung cancer.</detailed_description>
