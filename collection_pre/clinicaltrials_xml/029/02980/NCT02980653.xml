	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the population prevalence of critical body weight loss ( more than 5% from baseline) in patients with Head and Neck cancer. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the impact of appetite, and performance status; To evaluate the change of quality of life (QoL); To evaluate the incidence of infection and hospitalization; To evaluate the safety profiles</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Megestrol Acetate Against Cancer-related Critical Body Weight Loss in Patients With H&amp;N Cancer Who Receiving CCRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis testing will be used to determine the patient number in this study. According to a preliminary data at CGMH-LK, the investigators have the untreated patients with population prevalence of critical weight loss that is 0.56, and the investigators assume the study treated population prevalence is 0.4, power set in 0.9, alpha set in 0.05.</detailed_description>
