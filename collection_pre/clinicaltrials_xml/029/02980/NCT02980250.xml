	<brief_title>Multi-Center Study of Different Doses Domperidone in Feeding Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the premature infant have been divided into four group.The first group take the 0.2mg/kg/tds domperidone as treatment ,while the other group take the 0.4mg/kg/tds domperidone,0.6mg/kg/tds domperidone and the placebo respectively . An objective index has been decided to evaluate the severity of feeding intolerance in the premature infant. 3kg/kg 5% glucose will be injected into the gastric tube .The residual glucose will be drawed out from the gastric tube. The residual percentage is the main result of the study. The main result will be compared by the secondary result to help to explain the accuracy. The secondary result is the percentage of residual milk drawed out from the gastric tube from how many milk the infant take 3 hours ago. Any adverse effect will be recorded and analysed to figure out whether is associate with the domperidone.</detailed_description>
