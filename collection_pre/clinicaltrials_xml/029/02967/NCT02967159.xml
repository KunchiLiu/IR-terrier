	<brief_summary>AZD7594 is a non steroidal, potent and selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) under development for once daily inhaled treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Abediterol is a novel and selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist with the potential for once daily treatment of asthma and COPD in fixed dose combination (FDC) with an ICS or a novel anti inflammatory (AI) agent. This study will be the first clinical study for the combination exposure of AZD7594 with abediterol as 2 compounds in FDC or in free combination via 2 separate dry powder inhalers (DPIs). This study will be conducted in healthy male subjects to minimize the effects of concomitant disease states or medications on study measurements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Disposition of Drug in Body and Safety After Administration of Single Inhaled Doses of Drugs Abediterol and AZD7594 Administered Alone, in Fixed Dose Combination and in Free Combination Using the Dry Powder Inhaler in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZD7594 is a non steroidal, potent and selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) under development for once daily inhaled treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have not been definitively shown to decrease the rate of decline in lung function that is typical of COPD. The aim is to develop AZD7594 as a well tolerated once daily selective inhaled GR modulator with an acceptable side effect profile compared to conventional ICS on the market. Abediterol is a novel and selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist with the potential for once daily treatment of asthma and COPD in fixed dose combination (FDC) with an ICS or a novel anti inflammatory (AI) agent Fixed dose ICS/LABA combination treatment is more effective in improving lung function, health status and reducing exacerbations than the individual components. The long term goal of abediterol development program in COPD is to investigate it both as a monotherapy and as a combination therapy in conjunction with an ICS or a novel anti inflammatory agent. This study will be the first clinical study for the combination exposure of AZD7594 with abediterol as 2 compounds in FDC or in free combination via 2 separate dry powder inhalers (DPIs). This study will be conducted in healthy male subjects to minimize the effects of concomitant disease states or medications on study measurements. Subjects will receive all 4 treatments in a randomized order. Given that the treatment in each period is a single dose of AZD7594, a 21 (±2) day wash out should be adequate to prevent carry over effect to next period. The abediterol elimination half life is shorter than that of AZD7594. Therefore, a 21 (±2) day wash out is sufficient for the elimination of both AZD7594 and abediterol. Overall, pre-clinical and clinical data generated to date with abediterol show expected safety profile, and support the continued studies with abediterol.</detailed_description>

Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive. 4. Subjects should be willing to follow reproductive restrictions #11 in Section 7.47.4.1 to prevent pregnancy and drug exposure of a female partner and refrain from donating sperm or fathering a child from the first day of dosing until 3 months after the last dose of IMP. 5. Be able to inhale from the DPI devices according to given instructions. 6. Able to understand, read and speak the German language. 1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. 3. Known Gilbert's syndrome, family history of Gilbert's syndrome or suspicion of Gilbert's syndrome based on liver function tests. 4. Any contraindication against the use of vagolytic or sympaticomimetic drugs, as judged by the Investigator. 5. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of IMP. 6. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results, as judged by the Investigator. 7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibodies (anti HBc Ab), hepatitis C antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 8. Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest (confirmed by 1 controlled measurement), defined as any of the following: Systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg Diastolic BP (DBP) &lt; 50 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg Pulse &lt; 50 or &gt; 90 beats per minute (bpm) 9.
