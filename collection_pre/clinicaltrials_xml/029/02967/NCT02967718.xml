	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease is still the major cause of death in China. Chinese medicine plays more and more important role in CHD prevention and treatment. Phlegm and blood stasis are its major pathological basis. Based on that, the investigator aims to evaluate the evolutionary process of CHD phlegm-blood stasis syndrome by large samples, multi-centre, cross-section observation combining with longitudinal tracking on-site survey method so as to guide the clinical treatment of CHD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of myocardial infarct (MI) and death induced by atherosclerosis or coronary artery spasm. Despite improvements in interventional and pharmacological therapy for acute MI, the mortality early after AMI remains high. Nowadays, as our life quality develops and dietary structure changes, the morbidity of hyperlipidemia dramatically increased. Based on the Chinese medicine, hyperlipidemia belongs to phlegm and it's the basis of atherosclerosis, blood-stasis is the pathological basis of ischemia. Therefore, the investigator proposes that phlegm and blood-stasis syndrome is the main differentiation on CHD. Based on that, the investigator prospectively and retrospectively explores the evolutionary process of CHD phlegm-blood stasis syndrome by large samples, multi-centre, cross-section observation combining with longitudinal tracking on-site survey method.It will provide evidence and guidance to the future clinical treatment using Chinese medicine.</detailed_description>
