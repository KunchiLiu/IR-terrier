	<brief_summary>The proposed study will examine changes in older insomniacs' cognitive functioning following behavioral treatment for insomnia using a combination of two methods. A traditional repeated measures design will be used to look at group level differences based on performance on a neuropsychological battery administered prior to, immediately after, and 3 months after completing a 4 week behavioral treatment program for insomnia. This data will be analyzed using standard repeated measures analytic techniques. A time-series design will also be used to look at within-subject differences based on a brief cognitive battery that will be self-administered on a daily basis. Data from this daily battery will be examined using intraindividual variability modeling.</brief_summary>
