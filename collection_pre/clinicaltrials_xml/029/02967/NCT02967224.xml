	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate noninferiority of Toujeo versus "standard of care" basal insulin therapy measured as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate superiority of Toujeo versus "standard of care" basal insulin if noninferiority is met, measured as HbA1c change. - To compare Toujeo to other "standard of care" basal insulin in terms of patient persistence with assigned basal insulin therapy with or without intensification. - Risk of hypoglycemia including the incidence of documented symptomatic or severe hypoglycemic events [as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA] Workgroup on Hypoglycemia). - Change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). - Change in body weight. - Differences in patient reported outcomes measured by Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status and Change Versions (DTSQs and DTSQc). - Change in hypoglycemic control subscale (HCS) - Healthcare resource utilization including hospitalizations and emergency department or other health care provider visits and healthcare costs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled (HbA1c &gt;7%) with current (≥6 months) standard of care with oral agents (metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinediones, DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, glinides, α glucosidase inhibitors) and with or without GLP1 receptor agonist, and eligible to basal insulin treatment, per investigator's judgment. Exclusion criteria: HbA1c ≤7%, no upper bound. Age &lt;18 years. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory tests, or vital signs at the time of screening, or any major systemic disease resulting in short life expectancy that in the opinion of the Investigator would restrict or limit the patient's successful participation for the duration of the study. Use of any product containing insulin since the time of diagnosis with T2DM other than temporary use during a pregnancy or hospitalization. Use of any product containing insulin occurring within 3 months prior to the time of screening. Use of oral hypoglycemic agents other than those noted in the inclusion criteria, GLP 1 receptor agonists not approved for use with insulin, or any investigational agent (drug, biologic, device) within 3 months prior to the time of screening. All contraindications to commercially available insulin therapy or warnings/precautions of use as displayed in the respective National Product labeling for these products. Hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or Toujeo excipients. Patient is the Investigator or any Subinvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol. Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
