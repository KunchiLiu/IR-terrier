	<brief_summary>A Phase 2, Dose-ranging, 12-week Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Parallel-group Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Three Formulations of Ultra-low Dose Estriol Vaginal Gel (0.005% Estriol Vaginal Gel, 0.002% Estriol Vaginal Gel, 0.0008% Estriol Vaginal Gel) for the Treatment of Vaginal Dryness in Postmenopausal Women with Vulvovaginal Atrophy. Vulvovaginal atrophy is a natural consequence of the progressive estrogen deficiency that occurs in menopause. Epidemiological data have indicated that about 50% of otherwise healthy women over 60 years of age experience symptoms related to urogenital atrophy such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, burning, itching, as well as urinary complaints or infections of the lower urinary tract. As these alterations frequently affect the quality of life of postmenopausal women, it is important for doctors to detect their presence and offer treatment options. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. One advantage of local treatment with estrogen is avoidance of first-pass liver metabolism, making it possible to use lower doses of estrogen compared with oral therapy; the local route also minimize systemic adverse effects. The search for therapeutic alternatives which may present improvements in relation to the current products has been encouraged.</brief_summary>
