	<brief_summary>In this 3-year successive research plan, investigators will conduct a prehospital randomized controlled trial to address the following question: In adult patients with non-traumatic cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitated by emergency medical technician (paramedic level) in the prehospital setting, will receiving endotracheal tube intubation cause a better chance of sustained recovery of spontaneous circulation and other survival outcomes like neurologically favorable status, comparing to those who receiving supraglottic airway device.</brief_summary>
