	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to evaluate the levels of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and the presence of red complex microorganisms (RCM) such as Treponema denticola (T.d), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) and Tannerella forsythia (T.f) in the subgingival tissues of chronic periodontitis subjects before and after intervention with pranayama as an adjunct to scaling and root planing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty chronic periodontitis subjects were selected out of which 30 subjects (control group) were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) and 30 subjects (pranayama group) also underwent SRP and pranayama for 3 months. Clinical parameters were recorded and the presence of PPAR-γ, NF-kB and RCM were assessed at baseline and after 3 months</detailed_description>
