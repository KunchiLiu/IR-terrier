	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a peri-articular multimodal injection for post-operative pain control following operative management of closed, rotational ankle fractures. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to either receive or not receive intra-operative injections in addition to standard opioid analgesic regimens. Patients will be treated with standard of care surgical techniques by the treating orthopaedic surgeon for the patient's specific fracture pattern. The patients randomized into the injection cohort will receive a 25cc intra-operative injection with 200 mg ropivacaine, 0.6 mg epinephrine, 5 mg and morphine into the local superficial and deep peri-incisional tissues while under general anesthesia. Total post-operative opioid consumption expressed in morphine equivalent dose will be recorded, including IV and oral opioids. Time in hours from operation conclusion to discharge and discharge disposition (to where the patient is discharged) will also be recorded. Post-operative pain scores will be assessed and recorded in the immediate post-operative period and every 4 hours subsequently until the patient is discharged. Medication related side effects will be monitored. The investigators hypothesize that the injection cohort will have reduced pain scores, lower narcotic requirements, shorter length of stay, and be more likely to discharge to home following surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Multimodal Periarticular Injections in Operatively Treated Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periarticular fractures (bone breaks extending into the joint surface) treated by orthopaedic surgeons are associated with significant pain in the post-operative period, often requiring high doses of opioid analgesics. In recent years, the high risk of misuse, abuse, and death associated with prescription opioid use has become increasingly evident. Although physicians are being advised to avoid administration of opioid prescriptions, alternative pain management options are limited. Currently, there is a need to investigate different pain management models in order to provide safe and effective pain relief during the post-operative period. The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of peri-incisional multimodal injections as an alternative post-operative pain control method in orthopaedic trauma patients with operative ankle fractures. Approximately 200 patients will be randomized to either receive or not receive intra-operative injections in addition to standard opioid analgesic regimens. Post-operative pain management outcomes will be assessed and compared between the 2 study groups to determine effectiveness of the injections. The proposed study will build upon related work to advance post-operative pain control regimens in orthopaedic surgery. Goals include the reduction of unnecessary patient suffering, reliance on opioids, and length of stay, while improving patient experience. These aims will be accomplished through the expansion of currently used multimodal periarticular injections from populations undergoing elective surgery to orthopaedic trauma patients with rotational ankle fractures. The study design is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients included in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: intra-operative multimodal periarticular injection or control (no injection). The peri-incisional injection will consist of ropivacaine, epinephrine, and morphine. All pharmacologic agents in the anesthetic cocktail are FDA approved and have been previously used in combination during other types of orthopaedic surgeries. All patients included in the study will receive standard post-operative opioid analgesic regimens, administered 'per needed', regardless of their assigned treatment group per study protocol. â‰¥ 40 patients will be randomly assigned to each group. The patients enrolled in the investigation as well as health care professionals performing post-operative assessments and collecting data will be blinded to treatment allocation. The feasibility of multimodal peri-incisional injections is supported by their current efficacy in populations undergoing elective orthopedic surgeries. These injections may be equally effective at reducing pain compared to regional anesthesia with continuous infusions, and single-shot nerve blocks. The investigators hypothesize that the injection cohort will have reduced pain scores, lower narcotic requirements, shorter length of stay, and be more likely to discharge to home following surgery.</detailed_description>
