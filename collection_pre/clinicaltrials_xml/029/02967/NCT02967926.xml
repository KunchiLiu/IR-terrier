	<brief_title>Digital SpyGlass Confirmed Common Bile Duct Stones Clearance Without Fluoroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients This study recruited patients who suspected/confirmed CBDS from clinical manifestation, liver function tests and imaging studies. With CBD sized between 5 and 15 millimeters, which measured from transabdominal ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The exclusion criteria were history of bile duct surgery, bile duct stricture, bile duct tumors, severe comorbid diseases, unstable vital signs, pregnancy, and coagulopathy. All patients were informed and wrote informed consent for the procedure. Procedures Non-fluoroscopic CBDS removal was performed by experienced endoscopists, using standard side-viewing duodenoscope. After identified major papilla, the investigators performed bile duct cannulation with guidewire assisted technique. Successful cannulation confirmed by visualized bile aspiration. If the patients had difficult cannulation, double guidewire technique was used. After the successful bile duct cannulation, the investigators performed endoscopic standard sphincterotomy (EST). Precut sphincterotomy was not used in this study. Non fluoroscopic balloon extraction was performed. The balloon was pushed up to hilum then the investigators sweep until suspected complete CBD clearance. After that the investigators used digital SpyGlassTM to confirm the complete clearance of CBDS. If SpyGlassTM showed residual CBD stone, the investigators repeat balloon extraction. If SpyGlassTM showed complete clearance, the investigator proceed to perform final cholangiogram as reference standard for this study.</detailed_description>
