	<brief_title>Blood Draw Validation for Ciprofloxacin Pharmacokinetic Research in Pediatric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concentration of cipro will be determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Unbound concentration will be determined by adjusting the pH of the plasma samples to physiological pH (7.4) in a CO2 incubator, followed by ultrafiltration and extraction of ciprofloxacin from the ultrafiltrate (as described above) prior to injection onto the HPLC system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children who are between 1 month and 18 years of age are under treatment for any type of childhood cancer use ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia as part of regular treatment have a PAC for intravenous medication and blood draws. Children will be excluded from this study if we are unable to obtain informed consent of both parents and assent of the child (if he/she is over 12 years of age) aspire blood from the PAC.</criteria>
