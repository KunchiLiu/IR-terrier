	<brief_summary>During last years, numerous sleep trackers have been commercialized. They are intended to give indications about sleep quality/duration in order to give people an internet-based feedback about their own sleep. For clinical and research purposes, tri-axial accelerometers/multi-sensors devices are used routinely to assess objective sleep quality/patterns. Their use is also validated to estimate sleep in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA). The purpose of the present study is to compare the accuracy of consumer-level sleep trackers and validated tools to measure sleep in OSA patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During last years, numerous sleep trackers have been commercialized. They are working on accelerometer-based technology. They are intended to give indications about sleep quality/duration in order to give people an internet-based feedback about their own sleep..

Their use is also validated to estimate sleep in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA).
