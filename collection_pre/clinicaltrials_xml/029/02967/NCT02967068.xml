	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect existing tissue specimens from subjects enrolled in Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC) studies. Analysis of these tissue specimens and linked clinical data collected through VCRC studies may lead to the identification and development of a series of translational research projects. Results of these studies will provide vasculitis researchers with insight into the causes of these diseases and generate new ideas for diagnostic tests and therapies, and will be of great interest to the larger communities of researchers investigating vasculitis and other autoimmune, inflammatory, and vascular diseases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Biopsy specimens collected as standard of care for these diseases will be retrieved and used in research. The most common biopsies performed are kidney, lung, skin, nerves, and vessels; however, other tissue is also of interest for the study. Biopsies are not performed as part of this protocol, rather we will request consent to collect biopsy specimens already collected under routine care.</detailed_description>
