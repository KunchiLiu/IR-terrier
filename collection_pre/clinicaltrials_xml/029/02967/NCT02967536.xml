	<brief_summary>Our multi-disciplinary research group works closely with people who have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). This is a life-long illness that causes breathing to stop during sleep, which leads to low-oxygen in the blood. Breathing restarts when the airway at the back of the throat reopens, usually during arousal from sleep. In some people the repeated arousals from sleep cause daytime sleepiness. Our research has shown that the low blood oxygen levels affect thinking and feeling, and in some cases we think it damages the brain cells involved with memory, attention, emotions and decision-making. This study will investigate the relationship between the amount of oxygen in the blood and the loss (if any) of brain cells. Also how the ability to perform complex tasks is affected in patients that suffer from sleep apnoea. The results will show whether the brain damage in patients with sleep apnoea can be reversed with treatment. These findings will guide doctors in the treatment for sleep apnoea and they will cast light onto the process of memory decline with the aim to preserve brain function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating the Effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on the Neuropathology of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational physiological study, which is anticipated to last for 4 years. It has been calculated that a minimum of 14 patients with untreated OSA will be studied. In order to study the mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in OSA, participants will start Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment following the confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnoea. CPAP is the treatment of choice for patients with moderate to severe OSA who are sleepy during the day. It is also used in patients with mild OSA if they are excessively sleepy or suffer from cardiovascular risk factors. It is recommended by the the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a treatment for adults with moderate or severe OSA (Sleep apnoea - continuous positive airway pressure, NICE 2008). In the proposed study the initiation of CPAP will be within the 18 week period set out in the National Health Service (NHS) Improvement Plan and Standards for Better Health (Standards for Better Health, Department of Health 2004). No patient with a diagnosis of OSA will commence treatment with CPAP later than advised by the NICE guidelines of clinical judgement for the best interest of the patient. In order to investigate the neuroinflammation process and discrete changes in the brain of patients with OSA, 7 patients with mild and 7 patients with moderate to severe OSA will undergo 3 months of CPAP treatment following initial sleep (assessment) study. They will undergo a dynamic Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance (PET-MR) scan with the translocator protein (TSPO) tracer 11C-(R)-PK11195 at the time of enrolment to the study and after 3 months of treatment. Each participant will also have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan before and after 3 months of treatment with a CPAP mask.</detailed_description>
