	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: The primary objective is to describe the effect of insulin glargine (U300) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients uncontrolled with their current basal insulin therapy and eligible for basal switching, according to the Physician decision, on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) improvement. Secondary Objectives: - Evolution of fasting plasma glucose - Evolution of insulin dose and body weight - Hypoglycemia incidence - Safety - Patients satisfaction when they change their insulin for HOE901-U300</brief_summary>
