	<brief_summary>Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy is the "standard" phototherapy for atopic eczema; ultraviolet A1 is sometimes used but is not a widely available treatment. We do not know the most important chromophores in treating atopic eczema; in which phototherapy is thought to work by improving epidermal barrier function, having beneficial effects on skin microbiome and local immunosuppression. It seems plausible that there are several chromophores and that 'targetting' several at once with different wavebands should help and for severe eczema that has not responded adequately to narrowband UVB or ultraviolet A1 alone the combination is sometimes used. This study is to test if the combination is moderately to greatly more effective than narrowband ultraviolet B monotherapy amongst patients referred for any form of first-line phototherapy for atopic eczema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Narrowband Ultraviolet B Versus Narrowband Ultraviolet B Plus Ultraviolet A1 for Atopic Eczema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy is the "standard" phototherapy widely used for atopic eczema; ultraviolet A1 is sometimes used but is not a widely available treatment. We do not know the most important chromophores in treating atopic eczema; in which phototherapy is thought to work by improving epidermal barrier function, having beneficial effects on skin microbiome and local immunosuppression. It seems plausible that there are several chromophores (the molecules that absorb the ultraviolet photons to set in chain the effects we are aiming for) and that 'targetting' several chromophores at once with different wavebands should help. For severe eczema that has not responded adequately to narrowband UVB or ultraviolet A1 alone the combination is sometimes used in the few centres where UVA1 is available. This study is to test if the combination is moderately to greatly more effective than narrowband ultraviolet B monotherapy amongst patients referred for any form of first-line phototherapy for atopic eczema.</detailed_description>
