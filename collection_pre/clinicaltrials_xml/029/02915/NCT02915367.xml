	<brief_title>Monitoring Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for Young Adult Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol describes a longitudinal study of young Kenyan women at high risk for HIV who will be offered HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for up to two years. Adherence will be monitored in all women with the next generation Wisepill; half will be randomized to receive short message service (SMS) reminders. The technical function, acceptability, cost, and validity of the next generation Wisepill device coupled to SMS reminders will be determined among this cohort of young Kenyan women. Additionally, SMS will be used for longitudinal assessment of risk perception and its alignment with PrEP adherence.</detailed_description>
