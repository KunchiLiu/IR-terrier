	<brief_summary>Stenting is an alternative to traditional surgery in the treatment of carotid stenosis.The intra and/or postprocedural cerebral embolization remains the most frequent complication. The type of carotid stent and of cerebral protection are the two most important variables potentially affecting the rate of cerebral microembolization. So far there no consensus on the the best stent and cerebral protection.</brief_summary>
