	<brief_summary>Study comparing different groups of people and how they respond to application of the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments. Investigators will divide all recruited participants into three groups based on health status (group 1: hemodialysis patients; group 2: patients with severe chronic kidney disease but not on dialysis; group 3: healthy participants with no clinically known kidney disease). Each group, which will comprise of 10 people, will receive the same treatment using the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Responses in Hemodialysis Patients to Blood Flow Restriction Using Non-pneumatic Anti-shock Garments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim: To determine how blood flow restriction to the lower extremities using non-pneumatic anti-shock garments affects hemodynamic and cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure in Hemodialysis (HD) patients while they are not on dialysis. Investigators propose a pilot study to assess the effects of blood flow restriction using non-pneumatic anti-shock garments in HD patients while they are not on dialysis. Outcomes: The primary objective will be a measurement of blood pressure upon application of the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments. Secondary outcomes will include the following: baroreflex sensitivity; trends in beat-to-beat blood pressure upon application of the anti-shock garments; patient tolerability of the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments, ejection fraction via echocardiogram analyses.</detailed_description>
