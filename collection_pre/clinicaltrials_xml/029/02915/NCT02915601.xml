	<brief_summary>Low serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal laboratory range, are strongly associated with increased risks of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and death. The current proposal will investigate whether bicarbonate administration in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will improve the health and function of arteries and reduce the size of the left ventricle of the heart. Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence upon which physicians can base recommendations to patients with CKD to decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.</brief_summary>
