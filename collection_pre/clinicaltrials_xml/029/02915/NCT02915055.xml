	<brief_summary>This will be a single-center, prospective observational study. The study will compare post-operative pain scores and narcotic consumption between two groups of patients - one cohort will receive ibuprofen (Motrin) and Percocet (to be used as needed) while the other cohort will receive only Percocet. Both pain management options are considered to be standard of care. The primary objective of the study is to compare patients' reported pain and narcotic use following meniscectomy, and determine if NSAIDs can provide adequate pain relief.</brief_summary>
