	<brief_title>The Study to Evaluate JS001 in Patients With Advanced GC, ESCC, NPC, HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Design: This study is a phase Ib/II clinical study of a Recombinant Humanized Anti-Programmed Death Antibody 1 (PD-1) Monoclonal Antibody for infusion. It is a multicenter, open-label clinical study to investigate the preliminary efficacy and safety of JS001 at 4 indications including gastric adenocarcinoma (GC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which have unique unmet clinical need in China. Subjects will be eligible for this study after they fulfill the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Subjects diagnosed as the gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma will receive treatment at the dose of 3 mg/kg. If one certain indication cannot reach the predefined study endpoints under the dose of 3 mg/kg, enrollment of patients will be expanded to 10mg/kg group. Meanwhile, subject to the safety and pharmacokinetic data from other dose groups observed in other ongoing or coming phase I studies, this study may explore to other dose groups and determine the RP2D of relevant indication. To add new dose group(s), approval from Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and Ethics Committee for local study site should be obtained before initiation of subject enrollment. Study Treatment: This study is planned to conduct the 3 mg/kg dose group study at first. After enrollment, the subjects will be administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) with 4 weeks as a cycle, until absence of further benefits, acceptable toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal or death. If patient experiences 1st onset of disease progression and investigator judges that patient will obtain clinical benefit from the study treatment, patient can continue the study treatment after the discussion between investigator and medical monitor from sponsor or authorized CRO and approval is obtained afterwards. If the subject develops 2nd disease progression after 1st disease progression, he/she should permanently withdraw from the study treatment. Tumor Assessment: During the study, tumor response assessment will be conducted every 8 weeks in the first year according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumor response assessments will also be evaluated according to irRC at them same frequency with RECIST 1.1. Pharmacokinetics: At least 10 of patients (no limit for indication) in 3 mg/kg dose group at the assigned study sites, should complete serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling at the first 3 cycles. If a subject cannot complete the scheduled sample collection due to any cause, another subject should be substituted. The schedule of pharmacokinetic blood sampling is referred to Appendix 2. If other dose groups are opened during the study, at least 10 subjects from each dose group should participate in serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling. Acquisition of Tumor Tissue Specimen: Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinoma at esophageal-gastric conjunction) or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma must provide tumor tissue specimens prior to enrollment to detect the expression of PD-L1. Only the patients with positive PD-L1 expression are eligible to the study. Subjects with nasopharyngeal carcinoma must provide tumor tissue specimens prior to enrollment for future use in subsequent exploratory researches. If the response is verified as partial response (PR) and/or progression of disease (PD) for subjects in nasopharyngeal carcinoma group or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma group and tumor tissues could be obtained, these subjects can voluntarily participate in a subgroup study of this study. They will provide tumor tissues for exploratory research in correlation between tumor marker and anti-tumor response level. All the tumor tissue specimens provided will be sent to designated central laboratory for further evaluation End of Study: The primary endpoint of the study is ORR. The study will be complete after 12 months of last subject first dosing and data analysis will be conducted at the same time. If by then there are still some subjects receiving treatment of study drug, these subjects will be transferred to an expansion study to continue treatment of study drug until occurrence of no more clinical benefits, unacceptable toxicity, investigator deciding to end the treatment, withdrawal of inform consent or death.</detailed_description>

Patients who have recurrence or metastasis within 6 months after completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible to this study; Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma must have received at least one line of treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (including but not limited to anticancer drug treatment or concomitant radiochemotherapy) and have tumor progression documented or be intolerable to the current chemotherapy regimen. Patients who have recurrence or metastasis within 6 months after completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy (including but not limited to chemotherapy or concomitant radiochemotherapy) accompanied by the radical operation are eligible to this study; Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have received at least one line of treatment for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (including but not limited to anticancer drug treatment or concomitant radiochemotherapy) and have tumor progression documented or be intolerable to other current chemotherapy regimens. Patients with recurrence or metastasis within 6 months after completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant concomitant radiochemotherapy are eligible to this study. 3. Have at least one measurable lesion (according to RECIST 1.1); Note: Lesion with radiotherapy treated previously can't be regarded as a target lesion, unless which has definite progressed after radiotherapy. 4.
