	<brief_summary>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) causes significant morbidity and mortality and is the third most common cause of heart failure and the most frequent reason for heart transplantation. The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy(DCM) is complex. There is a growing body of literature suggesting that the humoral immune system activation and autoantibodies against myocardial generation play an important role in the progression of DCM. At present immunoadsorption technology has been successfully applied in autoimmune antibody removal treatment of a variety of diseases. And some applications of immunoadsorption(IA) in patients with DCM showed that immunoadsorption(IA) can indeed reduce the autoantibodies, improve symptoms and prognosis, but additional research is needed to identify indications and instruments for the IA treatment of DCM.</brief_summary>
