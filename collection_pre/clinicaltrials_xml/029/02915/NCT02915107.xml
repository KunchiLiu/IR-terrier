	<brief_summary>The aim of the Danish Organization for Randomized Trials with Clinical Outcome (SORT OUT) IX STEMI OCT is to compare early vascular healing of the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent with a biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The SORT OUT IX STEMI OCT Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SORT OUT IX STEMI OCT is a randomized 1:1 study comparing the polymer-free Biolimus-eluting BIOFREEDOM stent with a biodegradable-polymer Sirolimus-eluting ORSIRO stent patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI. Vascular healing index (uncovered stent struts, malapposed stent struts, maximal intima coverage and accumulated extra-stent lumen volume) assessed with optical coherence tomography (OCT) 1 month after primary PCI. Patients will be enrolled by the investigators and randomly allocated to treatment groups after diagnostic coronary angiography and before primary PCI. A web based Trial Partner randomization system will be used. OCT will be performed with the frequency-domain OPTIS OCT system and Dragonflyâ„¢ Imaging Catheter during the index procedure and after 1 months.</detailed_description>
