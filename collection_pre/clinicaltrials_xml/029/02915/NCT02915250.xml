	<brief_summary>This is a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period cross-over study using a standardised solid meal test in subjects with type 2 diabetes to investigate postprandial glucose control of BioChaperone® Combo compared with Humalog® Mix25 and with simultaneous subcutaneous injections of Humalog® and Lantus® during three separate dosing visits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Compare Post Prandial Blood Glucose Control of BioChaperone® Combo With Humalog® Mix25 and With Simultaneous Injections of Humalog® and Lantus® in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period cross-over study using a standardised solid meal test in subjects with type 2 diabetes to investigate postprandial glucose control of BioChaperone® Combo compared with Humalog® Mix25 and with simultaneous subcutaneous injections of Humalog® and Lantus® during three separate dosing visits. Furthermore, this study aims to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the three different study treatments. During each dosing visit, subjects will be given 3 doses of IMP on three consecutive days (Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3). Dosing on Day 2 and Day 3 will be followed by a standardised solid meal test.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subject aged 1870 years (both inclusive) Type 2 diabetes mellitus (as diagnosed clinically) for ≥ 12 months HbA1c level between 7.5% and 9.5% (both inclusive) Body mass index between 20.0 and 40.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) Treated with once daily injections with insulin glargine U100 for ≥ 3 months prior to screening Type 1 diabetes mellitus Known or suspected allergy to the IMPs or related products Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised. Receipt of any medicinal product in clinical development within 60 days prior to this trial. Clinically significant abnormal haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis or coagulation screening tests, as judged by the Investigator considering the underlying disease Supine blood pressure at screening outside the range of 90160 mmHg for systolic or 5095 mmHg for diastolic and/or resting supine heart rate outside the range 5090 beats per minute. This exclusion criterion also pertains to subjects being on antihypertensives. Current treatment with premixed or intermediate insulin products, or with long acting insulins other than insulin glargine U100. The use of short or rapid acting prandial insulin products will be allowed provided their use has been stable for ≥ 3 months prior to screening. Use of GLP1 receptor agonists or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) other than stable intake of metformin alone or metformin in combination with a DPP4 inhibitor within 4 weeks prior to screening Women of child bearing potential not willing to use contraceptive methods.</criteria>
