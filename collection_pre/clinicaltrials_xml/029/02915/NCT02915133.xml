	<brief_summary>Macular foveoschisis (MF) is a common complication of pathological myopia, which is characterized by choroid-retinal degeneration and vision impairment. Although pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is the primary method for MF treatment, there is still a large proportion of recurrent MF due to the extremely long global axial length and posterior staphyloma. Macular buckling (MB) surgery aims at counteracting the traction exerted by the posterior staphyloma, and has been proven an effective method for treating MF. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is widely used for the structural analysis of MF. Multifocol electroretinogram (mfERG) is an objective examination for visual evaluation. To our knowledge, there is a lack of data on the comprehensive visual function evaluations of MF patients associated with OCT findings. Our clinical trial aims to provide the structural and functional relationship in MF patients undergoing MB surgery, and find out potential factors to determine the visual prognosis.</brief_summary>
