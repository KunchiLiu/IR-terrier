	<brief_title>Zip Incision Approximation vs. Suture for C-Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean-section birth is a very invasive surgical procedure. While the desired outcome focuses primarily on the successful delivery of a healthy baby and maintenance of the mother's health, the surgery involves a complex surgical closure process, starting with the uterus, and progressing through several layers of traditionally suture closure in several tissue planes. A successful closure results in no surgical site complications, with good patient comfort and a minimal scar being a desired outcome. Conventional skin closure methods such as sutures are effective but have drawbacks. It has been suggested that the ideal method of wound / incision closure should be: - fast - non-traumatic - minimally or non-invasive - associated with a low incidence of adverse events such as dehiscence and infection - yielding acceptable cosmetic results ZipLine Medical, Inc. is a Campbell, California-based company that has developed a novel, non-invasive skin closure device called Zip Surgical Skin Closure to replace sutures, staples and glue for closure of the skin layer for surgical incisions or laceration repair. In the USA, the device has been classified by the FDA as a Class I, 510(k) Exempt device and began commercial use in the USA in April 2013. The ZipLine Device has been clinically demonstrated benefits include (references included later in this document): - Closure speed faster/superior to (and less variable compared to) sutures - Suture-like cosmetic outcome - Reduction in post-surgical care costs - Fewer closure-related wound issues - Greater patient satisfaction</detailed_description>
