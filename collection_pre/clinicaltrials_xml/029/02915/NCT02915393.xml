	<brief_summary>Spleen Deficiency Syndrome(SDS)is a widely researched issue, but due to the limitations of the research methods, the scientific mechanism of SDS is biased and not comprehensive. SDS would be researched in this project deeply and systematically with modern life-scientific methods. Based on the previous work, the participants, with SDS, suffering from Qi deficiency syndrome--chronic superficial gastritis--chronic atrophic gastritis--gastric cancer would be included, and the corresponding research would be conducted at the molecular-cell-gastric tissue level, and at the same time, systematical biological database of SDS would be built by systematical biological methods, such as pioneered SPARS sequencing technology created in our research group, proteomics and metabonomics. Under the above work, the investigators would conduct data mining and molecular network analysis, and then verify the key functions. By analyzing the systematical biological features of syndrome and its relationships with constitution and disease, this study would provide a new basis for objective reality of syndrome, and also offer a crucial premise of revealing biological basis for syndrome correctly, which is of important theoretical and practical significance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged between 18 and 65 years. No apparent abnormality in the routine blood test, urinalysis, routine stool &amp; fecal occult blood test, biochemical test, chest radiograph and electrocardiogram(ECG). The endoscopic diagnoses of chronic superficial gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer conform to the corresponding pathological diagnoses TCM diagnoses of Spleenqi Deficiency Syndrome or Spleen Dampheat Syndrome. Voluntary participation. Having given written informed consent. Gastropathy with special causes, such as acute gastritis, gastrinoma, chronic gastritis resulting from special causes (like granulomatous gastritis, lymphocytic gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, gastritis after gastric operation) peptic ulcer, other malignant tumors of stomach (like gastric lymphoma, gastri stromal tumor, carcinoid tumor, malignant hemangioma, squamouscell carcinoma, primary gastric choriocarcinoma and metastatic gastric tumor), benign gastritic tumors that originate from epithelium or submucosa (epithelial tumors like adenomatous polyps and hyperplastic polyps, stromal tumors like benign stromal tumor, neuronal tumor and pseudolymphoma). Combined with other digestive diseases (like gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal varices, acute and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis arising from various causes, acute/chronic pancreatitis and acute/chronic cholecystitis). Combined with other severe systemic diseases such as respiratory failure, severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, immune system, urinary and mental disorders diseases. Pregnancy, or planning pregnancy during the trial or within three month period thereafter. Participation in any clinical trial including blood sampling and/or administration of substances up to 90 days before Day 01 of this study.</criteria>
