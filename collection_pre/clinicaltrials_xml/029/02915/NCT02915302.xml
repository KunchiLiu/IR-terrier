	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the 0.5-mL dose (15 μg HA per strain) of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in children 6 through 35 months of age. Primary objective: - To compare the rate of any fever (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [38.0°C]) following the 0.5-mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine to that following the 0.25 mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during the 7 days after either vaccination (Dose 1 and Dose 2 combined) in subjects 6 to &lt; 36 months of age. Secondary objective: - To compare antibody responses induced by the 0.5-mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine to those induced by the 0.25-mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine as assessed by geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios and seroconversion rate differences after the final vaccination in subjects 6 to &lt; 36 months of age. Other objectives: - To describe the safety of 2 different dose levels of the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in subjects 6 to &lt; 36 months of age. - To describe the immunogenicity of 2 different dosages of the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in subjects 6 months to &lt; 36 months of age. - To submit available sera from approximately 30 subjects to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research for further analysis by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the FDA to support formulation recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will receive 1 intramuscular dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during Visit 1. Participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance, will receive a second dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1). Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited AE information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or to Visit 3 for those subjects receiving 2 doses. Serious adverse event information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or Visit 3, as appropriate. Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all subjects prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and at Day 28 after the final vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 6 to &lt; 36 months of age on the day of first study vaccination (study product administration). Born at full term of pregnancy (≥ 37 weeks) and/or with a birth weight ≥ 2.5 kg. Note: This inclusion criterion only applies to subjects 6 to &lt; 12 months of age on the day of the first study visit. Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or guardian(s). Subject and parent/guardian are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 30 days preceding the first trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure. Receipt of any vaccine in the 30 days preceding the first trial vaccination, or planned receipt of any vaccine before Visit 2 for subjects receiving 1 dose of influenza vaccine or Visit 3 for subjects receiving 2 doses of influenza vaccine. Previous vaccination against influenza (in the 20162017 season) with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine. Receipt of immune globulins, blood, or bloodderived products in the past 3 months. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months). Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances. Thrombocytopenia, which may be a contraindication for intramuscular vaccination, at the discretion of the Investigator. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination. Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily. Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion. Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of planned vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [38.0°C]). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided. Identified as a natural or adopted child of either the Investigator or an employee with direct involvement in the proposed study. History of serious adverse reactions to any influenza vaccine. Personal history of GuillainBarré Syndrome. Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a health risk to the subject if enrolled or could interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine. Personal history of clinically significant developmental delay (at the discretion of the Investigator), neurologic disorder, or seizure disorder. Known seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.</criteria>
