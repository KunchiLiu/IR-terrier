	<brief_summary>In France, almost 1 death on 50 is a suicide. The suicide occurs in unbearable psychic pain where mental trouble has a major influence. It is classified as preventable mortality. According to interpersonal psychological theory of suicide, the repeated exposition to stressful and painful events (as physical abuse) would facilitate suicide attempt through the increased pain tolerance. The social pain (or psychical pain on the broader sense) and physical pain are closely linked. The investigators hypothesize that the measure of painful perception will be significantly superior on suicidals attempters compared to non-attempters. It will be the case for recent suicide attempters and former suicide attempters, suggesting a suicidal vulnerability trait. Moreover, the investigators expect that social distress induced by a social exclusion paradigm will be significantly superior on suicide attempters compared to non-attempters. The aim of the study is to investigate the physical and psychic pain on depressed subjects with or without history of suicide attempts. After a clinical evaluation (psychiatric symptomatology, personality trait, suicidal dimension), subjects will be submitted to a painful thermic stimulation and will participate at a computer test of social exclusion (named Cyberball).</brief_summary>
