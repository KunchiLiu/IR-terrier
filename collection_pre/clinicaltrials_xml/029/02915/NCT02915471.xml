	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this research program is to develop and examine the impact of a Cancer virtual peer-to-peer (VP2P) Support Program on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in adolescents with cancer (AWC). In the current proposal, the feasibility of trialing the Skype-based VP2P program providing peer-support from mentors and the magnitude of program effect estimates will be evaluated in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). This pilot RCT will enable us to refine the program and determine the appropriate sample size for a future large-scale RCT, which will compare the effectiveness of VP2P to a waitlist control group at a major Children's Oncology Group- affiliated centers in Canada and the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Peer-to-Peer (VP2P) Support Mentoring for Adolescents With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this project is to develop and examine the impact of a virtual peer support program on health outcomes and quality of life of adolescents with cancer using a waitlist randomized controlled trial. In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the experimental group will receive a manualized peer mentorship program that will provide modelling and reinforcement by trained young adults aged 18-25 years who have learned to function successfully with their pain. Mentoring sessions consist of 10 sessions of 30-45 minute Skype calls over 8 weeks. Feasibility of the program will be measured in addition to quality of life, physical and emotional symptoms, pain coping, self-efficacy, social support, and self-management skills.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Englishspeaking 1217 year olds Cancer diagnosis with an expected 5year survival rate of &gt;70% according to treating oncologist (most childhood cancer diagnoses meet this criterion1) Access to computer capable of using free Skype software (NB: 87% of American households had Internet access in) Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of 60/100 (minimal assistance needed to complete activities) as assessed by the study coordinator at the time of recruitment. The Principal Investigator and CoInvestigators (Dr. Jennifer Stinson, Dr. Nathan and Dr. Gupta) will train the study coordinator to complete Karnofsky or Lansky performance assessments. NB. Note that even though text messaging is part of the intervention, access to smartphones is not required. Smartphones (iPhone 6) may be loaned to participants by Dr. Stinson.
