	<brief_title>ILT-101 in Patients With Active Moderate to Severe Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interleukin 2 (IL-2) plays an important role on immune homeostasis by acting on T lymphocytes. In systemic lupus erythematosus, there is a so called "insufficiency" in a subpopulation of T lymphocytes, the regulatory T cells (Tregs) leading to altered immune balance between regulatory and effector T cells. These cells seem to play a major role in the physiopathology of the disease. Many researches enlighten the fact that this Tregs/Teffs balance can be restored by administering low dose of IL-2. It is thus assumed that treatment with low dose of IL-2 may impact positively the progression of the disease and thus help patients improving their clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
