	<brief_title>Ustekinumab for the Treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab, an interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitor, in patients with GCA Hypothesis IL-12/23 pathway blockade may maintain disease remission in patients with GCA Specific Aims - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ustekinumab administration in 20 patients with GCA - To evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab for remission maintenance and glucocorticoid sparing in 20 patients with GCA</detailed_description>
