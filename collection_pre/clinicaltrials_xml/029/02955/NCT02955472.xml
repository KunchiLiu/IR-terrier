A subject with any history of gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, acute or chronic pancreatitis, and others) and surgery (except for simple appendectomy or repair of a hernia), which can influence the absorption of investigational products. A subject who has the following clinical laboratory test results Liver Function Test (AST, ALT) &gt; three times the upper limit of the normal range History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 210g/week(12g = 125 mL of wine, 10g = 250 mL of beer, 10g = 50 mL of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening. A subject who has participated in any other clinical trials and had medication within 3 months prior to the first administration of investigational product. (The end date of another clinical trial is based on the last day of the administration) A subject who has the following vital signs results in sitting position at the time of the screening: SBP ≤ 90 mmHg or DBP ≤ 60 mmHg.

A smoker who consumes more than 20 cigarettes/days A subject who has taken any ethicalthecounter drug or has taken any overthecounter drug within 10days before the investigational product administration A subject who has donated whole blood within 2 months or blood components within 1 month prior to the investigational product administration Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation. A subject who is unable to take regular diet during the study period. Abnormal diet that may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs History of sensitivity to pregabalin, gabapentin, or other alpha2 delta ligands. Evidence of hereditary disease, including galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucosegalactose malabsorption. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this protocol. A subject who is not eligible for the study due to reasons on the investigators' judgment.</criteria>
