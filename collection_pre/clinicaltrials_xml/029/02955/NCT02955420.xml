	<brief_summary>Berlin Cures develops BC 007 to treat patients suffering from diseases (chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, chronic fatigue syndrome etc.) which are associated with functional autoantibodies (AAB) directed against G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). The first part of the study (part A) is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of BC 007. The study part is blinded and placebo controlled in order to better discriminate possible safety signals. The assessment of safety and tolerability in an elderly cohort is a bridge to dosing elderly GPCR AAB positive subjects in part B. The subjects in part A are confirmed to be GPCR AAB negative. The objective of the second part of the study (part B) is to evaluate the efficacy of BC 007 in neutralizing AAB against GPCR shortly after dosing compared to baseline and to find the optimal dose for the neutralization of the AAB in all individuals. This dose shall be taken to progress into a Phase II/III trial with beta1-adrenergic receptor-AAB positive patients suffering from chronic heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of BC 007 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A Primary objective is: - To assess safety and tolerability of BC 007 after a single ascending intravenous (i.v.) bolus + infusion in healthy, young and elderly subjects. Secondary objectives are: - To determine the pharmacokinetic plasma and urine profiles of BC 007 in healthy, young and elderly subjects. Part B Primary objective is: - To assess the neutralizing potency of BC 007 against GPCR autoantibodies alpha -1 adrenergic receptor, beta-1 adrenergic receptor, beta-2 adrenergic receptor or endothelin-A-receptor following ascending i.v. bolus + infusion. Secondary objectives are: - To assess safety and tolerability of BC 007 after a single ascending i.v. bolus + infusion in GPCR AAB (α(1)-adrenergic receptor AAB, ß(1)-adrenergic receptor AAB, ß(2)-adrenergic receptor AAB or endothelin-A-receptor AAB) positive healthy elderly subjects. - To determine the pharmacokinetic plasma and urine profiles of BC 007 in GPCR AAB (α(1)-adrenergic receptor AAB, ß(1)-adrenergic receptor AAB, ß(2)-adrenergic receptor AAB or endothelin-A-receptor AAB) positive healthy elderly subjects.</detailed_description>
