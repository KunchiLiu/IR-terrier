	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed, welldifferentiated advanced, nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumor of GI, pancreatic or thoracic origin. No history of, and no active symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome. Patients must have been pretreated for advanced disease the number of prior systemic therapy/regimen depends on which origin. Patients must be willing to provide biopsy material. Radiological documentation of disease progression while on/or after the last treatment; progression must have been observed within 6 months prior to start of study treatment Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, highgrade neuroendocrine carcinoma, adenocarcinoid, goblet cell carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. Pretreatment with interferon as last treatment prior to start of study treatment. Prior treatment for study indication with: Antibodies or immunotherapy within 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. PRRT administered within 6 months of the first dose. Systemic antineoplastic therapy Tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 14 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before the first dose of study treatment. Prior PD1 or PDL1directed therapy. Cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, or transarterial chemoembolization of hepatic metastases History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies which in the opinion of the investigator may pose an increased risk of a serious infusion reaction.</criteria>
