	<detailed_description>A pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted, by assessors blind to group allocation.Participants will be referred to the study from 'Maccabi Healthcare Services' by family physicians and geriatric physician of 'Maccabi Healthcare Services Central District'. The majority of TECH protocol training will take place in the participants' home as self-practice. The assessment and weekly group meetings will take place at clinics of Maccabi Healthcare Services in the Central District. A Helsinki approval (#2016009) has already been obtained. Participants will receive information regarding the study and if eligible will sign a consent form, undergo the screening and then the pre-intervention assessments. Then they will be randomly allocated into experimental or control group by a computer program. The experimental group participants will receive the TECH protocol, while participants in the control group will not receive any treatment. Following the intervention a second assessment will be performed, as well as follow-up assessment six months later.</detailed_description>
