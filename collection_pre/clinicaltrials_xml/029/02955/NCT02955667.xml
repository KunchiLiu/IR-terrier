	<brief_summary>This study intends to carry out a prospective, randomized controlled trial to research and development a new invivo microscopy based on the technology which is combined with high-definition microscopy and colposcopyï¼Œso as to diagnose cervical lesion directly and non-invasively by observing cervical tissues and cells, which makes it possible to diagnose cervical cancer without wounds.</brief_summary>
