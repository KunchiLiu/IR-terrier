	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Oral HBI-8000 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Adult T Cell Lymphoma (ATL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2b, open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of HBI-8000 40 mg BIW in patients with relapsed or refractory ATL (R/R ATL). HBI 8000 will be administered orally approximately 30 minutes after any regular meal twice a week. There will be 3 to 4 days between dosing. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 consecutive days. HBI-8000 administration will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities are observed despite appropriate dose reduction or treatment interruption.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histopathological, or cytological diagnosis of ATL confirmed as seropositive for antiHuman Tlymphotrophic Virus typeI (HTLVI) antibody 2. Acute, lymphoma and unfavorable chronic types. The unfavorable chronic type is defined by the presence of at least one of the following: serum albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 300 U/L or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &gt;25 mg/dL 3. Progressive disease after receiving ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy with antitumor agent(s). This should include frontline chemotherapy, and mogamulizumab, or ineligible for mogamulizumab and there is no other available treatment with proven efficacy 4. Male or female, aged 20 years or older 5. ECOG Performance Status of 02 6. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months 7. Meeting the following laboratory criteria: Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt;1500/µL independent of growth factor support within 7 days of starting the study drug Platelets &gt;75,000/µL independent of transfusion within 14 days of starting the study drug Hgb &gt;8 g/dL independent of transfusion within 14 days of starting the study drug Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN Serum aspartate aminotransferase/glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase/glutamyl pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) less than or equal to 3 X ULN Serum Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN 8. Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing (reproductive) potential. Female patients of child bearing potential must use an effective method of birth control (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide or condom with spermicide) during treatment period and 1 month thereafter; Males must use an effective method of birth control (2 barrier methods) during treatment period and 3 months thereafter. Note: Female patients will be considered to be women of childbearing potential unless having undergone permanent contraception or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as at least 12 months without menses with no other medical reasons (e.g., chemical menopause because of treatment with antimalignant tumor agents). 9. Signed informed consent 2.5.2 1. Male patients with QTcF &gt; 450 msec at screening, female patients with QTcF &gt; 470 msec at screening, or patients with congenital long QT syndrome, clinically significant arrhythmia, history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV) or acute myocardial infarction within 6 months of starting the study drug at screening. 2. Patients with known hypersensitivity to benzamide class of compounds or any of the components of HBI8000 tablets; 3. Patients with a second malignancy other than disease under study. The exceptions are disease that has been treated with curative intent with no evidence of recurrence in past 5 years including: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Cervical carcinoma in situ Carcinoma in situ of the breast An incidental histological finding of prostate carcinoma (TNM stage T1a or T1b) Earlystage gastric cancer treated with endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection 4. Autologous stem cell transplantation within 12 weeks (84 days) of starting the study drug 5. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation requiring immunosuppressant treatment within 21 days of starting the study drug or with active Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) 6. Organ transplantation recipients except hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 7. Uncontrolled intercurrent infection 8. Hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or hepatitis C virus antibody positive. In case hepatitis B core antibody and/or hepatitis B surface antibody is positive even if hepatitis B surface antigen negative, a hepatitis B virus DNA test (realtime PCR measurement) should be performed and if positive, the patient should be excluded from study 9. Any history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 10. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, endocrine disorder, bleeding disorder 11. Major surgery or radiation therapy within 28 days of starting the study drug 12. Receiving investigational agents or anticancer therapy within 28 days, nitrosourea or mitomycin C within 42 days, of starting the study drug 13. Receiving antibody therapy for ATL within 12 weeks of starting the study drug 14. Women who are breastfeeding or women who are not willing to stop breastfeeding during study treatment period and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug 15. Potential for noncompliance or at increased risk based on investigator's judgement</criteria>
