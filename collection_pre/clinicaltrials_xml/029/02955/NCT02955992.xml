	<brief_summary>As ICU mortality is high, end-of-life is a subject of major concern for intensivists. With a mortality rate of 20%, end-of-life care has become a daily responsibility. Among those deaths, 60 to 80% follow a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment, situations where physicians, nurses and relatives must work together towards the most consensual decision. In this context, patients' relatives feel vulnerable and, in the months that follow the death, they are most likely to present symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life (anxiety, depression, PTSD, prolonged grief). Many studies have shown that communication with caregivers is one of the most highly valued aspects of care that impacts on family members' experience during the patient's stay and after the patient's death. Improving communication during the end-of-life process in the ICU context is a necessity that has been put forward in palliative care and family-centered care guidelines. This study aims to improve both communication skills and behaviour by giving precise recommendations to physicians (3 step strategy) in their direct contact with patients' relatives. We designed a 3-step physician-driven support strategy that consists in 3 meetings with the relative - one before, one during and one after the patient's death. We hypothesize that this strategy will improve communication in the end-of-life setting and thus should reduce post-ICU burden for family members, specifically the development of prolonged grief 6 months after the death.</brief_summary>
