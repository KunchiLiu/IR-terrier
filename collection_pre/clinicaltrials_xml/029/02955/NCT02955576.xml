	<brief_title>Microneedle Patch for Psoriatic Plaques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a novel minimally invasive approach, microneedle-mediated transdermal drug delivery has received increased attention. Microneedle patch effectively penetrates the skin barrier of the stratum corneum and create efficient pathways for the delivery of drugs. A randomized controlled trial based on split-body was planned to evaluate the efficacy of enhanced transdermal delivery of topical agent by hyaluronic acid (HA)-fabricated microneedle patch in psoriatic plaques. Six psoriatic plaques in a patient will be randomized to either microneedle HA patch, patch, or control groups. Patch group is planned for rule out the occlusion effect of patches. All lesions will be treated with topical agent and patches daily for 2-week period. The severity of psoriasis will be grated with modified PASI score and the clinical improvement will be assessed as % from baseline every week. Overall 20 patients with 120 psoriatic plaques will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
