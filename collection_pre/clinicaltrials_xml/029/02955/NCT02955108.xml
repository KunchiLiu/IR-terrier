	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to look at the effects of distractive auditory stimuli (DAS) on reducing dyspnea intensity and related anxiety and increasing exercise tolerance. Investigators hope that compared to a no-music control condition, that under a music condition participants with COPD will (a) demonstrate increased self-paced walk distance and enjoyment; (b) have less dyspnea intensity, (c) experience less dyspnea anxiety; (d) have less fatigue and state anxiety; and (e) higher maximum heart rate. The upbeat music with a tempo of 90 - 100 bpm (an average-to-moderate walking tempo) is expected to have distractive and performance enhancing effects in order to increase tolerance to dyspnea and exercise. The long-term goal of this study is to increase physical activity in adults with COPD and RLD by promoting dyspnea and fatigue management through use of distractive auditory stimuli in the form of music.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomized clinical trial will use a cross-over design. The research will include two within-subject factors, music versus no music and time. Each subject will be randomized a single time to receive either music first then no music, or alternatively, no music first then music during two walk tests.</detailed_description>
