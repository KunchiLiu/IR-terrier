	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of ABT-494 versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of participants with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 is a blinded 52 week extension period to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 in participants with RA who have completed Period 1.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) for &gt;= 3 months who also fulfill the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/ European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA. Participants have been receiving csDMARD therapy &gt;= 3 months and on a stable dose for &gt;= 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. 1. Participants must have failed (lack of efficacy) at least one of the following: methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. 2. The following csDMARDs are allowed: oral or parenteral MTX, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and leflunomide. 3. A combination of up to two background csDMARDs is allowed except the combination of MTX and leflunomide. Participant meets both of the following disease activity criteria: 1. &gt;= 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and â‰¥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits; and Prior exposure to any Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (including but not limited to tofacitinib, baricitinib, and filgotinib). Participants with prior exposure to Biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) therapy. History of any arthritis with onset prior to age 17 years or current diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease other than RA (including but not limited to gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis, reactive arthritis, overlap connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, fibromyalgia [currently with active symptoms]. Current diagnosis of secondary Sjogren's Syndrome is permitted.</criteria>
