	<brief_summary>This is a single site feasibility trial to test whether daily administration of Teriparatide, in participants with Weber type B ankle fractures that are being conservatively managed, is superior to the standard care treatment with regard to the rate of healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ankle Fractures Treated With Teriparatide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle fractures are common in older people, they are very disabling and require either a cast or a boot for treatment and the patients need to use crutches for balance. These fractures can lead to complications including non union or delayed union in addition to risks of clotting of the leg vessels (deep vein thrombosis) where these clots can dislodge and migrate to the lungs (pulmonary embolus) resulting in breathing difficulties and/or death. Also these fractures commonly result in patients needing a temporary period of residential care. Therefore, if the healing time can be reduced, there is a potential for large benefits for the patient and reduced care costs for health and social care services. Teriparatide hormone is one of the new medications used for treating osteoporosis(weak bones), and studies in the USA have reported that Teriparatide hormone treatment can accelerate bone fracture healing time in pelvic fractures. Other reports also support faster healing time when Teriparatide hormone is used. The investigators are carrying out this feasibility study with 10 participants, in order to provide the information that will prepare us for carrying out a definitive study in the future.</detailed_description>
