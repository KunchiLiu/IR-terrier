	<brief_summary>Mother spend a large amount of time with their children. It is assumed that mother contributes to their neurological development not only with visual stimuli, but also with auditory stimuli. A recent study revealed that prefrontal cortex can be activated in response to the self-name being spoken by the mother than by a stranger.
