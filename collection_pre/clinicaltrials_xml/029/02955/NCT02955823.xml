	<brief_title>A Combination of Lenalidomide and Rituximab as Front Line Therapy for the Treatment of Elderly Frail Patients Evaluated in CGA With Diffuse Large B-cells Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. A Phase II Study of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial in elderly patients (≥ 70 years) affected by DLBCL defined as frail according to CGA and previously untreated. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of the R2 (Revlimid+Rituximab) combination in first line DLBCL patients not candidate for the standard R-CHOP (or R-CHOP like) treatments due to the frail status.</detailed_description>

Suspect or clinical evidence of CNS involvement by lymphoma 4. Contraindication to the use of Rituximab or of Lenalidomide 5. HBsAg positivitv; HBcAb positivity is accepted only with concomitant treatment with Lamivudine or Tenofovir depending on HBVDNA 6. HIV positivity 7.
