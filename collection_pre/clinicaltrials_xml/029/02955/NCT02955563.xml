	<brief_summary>We seek to develop a pragmatic, scalable intervention to overcome problems with surrogate decision making in ICUs. Our aim is to conduct a pilot study among 100 surrogates and clinicians of incapacitated patients at high risk of death to assess the impact of the CSDM (communication and shared decision making) web-based tool on key elements of decision making quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CSDM: A Trial to Improve Communication and Shared Decision Making Using a Web-Based Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roughly 600,000 Americans annually die in or shortly after an ICU admission, generally after decisions by surrogates to forego life support. Several decades of research indicate: 1. Family members in ICUs often struggle in the role of surrogate and experience high rates of lasting psychological sequelae (e.g. depression, anxiety, PTSD). For example, a systematic review found that one third of surrogates have long term feelings of guilt and doubt about the decisions they made. 2. Patients often receive treatment that is inconsistent with their values and preferences. For example, in the SUPPORT trial, physicians were frequently unaware of patients' wishes regarding end-of-life care, and patients often died receiving more invasive treatment than they preferred. 3. Intensive care near the end of life is a significant contributor to health care costs. For example, medical care in the last year of life accounts for 25% of Medicare costs, and ICU care contributes substantially. Breakdowns in clinician-family communication in ICUs are common and an important target for interventions. Using quantitative analysis of audiorecorded goals of care discussions in ICUs, we found that in more than 50% of conversations clinicians did not inquire about the patient's values and treatment preferences, and in a similar proportion failed to explicitly offer alternatives to indefinite life-prolonging treatment, such as time-limited trials or comfort-focused treatment. We have also documented frequent omissions of important prognostic information during such conversations and other researchers have documented that surrogates often hold unduly optimistic estimates of patients' prognosis. These data highlight the importance of improving the quality of collaborative decision making in ICUs. This proposal is responsive to national research priorities: The proposed research addresses priority areas for national action from the Institute of Medicine and NIH: improving clinician-family communication and end-of-life care for patients with advanced organ system failure. It is responsive to calls by the Institute on Aging to promote patient-centered decision making for elderly patients. A critical barrier to addressing these problems is the absence of a scalable intervention. No empirically validated decision support tools exist for the range of critical illnesses confronted in ICUs. Prior interventions to address these problems (e.g., proactive palliative care consultation or adding a family support counselor to the ICU team) face major barriers to dissemination due to projected palliative care workforce shortages and the high cost of adding more personnel to ICU care teams. Thus, we have developed a pragmatic, scalable intervention to overcome these problems. We plan to conduct a pilot study among 100 surrogates and clinicians of incapacitated patients to assess the efficacy of this intervention (the tool) on several aspects of decision making. We hypothesize that, compared to usual care controls, the intervention group will have more elements of shared decision making during audio recorded conversations (H1), surrogates will have more accurate expectations about the patient's prognosis (H2), greater clarity about the patient's values and preferences (H3), and higher perceptions of preparation for decision making (H4), assessed using validated measures.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible patient's surrogates and their clinicians are enrolled in this study. Surrogate inclusion criteria: We will enroll all eligible and willing surrogate decision makers aged ≥18 defined as persons selfidentified as participating directly in health care decision making for the incapable patient under relevant state law. Surrogates are eligible based on these patient characteristics: 1. Age ≥ 18 years 2. Lack of decision making capacity as determined by clinical examination by the attending physician (or his/her designee) 3. At least one of the following: 1. ≥40% chance of severe long term functional impairment as judged by the patient's attending physician (or his/her designee) 2. ≥40% chance of hospital mortality as judged by the patient's attending physician (or his/her designee) 3. ≥ 96 hours of mechanical ventilation Clinician eligibility criteria: Eligible physicians will be the patient's primary attending or his/her designee. If an enrolled patient is cared for by more than one attending physician during their ICU stay, each will be consented. Surrogate Exclusion critera are Individuals &lt;18 years old, those who cannot read and understand English, and those who cannot complete questionnaires due to physical or cognitive limitations will be excluded. We cannot enroll nonenglish speakers because of the logistical and financial barriers to having questionnaires in multiple languages. Surrogates must also have access to a computer if unable to be at the hospital to participate in the intervention and access the tool online. Clinician Exclusion criteria: none</criteria>
