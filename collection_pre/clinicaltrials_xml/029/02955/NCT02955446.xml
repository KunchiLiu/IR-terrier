	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Protocol for PF-03084014 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an expanded access-physician sponsored trial of PF-03084014, a novel gamma-secretase inhibitor being developed for cancer therapy. This trial is designed for patients who have been on a previous Industry-sponsored phase I trial using PF-03084014 for&gt; 1 year. The study is designed to evaluate the safety of prolonged oral administration of single agent PF-03084014. There are two study subjects with desmoid tumor who have been on the trial for a prolonged period of time (54 and 77 months, respectively) with either stable disease or response, indicating significant clinical benefit for a patient population in which there are few options. The goal of this protocol is to allow these subjects, who are clearly benefiting from PF-03084014, to continue to receive it</detailed_description>
