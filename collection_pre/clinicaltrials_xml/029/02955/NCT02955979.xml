	<brief_summary>Iodinated contrast media are now frequently used in diagnostic imaging exams, including pediatrics. In adults, the acute renal failure (ARF) associated with contrast agents (CA-AKI) occur in 3-33% of exposed patients, especially as the patient is fragile, has comorbidities or pre-existing renal aggression . In children, the prevalence of this little known disease is probably underestimated. The investigators intend to conduct a prospective epidemiological study, to estimate the impact of the acute renale failure to iodinated contrast agents in pediatrics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence of Acute Renal Failure Associated With Iodinated Contrast Agents in Pediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be included those of pediatric emergencies, Hospitalization Unit of Short Duration pediatric, pediatric intensive care and pediatric resuscitation. The acute renale failure will be estimated on the basis of criteria KDIGO (score of kidney disease) group in 2012 to 48 hours a computed tomography (CT) scan with injection of contrast media, based on a change in creatinine clearance of the estimated according to the formula Schwartz revised in 2009 and / or diuresis. Patient characteristics will be identified in order to establish risk factors.</detailed_description>
