	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine when used as a single-dose toddler vaccine in individuals who are either meningococcal vaccine naïve or have received one or more doses of monovalent meningococcal C (MenC) vaccines during infancy. Primary Objectives: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® in toddlers who either are meningococcal vaccine naïve or have received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® in meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers Secondary Objectives: - To compare the antibody responses (geometric mean titers [GMTs]) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in toddlers who either are meningococcal vaccine naïve or have received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy - To compare the antibody responses (GMTs) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers - To compare the antibody responses (GMTs) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in toddlers who received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy. Observational Objective: - To evaluate the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Nimenrix®.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months will be enrolled and randomized depending on the meningococcal background to receive either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix®. They will be assessed for immunogenicity assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and post-vaccination. Safety information will be collected post-vaccination and through the entire study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 12 to 23 months on the day of the first study visit Subjects have received all recommended standardofcare nonmeningococcal vaccinations according to his/her age as per local regulations Informed consent form (ICF) has been signed and dated by the parent/legally acceptable representative Subject and parent/legally acceptable representative are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures Covered by health insurance if required by local regulations Subjects have not received any meningococcal vaccine in the second year of life (i.e., from 12 months of age) For Inclusion in Groups 1 and 2: Subjects must not have received any vaccination against meningococcal disease with either a trial vaccine or a licensed meningococcal vaccine (i.e., polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, Y, B; or any monovalent or bivalent meningococcal vaccine) For Inclusion in Groups 3 and 4:Subjects must have previously received at least 1 dose of licensed monovalent meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccine during infancy (i.e., before 12 months of age). Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine prior to Visit 2 except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before or after study investigational vaccines. This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months For Groups 1 and 2 only: Vaccination against meningococcal disease with either a trial vaccine or a licensed meningococcal vaccine (i.e., polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, Y, B; or any monovalent or bivalent meningococcal vaccine) For Groups 3 and 4 only: Vaccination against meningococcal disease with either a trial vaccine or a licensed meningococcal vaccine (i.e., polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, Y, B; or any monovalent B meningococcal vaccine), except licensed monovalent meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccination received during infancy Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, subjects with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or subjects travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease) Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Personal history of an Arthuslike reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccine Personal history of GuillainBarré Syndrome Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/legally acceptable representative contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion Bleeding disorder or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
