	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare both short-term and long-term treatment effect of laparoscopic vs. open approach on progressive gastric and rectal cancer, based on circulating tumor cell (CTC) test results as well as disease-free survivals, and figure out principles of laparoscopic approach for progressive gastric and rectal cancer. Secondary purpose is to establish an evaluation system for laparoscopic surgery for progressive gastric and rectal cancer treatment using CTC as a biomarker.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Significance of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Treatment of Gastric and Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery represents a milestone for treatment of gastric and rectal cancer, with advantages of minimal invasion and rapid recovery compared to open approach. However, for progressive gastric and rectal cancer, laparoscopic approach has not been officially promoted by NCCN guideline (2015). Over the past decade, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), originated from a tumor cell, have been identified as potential blood-based biomarkers capable of providing prognostic and predictive Information. In the present study, the investigators utilize the CTCBIOPSY® system (YZYBIO Company, Wuhan, China), which has been approved by CFDA (Chinese Food and Drug Administration), to detect CTCs, and try to compare both short-term and long-term treatment effect of laparoscopic vs. open approach on progressive gastric and rectal cancer, based on circulating tumor cell (CTC) test results as well as disease-free survivals, and figure out principles of laparoscopic approach for progressive gastric and rectal cancer. Secondary purpose is to establish an evaluation system for laparoscopic surgery for progressive gastric and rectal cancer treatment using CTC as a biomarker.</detailed_description>
