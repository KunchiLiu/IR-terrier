	<detailed_description>Childhood obesity continues to be a key challenge in France. The unit is facing a high demand with limited resources, moreover despite an intensive program of care with a multidisciplinary dedicated team, the impact on weight loss is moderate. The hypothesis is to ameliorate results by using distance monitoring in maintenance phase. After a traditional intensive period consisting in a weekly family-based multidisciplinary intervention, patients are randomized in two arms, traditional or distance follow-up. Traditional follow-up is based on face-to-face multidisciplinary consultations every three months. The distance monitoring is based on a mobile application dedicated to food behavior change and physical activity, with weekly self-monitoring, goal setting, physical activity and healthy eating support, monthly weight assessment. Pre-programmed feedbacks "motivational strategies" are included. After one year of follow-up, adolescents are evaluated for weight loss, compliance and quality of life. The two groups will be compared. The question is can mobile apps help to monitor and promote healthy lifestyle in obese adolescents.</detailed_description>
