	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase Ib open label, single arm, adaptive multicentre trial. Patients with newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM) will be treated with Cyclophosphamide-Bortezomib-Dexamethasone (CyBorD) in combination with Daratumumab (DARA). The safety profile of daratumumab to date, which does not appear to overlap with those known for approved agents, combined with its distinct MoA, suggest that the therapeutic profile of daratumumab combined with various backbone regimens may improve the treatment effect of these regimens. Additionally, daratumumab as a single agent may prolong the progression free interval for these patients. Based on the potential for cyclophosphamide to enhance ADCP, there is a strong rationale to combine DARA with a cyclophosphamide, bortezomib containing regimen. This will be the first clinical trial to explore the feasibility of combining daratumumab with a cyclophosphamide containing backbone induction regimen and if successful will provide the rationale for larger studies exploring the efficacy of this combination in greater detail.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will consist of 2 phases: - The Screening Phase will extend up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. - The Treatment Phase will be conducted in 2 parts and will extend from Cycle 1 Day 1 until treatment discontinuation. Treatment Phase, Part 1: Induction/Transplantation/Consolidation Phase. The consolidation phase of treatment will begin approximately 30-60 days after Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT), when the patient has recovered sufficiently and engraftment is complete. Treatment Phase, Part 2: Maintenance Phase treatment until a maximum duration of 2 years, documented disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>

Patient must be between 18 and &lt;70 years of age. Patient must have documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma requiring treatment as per IMWG updated criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and measurable disease as defined by: Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ≥10% or presence of a biopsy proven plasmacytoma Measurable disease as defined by any of the following: IgG multiple myeloma: serum monoclonal paraprotein (Mprotein) level ≥1.0g/dl or urine Mprotein level ≥200mg/24 hours; or IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM multiple myeloma: serum Mprotein level ≥0.5g/dl or urine Mprotein level ≥200mg/24 hours; or Light chain multiple myeloma without measurable disease in the serum or the urine: serum immunoglobulin free light chain ≥10mg/dl and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda free light chain ratio. Newly diagnosed patient eligible for high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patient must have an ECOG performance status score of 02. Patient must have pretreatment clinical laboratory values meeting the following criteria during the Screening Phase: Haemoglobin ≥7.5g/dl (≥5mmol/l); prior red blood cell [RBC] transfusion or recombinant human erythropoietin use is permitted); absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0x109/l (GCSF is permitted); AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except in patients with congenital bilirubinaemia, such as Gilbert syndrome, direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN); calculated creatinine clearance ≥40ml/min/1.73m2; corrected serum calcium ≤ 14mg/dl (&lt;3.5mmol/l); or free ionized calcium ≤6.5mg/dl (≤1.6mmol/l); platelet count ≥70x109/l for patients in whom &lt;50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells; otherwise platelet count &gt;50x109/l (transfusions are not permitted to achieve this minimum platelet count). Patients who are women of childbearing potential or male partners of women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception methods from signing of the informed consent form until at least 100 days after the last study drug administration. Childbearing potential is defined as any woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). The investigator or a designated associate is required to advise the patient how to achieve adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in the study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) progestogenonly hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable and implantable), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, successfully vasectomised partner and sexual abstinence. In addition, the use of condoms by patients or their partners is required unless the woman has had a hysterectomy. Contraception will start 4 weeks before the start of therapy, will continue during therapy including dose interruptions and for 4 months after the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen. A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests at Screening, first within 10 to 14 days prior to first dose and the second within 24 hours prior to first dose. Patient must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol. Patient has received daratumumab or other antiCD38 therapies previously. Patient has a diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or smoldering multiple myeloma. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is defined by presence of serum Mprotein &lt; 3g/dl; absence of criteria consistent with active/symptomatic multiple myeloma as per IMWG criteria. Smoldering multiple myeloma is defined as asymptomatic multiple myeloma with absence of related organ or tissue impairment (ROTI) end organ damage. Patient has a diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or other conditions in which IgM Mprotein is present in the absence of a clonal plasma cell infiltration with lytic bone lesions. Patient has prior or current systemic therapy or stem cell transplantation for any plasma cell dyscrasia, with the exception of an emergency use of a short course (equivalent of dexamethasone 40mg/day for a maximum 4 days) of corticosteroids before treatment. Patient has peripheral neuropathy or neuropathy grade 2 or higher, as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0.
