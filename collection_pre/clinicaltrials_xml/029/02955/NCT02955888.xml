	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PBI-4050, and its effects on the pancreatic, pulmonary functions and on various biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis patients with abnormal glucose tolerance. Patients with abnormal glucose tolerance have elevated glucose level either at 1 hour or 2 hour during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The Main study will include 24 weeks of treatment with PBI-4050 or matching placebo. At the end of the treatment period, patients will have the option of participating in a 24-week Extension study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety, Tolerability &amp; Efficacy in Cystic Fibrosis Patients With Abnormal Glucose Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PBI-4050, and its effects on the pancreatic, pulmonary functions and on various biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis patients with abnormal glucose tolerance. Patients with abnormal glucose tolerance have elevated glucose level either at 1 hour or 2 hour during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). A total of 90 patients (30=INDENT, 30=IGT, 30=CFRD) will be enrolled for study participation. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will continually review individual patients safety data obtained from the 90 patients. When the first 30 patients have completed at least 1 month of study treatment, the DSMB will meet formally to determine whether additional patients may be enrolled, the study should continue with changes or if the study should be stopped. In addition, the DSMB will review the PK data and may recommend dose adjustment based on the PK results. The total duration of study participation for each patient is at least 32 weeks, including up to 4 weeks of a screening period, 24 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of safety follow-up. Patients who choose to participate in the extension will be in the study for an additional 24 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of safety follow-up (for a total of 56 weeks).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient is 18 years of age or older at screening. 2. Patient has a documented and confirmed CF diagnosis. 3.

Patient has signed written informed consent. 6. Patient is able and willing to wear a Control Glucose Monitoring System for 14 days (for participating sites only). 7. Patient is able and willing to selfmonitor blood glucose level at home. 8. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) and agree to use adequate birth control from screening throughout the study and for the 30 days after the last study drug administration. 9. If a male patient has not been vasectomized at least 6 months before screening and partners with a woman of childbearing potential, he must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method throughout the study and for the 30 days after the last study drug administration. 1. Patient has recent or ongoing infection requiring intravenous treatment with an antiinfective agent within 30 days before screening. 2. Patient is concurrently taking high dose of ibuprofen (&gt;30 mg/kg) or is using corticosteroids (except inhaled and topical corticosteroids). 3. Patient is currently using weightloss medications. 4. Patient has used any strong inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isozyme within 30 days prior to the first study drug administration. 5. Patient has significantly elevated liver enzyme levels, defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) â‰¥ 2.5 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or total bilirubin above ULN at screening. 6. Patient has a history of chronic alcohol or other substance abuse as determined at screening that may prevent study compliance based on Investigator judgment. 7. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer. 8. Patient has unstable chronic heart failure that has required change in therapy within 2 months prior to screening. 9. Patient with known noncontrolled history of infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and/or active Hepatitis. 10. Woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding or planning a pregnancy during the course of the study. 11. Woman of childbearing potential who is unwilling to use adequate birth control throughout the duration of the study. 12. Patient has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, is likely to interfere with study conduct and compliance. 13. Patient has participated in an investigational clinical trial within 30 days (or 5 halflives, whichever is longer) prior to screening visit.</criteria>
