	<brief_summary>The gastric acid pocket is believed to be the reservoir from which acid reflux events originate. The risk for acidic reflux is mainly determined by the position of the gastric acid pocket. Little is known about how changes in position and size of the acid pocket contribute to the therapeutic effect of proton pump inhibitors(PPI) plus mosapride in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Investigators will conduct a prospective randomized, single blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the hypothesis that mosapride affecting gastric motility might reduce gastro-esophageal reflux by changing the acid pocket position and size.</brief_summary>
