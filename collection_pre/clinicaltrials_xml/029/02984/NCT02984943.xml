	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects and ease of using hyperbaric oxygen therapy HBO2 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis joint pain and prevention of disease progression. In this study it is our intention to not only evaluate effects and ease of treatment but time, cost, possible adverse events and effect size in an attempt to predict an appropriate sample size and improve on the study design prior to a more extensive study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen on Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that primarily involves synovial joints, typically symmetrically. If untreated and/or uncontrolled, joint destruction due to erosion of cartilage and bone can cause joint destruction, joint deformities, loss of physical function, severe disability, and difficulties maintaining employment.1 ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria2 is a score-based algorithm which adds scores of 4 categories including, joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants and duration of symptoms. A score of &gt;6/10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite RA. Non-pharmacologic and supplementary therapies include patient education, rest, exercise, nutrition counseling, cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and immunizations to decrease risk of infectious complications of immunosuppression. These are important in the comprehensive management of RA in all stages of disease and are used in addition to drug therapy. Pharmacologic therapies typically start with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), preferably as soon as possible after diagnosis. DMARDs are commonly used in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids which are often used as bridging therapies until the DMARDs become effective. The goal is disease remission. To assess response, disease activity scores are used along with inflammatory markers. Three patients with active RA treated in the multi-place hyperbaric facility at DGMC, Travis Air Force Base, CA, for non RA-related indications, all noted significant improvement in arthralgias, sleep patterns and overall well-being during the course of therapy. Two were treated at 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) oxygen for 90 minutes daily Monday through Friday. One patient received 2 ATA air on the same treatment protocol as a participant in a research study, and a subsequent course of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) at 2 ATA. This is a pilot study. Patients will be recruited through the Rheumatologists, flyers in the Rheumatology Clinic or thru Commander Calls. During the first visit: The rheumatologist will discuss the trial and at this point the subject will be consented and the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed. If subject qualifies they will see the Hyperbaric physician who will do physical examination to determine if it is safe for the subject to receive HBO2. After this exam is done the subject will be scheduled for a trial Hyperbaric session. Baseline visit will be done after the subject has tolerated the trial hyperbaric session. This visit includes: 1. A visit with the rheumatologist to do routine assessments to establish baseline measurement using the Disease Activity Scale (DAS28) 2. Labs (CRP and ESR), will be completed. MRI with an without contrast and ultrasound will be done on both hands from wrists to proximal phalanges the wrist. 3. Subjective patient reporting will be captured using the Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ)9 4. Sleep quality will be tracked using the Pain and Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQ-3)10 . Surveys will be done by a study team member, The subject at this time will be scheduled to start 30 HBO2 treatments. Treatments are daily, Monday through Friday At month 2, labs (ESR and CRP) will be repeated. At the month 3 and month 6 visit the subject will see the rheumatologist to track disease activity using the DAS-28. Labs, MRI and Ultrasound will be done. MDHAQ and PSQ-3 will be administered at this time. If the patient's RA symptoms worsen during the study,the physicians will institute measures to address the cause. The medical monitor will be notified and if any adverse events are involved, they will be recorded and reported to the IRB. Data: Data will be entered by authorized study personnel only. Demographic information will be collected including sex, age and ethnic background in accordance with HIPPA compliance. Data collected during this study will be analyzed at various points in time to include physician exams, labs, radiologic studies, joint inspection. Changes in joint pain will be determined by self-reporting and results of the standard outcome measures questionnaires. A separate sleep survey will be administered.</detailed_description>
