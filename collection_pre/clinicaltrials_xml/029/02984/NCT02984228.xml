	<brief_summary>Glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) accounts for approximately 2-5% of all chronic shoulder pain and may be classified into primary and secondary forms. Primary glenohumeral OA is caused by degenerative joint disease, inflammatory arthropathies, and neuropathic arthropathy secondary to syringomyelia or diabetes. Secondary glenohumeral OA is caused by trauma, postoperative changes after arthroscopy or capulorraphy, and osteonecrosis. Hyaluronic acid is found in synovial joint fluid and has viscoelastic, chondroprotective, and possibly anti-inflammatory properties. It has been shown to increase joint lubrication. Platelet-rich plasma contains growth factors that have been shown to promote tissue regeneration. The aim of this study is to determine whether injections of hyaluronic acid or platelet-rich plasma can be used reliably to decrease pain, restore function, and improve quality of life in patients suffering from glenohumeral OA. Patients will be randomized to receive either an injection of hyaluronic acid or an injection of platelet-rich plasma. Outcomes will be assessed via questionnaires for up to 24 weeks post-procedure.</brief_summary>
