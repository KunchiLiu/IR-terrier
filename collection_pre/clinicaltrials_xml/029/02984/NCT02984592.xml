	<brief_summary>Premature ejaculation (PE) is one of the prevalent disorders in men; its leading sequel such as lack of self-confidence, anxiety, depression and unsatisfactory intercourse in men and their partners. The current study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between ejaculation and physical activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Exercise on Premature Ejaculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most frequent sexual dysfunction in males, and its prevalence has been reported as 21-33%. Currently, there are no universal criteria for the diagnosis, or treatment strategies or approaches for PE. Lack of observational studies directed to PE makes comprehension of this sexual dysfunction difficult. The common point for definition of PE is a short duration between penetration and ejaculation, little or no control on voluntary control of ejaculation, and annoying character and negative effect of this condition on the individual. There are various treatment methods since ejaculation physiology and neuroanatomy is not yet clearly demonstrated. According to neurobiological hypothesis of Waldinger, a dysfunction in the serotonin pathway of the central system such as serotonin-2C hyposensitivity and/or serotonin-1A receptor hypersensitivity is a possible cause of lifelong PE. These experimental animal models showed that serotonergic activity at hypothalamic level inhibited ejaculation reflex. Based on this physiological effect, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and serotonin agonists increase intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT). A number of studies showed that exercise increased the functional effect of serotonin in the human brain. The effects of physical activity level on human health have attracted interest worldwide. Lack of physical activity forms the basis of various health problems, however regular physical act contributes prevention and treatment of a number of disorders. In current study, investigators will compare the ejaculation control, IELT, and prevalence of PE between sportsmen that have regular physical activity, and the individuals with a sedentary lifestyle.</detailed_description>
