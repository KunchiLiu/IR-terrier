	<brief_summary>Plasma-cell post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PC-PTLD) are rare monomorphic PTLD divided into plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and plasmacytoma-like lesion (PLL) PTLD. To date, there is no exhaustive published cytogenetic data on PC-PTLD. The investigators report array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of 10 cases of PCM and PLL-PTLD.</brief_summary>
