	<brief_title>Simethicone: Does it Improve Operative Field and Postoperative Pain?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Simethicone is an oral antifoaming agent that reduces bloating, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain by promoting the clearance of excessive gas along the gastrointestinal tract. Objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative oral simethicone for bowel preparation in gynecological laparoscopies. Methods: 100 infertile women will be scheduled for laparoscopy, patients randomized to receive either Simethicone (Group I) or placebo tablets (Group II). The primary outcome measure will be the overall exposure of the surgical field and pain scoring. Assessment of the overall exposure of the surgical field was done using a five-point scale (poor, sufficient, medium, good, and excellent). Visual analog score (VAS) will be used for assessment of postoperative pain and verbal analog scoring was used for assessment of patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
