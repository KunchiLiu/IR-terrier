	<brief_summary>The study is a prospective randomized study about hallux valgus surgery. The investigator try to assess if the fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy with a cannulated screw have an incidence in the first ray mobility since the two technics ( fixation and no-fixation) are described and practiced, and since the stiffness of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint is determinant in the result of this functional surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It's a prospective monocentric randomized work about forefoot surgery. Every patient included undergoes an hallux valgus chevron osteotomy of the first metatarsal associated with a percutaneous Akin osteotomy of the first phalange. The investigators study the impact of the fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy ( osteotomy of the first phalange of hallux) with two arms: one with fixation of the percutaneous Akin osteotomy, and one with a non-fixed percutaneous Akin osteotomy This study as been approved by Institutional review board; written informed consent is required for all patients before inclusion. The clinic follow-up of each patients included in the study will be the same of the normal follow-up for this type of surgery in our practice. This includes clinical exam, radiologic exam, and functional score AOFAS before surgery, at 6 weeks after the surgery, four months after surgery and finally one year after the surgery. The primary outcome measure which is the first metatarso-phalangeal global mobility will be blindly measure by an observator.</detailed_description>
