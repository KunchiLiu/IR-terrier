	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the association between gross motor function and chewing performance level in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A cross-sectional study was conducted in 152 children (ages 2-10y, 51.3% male) with a diagnosis of spastic CP. The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine gross motor function levels of children. Chewing performance level was determined by using the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the association between gross motor function and chewing performance level in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A cross-sectional study was conducted in 152 children (ages 2-10y, 51.3% male) with a diagnosis of spastic CP. The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine gross motor function levels of children. Chewing performance level was determined by using the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS).Children with a diagnosis of spastic CP aged 2 to 12 years who were referred due to chewing/swallowing problems by pediatric neurologists were included. The inclusion criteria were above the age of 24 months, and had complaints about chewing function. Children under the age of 24 months, requiring tube feeding or taking any oral nutritional supplements, and used any medicine and/or oral appliances that could affect the chewing performance, were excluded.</detailed_description>
