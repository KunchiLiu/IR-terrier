	<detailed_description>During the study period around 2000 term neonates were born in the university affiliated hospital. Five to 7 term neonates were assessed weekly by the principal investigator (PI) for study eligibility. The parents of neonates who met the inclusion criteria received information about the study after which they were invited to participate. Written informed consent from parent was obtained. The PI entered data into the online Research Randomizer which provided a randomization number corresponding to a numbered treatment pack containing two syringes, each containing 2ml of an identical and therefore blinded liquid. Study investigators, clinical staff, parents and monitors remained blinded to treatment allocation until data analysis was completed. To ensure standardization the included term infants were not breastfeed 30' prior to the heel stick and a standardized heel lance was used.Each infant was taken to a separate room with the mother by the assigned nurse to provide a quite environment. All infants were awake at the time of the procedure. Their clothes were removed and wet diapers were changed. In both groups, the infants were placed in a supine position on a changing table. Dextrose administration and the heel stick were undertaken by an experienced staff neonatal nurse. The heel was warmed with a warm wet towel up 2' minutes before the procedure. The heel was disinfected shortly before the procedure started.</detailed_description>
