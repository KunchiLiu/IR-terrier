	<brief_title>3D Versus 2D Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy With Splenic Hilum Lymph Nodes Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized comparison of 3D and 2D laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer with spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph nodes dissection will be performed, to evaluate the safety and feasibility for the extensive application of the novel 3D laparoscopic technique. The evaluation parameters are number of group No.10 lymph nodes harvested, perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Primary proximal gastric adenocarcinoma confirmed pathologically by endoscopic biopsy; 2. cT24aN03M0 at preoperative evaluation according to AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition. 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG): 0 or 1; 4. American Society of Anesthesiologists （ASA） score: Ⅰto Ⅲ; 5. Written informed consent. 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding women; 2. Severe mental disorder; 3. Previous upper abdominal surgery (except laparoscopic cholecystectomy); 4. Previous gastrectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection, or endoscopic submucosal dissection; 5. Enlarged or bulky regional lymph node diameter larger than 3 cm based on preoperative imaging; 6. Other malignant disease within the past 5 years; 7. Previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy; 8. Contraindication to general anesthesia (severe cardiac and/or pulmonary disease); 9. Emergency surgery due to a complication (bleeding, obstruction, or perforation) caused by gastric cancer.</criteria>
