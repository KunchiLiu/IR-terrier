	<brief_summary>Correct assessment of a patient's volume status is the most important goal for an anesthetist. However, most of the variables used for fluid response evaluation are invasive and technically challenging.Pulse oximeter is a non-invasive, standardized and widely used monitoring method in many countries. Our aim in this study is to investigate the usefulness of the noninvasive pleth variability index to predict hypotension in orthopedic hip fracture patients who underwent spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
