	<brief_title>Objective Physical Activity Assesment in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study aims to accurately assess weekly physical activity levels of postmenopausal women using lactate thresholds to individualize the accelerometer cut-points. Postmenopausal women will be recruited from local advertisements in public health centers. Each woman will perfom on different days a progressive discontinuous submaximal walking-running test and several constant speed tests wearing an accelerometer to identify the individual lactate threshold (LT), the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) and the corresponding accelerometer activity counts/min (cpm). Participants then will wear an actigraph accelerometer (wGT3X-BT) for seven days. Linear regression equations will be developed for each participant to determine accelerometer activity counts for each intensity level: 1) sedentary behaviour (&lt;200 cpm), 2) light intensity (200 cpm to activity counts at LT), 3) moderate intensity (activity counts between LT and MLSS) and 4) vigorous intensity (activity counts &gt;MLSS). Physical activity levels will be measured using both, individualized approach and Sasaki, Jonh and FreedsonÂ´s (2011) absolute cut-points obtained through walking and running activities eliciting 3-6 MET intensities (2689-6166 cpm), considering it a "moderate" effort.</detailed_description>
