	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Effect on Ischemic_ Reperfusion Injury in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In addition to well-known effect of Erythropoietin (EPO) on erythropoiesis in hypoxic conditions, some lines of evidence suggest its protective effects against reperfusion injury in several tissues by its specific receptor. Preclinical studies have indicated a broad variety of cardioprotective actions for EPO. It improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in congestive heart failure, angiogenesis, limit myocardial inflammatory response, cardiac remodeling, infarct size and apoptosis extension induced by reperfusion injury. Activation of EPO receptor in endothelial and cardiac cells is suggested to attenuate proinflammatory cytokines production and inflammatory cells infiltration, and increasing nitric oxide production through possible mechanisms. Reperfusion injury is unavoidable event during cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.It is associated with inflammation, cell injury and attenuate contractility property. Although it is an area of concern and many clinical studies have been designed by different interventions, it remains a major challenge. EPO intervention during heart reperfusion (surgery/ percutaneous angioplasty) as a new promise of cardioprotection strategy is the main design of several studies with conflicting results .</detailed_description>
