	<detailed_description>In this study the efficacy of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) (Enoxaparin) compared to Aspirin in the use of preventing death and clinically important blood clots in the lungs in patients who sustain trauma will be investigated. The following comparisons between aspirin and the LMWH are described in the specific aims below: Specific Aim 1: Assess the proportion of patients who sustain death, clinically significant pulmonary embolism, or complication after orthopaedic trauma treated with injectable LMWH compared to those treated with aspirin. Hypothesis 1a: The mortality rate will be non-inferior in the aspirin group Hypothesis 1b: The rate of clinically significant PE will be non-inferior in the aspirin group Hypothesis 1c: The rate of complications will be superior (i.e., lower) in the aspirin group Specific Aim 2: Assess satisfaction with care in orthopaedic trauma patients treated with injectable LMWH compared to those treated with aspirin Hypothesis2a : Satisfaction will be superior in the aspirin group Specific Aim 3: Document out of pocket patient costs in orthopaedic trauma patients treated with injectable LMWH compared to those treated with aspirin Hypothesis3a : Out of pocket costs will be lower in the aspirin group Specific Aim 4: Examine the proportion of minor clot events that are less important to patients (clots in the proximal legs, incidental PE) in orthopaedic trauma patients treated with injectable LMWH compared to those treated with aspirin. Hypothesis4a : The rate will be non-inferior in the aspirin group Specific Aim 5: Examine the proportion of minor clot events that are less important to patients (clots in the proximal legs, incidental PE) in orthopaedic trauma patients treated with injectable LMWH compared to those treated with aspirin. Hypothesis 5a: The rate will be non-inferior in the aspirin group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Trauma patients who are at increased risk of blood clots from their orthopaedic traumatic injury (operatively treated extremity injuries and all pelvis or acetabulum fractures that are treated either operatively or non operatively) and for whom a prophylactic blood thinner regimen would be standard of care at their institution. 18 years or older Patients who do not require prophylactic blood thinners as standard of practice Patients who are already on long term blood thinners (participants on other than lowdose aspirin or platelet inhibitors such as Plavix or Aggrenox will NOT be excluded) or who require therapeutic (as opposed to prophylactic) blood thinners for an acute issue such as a blood clot in the last 6 months) Patients who cannot receive either of the study medications due to an allergy (history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, allergy to aspirin, or NSAIDs) or other medical contraindication to blood thinners Patients who are on higher dose aspirin (&gt;81 mg once a day or higher) for medical reasons or who will be treated with higher dose aspirin Patients with underlying chronic clotting disorders (i.e. Factor V Leiden, hyperhomocysteinemia, Protein C and S deficiency) that require full dose anticoagulation or are a contraindication to venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis; End stage renal disease or impaired creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min at time of randomization(note: creatinine clearance does not need to be documented if prescribing physician would order medication without test as SOC) Pregnant or lactating patients; Patients contraindicated for any reason for either medicine Prisoners Patients who do not speak either English or Spanish Patients may be excluded for other reasons at the discretion of the treating physician; the reason for exclusion must be documented on the screening form. Patients must be enrolled prior to receiving more than 2 doses of LMWH or Aspirin for initial prophylaxis.</criteria>
