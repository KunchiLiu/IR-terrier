	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether there is a population-level association between circulating respiratory viruses and NHS hospital admissions for acute vascular events using data from national infection surveillance and Hospital Episode Statistics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specific Respiratory Infections as Triggers of Acute Medical Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will conduct a time series study correlating anonymised population level data on all samples from NHS laboratories testing positive for six common respiratory viruses with admissions to NHS hospitals in England for a range of cardiac and vascular outcomes over the time period 01/01/2004 to 31/12/2014. This will involve generating Poisson regression models controlling for factors such as seasonal and long-term trends, environmental temperature and humidity. This study is funded by an Academy of Medical Sciences Starter Grant for Clinical Lecturers.</detailed_description>
