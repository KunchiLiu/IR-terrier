	<brief_summary>Brown adipose tissue has the capacity to consume large amounts of energy and has insulin-independent glucose uptake. The investigators have recently observed an inverse correlation between irisin levels and insulin needs of type 1 diabetes patients. Transplantation of brown adipose tissue to insulin-deficient rats normalized their blood glucose levels. In this study 12 patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes (&gt;10 years) and with variable exogenous insulin needs will be investigated for amount of brown adipose tissue with positron emission tomography using the tracer 18F-deoxy glucose.</brief_summary>
