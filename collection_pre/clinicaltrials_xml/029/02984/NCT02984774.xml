	<brief_summary>The goal of the study was the detection of telomerase activity in eutopic, ectopic endometrial tissue and in peripheral blood and finding the correlation between the telomerase activity and clinic findings. With these results, confirmation of the hypothesis regarding the endometriosis pathogenesis and endometriosis-related infertility was aimed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Telomerase Activity in Endometrial Tissue and Serum in Endometriosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although distorted pelvic anatomy, impaired peritoneal, humoral and cellular functions, decreased implantation rate, oocyte and embryo quality, obstructed utero tubal connection are most researched aspects of endometriosis-related infertility, etiopathogenesis of endometriosis-related infertility still remains controversial. Endometrial cell is a unique eukaryotic somatic cell with cyclic telomerase activity. Hormone-dependent cyclic variation of endometrial telomerase activity was stated in previous studies. On the other hand telomerase, activity was shown in endometriotic lesions, whereas this activity lacks in most of the somatic cells. In this study, assessment of possible relation to increased telomerase activity in infertile patients with endometriosis was aimed. Before published studies were assessed telomerase activity in benign and malign gynecological conditions and in endometriosis tissue, as well. But evaluation of ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissue and serum telomerase activity in infertile and fertile endometriosis and healthy control subjects was not performed. Correlation of telomerase activity and endometriosis-related infertility was aimed in this study.</detailed_description>
