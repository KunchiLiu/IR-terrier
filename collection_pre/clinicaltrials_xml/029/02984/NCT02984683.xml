	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To select in the first part the SAR566658 dose based on Objective Response Rate (ORR) and safety of 2 dose levels and to demonstrate in the second part the efficacy of the selected dose based on ORR. Secondary Objectives: - To assess: - Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration Of Response (DOR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Time To Progression (TTP) - The impact of ocular primary prophylaxis on the incidence of keratopathies; - The potential immunogenicity of SAR566658 - To evaluate the global safety profile</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of SAR566658 Treatment in Patients With CA6 Positive Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study for 1 patient will include a screening period of up to 21 days prior to first study drug administration, 3-week treatment cycle(s) (until 30 days after last SAR566658 administration), and a follow-up period. Each patient will be treated until radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal of further study treatment.</detailed_description>
