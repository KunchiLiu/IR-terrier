	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of alirocumab with standard of care on coronary atheroma progression in patients who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event and are treated with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Secondary Objectives: - To compare the efficacy of alirocumab with standard of care on absolute change in percent atheroma volume (PAV) and normalized total atheroma volume (TAV). - To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo-B), triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and Lipoprotein(a)(Lp[a]). - To evaluate the safety of alirocumab including the occurrence of cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease [CHD] death, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI], fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients hospitalized for ACS (Acute STsegment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], Acute nonSTsegment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], and Unstable angina [UA]). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥100 mg/dL. Patients who undergo Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of the coronary arteries with at least &gt;50% stenosis angiographically within 1 week after the ACS onset. Patients aged ≥20 years old at ACS diagnosis. Negative to serum Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody, and Hepatitis C antibody tests. Written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Patients who have been previously treated with at least one dose of any antiproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (antiPCSK9) monoclonal antibody. Uncontrolled hypertension (multiple reading with systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt;110 mmHg) between ACS diagnosis and randomization visit. Known history of hemorrhagic stroke. Currently under treatment for cancer. Patients on LDL apheresis. Any clinically significant abnormality identified that in the judgment of the Investigator or any subInvestigator would preclude safe completion of the study or constrain endpoints assessment such as major systemic diseases, patients with short life expectancy. Considered by the Investigator or any subInvestigator as inappropriate for this study for any reason, including: Unable to meet specific protocol requirements, such as scheduled visits; Investigator or any subInvestigator, pharmacist, study coordinator, other study staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol, etc; Presence of any other conditions (eg, geographic, social, etc.) actual or anticipated, that the Investigator feels would restrict or limit the patient's participation for the duration of the study. Laboratory findings measured within 2 weeks after the ACS diagnosis (positive serum or urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
