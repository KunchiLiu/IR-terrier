	<brief_summary>Investigators aimed to evaluate the impact of bupivacaine administration into the surgical field after total thyroidectomy on post-operative pain and analgesic requirement with a double-blind, prospective, clinical, randomized study. Pain assessment was performed with the visual analog score (VAS). Participants were pre-operatively, divided into two groups randomly to receive either bupivacaine or not. One group received a 10 ml of bupivacaine solution while the other group was treated with the same volume of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) through the drain after completion of total thyroidectomy procedure. All participants were anesthetized and operated with the same anesthesia and surgical team.</brief_summary>
