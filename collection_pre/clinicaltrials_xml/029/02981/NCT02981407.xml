	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two red blood cell transfusion strategies (liberal and restrictive) for patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction and are anemic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In most clinical settings, evidence suggests it is safe to wait to give a blood transfusion. However, for those who have suffered a heart attack, there is a lack of high quality evidence to guide transfusions. This 3500 subject multi-center randomized trial will fill that void. Hospital inpatients diagnosed with myocardial infarction who have blood counts less than 10 g/dL are randomized to receive either a liberal or a restrictive transfusion strategy. Patients randomized to the liberal transfusion strategy will receive a red blood cell transfusion anytime there is a blood count of less than 10 g/dL. Patients randomized to the restrictive transfusion strategy are permitted to receive a blood transfusion if the blood count is below 8 g/dL and the physician believes it is in the patient's best interest. A transfusion will be strongly recommended if the blood count drops to less than 7 g/dL. If the patient has symptoms of angina (e.g., chest discomfort described as pressure or heaviness) that do not go away with medication, a blood transfusion is ordered regardless of the blood count. The transfusions strategies will be maintained until hospital discharge for a maximum of 30 days. Patients will be followed for 30 days for clinically relevant outcomes. Vital status will be confirmed at 180 days.</detailed_description>
