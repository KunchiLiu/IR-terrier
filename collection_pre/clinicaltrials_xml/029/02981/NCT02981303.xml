	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma or metastatic TNBC Safety: To characterize the safety of Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab given in combination Hypothesis: Restore (for melanoma) or enhance (for TNBC) sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) by appropriate and effective stimulation of the subject's innate and adaptive immune systems in those subjects who have failed 1st line therapy The study will incorporate Simon's optimal 2-stage design with sample size fixed at 12 subjects each in Stage 1 for advanced melanoma and for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subjects. The safety criterion of ≤ 4 (or ≤ 33%) subjects with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1 within either tumor type must be met in order to proceed to Stage 2. The starting dose is 4 mg/kg for Imprime PGG. In the event there are a total of &gt; 4 (or &gt; 33%) of subjects with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1, the dose of Imprime PGG will be reduced to 2 mg/kg, and Stage 1 will be repeated at a dose of 2 mg/kg with an additional cohort of n=12 subjects. For the dose that meets the safety criterion in Stage 1, at least 1 response in melanoma subjects and 2 responses in TNBC subjects amongst the 12 subjects within each tumor type must be observed in order to proceed to Stage 2. Stage 2 will enroll an additional 17 subjects with melanoma, and 30 subjects with TNBC. For the dose that meets the Stage 1 safety criterion, success will be declared if at least 4 amongst the total of up to 29 subjects with melanoma, and 13 amongst the total of up to 42 subjects with TNBC achieve an objective response.</brief_summary>

Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. 8.

Be willing to consider providing fresh tissue for biomarker analysis, and, based on the adequacy of the tissue sample quality, for assessment of biomarker status. Repeat samples may be required if adequate tissue is not provided. Newly obtained biopsy specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalinfixed, paraffinembedded block specimens are preferred to slides. Note: Information on 1 tumor biopsy sample is mandatory and is as follows: (1) To determine eligibility, historical (diagnostic) tumor biopsy official pathology report +/ an archival sample. Additional biopsy samples, preferably obtained from the same localized region, are highly desirable when feasible at the following time points: (2) Sample before the first dose of study treatment, (3) Sample after completion of Cycle 2 but before the start of Cycle 3 dosing, and (4) Sample either at the time of response or at the End of Study Visit (if no response). 10.

Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN 2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases 3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases 13. Have adequate renal function as defined by the following criteria: Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN and CrCl ≥ 30 ml/min per Cockcroft Gault formula: 14. Have adequate hematologic function, defined as meeting all of the following criteria: 1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (uncorrected by RBC transfusion) 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L 3.
