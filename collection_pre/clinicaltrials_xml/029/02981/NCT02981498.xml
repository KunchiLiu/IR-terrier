	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of Sorafenib Combined With Concurrent HAIC for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In most current guidelines, unresectable HCC with major PVTT are considered not generally suitable for transarterial chemoembolization, and sorafenib is recommended as standard care.3-5 However, for patients with major PVTT, the median overall survival of those treated with sorafenib monotherapy was only 3.1 to 6.0 months. Whether combining sorafenib with hepatic arterial infusion (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious remains unknown, with no prospective clinical data currently available.The investigators therefore conducted a prospective single center, single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sorafenib combined with HAIC in patients with unresectable advanced HCC.</detailed_description>
