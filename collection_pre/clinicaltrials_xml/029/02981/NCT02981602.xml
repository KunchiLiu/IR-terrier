	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of IONIS-HBVRx in Treatment-Naïve Patients With Chronic HBV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examines the effects of IONIS-HBVRx or placebo (3:1 randomization) administered subcutaneously to treatment-naïve patients who are chronically infected with HBV and the effects of subsequent nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment on these patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 to 70 years Chronic HBV infection ≥6 months (e.g., positive for serum HBsAg ≥ 6 months) Plasma HBV DNA ≥ 2 x 1000 IU/mL Serum HBsAg ≥ 50 IU/mL Current or prior receipt of antiHBV nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. Patients who have failed prior interferon treatment, greater than 6 months prior to Screening, may be evaluated for possible participation in the study History of liver cirrhosis and/or evidence of cirrhosis as determined by any of the following: 1. Liver biopsy (i.e., Metavir Score F4) within 2 years of Screening, or 2. Fibroscan &gt; 12 KPa, within 12 months of Screening, or 3. ASTtoPlatelet Index (APRI) &gt; 2 and Fibrosure result &gt; 0.7 within 12 months of Screening For patients without a test for cirrhosis in the above timeframes, Fibroscan, or APRI and Fibrosure, may be performed during the screening period to rule out cirrhosis History of liver failure as evidenced by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and/or gastric or esophageal varices History of liver disease other than Hepatitis B Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis D virus (HDV) BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 History of, or suspected presence of vasculitis Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant Currently taking, or took within 3 months of Screening, any immunosuppressing drugs (e.g., prednisone) Diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma as evidenced by screening alphafetoprotein ≥ 200 ng/mL. If the screening alphafetoprotein is ≥ 50 ng/mL and &lt; 200 ng/mL, the absence of liver mass must be documented by imaging within 6 months before randomization Clinicallysignificant abnormalities aside from chronic HBV infection in medical history (e.g., previous acute coronary syndrome within 6 months of Screening, major surgery within 3 months of Screening, uncontrolled diabetes) or physical examination History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy History of extrahepatic disorders possibly related to HBV immune complexes (e.g., glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa) History of excess alcohol consumption within 6 months of Screening History of drug abuse or dependence, or recreational use of drugs: within 3 months of Screening for soft drugs (such as marijuana) and within 1year of Screening for hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP])</criteria>
