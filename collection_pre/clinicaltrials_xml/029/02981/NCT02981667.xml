	<brief_summary>Previous research is equivocal concerning if high intensity interval training is viewed as more aversive versus moderate exercise. Our data in active men and women showed that interval training is viewed as more enjoyable than higher volume moderate exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Higher Enjoyment in Response to High Intensity Interval Training Versus Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve men and women who were habitually active initially performed ramp exercise on a cycle ergometer to assess maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and peak power output (PPO), which was used to determine workload for the subsequent 2 bouts. They returned at least 48 h later at the same time of day to complete high intensity interval training (HIIT consisting of repeated 1 min bouts at 85 %PPO) or moderate intensity continuous training (MICT consisting of 25 min at 40 %PPO). During exercise, heart rate, oxygen uptake, perceived exertion, pleasure:displeasure, and blood lactate concentration were continuously assessed. Ten minutes post-exercise, physical activity enjoyment was measured. Data showed that despite higher oxygen uptake, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and perceived exertion in HIIT, enjoyment was higher in HIIT versus MICT.</detailed_description>
