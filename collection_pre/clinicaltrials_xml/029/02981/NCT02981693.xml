	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of iRoot SP as a root canal sealer in comparison with AH Plus sealer within 1-year follow up.Patients needing root canal treatment were enrolled and allotted into either iRoot SP group or AH Plus arm randomly. After root canal shaping and cleaning, the teeth were obturated according to their arms. Assessment of postoperative pain was done 1 week after root canal obturation using visual analog scale. After 1-year follow-up, clinical and radiographic evaluations were carried out. Statistical analysis at P &lt; 0.05 was conducted to measure difference between the arms.</brief_summary>
