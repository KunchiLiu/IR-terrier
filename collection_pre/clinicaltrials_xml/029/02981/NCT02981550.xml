	<brief_summary>The purpose of this feasibility study is to test a device which analyzes breath and may allow doctors and health professionals to immediately determine if an ill patient has a specific type of bacterial infection. This will allow a health professional to provide immediate targeted antibiotics to properly start treatment without delay.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Community acquired, or hospital acquired [nosocomial] infections [pathogens] are a common cause for morbidity and mortality. Initiation of antibiotic treatment is by best guess or using a broad spectrum antibiotic. The improper administration of antibiotics is known to lead to the developing specter of antibiotic resistant organisms. Certain community acquired bacterial infection such as Streptococcus upper respiratory tract infections carry increased risk of morbidity secondary to risk of developing abscess, glomerulonephritis, and/or rheumatic fever. Commonly, most upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses. However due to the unknown pathogen causing an upper respiratory tract infection, with the risks of potential chronic severe complications from Streptococcus, initial treatment starts with either an antibiotic, or a typical 3day wait for bacterial culture result. Quite often, the wait-and-see approach in the community is not undertaken because of the difficulty in returning for a follow-up appointment. The risk of a developing antibiotic resistant bacteria is well-known and is one of the greatest health threats worldwide leading to longer hospitalizations, higher medical costs and death, according to the World Health Organization. Thus a point of care device which would enable physicians or other medical practitioners to promptly discriminate between Streptococcal or other antibiotic sensitive pathogens versus non antibiotic sensitive viral causes of specific upper respiratory tract infectious pathogens is needed.</detailed_description>
