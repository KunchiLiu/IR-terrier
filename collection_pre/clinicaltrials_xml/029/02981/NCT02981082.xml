	<brief_summary>A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in 34 Systemic Sclerosis-Pulmonary Hypertension (SSc‐PAH) patients. The study will determine safety and the primary outcome variability for DMF in treating SSc‐PAH; the primary outcome of clinical efficacy in this pilot trial will be improvement in 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in 34 Systemic Sclerosis-Pulmonary Hypertension (SSc‐PAH) patients. The study medication will be added to stable background PAH medication(s). Subjects will be dosed for 24 weeks, will undergo examination every 8 weeks, and will be finally evaluated 12 weeks after completion of treatment. Dosage will be twice daily oral doses of 120mg for the first 7 days followed by the maintenance dose of 240mg twice a day.Participation will be for a total of 40 weeks, including a 4-week screening period, 24 weeks of drug, and a safety follow‐up 12 weeks after the last dose. The study will determine the safety and the primary outcome variability for DMF in treating SSc‐PAH; the primary outcome of clinical efficacy in this pilot trial will be improvement in 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD).</detailed_description>
