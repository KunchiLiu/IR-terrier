	<brief_summary>Breast cancer related lymphedema (BRCL) is a common complication following breast cancer treatment. The incidence of BRCL ranges from 6-50%, depending on the surgical procedure in the axilla and the type of the radiation therapy. BRCL can causes cosmetic deformities, impaired physical mobility, mental discomfort, reduced quality of life and erysipelas. Therapy of BRCL is divided into conservative and operative methods. However, all the above method has some shortcomings. It is urgent to investigate new approaches to treat BRCL. In this study, fat grafting is to be used for the treatment of BRCL, and the efficacy and safety of this method will be also assessed.</brief_summary>
