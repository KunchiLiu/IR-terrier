	<brief_summary>This is a prospective biomarker study on prostate cancer patients receiving Radium 223 as standard of care. Participants will take part in this research study because they have chosen Radium 223 treatment for their prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and causing pain. Investigators want to find out if a blood test performed before and after the Radium 223 treatment will help to understand how prostate cancer cells react to this therapy. In this pilot study, researchers want to find out if Radium 223 given as part of standard treatment for prostate cancer can decrease the number of circulating prostate cancer cells. Radium 223 kills prostate cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Other than looking at the changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells before and after Radium 223, researchers would also like to look at the changes in a DNA damage marker, called gamma H2AX, in the circulating prostate cancer cells before and after treatment with Radium 223. Assessing the DNA damage marker gamma H2AX is investigational. It is performed in the same tube of blood that is used for assessing the changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells.</brief_summary>
