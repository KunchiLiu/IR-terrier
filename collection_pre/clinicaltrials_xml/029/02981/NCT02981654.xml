	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, non-comparative study that will be conducted on female subjects between 30 and 75 years of age, diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Following the screening period, including urodynamic assessment to confirm SUI, each subject will undergo three FemiLiftTM treatment sessions, and will be followed up for a period of one year. The main efficacy endpoint in this study is defined as significant improvement (score of 6 or 7) in the urinary incontinence measured with PGI-I score at the 6 months visit. Various subjective and objective measures of incontinence severity, quality of life, sexual function and tissue effects will be performed at follow up.</brief_summary>
