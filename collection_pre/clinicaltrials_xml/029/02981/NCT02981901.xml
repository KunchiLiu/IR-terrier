	<brief_summary>No structured organization for ovarian first line management emerges in France. Management across France seems to depend on regional contexts. Regions display no specific organization or delineate regional network for the ovarian cancer management or report centralized management revolving around referent centers. These different templates present a major problem in identifying differences, costs and benefit. To deal with this issue the Investigators propose a health economic evaluation based on cost-effectiveness analyses, completed with a budget impact analysis. This study will investigate the cost-effective management of patients with initial ovarian cancer using databases representative of different parts of French territories.</brief_summary>
