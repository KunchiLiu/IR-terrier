	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent form; 2. Subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 classification criteria for Takayasu arteritis: 2.1 Age of onset ≤40 years; 2.2 Claudication of upper or lower extremities; 2.3 Decreased pulsation of 1 or both brachial arteries; 2.4 Difference of ≥ 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms; 2.5 Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta; 2.6 Angiography * showing a branch of the aorta stenosis or occlusion; Meeting more than 3 of 6 criteria suggests the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. * Angiography in this study was replaced by vascular magnetic resonance angiography（MRA）or computed tomography angiography（CTA）. 3. Males or females between the ages of 18 and 65 years; 4. All subjects agreed to have no childbearing plan during the clinical trial, and the results of serum or urine pregnancy test for females must be negative; 5. Evidence of disease in active phase during the past 3 months, meeting at least 2 of the following criteria: 5.1 There is a new onset of vascular ischemia ,in accordance with at least one of the following: 5.1.1 newly discovered difference of blood pressure between arms (systolic pulse pressure difference of at least ≥ 10mmHg); 5.1.2 new onset of decreased pulsation of 1 or both brachial arteries; 5.1.3 other new manifestations of vascular ischemia; 5.2 Inflammatory abnormalities, meeting at least one of the following: 5.2.1 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate（ESR） level higher than the normal upper limit（others factors like infection are excluded）; 5.2.2 highsensitivity Creactive protein（hsCRP）≥ 6mg/L or Creactive protein（CRP）&gt; 10mg/L; 5.3 Imaging examinations show abnormalities suggesting that disease is in active phase, meeting at least one of the following: 5.3.1 Vascular wall show enhanced signal on MRA(active inflammation); 5.3.2 enhanced CTA suggests new vascular lesions; 5.3.3 Color Doppler ultrasonography suggests vascular wall inflammation; 5.4 Systemic symptoms that can not be explained by other causes: fever, fatigue or losing weight. 1. Takayasu arteritis which only show lesions of vascular dilatation or aneurysm formation; 2. Takayasu arteritis patients who have undergone surgical procedures, for example, heart valve replacement or renal artery stenting; 3. Subjects with organ failure, meeting at least one of the following: 3.1 Cardiac function: New York Heart Association grade 4; 3.2 Glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60ml/min; 3.3 Liver function： Childpugh grade 2 and worse than grade 2; 3.4 High frequency of amaurosis (flare on 3 consecutive days); 3.5 Acute cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage; 3.6 Blood pressure&gt; 160/100mmHg; 4. Suffer from other autoimmune diseases (eg, ANCAassociated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behcet's disease, etc.) besides Takayasu arteritis; 5. Serious or progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, or other coexisting medical conditions that are not associated with Takayasu's arteries but may result in unacceptable risks; 6. Comorbidities as asthma that may require the use of medium to high doses of glucocorticoids (prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day or equivalent doses of prednisone equivalents) during the study period; 7. subjects with history of malignancy diseases; 8. Subjects with any serious acute or chronic infection; 9. Hepatitis B surface antigen positive or hepatitis B DNA positive; 10. Hepatitis C RNA positive; 11. Subjects who are at risk of tuberculosis, especially with the following conditions: 11.1 clinical or radiological or laboratory evidence of active or occult tuberculosis; 11.2 History of active tuberculosis, even it had been treated; 12. Subjects with abnormal laboratory test results, meeting at least 1 of the following: 12.1 Subjects with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or glutamicoxalacetic transaminase（AST）≥1.5 fold of the normal upper limit; 12.2 Blood white blood cell count ≤4×10^9 / L; 12.3 Platelet count ≤100 × 10^9 / L; 12.4 Hemoglobin ≤100g / L; 12.5 Other laboratory test abnormalities that may contribute to unacceptable risks for participants in this study; 13. Subjects who are allergic to any of the investigational drugs; 14. Use treatments and/or medication that are not allowed in this trial: 14.1 History of leflunomide treatment for at least 3 months but not effective; 14.2 Subjects who have received cyclophosphamide or leflunomide during the last 6 months; 14.3 during the last 3 months, using azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, thalidomide, antimalarials, or any other treatment for Takayasu arteritis, which was not specially permitted in the protocol; 14.4 Use of traditional Chinese medicine or proprietary Chinese medicine during the last 3 months; 14.5 Received biological agents such as rituximab, interleukin（IL）6 receptor antagonists, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors during the last 6 months; 14.6 Subjects who had undergone plasmapheresis or lymphocyte replacement or immunosorbent therapy in the last one year, or those who had planned to receive such treatments; 14.7 Patients who are willing to receive attenuated vaccine during the trial; 14.8 Subjects accepted or planned to have organ transplantation;</criteria>
