	<brief_summary>A comparison of reported estimated blood loss with quantified blood loss in all patients whose medical records indicate Triton was used during their vaginal delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accurate Display of Postpartum Hemorrhage Using Triton (ADOPT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a retrospective blinded cohort trial comprised of two data collection phases. In the first phase data will be collected on all women who had vaginal deliveries between 2010 and 2015 who had a procedure code indicative of transfusion (99.0x) or received a diagnosis suggestive of peripartum hemorrhage (e.g. diagnosis x code 666.xx, 641.x, 645.x, 646.x 674.x). Phase 2 will consist of all women who delivered (vaginally) at HackensackUMC who had blood loss and measured quantitatively by Triton and qualitatively (i.e., EBL) by obstetrician. This will be accomplished by reviewing the records of women who delivered and were discharged within the data collection period.</detailed_description>
