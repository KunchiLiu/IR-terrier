	<brief_summary>Effective treatment options for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with the T315I mutation are few. This study compared overall survival (OS) between CML and Ph+ ALL patients treated with ponatinib versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).</brief_summary>
