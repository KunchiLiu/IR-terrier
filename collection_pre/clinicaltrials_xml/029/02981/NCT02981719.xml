	<brief_title>Clinical Application of IRE Combined With Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irreversible electroporation (Irreversible Electroporation IRE) ablation as a new minimally invasive therapy in inhibiting tumor growth, improve survival rate and achieved remarkable results, and chemotherapy as traditional treatment methods,at the same time with adjuvant chemotherapy in ablation of irreversible electroporation can improve chemotherapy perforation area to the spread of cancer cells in reversibility, and has selectivity to tumor cells, avoiding normal tissue damage. The combination of the two aims to improve the quality of life and prolong the survival time. The aim of this study was to observe the survival status, recurrence and death time of patients with pancreatic cancer treated by chemotherapy combined with IRE. The survival and overall survival of the patients were evaluated respectively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Radiologic confirmation of unresectable pancreatic cancer by at least CT of chest and abdomen Screening must be performed no longer than 2 weeks prior to study inclusion Maximum tumor diameter ≤ 5 cm Histological or cytological confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; Age ≥ 18 years ASAclassification 0 3 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to definite inclusion; Hemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol/L Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100*109/l Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min Prothrombin time or INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN Activated partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.25 x ULN (therapeutic anticoagulation therapy is allowed if this treatment can be interrupted as judged by the treating physician) Written informed consent Resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma as discussed by our multidisciplinary hepatobiliary team Successful down staging after (radio)chemotherapy from previous unresectable/borderline tumor to resectable tumor History of epilepsy History of cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt;NYHA class 2 Active Coronary Artery Disease (defined as myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening) Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy or pacemaker (beta blockers for antihypertensive regimen are permitted) Uncontrolled hypertension. Blood pressure must be ≤160/95 mmHg at the time of screening on a stable antihypertensive regimen Compromised liver function (e.g. signs of portal hypertension, INR &gt; 1,5 without use of anticoagulants, ascites) Uncontrolled infections (&gt; grade 2 NCICTC version 3.0) Pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start of treatment Immunotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure Chemotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure Radiotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure Concomitant use of anticonvulsive and antiarrhythmic drugs (other than beta blockers used for antihypertensive) Allergy to contrast media Any implanted stimulation device Any implanted metal stent/device within the area of ablation that cannot be removed Any condition that is unstable or that could jeopardize the safety of the subject and their compliance in the study; Of note, patients with contraindications for MRI will not be excluded from participation: in this case radiologic followup will consist of CTscanning according to protocol.</criteria>
