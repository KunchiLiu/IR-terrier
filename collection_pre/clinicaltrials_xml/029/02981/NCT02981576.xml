	<brief_summary>Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that leads to permanent functional and neurological deficits in injured individuals. The limited ability of the Central Nervous System (CNS) to spontaneously regenerate impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery of the spinal cord. The leading causes are motor-vehicle crashes, sports-associated accidents, falls, and violence-related injuries. Unfortunately, there is still no effective clinical treatment for SCI. In recent years, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine based approaches have been proposed as alternatives for SCI repair/regeneration. Mesnchymal stem cells (MSC) use in SCI showed promising results in several studies. Our aim is to assess and compare the safety and effectiveness of autologous BM-MSC vs autologous AT-MSC in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of BM-MSC vs AT-MSC in the Treatment of SCI Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted at Cell Therapy Center (CTC) in Jordan, where 14 SCI patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited and blindly divided into 2 groups of equal numbers. The first groups will be treated with autologous BM-MSC, while the second group will be treated with autologous AT-MSC. The outcomes and improvements will be assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be performed at base line and after 12 months of the stem cell transplantation.</detailed_description>
