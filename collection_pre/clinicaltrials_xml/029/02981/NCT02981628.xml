	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating younger patients with CD22 positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Immunotoxins, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, are antibodies linked to a toxic substance and may help find cancer cells that express CD22 and kill them without harming normal cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD22 Positive B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the morphologic response rate (complete response [CR] + complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) following one cycle of treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) in children with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the CR/CRi rate following 2 cycles of InO therapy. II. To determine the safety of single agent InO administered at the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) to pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B-ALL. III. To determine the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry in responding patients. IV. To determine the incidence, severity, and outcomes of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) of the liver in patients during InO therapy and following subsequent treatment, including myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). V. To estimate the 3-year event-free survival (EFS), 3-year overall survival (OS), and among responders duration of CR/CRi for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL treated with InO. OUTLINE: Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 4 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have BALL with &gt;= 5% (M2 or M3) bone marrow blasts with or without extramedullary disease Leukemic blasts must demonstrate surface expression of CD22 at the time of relapse by local/institutional flow cytometry of a bone marrow aspirate sample; (assessment of CD22 using a phycoerythrin [PE] fluorophore is strongly recommended) In the case of an inadequate aspirate sample (dry tap), flow cytometry of peripheral blood specimen may be substituted if the patient has at least 1000/uL circulating blasts; alternatively, CD22 expression may be documented by immunohistochemistry of a bone marrow biopsy specimen Patient must have one of the following: Second or greater relapse; Primary refractory disease with at least 2 prior induction attempts; First or greater relapse refractory to at least one prior reinduction attempt Relapsed patients previously diagnosed with Blymphoblastic lymphoma are eligible if they have an M2 or M3 marrow at the time of enrollment on this study Patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)+ ALL must have had two prior therapy attempts including two different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer therapy, defined as resolution of all such toxicities to =&lt; grade 2 or lower per the inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to entering this study Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients who relapse while receiving standard maintenance therapy will not be required to have a waiting period prior to enrollment onto this study; otherwise, at least 14 days must have elapsed since the completion of cytotoxic therapy, with the exceptions of hydroxyurea or corticosteroids used for cytoreduction Intrathecal cytotoxic therapy: No waiting period is required for patients having received intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and/or hydrocortisone; intrathecal chemotherapy given at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for relapse prior to study enrollment is allowed At least 7 days must have elapsed since the completion of therapy with a growth factor; at least 14 days must have elapsed after receiving pegfilgrastim At least 7 days must have elapsed since completion of therapy with a biologic agent; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period prior to enrollment must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur At least 3 halflives must have elapsed since prior therapy that included a monoclonal antibody with the exception of blinatumomab; patients must have been off blinatumomab infusion for at least 7 days and all drug related toxicity must have resolved to grade 2 or lower as outlined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria &gt;= 2 weeks must have elapsed since local palliative radiation therapy (XRT) (small port); &gt;= 3 months must have elapsed if prior cranial or craniospinal XRT was received, if &gt;= 50% of the pelvis was irradiated, or if totalbody irradiation (TBI) was received; &gt;= 6 weeks must have elapsed if other substantial bone marrow irradiation was given At least 90 days must have elapsed since stem cell transplant; patient must have had no more than one previous HSCT and currently have no evidence of active graft versus (vs.) host disease (GVHD) At least 42 days must have elapsed since chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, or 2;
