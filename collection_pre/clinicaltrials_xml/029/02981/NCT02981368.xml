	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Subjects provide signed informed consent and confirm that they are able and willing to comply with all protocol requirements. Cohort A Only: At least high risk prostate cancer defined by NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2016 (clinical stage ≥T3a or PSA &gt;20 ng/mL or Gleason score ≥8). Scheduled or planned radical prostatectomy with PLND. Cohort B Only: Radiologic evidence of local recurrence or new or progressive metastatic disease demonstrated on anatomical imaging (CT, MRI, or ultrasound), wholebody bone scan (99mTcMDP or Na18F) within 4 weeks of enrollment. If prior treatment with radiation or ablative therapy, evidence of recurrence outside the confines of prior treated site(s) is needed. Scheduled or planned percutaneous biopsy of at least one amenable lesion. 1. Subjects administered any radioisotope within five physical halflives or any IV Xray contrast medium within 24 hours or any high density oral contrast medium (oral water contrast is acceptable) within 5 days prior to study drug injection. 2. Subjects with any medical condition or other circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives, or completion. Cohort A Only: Patients with prior androgen deprivation therapy or any investigational neoadjuvant agent or intervention Cohort B Only: Prior radiation or ablative therapy to intended site of biopsy Initiation of new therapy for recurrent and/or progressive metastatic disease since radiographic documentation of recurrence/progression.</criteria>
