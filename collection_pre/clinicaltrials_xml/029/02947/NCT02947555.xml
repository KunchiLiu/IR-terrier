	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Risk Assesment in Diabetic Patients Via Lens Autofluorecscence Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate of lens autofluorescensce is associated with the accumulation of advanced glication endproducts (AGE).The concetration of AGE increases with age but is also higher in diabetic patients. There is evidence that diabetes could be diagnosed via the detection of lens autofluorescence. The investigators are planning a cross sectional clinical trial to evaluate if the rate of lens autofluorescence could be associated with the clinical appearance of atherosclerotic vascular diseases in diabetic/non-diabetic patients and in patients who already had atherosclerotic vascular events and patients without previous atherosclerotic events. The cardiovascular and metabolic histoty of patients will be evaluated using a questionaire. Antropometrical data, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose metabolism, serum lipid profile, CRP, serum creatinine (eGFR) will be assased. ClearPath DS-120 biomicroscopical optical system (Freedom Meditech, San Diego, CA, USA) will be used for the measurment of lens autofluorescence. The measurement will be performed on one eye. Data of the different patient groups will be compared using ANOVA, a value of p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.</detailed_description>
