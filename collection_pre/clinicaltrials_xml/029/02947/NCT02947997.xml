	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of a redesigned tethered capsule catheter that contains an integrated micro-motor. Investigators will be testing imaging of this new technology in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study for Imaging of the Esophagus Using Tethered Capsule OCT Endomicroscopy With Distal Scanning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 healthy volunteers will be enrolled and asked to swallow the Distal Scanning Capsule. The subjects will be awake and un-sedated. The capsule is attached to a string like tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis. As the capsule progresses through the esophagus, multiple images of the esophagus are acquired in real time to be analyzed later.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must be over the age of 18 Subjects must be able to give informed consent Subjects must have no solid food for 4 hours prior to the procedure, and only clear liquids for 2 hours prior to the procedure. Subjects with the inability to swallow pills and capsules. Esophageal fistula and/or esophageal strictures with a stricture diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the capsule. Subjects who have a bleeding disorder and are currently on anticoagulants.</criteria>
