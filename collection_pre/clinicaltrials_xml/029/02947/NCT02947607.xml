	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the investigation of new host-microbiome interactions promoting adenoma formation and adenocarcinoma progression. For that purpose, the investigators will collect saliva, stool and colon biopsy specimens from patients referred to colonoscopy or surgical resection of colorectal tumor. Besides, a questionnaire about diet, lifestyle and medical history will be collected. Sample analysis will involve simultaneous characterization of host and microbiota genomic and transcriptomic components.</brief_summary>
