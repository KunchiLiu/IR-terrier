	<brief_summary>This blinded end point RCT will recruit high risk TIA and mild stroke patients (through the emergency TIA clinics and the acute stroke services at the Norfolk &amp; Norwich University Hospital) who require anti-hypertensive therapy to examine the clinical and cost effectiveness of self-monitoring and self management of Blood Pressure compared to self monitoring alone and treatment as usual.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Self-monitoring and Treatment of Blood Pressure Following Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question: In patients with a mild/moderate stroke or TIA who require drug treatment for BP control, does BP self-monitoring with or without patient-led management using a previously agreed treatment regime result in better BP control and patient satisfaction than standard GP based management? Planned sample size: 165 eligible participants distributed 1:1:1 between three groups. Group 1 (control) - treatment as usual (TAU). Group 2 - Self-monitoring only (Se-MO). Group 3 - Self-monitoring and self-management (Se-Man). Primary outcome: Number reaching target Ambulatory BP levels at follow-up and change in mean Ambulatory BP levels between baseline and follow-up at 6 months. Secondary outcomes: Number of changes in anti-hypertensive treatment during study Side-effects profiles and adverse events BP variability Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) changes All cause and cause-specific mortality outcome at six month Recurrent TIA or stroke Incident CVD- stroke, TIA and myocardial infarction Costs Health related quality of life assessed Quality Adjusted Life Years (EQ-5D based) Patient satisfaction and experience of the process (qualitative data)</detailed_description>
