	<brief_title>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Enhances Islet Autograft Survival in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to assess whether infusion of Prolastin-C during peri-transplant period can enhance islet autograft survival and function in chronic pancreatitis patients who have total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation. This is a prospective, controlled, double-blind study. The primary endpoint will be area under the curve for the serum C-peptide level during the first 4 hours of an mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), normalized by the number of islet equivalents (IEQ)/kg at day 365Â±14 after the transplant.</detailed_description>
