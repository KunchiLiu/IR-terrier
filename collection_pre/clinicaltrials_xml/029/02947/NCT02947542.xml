	<brief_summary>There is no evidence from prospective randomized clinical trials regarding the performance of conventional versus one-catheter-strategy for invasive coronary angiography over the radial access. The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the one-catheter concept with use of the BLK and Tiger catheter compared to the standard Judkins catheter in diagnostic coronary angiography via transradial access. Patients with stable angina pectoris will be randomly assigned to coronary angiography performed with the BLK, Tiger and Judkins catheter. The primary endpoint is coronary angiography duration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Different Diagnostic Coronary Catheters Over the Radial Access - the UDDC - Radial Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one-catheter concept using the BLK (Terumo, Somerset, USA) or the Tiger catheter (Terumo, Somerset, USA) compared to the standard Judkins catheters in diagnostic coronary angiography by the transradial access. Patients with stable angina pectoris will be randomly assigned to coronary angiography performed with the BLK (Group I), Tiger (Group II) or Judkins catheters (Group III). Primary endpoint is the time duration (min) that is necessary to perform complete coronary angiography including 6 different projections for the left-coronary system and 3 different projections of the right-coronary-system. Secondary endpoints will cover safety and imaging quality of the different catheter systems.</detailed_description>
