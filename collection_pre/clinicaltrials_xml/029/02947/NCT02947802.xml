	<brief_summary>This is an online survey assessing consumer support for different labeling policies related to sugar sweetened beverages. The investigators will present consumers with three labels that are being considered for sugar sweetened beverages: a calorie label, a text warning label that says "Warning drinking beverages with added sugar(s) can lead to health problems like obesity, diabetes and tooth decay" and a graphic warning label that includes graphic images to correspond with each of the health problems listed with the text warning. The investigators will ask participants their support for each label. The investigators will also see if support for the labels change after learning of the effectiveness of these labels. The investigators will share the results of a recent field study that suggested calorie and textual warning labels had no influence on the purchasing of sugar sweetened beverages while the graphic label decreased purchasing by 11 percent.</brief_summary>
