	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that alternating DBS parameters on a weekly basis will prevent tolerance to stimulation and thus waning of benefit, compared with non-alternating stimulation. The primary endpoint will be preserved tremor control with the alternating group compared with standard treatment using the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS). Key secondary endpoints will be preserved activities of daily living measures as well as preserved tremor control as quantified by motion sensor data. This study has one primary aim: To determine if alternating DBS stimulation parameters on a weekly basis will be superior at preserving tremor control compared with usual stimulation (non-alternating stimulation) in ET patients with VIM DBS.</brief_summary>

Patients with the following IPG types: Activa PC, SC or RC 1. Atypical tremor disorder including but not limited to tremor due to multiple sclerosis, medicationinduced tremor, Parkinson's disease or parkinsonian syndrome 2. DBS placement complicated by infection, hemorrhage or stroke 3. Previous thalamotomy (either stereotactic, gamma knife or focused ultrasound) or previous DBS surgery resulting in explantation and reimplantation 4. Known incorrect or poor lead placement 5. Inability to change group settings on a weekly basis at least 75% of the time 6. Inability to tolerate 12week period without additional programming changes, including voltage stimulation adjustment 7.
