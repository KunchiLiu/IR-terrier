	<brief_summary>Cure rate os pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) after gold-standard-treatment adenotonsillectomy is 50-80 %. Treatment alternatives are scarce, poorly effective and based up on low scientific evidence. This means one out of five patients will remain exposed to the well-known neurocognitive, behavioral and quality of live adverse effects of disease. Rapid Maxillary Expansion, an orthopaedic-orthodontic treatment of pediatric malocclusion, has recently shown promising results in the treatment of pediatric OSAS based upon its effect on craniofacial and upper airway growth, usually limited in this patients. The investigators propose a randomized, prospective, controlled trial in patients with Pediatric OSAS non-responding to adenotonsillectomy. The aim of the study is to enhance the treatment success rate avoiding morbimortality associated to disease persistence during childhood and development during adult life.</brief_summary>
