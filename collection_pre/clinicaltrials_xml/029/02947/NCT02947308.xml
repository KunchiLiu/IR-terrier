	<brief_title>A Study Examining Adolescents With Non-Suicidal Self-Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to study brain development in 12-14 year old females with a history of NSSI. Assessments will take place over the course of three years, with three visits per year - a total of nine visits. The first visit will take place at the Ambulatory Research Center (ARC) at the Fairview Riverside hospital complex. This visit will include a number of questionnaires designed to gather information about the participant's physical and psychological health. Additionally, measures of intelligence quotient (IQ) and demographics will be assessed. The second visit will again take place at the ARC. For this visit, participants will be asked to partake in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in which they prepare a short, five-minute speech and deliver the speech to an audience with an additional task to follow. The TSST will be videotaped. Following the completion of this task, the participant will complete computer tests in order to measure things like attention and memory. During the second visit, five saliva samples will be collected to measure levels of the hormone Cortisol. The participant will need to collect additional saliva samples at home. The third visit will take place at the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) and will involve a brain MRI. Before the MRI the participant will be asked to provide a urine sample and complete a drug and pregnancy test. During the MRI, the participant will be asked to lie quietly in the scanner. The participant will do activities such as resting, listening to music, and playing games using a button box while in the scanner. The participant will need to come in to complete these assessments twice more at one and two years following the completion of the first set of visits - a total of nine visits overall.</detailed_description>
