	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been used widely for the reduction of post operative blood loss for various orthopaedic procedures including but not limited to total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. A recent multihospital meta-analysis conducted in 2013 showed that patients who received TXA showed a significant reduction in post-operative transfusion (20.1% to 7.7%). The procedures we will be evaluating are the intramedullary nail for intertrochanteric fracture and hip hemiarthroplasty. These procedures are similar to the total hip or knee replacement in that they can result in significant blood loss that requires a post operative transfusion. STUDY PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of TXA to decrease the rate of post-operative transfusion for acute hip fractures repaired with the following two methods, intramedullary nailing for intertrochanteric fracture and hemiarthroplasty. METHODS: The model for the study is a prospective randomized control trial. Patients will be placed in one of two arms of the study after passing our inclusion criteria. The arms will be for either the intramedullary nailing for intertrochanteric fracture or for hemiarthroplasty. These two categories will be subdivided into those receiving TXA and those not receiving TXA. The patients in each category will have standard post-operative care and laboratory testing. We will record the patients in either arm of the study, whether it be no TXA or TXA, who require post-operative transfusion within 1 week of the operation.</brief_summary>
