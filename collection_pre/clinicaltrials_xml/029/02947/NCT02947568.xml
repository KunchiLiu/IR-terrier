	<brief_title>Genetical Background of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in Diabetes Mellitus and in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multisystemic disease, also affecting extrahepatic organs (1,2,6). According to former data, not only the prevalence of chronic hepatic disease, chronic cardiovascular diseases, but also the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is higher in NAFLD (4,7). A strong association has been shown between diabetes mellitus (DM) and NAFLD as well (3,5,10). Many genetical factors have been studied in the background of NAFLD. Many studies have proved the effect of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 gene (PNPLA3) (8,9). Effect of numerous genetical polymorphisms has been suggested behind oxidative stress responsible for NAFLD (8).</detailed_description>
