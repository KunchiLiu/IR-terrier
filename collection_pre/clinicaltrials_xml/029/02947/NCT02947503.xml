	<brief_summary>One approach to prevent the rising burden of diabetes is to address the issue of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM has a growing prevalence up to 5-10% (and even higher in specific subgroups), with a pregnant population becoming older and more obese worldwide. GDM increases the risks of complications during pregnancy, at delivery and on the longer term, like type 2 diabetes (T2D) and persistent obesity, in mother and child. Moreover, insulin added to diet as the standard care for GDM has disadvantages for mother (maintenance of hyperinsulinaemia, increasing weight and blood pressure) and child (macrosomia, hypoglycaemia) with related adverse pregnancy outcomes. Metformin, as an insulin sensitizer targeting the cause of GDM, may have essential benefits, as suggested by observational studies. However, RCTs with metformin (early positioned in the treatment of GDM) are still lacking. The POEM study is the first Randomized controlled trial (RCT) in GDM to test the hypothesis that metformin, early given from the start of the diagnosis GDM, on top of diet and lifestyle improves clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes in mother and child during pregnancy, at delivery and on the longer term - up to 20 years after birth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pregnancy Outcomes: Effects of Metformin Study (POEM Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The POEM study was designed to investigate the effects of metformin on top of diet and lifestyle (with insulin rescue if needed) in GDM on eight clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes at delivery, summarized by means of an integrated, newly developed score, the GDM Outcome Score (GOS), and on other relevant outcomes on the longer term in mother and child. The investigators hypothesize that metformin given to women with GDM from the start of the diagnosis reduces risks resulting in relevant health benefits for mother and child during pregnancy, at delivery, and many years thereafter. The POEM study is a randomized controlled intervention study, consisting of three phases: - Phase A - from inclusion until two weeks after delivery; intervention study with and without exposure of metformin in mother and (unborn) child: two arms after randomization with 1:1 allocation to Diet + Lifestyle + Metformin (DLM) or Diet + Lifestyle (DL); - Phase B - from two weeks until 1 year after delivery; intervention study with exposure of DLM vs DL in mother; - Phase C - from 1 until 20 years after delivery; observational extension study of mother and child without study medication.</detailed_description>
