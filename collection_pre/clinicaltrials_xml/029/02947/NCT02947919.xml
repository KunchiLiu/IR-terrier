	<brief_summary>Preoperative anxiety and stress are present in up to 60% of pediatric patients undergoing surgery, having a great physiological and emotional impact on children in both the short and long term. There are many reports on the use of music therapy in the perioperative period as a complementary technique in the preoperative stress and anxiety management. However, there are no assessments of the effect of this intervention on the physiological variables, such as salivary cortisol.</brief_summary>
