	<brief_title>Trial of Aganirsen in iCRVO Patients at Risk of Developing NVG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The STRONG Study is a phase II/III prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-masked, three-armed multi-centre study of aganirsen antisense oligonucleotide, a topical treatment for iCRVO intended to prevent Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG). The study will evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of aganirsen formulated in an eye emulsion in avoiding new vessel formation by blocking the Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS)-1. Eligible patients will be treated with aganirsen or placebo for a period of 24 weeks. They will also be invited to participate in sub-studies working on the analysis of gonioscopic images, detection of biomarkers for neovascular glaucoma and risk factors for ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrolment to the trial: Male or female ≥ 18 years IOP in the study eye ≤ 21mmHg Primary ischaemic CRVO or conversion to ischaemic CRVO in the study eye for no longer than 4 weeks Bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) ETDRS letter score &lt; 35 (&lt; 20/200 Snellen equivalent) in the study eye ≥ 10disc area of retinal capillary obliteration on fluorescein fundus angiography in the study eye (central fundus: macular area as defined by the optic disc and the arcades, an approximate 6000 micron circle around the fovea) and/or large, confluent retinal haemorrhages in the study eye Must be accompanied by 4 or more out of 6 following criteria: A relative afferent pupillary defect (with a normal fellow eye) ≥ 10 cottonwoolspots in the study eye Venous tortuosity in the study eye Peripheral visual field defects corresponding to ischaemia (Goldmann perimeter or other semiautomatic kinetic methods) in the study eye Engorged vessels on iris and/or in the chamber angle in the study eye Detectable anterior chamber flare in the study eye Subjects presenting 1 or more of the following criteria will not be enrolled in the trial: Ocular conditions with a poorer prognosis in the fellow eye than in the study eye Primary or secondary glaucoma in the study eye Prior or concomitant ocular treatment with antiVEGF in the study eye (ranibizumab/bevacizumab is not allowed within the last 45 days, aflibercept within the last 90 days) before screening visit Use of antiVEGF treatment in the fellow eye during the trial Previous use of intraocular corticosteroids at any time or use of periocular corticosteroids in the study eye within 90 days prior to screening visit History of idiopathic or autoimmune uveitis in either eye Presence of NVD, NVE or anterior segment neovascularisation (NVA or NVI) in the study eye Previous PRP in the study eye Intraocular surgery (other than intravitreal antiVEGF treatment) or laser treatment in the study eye within the past 90 days before screening visit Patients with a history of breast cancer</criteria>
