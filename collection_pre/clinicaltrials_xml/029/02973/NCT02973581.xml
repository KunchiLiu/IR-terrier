	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized trial is to assess the efficacy of SPI-directed analgesia for vitreoretineal surgery, presence of PONV and oculocardiac reflex and compare Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) with Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) for monitoring pain perception postoperatively. Patients received general anaestesia alone or combined with either preemptive analgesia using topical solution of 0,5% proxymetacaine or peribulbar block (0,5% bupivacaine with 2% lidokaine) or preemptive intravenous infusion of 1,0 g of metamizol or preemptive intravenous infusion of acetaminophen in a doseof 10-15mg/kg of body weight.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Monitoring depth of anaesthesia using spectral entropy (SE) and quality of neuromuscular block are routine in modern anaesthesia, whereas monitoring of analgesia still requires further studies. Recently, the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) was added as a surrogate variable showing the nociception-antinociception balance into abovementioned parametres constituting a novel approach in monitoring patients intraoperatively, known as adequacy of anaesthesia (AoA) or tailor-made anaesthesia.</detailed_description>
