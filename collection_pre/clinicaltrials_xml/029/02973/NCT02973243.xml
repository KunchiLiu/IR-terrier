	<brief_title>The Vital Signs to Identify, Target, and Assess Level (VITAL) Care Study III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The frequency of EWS scores, number of automated notifications and serious events performed on a general ward is contingent on the quality and frequency of vital signs measurement like respiratory rate. This is due to the EWS escalation schemes of hospitals with an acute intervention team. Obtained sub-score trigger levels of vital signs contribute to higher and more frequent scoring. We examine the influence of different respiration rate sensor concepts and measurements on scoring (NEWS and CREWS) and workflow in a typical UK gastroenterology and respiratory ward.</detailed_description>
