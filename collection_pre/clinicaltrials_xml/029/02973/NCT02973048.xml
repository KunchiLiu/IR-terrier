	<brief_summary>Over the past 15 years, cesarean delivery is most commonly performed under spinal anesthesia using hyperbaric bupivacaine which provides an adequate sensory and motor block. Despite effective surgical anesthesia, bupivacaine is associated with long duration motor block and dose-dependent maternal hypotension potentially harmful for the fetus. Prilocaine with its new 2% hyperbaric formulation (HP), developed recently, showed rapid onset of action and faster regression of motor block compared to other local anesthetics without noteworthy side-effects when used intrathecally. The aim of this randomized, multicenter, powered clinical trial is to investigate whether HP may be an efficient alternative to hyperbaric bupivacaine for scheduled caesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
