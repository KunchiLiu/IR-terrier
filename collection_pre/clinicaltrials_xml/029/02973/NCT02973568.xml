	<brief_summary>Today, pain is a difficult affordable subject in Spain. There are however 187 units of pain care with a consultations rate in emergency center of more than 60%.For example OXYCODONE(opioid analgesic)is widely used while it's under used in Spain. In the same way MEOPA(Kalinox) is a new approach of pain care daily used as well in France (for example in dislocated shoulder pain, or ulceration care...etc) There are lots of studies relative to chronic pain but not too much about acute pain in Spain.That's why we want to focus our study on evaluation of acute pain treatment and efficacy in french and spanish hospital</brief_summary>
