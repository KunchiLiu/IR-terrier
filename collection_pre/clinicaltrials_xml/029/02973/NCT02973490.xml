	<brief_title>Transanal Tube Drainage in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection of the Colorectal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a technique for endoscopic tissue resection that enables endoscopists to control the depth and direction of diathermic knife incisions.Recently, the number of reports in which ESD has been successfully used to treat colorectal tumors has increased. But the complatios with colorectal ESD were higher than esophagus and stomach ESD.We design the clincal trial to investigate the efficacy of transanal tube drainage in colorectal ESD.</detailed_description>
