	<brief_summary>The Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) is a bariatric surgery procedure performed by laparoscopic booming in recent years. This is an effective intervention on weight loss over the long term with few early postoperative complications and low morbidity in the long term. Obesity is considered as a risk factor for hernia full after surgery by laparoscopy with a relative risk of 29% in connection with cholecystectomy. Several series showed a rupture rate on trocar from 0 to 0.7%, but each time with a clinical evaluation. Recently, it was shown eventrations rate between 26 and 38% under the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a rupture rate increased on epigastric trocar. The assessment in the context of this series was ultrasound. Recent data suggest that the absence of closure of the epigastric trocar of 12mm through an SG of first intention was associated with a hernia rate of 17% with a scannographic evaluation. Also, recently, Tabone suggests that the systematic closure of the epigastric trocar site would not be as effective as lateralize inserting the trocar from the white line of the abdomen. Change the positioning of this trocar induce an additional difficulty in handling instruments for the realization of the SG with an désaxassion instruments, a conflict between the instruments for the realization of the SG and the optical laparoscopy.</brief_summary>
