	<detailed_description>Design: randomized, single blind, controlled trial. The main goal of this study is to compare the exercise tolerance in COPD patients after an 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation program using High Flow Nasal Cannula or The Venturi Mask. The exercise tolerance will be measured in seconds in a Constant Load Treadmill Test (CTLT).</detailed_description>
