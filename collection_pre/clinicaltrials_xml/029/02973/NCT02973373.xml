	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the benefit on image quality of MRI of the chest performed under high frequency non-invasive ventilation. This technique indeed allows to generate an apnea duration of several minutes with acquisitions performed at full inspiration. This study will be applied on healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI of the Chest Under High Frequency Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High frequency ventilation (HF-V) has been applied by using a non-invasive interface allowing to obtain a prolonged apnea in awaken subjects. Such an application should be of interest for MRI taking into account its susceptibility to motion of the chest and the imperfect techniques of respiratory gating that are usually performed at end expiration. The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit on image quality of different sequences performed with and without the device in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
