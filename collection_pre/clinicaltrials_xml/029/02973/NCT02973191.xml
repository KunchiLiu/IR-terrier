Adequate central or peripheral vascular access for leukapheresis procedure. For subjects requiring central venous catheter (CVC) placement, a surgical consultation indicating subject eligibility for CVC placement is sufficient for enrollment. 10. Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for usage in other individuals without recipient knowledge about exposure to a genetically modified organ by the donor and having been informed about the potential risks associated with it at any point after receiving JCAR015 infusion. 11. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP1) must: a. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator (one negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (ßhCG) pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to the first dose of cytoreductive chemotherapy (Part A screening evaluation), and one negative serum or urine pregnancy test at the Part B screening evaluation prior to first JCAR015 infusion). She must agree to have another pregnancy test 90 days post final JCAR015 dose. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence2 from heterosexual contact. b. Either commit to true abstinence2 from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception methods must include 1 highly effective and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception from at least 28 days prior to JCAR015 initial infusion and during the study therapy including dose interruptions. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.
