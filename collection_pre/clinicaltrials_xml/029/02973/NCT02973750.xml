	<brief_summary>While significant progress has been made in the treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer, this progress has mostly shown benefits for younger women. This study aims to understand two things: How body composition (the amount of muscle and water versus fat in in the body) affects the dose and side effects of chemotherapy; and the biological reason for the worse prognosis with aging. To get a good view of these effects, investigators are asking the help of both younger and older women for this project.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must have one of the following: a) Histological or cytological diagnosis of highgrade serous ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer, stage III or IV; b) In the opinion of investigator, highly suspicious stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer (histologically confirmed nonserous ovarian, fallopian, and peritoneal cancers will be considered screening failures). At least one biopsiable lesion by CT/US or laparoscopy. Have not received previous treatment for ovarian cancer. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;3 (Karnofsky &gt;60%). Must have adequate organ and marrow function. Deemed eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel and surgery by their oncologist. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Active second malignancy within last 2 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinomas. Prior treatment for ovarian cancer. Potential participants with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to carboplatin and paclitaxel. Known allergy to carboplatin, paclitaxel, or cremophor. Uncontrolled concomitant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Women who are pregnant. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with carboplatin and paclitaxel or other agents administered during the study.</criteria>
