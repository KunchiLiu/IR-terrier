	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to increase the efficiency of exposure in virtual reality (VR). Based on the EMDR research the investigators would like to show that the implementation of eye movements during the VR exposure results in a faster physiological relaxation response among probands with spider phobia, which has a positive effect on the subjective and behavioral efficacy of the VR exposure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The VR paradigm consists of one room with a spider in it. The proband is supposed to look at it for a few minutes. This exposure is repeated several times. In the experimental group a ball appears during the exposure, that moves horizontally across the room. The probands are supposed to follow this movement with their eyes. EDA, EKG and respiration are being recorded. Furthermore the subjective and behavioral spider phobia is measured before, during and after the exposure to determine occurring changes.</detailed_description>
