	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the efficacy of the ResAppDx software application in diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory conditions (bronchiolitis, asthma, croup, upper or lower respiratory tract infections) in infants and children. Patient's cough sounds will be recorded using a smartphone and analysed using the ResAppDx software. The ResAppDx diagnosis will be compared to radiologic diagnosis and/or clinical diagnosis. The ResAppDx diagnosis will not be provided to the clinician or patient.</brief_summary>
