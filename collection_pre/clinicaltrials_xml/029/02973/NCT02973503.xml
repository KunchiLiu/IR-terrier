	<brief_summary>A Phase 3, Global, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Efficacy of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir Fixed-Dose Combination for 8 Weeks in Treatment-Naïve, HCV GT1b-Infected Patients, with non-severe fibrosis The primary objectives of this study are as follows: - To evaluate the efficacy of of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir Fixed-Dose Combination for 8 Weeks in Treatment-Naïve, HCV GT1b-Infected Patients, with non- severe fibrosis as measured by the proportion of subjects with sustained viral response 12 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR 12). - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of EBV/GZR treatment The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: - To determine the proportion of subjects who attain SVR at 4 and 24 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR4 and SVR24) - To evaluate the proportion of subjects with virologic failure - To evaluate the kinetics of circulating HCV RNA during treatment and after cessation of treatment. - To evaluate the emergence of viral resistance to EBV/GZR during treatment and after cessation of treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seventy treatment-naïve subjects with chronic HCV GT1b infection without cirrhosis will be enrolled. There will be one treatment group with EBV/GZR (50/100 mg) once daily without regards to food for 8 weeks. EBV/GZR is manufactured as a 50/100 mg tablet for oral administration. Subjects will take 1 tablet daily without regards to food. Screening assessments will be completed within 28 days of the Day 1 visit. The screening window can be extended to 42 days for subjects requiring a liver biopsy, or extenuating circumstances. All subjects will complete the following study visits: Screening, Day 1, and on-treatment visits at the end of week 2, week 4 and week 8. Posttreatment visits will occur at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 after last dose of study drug. All subjects will complete the posttreatment Week 4 and 12 visits. Subjects who achieve SVR12 (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at posttreatment Week12) will complete the posttreatment Week 24 visit. Screening assessments will include physical examination, medical history, height, weight, vital signs, adverse events related to screening procedures, concomitant medications, safety laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, and coagulation), HCV RNA, serology (HCV, HBV), serology and/or antigen testing for HIV, HCV genotyping, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), assessment of the absence of cirrhosis or severe fibrosis (including Fibrotest® and Fibroscan®), serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) (females of child-bearing potential only), urinalysis. On-treatment assessments include adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, study medication dispensation and pill count, physical examination, weight, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, HCV RNA, and urine pregnancy tests (females of child bearing potential only). Posttreatment assessments include Aes, concomitant medications, vital signs, safety laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, and coagulation), HCV RNA, and urine pregnancy tests (females of child-bearing potential only).</detailed_description>

Females of childbearing potential (as defined in protocol Appendix 4) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 prior to enrollment Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use 2 effective method(s) of contraception from at least two weeks prior to Day 1 through 14 days after the last dose of study drugs. If acceptable by local regulatory agencies, methods of birth control allowed in the study are: intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide, hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pills, transdermal patch, or injectables), contraceptive sponge, female condom, male condom with spermicide or vasectomy. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g., abstinence only on certain calendar days, abstinence only during ovulation period, use of symptothermal methods, use of postovulation methods and withdrawal) are not acceptable methods of contraception. A female subject who is not of reproductive potential is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A female subjects who is not of reproductive potentials is defined as one who has either 1) reached natural menopause (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause), 2) 6 weeks post surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, or 3) bilateral tubal ligation. A male subject who is not of reproductive potential is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A male subject who is not of reproductive potential is defined as: one who has undergone a successful vasectomy. A successful vasectomy is defined as: (1) microscopic documentation of azoospermia, or (2) a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity post vasectomy. Lactating females must agree to discontinue nursing before starting study drug Subject must be of generally good health, with the exception of chronic HCV infection, as determined by the Investigator Subject must be able to comply with the dosing instructions for study drug administration and able to complete the study schedule of assessments Is under the age of legal consent, is mentally or legally incapacitated, has significant emotional problems at the time of prestudy screening visit or expected during the conduct of the study or has a history of a clinically significant psychiatric disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study procedures.
