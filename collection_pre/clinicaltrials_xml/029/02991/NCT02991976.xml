	<brief_summary>This study evaluates effects of high inspiratory oxygen on cerebral tissue oxygenation and patient recovery after carotid endarterectomy. Two group of patient undergoing to carotid with total intravenous anaesthesia will receive either 35% inspired oxygen or 100% oxygen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxygen Concentration and Recovery After Carotid Endarterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High inspired oxygen concentration may reduce brain hypoxia in the patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with total intravenous anaesthesia. However, there are some studies suggesting that high inspired oxygen concentration may induce cerebral vasoconstriction. This study was performed to measure the influence of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) on the regional tissue oxygenation in the patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with total intravenous anaesthesia. The INVOS 5100B monitor was used for regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) measurement from operative and nonoperative side, and INVOS Analytics Tool (Covidien) for area under curve (AUC) calculations. A bispectral index and invasive blood pressure monitoring were used in all patients.</detailed_description>
