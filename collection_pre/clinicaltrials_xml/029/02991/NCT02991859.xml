	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover, escalating repeat dose study, aiming to investigate whether higher potency of different inhaled corticosteroid confers an improvement in the topical efficacy to systemic activity ratio in asthmatic subjects. It will compare the dose response for topical efficacy via airway responsiveness (to adenosine-5'-monophosphate [AMP] challenge), and the dose response for systemic activity via 24 hour plasma cortisol suppression, and thereby compare the relative therapeutic index, for the following inhaled corticosteroids: fluticasone furoate (FF), fluticasone propionate (FP) and budesonide (BUD). There will be a screening visit 7-28 days before the first dose of study treatment, and a minimum 4-day run-in period before the first dose of study treatment. Subjects will be randomized to one of 12 treatment sequences, and will have two treatment periods, each comprising 5 consecutive 7-day phases of escalating doses of either FF, FP, BUD or placebo. There will be a 25- to 42-day washout period between treatment periods. The study duration for each subject will be approximately 22 weeks including the follow-up period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must be 18 to 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed Consent. Documented history of bronchial asthma, first diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the screening visit and being treated only with intermittent shortacting beta2agonist therapy by inhalation Prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt;=65% of predicted at screening; the predose baseline FEV1 should be +/15% of the screening baseline value and &gt;=65% predicted for the subject to continue Documented sensitivity to AMP with a provocative concentration of AMP resulting in a fall of &gt;=20% FEV1 with a PC20 AMP &lt;=80 mg/mL at the screening visit Demonstrated stable bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled AMP at the runin visit. The runin PC20 to be within 1.25 doubling concentration of the screening PC20. Current therapy could include shortacting Beta2agonists (SABA) prescribed SABA for at least 12 weeks prior to screening, if needed; no ICS, Longacting beta2agonist (LABA), longacting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) therapy for three months prior to the start of the study; and no biological therapies for at least 6 months prior to start of the study. Bodyweight &gt;=50 Kilogram (kg) and BMI within the range 18.035.0 kg/meter (m)^2 (inclusive) Male and female. Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [HCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies prior to randomization: Nonreproductive potential defined as premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of reproductive potential from 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and until at least five terminal halflives after the last dose of study drug. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use methods of contraception. Aspartate aminotransferase and Alanine transaminase &lt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin â‰¤1.5 x ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) Having provided written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. A history of lifethreatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures within the last 5 years. Other significant pulmonary diseases to include (but not limited to) severe pneumonia within 6 months of the screening visit, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma. Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear within 4 weeks of screening that: In the opinion of the investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study. A subject will not be eligible if he/she has clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at screening. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12 weeks of screening or that resulted in overnight hospitalization requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months prior to randomization. Use of prohibited medications including, antidepressant drugs, and antiasthma drugs (other than short acting inhaled betaagonists supplied as rescue medication, oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, stable doses of antihistamines, and paracetamol) for 1 week prior to screening and throughout the course of the study. Antihistamines should be withheld 4 days prior to AMP challenge; subjects must also be able to abstain from short acting inhaled betaagonists, for 8 hours prior to spirometry. Subjects undergoing desensitization therapy Current smokers or a smoking history of &gt;=10 pack years. A subject must not have used any inhaled tobacco products in the 12 month period preceding the screening visit. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 21 units per week for men and 14 units per week for females (1 unit =5 ounces [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of spirits) within 6 months of screening. All subjects who are currently or in the last month have worked nightshifts are excluded from the study Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day or received an investigational product within 30 days of study start, or 5 halflives of study drug if that is longer. A subject has any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the study results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study. (e.g. stroke or myocardial infarction within 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.) Evidence of cancer or history of cancer in the past 5 years other than adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix.

Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of FF, FP or BUD (i.e., lactose or magnesium stearate) Historical Allergy defined as history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Significant abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. The mean of the three individual ECGs will be taken. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt;450 millisecond (msec) for males or QTc&gt;470 msec for female subjects and &gt;480 in subjects with bundle branch block.
