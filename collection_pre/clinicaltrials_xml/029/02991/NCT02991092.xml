	<brief_title>The Influence of Different Fluid Therapy Measures on the Postoperative Outcome in Fast Track of Colon Cancer.ï¼ˆFTSlapCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients that were diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma by the First Hospital of Jilin University and were scheduled to undergo the laparoscopic surgery were prospectively included and divided into the experimental group and the control group with the random number method. After surgery, patients in the experiment group were provided with intravenous fluid administration at 1.0ml/Kg/h and encouraged to take food and drink water early after surgery, and the intravenous fluid administration was stopped immediately when the oral intake was more than 1500ml/h; patients in the control group strictly followed the fasting and were provided with the intravenous fluid administration according to "Total amount of fluid = physiological requirement + additional loss (fever + gastrointestinal decompression) + amount lost" until their intestinal function completely recovered. The blood volume change indicators (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, oxyhemoglobin saturation, inferior vena cava diameter /body surface area (VCD), intra-abdominal pressure, specific gravity of urine, BNP, etc.) and inflammation indicators (CRP, IL-6, TNF-a) of the two groups of patients were observed and a comparison was made of the recovery time of intestinal function, incidence of complications, hospitalization time after operation and hospitalization expenses of the two groups.</detailed_description>
