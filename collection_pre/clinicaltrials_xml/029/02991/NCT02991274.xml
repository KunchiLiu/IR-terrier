	<brief_title>ARTEMIS DIANE T790M (An Amino Acid Substitution at Position 790 in EGFR, From a Threonine (T) to a Methionine (M)) Mutation at Hospital Laboratories in Comparison With Central Laboratory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, real world study. 800 patients from 80 different hospital sites will have local T790M testing by different molecular testing platforms and have central testing by Cobas platform. These two sets of data (local T790M testing and central T790M testing) will be analysed and compared to assess the concordance of these T790M testing platforms.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 2. Histological or cytological confirmed locally advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy. 3. Documented EGFR mutation positive (at any time since the initial diagnosis of NSCLC) known to be associated with EGFR TKI (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) sensitivity. 4. Patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an EGFRTKI agent. 5. Patients who consent to provide tumour tissue and blood. 1. Previous (within 6 months) or current treatment with AZD9291. 2. Patients who disagree to participate this study. 3. Patients whose medical objection was recorded to use the existing data from medical practice for scientific research.</criteria>
