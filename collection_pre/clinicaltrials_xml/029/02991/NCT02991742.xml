	<brief_title>Ioxaglate Versus Iodixanol for the Prevention of Contrast-induced Nephropathy in High-risk Patients (IDPC Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury represents a serious complication of procedures requiring administration of iodinated contrast media and is associated with the need for dialysis, prolonged hospitalization, increased costs, and mortality. Contrast-induced nephropathy is defined as an increase of 25% in serum creatinine before the procedure. Iodixanol, a nonionic, dimeric, iso-osmolar contrast medium may be less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast media in high-risk patients. The purpose of this study is to compare iodixanol versus ioxaglate in high risk patients between 48 and 96 hours after procedures that use contrast.</detailed_description>
