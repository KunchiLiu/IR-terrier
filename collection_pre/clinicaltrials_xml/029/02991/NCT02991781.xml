	<brief_title>Combined Bio- and Neuro- Feedback vs. Varenicline Use for Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will develop and experimentally test the efficiency of a neurofeedback(NF) training protocol for smoking cessation. As non-pharmacological, non-invasive and painless brainwave technique, NF contributes to teach individuals how they can take the control of their mind through operant conditioning. NF regulates brain function in natural way. Studies have reported an 80% rate of reducing or eliminating the need for traditional medication14. Therefore, other nicotine substitutes (such as varenicline) which may carry their own toxicity risk factor may become redundant. The protocol will include 5 bio- and 25 Neuro-feedback sessions, lasting approximately 36 months. The electrophysiological evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention will include EEG resting state and a multifeature Mismatch Negativity (MMN) evoked response measurements before and after the participation of human volunteers. These data will be analyzed in terms of cortical activation patterns and cortical connectivity. Questionnaires will be used to collect behavioral and psychometric data regarding smoking related behaviors. Additionally, a clinical evaluation including spirometry, exhaled carbon monoxide, total antioxidant capacity, vitamine E, and cotinine will be conducted. The data will be collected prior, during, after the completion of the study and after a one-year follow up. The Neurofeedback intervention will be compared to a different group of participants that will follow an intervention based on varenicline use for approximately 3 months. The electrophysiological evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention will include EEG resting state and a sleep polysomnography measurement. Questionnaires and clinical evaluation include the same measurements as the neurofeedback intervention but only in 3 time points: prior, during, after the completion of the study.</detailed_description>
