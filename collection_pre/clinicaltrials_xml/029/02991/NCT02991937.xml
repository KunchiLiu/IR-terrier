	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial of 190 subjects comparing non-operative management with antibiotics to surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The hypothesis is that antibiotics are not worse than surgery for the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis in children. The primary outcome will be survey scores on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scale Parent-proxy report. Secondary outcomes will include child scores on the PedsQL; length of stay; immediate, 1-week, 2-week, 30-day, and 60-day success of non-operative management; readmission rates for both groups; and long-term complications over one year.</brief_summary>
