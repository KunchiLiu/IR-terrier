	<brief_summary>This study will compare the CMAC and Glidescope videolaryngoscopes (VL) to traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL) using either a Miller or Macintosh laryngoscope by studying the performance of users. This will involve the use of an intubating pediatric manikin to assess various aspects of endotracheal intubation by experienced and inexperienced users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VL vs DL in Inexperienced Users: a Pediatric Manikin Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The commonly used method for endotracheal intubation in children is direct laryngoscopy using a Miller or Macintosh blade. Videolaryngoscopy is a widely accepted pediatric airway management. Videolaryngoscopes (VL) provide an indirect view of glottis without the need to align the oral, pharyngeal, and glottis structures. Some types of VLs provide also direct view of glottis with indirect view. Videolaryngoscopes can be used as a teaching tool for learners as they can visualize all the anatomical structures of larynx at the same time with the performer. VLs may facilitate the learning of endotracheal intubation in inexperienced users in the pediatric population. There are limited data on the use of videolaryngoscopes by anesthesia providers and medical personnel who are inexperienced in the use of videolaryngoscopes.</detailed_description>
