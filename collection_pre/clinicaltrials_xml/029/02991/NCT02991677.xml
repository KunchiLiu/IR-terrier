	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) continues to be a serious healthcare concern. It is painful, persistent, resistant to conventional pain therapies, and results in long-term suffering and decreased quality of life for many cancer survivors. The role of exercise to decrease CIPN-related neuropathic pain (CIPN-NP) will be investigated, with the goal of identifying the mechanisms associated with this therapeutic approach to manage CIPN-NP.</brief_summary>
