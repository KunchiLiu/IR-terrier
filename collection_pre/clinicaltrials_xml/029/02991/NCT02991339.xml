	<brief_title>The Effects of Dexamethasone Administration on Jaundice Following Liver Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative jaundice is one of the most common complications after hepatectomy for various liver tumors. Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone, were widely used to treat jaundice in the patients with severe hepatitis, liver dysfunction or liver failure. It was reported that glucocorticoids decrease the rates of liver dysfunction or mortality in those patients. However, whether post-operative glucocorticoids administration alleviated jaundice or deceased the rates of post-hepatectomy liver failure (PLF) yet to be determined. In this study, the investigators were aiming to evaluate whether dexamethasone administration accelerates the recovery from hepatectomy-related jaundice and decreases the rates of PLF and its safety in the subjects who developed elevated serum TB.</detailed_description>
