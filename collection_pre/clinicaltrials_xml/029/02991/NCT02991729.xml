	<brief_title>Use of a Novel Computerized Decision Aid for Prenatal Aneuploidy Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>184 women will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to use of a novel computerized iPad-based decision aid in addition to routine counseling or routine counseling only during a single study visit. This decision aid was developed at a 10th grade literacy level using input from Maternal Fetal Medicine physicians and certified genetic counselors, and piloted by 20 English and Spanish speaking women of varying education levels. Following completion of genetic counseling, participants will complete several surveys assessing knowledge and decision conflict. Data will be abstracted regarding demographics, screening and diagnostic testing uptake, and testing results.</detailed_description>
