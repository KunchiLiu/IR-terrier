	<brief_title>Safety and Dose-Finding Study of DTX301 (scAAV8OTC) in Adults With Late-Onset OTC Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, single arm, multicenter, safety and dose finding study of DTX301 in adults with late-onset OTC deficiency. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of single IV doses of DTX301. A key secondary objective of the study is to identify the optimal biological dose (OBD) of DTX301. Eligible subjects will receive a single IV infusion of DTX301. Dose escalation will be conducted according to a model that uses the collected data to predict the safety profile of the dose in order to determine the OBD. The decision to proceed to the next dose cohort will be made after the data monitoring committee (DMC) has evaluated the safety data for all subjects in a dosing cohort. Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks after dosing. After completion of this study, subjects will be asked to enroll in a 4-year extension study to evaluate the long term (a total of 5 years) safety and efficacy of DTX301.</detailed_description>
