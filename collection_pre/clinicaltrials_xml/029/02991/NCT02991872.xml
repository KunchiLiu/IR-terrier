	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term persistence of immune responses approximately 5 years or more after simulated rabies post-exposure prophylaxis provided in 2012 according to Essen (1-1-1-1-1) or Zagreb (2-1-1) intramuscular (IM) regimens in the subset of subjects who participated in the parent study (V49_24 [NCT01680016]) who were aged ≥6 and ≤17 years at the time of enrollment. This study is aimed to respond to a post-marketing commitment by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) requested at the time of the renewal of the purified chicken-embryo cell rabies vaccine license in China, granted in August 2015.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects with age ≥ 6 and ≤17 at the time of enrollment in the parent study who signed the informed consent prior to the extension study entry, who received the full PEP in the parent study according to either the Zagreb or Essen intramuscular regimens. 2. Subjects who or whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s) have voluntarily given written informed consent/assent for this extension study after the nature of the study has been explained according to local regulatory requirements, prior to study entry. 3. Individuals who can comply with study procedures. Prior to extension study entry, each subject must not have: 1. Documented medical history of exposure to rabies or rabies prophylaxis after completion of the parent study (V49_24 [NCT01680016]) and before study start. 2. Participated in the parent study (V49_24 [NCT01680016]) but not received the full PEP vaccination course (or received it out of window) following assignment to either Zagreb or Essen regimen during the parent study. 3. Progressive, unstable or uncontrolled clinical conditions. 4. Clinical conditions representing a contraindication to blood draws. 5. Abnormal function of the immune system resulting from: 1. Clinical conditions. 2. Systemic administration of corticosteroids for more than 14 consecutive days within 90 days prior to informed consent for all age groups. 3. Administration of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy within 90 days prior to informed consent for all age groups. 6. Received immunoglobulins or any blood products within 180 days prior to informed consent for all age groups. 7. Study personnel as an immediate family or household member. 8. Any other clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose additional risk to the subject due to participation in the study.</criteria>
