	<brief_summary>This research study aims to improve the standard exam called Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST). The FAST exam is an ultrasound test used to identify an abdominal bleed. The study will see if having patients roll on their right side improves the FAST exam. Making the FAST exam better can help trauma doctors save the lives of patients with bleeding.</brief_summary>
