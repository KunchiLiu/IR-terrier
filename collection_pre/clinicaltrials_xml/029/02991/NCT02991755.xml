	<brief_title>Use of 5-0 Prolene Versus 5-0 Fast Absorbing Gut During Cutaneous Wound Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 5-0 prolene during repair of linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure with 5-0 fast absorbing gut (both SOC). The investigators will use a split wound model, where half of the wound is treated with 5-0 prolene and the other half is repaired with 5-0 fast absorbing gut. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument (research procedure). The scar width and adverse events will be recorded.</detailed_description>
