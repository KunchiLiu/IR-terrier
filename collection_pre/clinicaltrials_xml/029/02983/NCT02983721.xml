	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the feasibility, success and safety of Transradial approach (TRA) verses Transfemoral approach (TFA) for diagnostic and therapeutic coronary angiography and coronary interventions, in terms of procedural time, access time, fluoroscopy time, procedural failure, , length of hospital stay in terms of days in hospital, Complications in terms of thrombophlebitis, hematoma, ecchymosis, infections thrombosis of vessel, MACE, Stroke and others.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trans Radial Versus Transfemoral Route for Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: PCI has been done traditionally through transfemoral route. But now transradial and transbrachial routes are also coming up in practice. We compared transradial versus transfemoral routes for ease of operability, time for procedure, complications, and failure rates through a prospective study. Methods: 400 Patients admitted in department of cardiology for percutaneous interventions were enrolled in the study. 200 patients were assigned to each group randomly. A single team did all the procedures. Pre procedure, intra procedure and post procedure data of all the patients was collected, tabulated and analysed properly. The variables studied include Access time ,Fluoroscopy time and overall procedure time, post procedure complications( ecchymosis ,Thrombophelibites, Hematoma, procedure access bleed), Failure rates,post procedure myocardial infarction, stroke, acute renal failure and infections.</detailed_description>
