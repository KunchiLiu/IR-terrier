	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of G1T38 as an oral therapy in combination with fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The study is an open-label design, consists of 2 parts: dose-finding portion (Part 1), and expansion portion (Part 2). Both parts include 3 study phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Survival Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first dose with study treatment and completes at the Post-Treatment Visit. Approximately, 102 patients will be enrolled in the study.</brief_summary>
