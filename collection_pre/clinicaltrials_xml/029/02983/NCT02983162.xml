	<brief_summary>Rationale: Retrospectively reviewing the participants of the GODDAF database, revealed a significant association between the weighted genetic risk score and Dupuytren disease recurrence. However, a significant dose-response relation was not found. This might be caused by underestimating the recurrence rate, due to the retrospective nature of determining recurrence. Therefore, we want to do a follow-up measurement of the GODDAF participants, to see whether they suffered from recurrent disease. Objective: We aim to determine whether the wGRS is associated with recurrent DD. Study design: An observational study, in which the participants of the GODDAF study are followed up. Study population: Patients affected by Dupuytren disease, aged 18-96 years, who were previously included in another study on the genetic basis of Dupuytren disease. Intervention (if applicable): NA Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the presence of recurrent Dupuytren disease.</brief_summary>
