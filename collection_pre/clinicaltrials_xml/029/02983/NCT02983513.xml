	<brief_summary>Preterm infants, during their stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), face a period of stressful environment, which may negatively impact early brain development and subsequent neurobehavioral outcomes. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of training parents in reducing stressful experiences early in life and in enhancing brain development and long term developmental outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Intervention in Preterm Infants: Short and Long Term Developmental Outcome After a Parental Training Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very preterm birth is associated with motor, cognitive and behavioral problems. Micro-structural brain abnormalities, even in the absence of focal lesions, have been documented by neuroimaging studies in preterm infants at term corrected age and later in childhood. These alterations in brain maturation occurring during the neonatal period may be implicated in long-term neurobehavioral disorders later experienced by preterm babies. However, there is increasing evidence that also negative environmental factors (intensive care, excessive sensory stimulation, paucity of parental contact etc.) can affect later outcomes. Potential benefits of early dyadic interaction and preterm baby massage in reducing the effects of the NICU stressor environment have been demonstrated. More recently, few studies have investigated visual function in preterm infants focusing on the potential role of early visual interaction to enhance attention and improve later neurodevelopment. The role of early intervention strategies to improve neurodevelopment has been recently emphasized. Early intervention programs based on the concept of "individualized care" have proved to be effective in promoting brain maturation and neurodevelopmental outcome. In this context, early interventions as the Mother Infant Transaction Program (MITP) and the Premie Start, both targeting parenting, have the greatest potential to have sustained effects on child development. In addition, recent studies have shown that exposure to stressful events in the neonatal period can cause epigenetic modifications in children born preterm; in particular alteration of serotonergic tone was observed, associated with methylation of the serotonin transporter gene, which could be implicated in the etiology of behavioral disorders observed in these children. In animal models these epigenetic effects appear to be influenced by maternal care that can epigenetically modulate the offsprings' stress response.</detailed_description>
