	<brief_summary>Purpose: Patients with peripheral lung nodules require evaluation for lung cancer. Our aim is to assess the diagnostic yield of a new technique, transbronchial cryobiopsies, in patients at risk for lung cancer. Target population: Patients referred for bronchoscopy and lung biopsies as a part of their work up for peripheral lung lesions. Procedures: Patients enrolled will have forceps transbronchial biopsies followed by transbronchial cryobiopsies for their lung lesion during bronchoscopy.</brief_summary>
