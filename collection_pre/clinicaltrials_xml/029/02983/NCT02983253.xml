	<brief_summary>Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an inherited multisystemic disorder. Literature suggests that HHT is often associated with higher frequency of infectious diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a variety of immunologic parameters in the blood serum of HHT patients in comparison to probands.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an inherited multisystemic disorder with recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Literature and the investigators' observation suggest that HHT is often associated with higher frequency of infectious diseases. This might be a hint for a immunocompromised situation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a variety of immunologic parameters in the blood serum of HHT patients in comparison to probands.</detailed_description>
