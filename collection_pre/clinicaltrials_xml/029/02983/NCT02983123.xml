	<brief_summary>This study evaluates if the 1-hour rule-in/rule-out algorithm for a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is safe and effective in patients with a lower pretest probability of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). During this study troponins will be collected at 0-, 1- and 4/6-hours, where absolute changes in the values will decide whether the patient need hospitalization or not. Can the time interval to the second troponin test be reduced by using an 1-hour high-sensitivity assay?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many patients seek Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient Clinic (OAEOC) with chest pain. The majority of these patients have symptoms suggestive of a benign non-cardiac chest pain. These patients do not need a directly transfer to the hospital, but can be admitted to the Observation Unit at the OAEOC for further pre-hospital testing, including serial troponins for a safe rule-out of acute MI. The main goal of this study is to change the current routine at the Observation Unit at OAEOC by introducing the 1-hour algorithm for hs-cTnT for a faster rule-in/rule-out of acute MI. All recruited patients will have serial troponins tested after 0, 1- and 4/6 hours, with the main hypothesis that the absolute changes within 1 hour can be used as surrogates for the changes and conclusions drawn after 4/6 hours. The cutoff levels used within the 0/1-hour algorithm are assay specific as specified in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of acute NSTEMI.</detailed_description>
