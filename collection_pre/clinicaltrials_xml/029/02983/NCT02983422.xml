	<brief_title>Effects of Aminophylline on Renal Function and Urine Volume of AKI Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden perturbation of kidney function that is frequently associated with high morbidity and mortality rates . A diagnostic time limit of 48 hours was recently introduced to ensure early diagnosis, management and prevention of progression to irreversible renal function loss . Furthermore, early AKI biomarkers that can ensure prompt diagnosis have been identified. When these biomarkers become widely available to clinical practice, informed therapeutic interventions capable of aborting disease progression, morbidity and mortality multiplication can be applied . In the injured kidney, adenosine is released endogenously from the macula densa causing vasoconstriction of the renal afferent arterioles via the adenosine A1receptor as well as vasodilatation of the renal efferent arterioles via the adenosine A2 receptor; thereby reducing the renal blood flow and glomerular perfusion pressure leading to ischemic kidney injury . One measure that has been tried with the objective of achieving better AKI outcome is the use of aminophylline (an ethylenediamine coupled theophylline) . Aminophylline is converted to theophylline in the human body, which in turn vasodilates the renal afferent arterioles through competitive inhibition of adenosine on the adenosine A1 receptor. Aminophylline and theophylline, methylxanthine nonselective adenosine receptor antagonists, have been effective in the management of AKI in certain clinical scenarios including heart failure, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and perinatal asphyxia. In the kidney, adenosine constricts the afferent arteriole and decreases glomerular blood flow; adenosine receptor blockade mitigates this vasoconstriction. Aminophylline also inhibits phosphodiesterase at higher concentrations, which leads to increased urine output. Eligible subjects included all patients more than 18 years old with acute kidney injury in ICU. To ensure the safest oversight for the duration of the study drug infusion, the investigators only approached patients for consent if participants' ICU stay would likely be at least 72 hours . Patients were recruited in the preoperative clinic or in the inpatient ward/ICU; the nature of the consent process for this interventional drug trial necessitated that all procedures were elective or scheduled. Because aminophylline has been associated with tachycardia and seizures at high serum levels, and its metabolism may be affected by liver or thyroid dysfunction and sepsis, the investigators selected the following exclusion criteria: history of tachyarrhythmias, seizures, coagulopathy (international normalized ratio &gt; 1.5 while not taking warfarin),or hypothyroidism. Study investigators or research nurses recruited participants; written, informed consent was signed by each patient or guardian. The treatment group received aminophylline 5 mg/kg IV load over 30 minutes, followed by 0.5 mg/kg IV every hour, for 72 hours .The control group received placebo bolus followed by IV infusions of normal saline (0.9%) every hour (matched by volume and appearance to the treatment group), for 72 hours.</detailed_description>
