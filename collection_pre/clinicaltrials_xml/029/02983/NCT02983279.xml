	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine that sort term calorie restriction will affect tumor biology in biopsy proven breast, endometrial or prostate cancers, which will positively impact biomarkers including miR-21, an onco-miR known to impact cancer outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caloric Restriction Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Endometrial, Prostate, or Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1) Investigate if caloric restriction will change serum micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) 21 (miR-21) expression in patients with prostate, endometrial or breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1. Investigate measurable changes induced by caloric restriction on both patient (host) and tumor characteristics from caloric restriction. 2. . Vital signs including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be monitored at baseline, midway, and at conclusion of the diet. 3. Investigate the adherence of the patient to the diet. 4. Weight, vital signs, and body composition will be obtained at baseline, midway through the diet, and at the conclusion of the diet. 5. Patients will have psycho-social evaluation using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) test (prostate cancer), FACT-Breast (B) test (breast cancer), or the FACT-Endometrial Cancer (En) test (endometrial cancer) and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) cancer fatigue short form at baseline, midway through diet, and at the conclusion of the diet. 6. Patient's nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment [MNA] form) will be assessed, and their caloric needs will be calculated. 7. Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant metastases and overall survival will be assessed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histological documentation of cancer of the endometrium, prostate or breast. 2. Candidate for definitive cancer surgery as determined by treating physician 3. The ability for the definitive cancer surgery to be scheduled within 412 weeks post initiation of dietary intervention as determined by the enrolling physician (not from diagnosis but from start of diet). 4. No other malignancy within the past 6 months unless it was a nonmelanomatous skin lesion 5. BMI â‰¥21 6. ECOG Performance Status of 2 or less 7. Patient must not be on antiretrovirals since they may alter patient metabolism 1. Patient is not a candidate for definitive cancer surgery 2. Definitive cancer surgery can not be performed within 412 weeks post study enrollment as determined by the enrolling physician. 3. Body Mass Index &lt; 21 4. Another malignancy within the past 6 months that was not a nonmelanomatous skin lesion 5. ECOG Performance Status &gt;2 6. Patient on antiretrovirals since they may alter patient metabolism</criteria>
