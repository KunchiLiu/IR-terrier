	<brief_summary>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used in premature infants to maintain lungs open and facilitate gas exchange. When ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch is present, areas of the lung that are open for gas exchange do not match up with the areas of the lung that are receiving blood for gas exchange. This study measure the responsiveness of V/Q mismatch to changes in the amount (or level) of CPAP.</brief_summary>
