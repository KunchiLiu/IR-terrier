	<brief_summary>This study is to determine first, the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 when administered in combination with nivolumab, and then, the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of combining NKTR-214 with nivolumab in select patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Both drugs target the immune system and may act synergistically to promote anti-cancer effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of CD122-Biased Cytokine (NKTR-214) in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Antibody (Nivolumab) in Patients With Select Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NKTR-214 is a cytokine (investigational agent) that is designed to target CD122, a protein which is found on certain immune cells (known as CD8+ T Cells and Natural Killer Cells) to expand these cells to promote their anti-tumor effects. Nivolumab is a full human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called PD-1 on immune cells and promotes anti-tumor effects. Approximately 40 eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study (Phase 1) will be assigned to one of five dose regimens of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab (0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 days with 240 mg nivolumab every 14 days, 0.003 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 14 days with 240 mg nivolumab every 14 days, 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 14 days with 240 mg nivolumab every 14 days, 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 days with 360 mg nivolumab every 21 days, 0.003 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 days with 360 mg nivolumab every 21 days). Based on safety, tolerability and efficacy observed in the trial, enrollment to additional dose escalation cohorts are planned. The first phase of the study will test the safety and efficacy profile of the combination and determine which dose will be studied in Phase 2 of the overall study. During Phase 2, cohorts of patients with specific cancers will be expanded and these patients will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur. The efficacy of the combination will be assessed using objective response rate (ORR). Exploratory immunological biomarkers in plasma and tumor samples will evaluate immune activation.</detailed_description>
