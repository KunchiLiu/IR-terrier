	<brief_summary>80 patients eligible for a total hip replacement (THR) mainly due to primary osteoarthritis were recruited from our waiting list. The patients were randomized to either CFP or Corail stem, both groups received Delta cup from Lima. Randomisation was done using envelopes. Patients could only participate with one hip. We are evaluating patients with different questionnaires, radiographs and RSA analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Study Comparing CFP and Corail Stem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept of femoral neck preserving hip replacement is intended for the young and active patients. By preserving proximal bone load, the transmission to the proximal femur is supposed to improve and future revision surgery would be facilitated. We speculated that a more conservative resection of the femoral neck could lead to better clinical outcomes compared to a conventional stem. We therefore decided to compare the clinical outcomes and the fixation between a short stem and a stem with a classic, conventional design. 83 patients were included in our randomized controlled trial where patients either received a Collum Femoris Preserving (CFP) stem or a Corail hip stem. Clinical outcomes are being assessed, plain radiographs are studied and the early migration is being measured using radiostereometric analysis. All of the patients have gone through 1 year follow-up. We are waiting for the 2 years data to conduct the final analysis and present the results.</detailed_description>
