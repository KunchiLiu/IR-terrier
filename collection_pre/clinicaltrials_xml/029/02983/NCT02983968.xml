	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the second most common cause of cancer death in the world, estimated responsible for nearly 745,000 deaths in 2012 (9.1% of all cancer deaths). This cancer is closely associated with the presence of chronic liver underlying disease and early diagnosis following a systematic surveillance of cirrhotic patients could improve disease-free survival in patients declaring HCC. However, the risk-benefit ratio of such monitoring is discussed. Nevertheless, it is recommended in patients with liver cirrhosis, from which the prevalence is estimated between 0.3% and 0.6% in the French population. This debate can lead to a failure to comply with recommendations and promote a large variability in the management of the surveillance of HCC in patients with cirrhosis in practice. Data acquisition regarding the current situation in France is required. The objective of this project is to use this database to document current practices concerning monitoring of incidents HCC in cirrhotic patients in France. A retrospective cohort study will be conducted on data from SNIIRAM recorded between 2007 and 2015. The primary analysis will focus on multivariate modelling of the deviation rate from the recommendations (advising the realisation of at least two echodoppler ultrasonographies yearly) with a competitive risk model, taking into account gender, social status, Charlson index, age at baseline, the alcoholic etiology of cirrhosis, type of facility and the yearly number of visits to a hepatologist during follow-up. It is estimated that more than 86,000 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 years will be included in the analysis</brief_summary>
