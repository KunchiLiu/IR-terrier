	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the Phase 1b Dose Escalation part of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of GS-5829 in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant in women with advanced estrogen receptor positive Her2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if not already determined) or the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of this study. The primary objectives of the Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion portion of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of GS-5829 in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant compared to exemestane or fulvestrant alone in women with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with evidence of metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent and who have progressed during treatment with at least one prior hormonal therapy. Note: In referring to prior hormonal therapy; targeted therapies, such as palbociclib and/or everolimus or investigative targeted therapies which were administered as part of a prior hormonal therapy regimen are allowed after the washout period has been reached. Phase 1b Dose Escalation Individuals may have had unlimited prior hormonal therapy and a total of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens (adjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 regimen). Individuals may have progressed on fulvestrant or exemestane as a single agent Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion Individuals may have had unlimited prior hormonal therapy, only one adjuvant chemotherapy is permitted (no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease is allowed). Individuals enrolling in Group 1 must be exemestane naïve and individuals enrolling in Group 2 must be fulvestrant naïve. If an individual is naive to both exemestane and fulvestrant, it is the investigator's decision for which Group to enroll Documentation of ER positive (≥ 1% positive stained cells by local standards) based on the most recent tumor biopsy, unless boneonly disease Documented HER2negative tumor based on local testing on most recent tumor biopsy (immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or negative by in situ hybridization HER2/CP17 ratio &lt; 2 or for single probe assessment HER2 copy number &lt; 4) Postmenopausal individuals considered to be in the postmenopausal state as defined by one of the following: Age ≥ 60 years Age &lt; 60 years and cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and serum estradiol and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level within the postmenopausal range Prior bilateral oophorectomy Pre/perimenopausal women can be enrolled if amenable to be treated with the luteinizinghormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, goserelin. Individuals must have commenced treatment with goserelin or an alternative LHRH agonist at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. If individuals have received an alternative LHRH agonist prior to study entry, they must switch to goserelin on or before Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) for the duration of the study Measurable disease defined per RECIST v. 1.1, or boneonly disease must have a lytic or mixed lytic blastic lesion that can be accurately assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individuals with boneonly disease and blasticonly metastases are not eligible All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy resolved to Grade ≤ 1 before the start of study drug dosing (with the exception of alopecia [Grade 1 or 2 permitted] and neurotoxicity [Grade 1 or 2 permitted]) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 1 Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator Adequate organ function defined as follows: Hematologic: Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (without platelet transfusion or any granulocytic growth factors within previous 7 days of the hematologic laboratory values obtained at screening visit) Hepatic: aspartate transaminase (AST) / alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if liver metastases are present, ≤ 5 x ULN); total or conjugated bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Renal: Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 mL/min as calculated by the CockroftGault method Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.2 Negative serum pregnancy test Females of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of contraception as described in the study protocol Females who are nursing must agree to discontinue nursing before the first dose of GS5829 Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study Key History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or the Gilead medical monitor would pose a risk to individual safety or interfere with the study evaluations, procedures, or completion Known brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, active uncontrolled infection, active or chronic bleeding event within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements as judged by treating physician Myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification &gt; Class II), unstable angina, or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia within the last 6 months of C1D1 Major surgery, defined as any surgical procedure that involves general anesthesia and a significant incision (i.e., larger than what is required for placement of central venous access, percutaneous feeding tube) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of GS5829, including any unresolved nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that is Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade &gt; 1 Minor surgical procedure(s) within 7 days of enrollment or randomization, or not yet recovered from prior surgery (placement of central venous access device, fine needle aspiration, or endoscopic biliary stent ≥ 1 day before enrollment or randomization is acceptable) History of a concurrent or second malignancy, except for: adequately treated local basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; cervical carcinoma in situ; superficial bladder cancer; adequately treated Stage 1 or 2 cancer currently in complete remission; any other cancer that has been in complete remission for ≥ 5 years Antitumor therapy (chemotherapy, chemoradiation, radiation, molecular targeted therapy) within 21 days or 5 halflives whichever is longer, of study drug dosing (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, or molecular agents with t1/2 &gt; 10 days); 5 halflives of any investigational drug; concurrent use of goserelin for pre/perimenopausal breast cancer and exemestane or fulvestrant per the protocol are permitted History of long QT syndrome or whose corrected QT interval (QTc) measured (Fridericia method) at screening is prolonged (&gt; 470 ms).
