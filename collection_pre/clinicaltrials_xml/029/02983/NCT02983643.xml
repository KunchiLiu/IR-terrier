	<brief_summary>Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) and Visceral Adipose Ratio (VAR) assess body composition changes and disclose malnutrition risk effectively. The aims of the study are to assess prevalence of malnutrition in patients planned for SCT, to characterize changes in body composition (SMI, total adipose tissue and VAR) that occur in the peri transplantation phase, and to identify Waist Circumference (WC) cut off points associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) in patients with B and T cell Lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a retrospective cohort study of patients having B and T cell lymphoma, who underwent SCT in the Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) unit at AUBMC. Consecutive patients having B and T lymphoma who underwent SCT at AUBMC will be identified by the research team and will be included as per the below inclusion and exclusion criteria. Starting from June 2016, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the study up until June 2006. The radiologist will access the AUBMC PACS system to review PET/CT scans of the identified patients. SMI, visceral, subcutaneous and intramuscular adipose tissues will be established by assessing at the level of L3.</detailed_description>
