	<brief_title>Patient Reported Outcomes Registry in Patient With Cancer Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PRO Xie project will recruit a representative cohort of patients with advanced lung or advanced pancreatic cancer with a high risk for the development of cancer cachexia. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are assessed in a real life setting by a questionnaire consisting of 20 questions: QoL is measured by SF12, fatigue by FACIT-F and cachexia by FAACT questionnaires, respectively. These data will determine the potential need for anti-cachexia treatment in those patients, as well as the number of underweight patients, the evaluation of general QoL, fatigue and cachexia and the evaluation of malnutrition.</detailed_description>
