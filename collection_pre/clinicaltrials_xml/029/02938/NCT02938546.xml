	<brief_summary>The subject is going to use 18F-FDG PET/CT to assess different genetic NSCLC metabolism after cisplatin chemotherapy and targeted therapy, define the assessment criteria for the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in NSCLC treatment respone and at last build multi-centre clinical trial platform of molecular classification and molecular imaging for cancer chemotherapy assessment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FDG Metabolism Imaging Monitoring Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Curative Effect of Chemotherapy Multicenter Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the first leading cause of cancer death in the world. Systemic chemotherapy has contributed to the only choice for more than 50% NSCLC patients. The genetic abnormalities lead to different therapy response to the same chemotherapy scheme in NSCLC patients. At present, early assessment and prediction is the key for optimize NSCLC therapy. 18F-FDG PET/CT is a noninvasive cell metabolism reaction molecular imaging technology which can assess cancer glucose metabolism sensitively and react cancer proliferation to some degree. Hence 18F-FDG PET/CT may be used to assess NSCLC therapy response noninvasively. It is a reliable method to individualize NSCLC treatment clinically by define the appropriate metabolism response cut-off values and assess time points of 18F-FDG PET/CT in predicting different genetic NSCLC patients.The subject is going to use 18F-FDG PET/CT to assess different genetic NSCLC metabolism after cisplatin chemotherapy and targeted therapy, define the assessment criteria for the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in NSCLC treatment respone and at last build multi-centre clinical trial platform of molecular classification and molecular imaging for cancer chemotherapy assessment.</detailed_description>
