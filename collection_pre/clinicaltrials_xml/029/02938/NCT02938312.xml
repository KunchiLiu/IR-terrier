	<detailed_description>Using a cluster-randomized study design, 400 overweight or obese African American women living in 8 rural counties in Alabama and Mississippi associated with the Deep South Network for Cancer Control will be assigned to either a weight loss only or weight loss plus community strategies condition for 2 years. Weight Loss Only condition: In year 1, participants will attend weekly in-person group sessions (1.5 hours each) aimed at behavioral changes for weight loss (diet and physical activity) for 6 months followed by twice a month meetings for 3 months, then monthly meetings for 3 months. In year 2, monthly phone calls will be used to encourage continued behavior change or weight maintenance. In-person group meetings will be facilitated by a trained lay staff and community health advisors. Monthly phone calls will be conducted by the community health advisor. Weight Loss Plus Community Strategies condition: Participants will receive the same weight loss program as the Weight Loss Only condition. In addition, a community-based organization or other non-profit group in the targeted community will receive funds and technical assistance to implement community-wide efforts to increase access to healthy affordable food and safe and convenient opportunities for physical activity (e.g., increase farmer's markets, develop walking trails). Over the course of the study, participants will complete four full assessments to include measurement of height and weight (to calculate BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, finger-stick blood draw for lipid and glucose testing, dietary recall, and questionnaires concerning participation in physical activity, self-efficacy for eating and exercise behaviors, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, social support, and demographic information (e.g., age, marital status, education, employment, household income).</detailed_description>
