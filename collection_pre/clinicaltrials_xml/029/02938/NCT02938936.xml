	<brief_title>Waiting Time. Wasting Time: A Randomized Control Trial to Investigate the Health Impacts of Improving the Quality of Antenatal Care in Mozambique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol describes a pilot study that will test the impact of a scheduling intervention intended to reduce waiting times for antenatal care. The study will include one intervention health clinic and one control clinic in Maputo, Mozambique. In the intervention facility women attending antenatal care will be informed that if they return at their scheduled date and time they will be seen within one hour by clinic staff rather than having to wait for an indefinite amount of time before being seen for care. Appointment cards will be clipped into ANC cards, which collect routine health data and are kept by women at the end of their ANC visit. Health facility staff will be trained to identify women who return at their scheduled time and to manage patient flow such that scheduled women are received quickly. After the start date of the intervention, all women attending ANC at the health facility will be provided a scheduled return date and time window. Baseline and endline exit interview surveys will be conducted in both intervention and control facilities to compare changes in waiting time, number of ANC visits, and provider satisfaction over the course the study period between clinics.</detailed_description>
