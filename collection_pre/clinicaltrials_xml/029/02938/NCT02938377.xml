	<detailed_description>Aim 1: Examine effects of algorithm-guided alcohol treatment on alcohol consumption and alcohol use Disorders (AUD) symptoms. Hypothesis 1A: Patients who are treated using algorithm-guided alcohol treatment will decrease drinking quantity and or frequency compared to pre-algorithm levels. Hypothesis 1B. Patients who are treated using algorithm-guided treatment will decrease current AUD symptoms compared to pre-algorithm symptoms levels. Aim 2: Examine effects of algorithm-guided alcohol treatment on retention in HIV care and HIV-related outcomes. Hypothesis 2A. Patients treated using algorithm-guided treatment will increase adherence to clinic visits and HIV medications compared to pre-algorithm levels. Hypothesis 2B. Patients who receive algorithm-guided treatment will have improved HIV biomarkers (e.g., CD4 and VL). Hypothesis 3B. There will be a positive relationship between VL and alcohol consumption measured by self-report and PEth level. Aim 3: Examine effects of algorithm-guided alcohol treatment on comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, HCV, other drug use disorders). Hypothesis 3A: Persons living with HIV (PLWH) with co-morbid depression and anxiety receiving algorithm-guided treatment will have better alcohol, mental health and HIV treatment outcomes compared to similar individuals in SC. Hypothesis 3B: PLWH with comorbid HCV receiving algorithm-guided treatment will have improved FIB4 results and reduced likelihood of HCV recurrence compared to persons in SC. Hypothesis 3C: Other drug use will decrease among those receiving algorithm-guided treatment vs SC.</detailed_description>
