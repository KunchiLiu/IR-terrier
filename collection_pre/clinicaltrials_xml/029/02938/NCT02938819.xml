	<detailed_description>Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative neurological disorders involving progressive impairment in motor, mood and cognitive functions. Movement disorders have a negative impact on individual's ability to perform well-learned motor skills. These include akinesia, bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor at rest. A goal-planning process should be useful to ensure that patients agree on the goals of rehabilitation. Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of home-based goal-oriented upper limb intervention in patients with Parkinson's disease.</detailed_description>
