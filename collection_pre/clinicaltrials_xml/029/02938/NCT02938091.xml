	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluated dietary modulation of LIPC rs1800588 (-514 C/T) for lipids and glucose using a randomized cross-over design comparing a high-fat Western diet and a low-fat traditional Hispanic diet in Caribbean Hispanics (n=42; 4 weeks/phase).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Modulation of Hepatic Lipase (LIPC) -514 C/T Variant Associations With Lipids and Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LIPC -514 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been inconsistently associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in population studies, supporting the possibility of its modulation by dietary factors. To investigate the interaction between the common LIPC -514(C/T) SNP and dietary fat, the investigators compared changes in lipids and glucose in response to two levels of dietary total fat (20% energy intake vs. 39% energy intake) in a crossover, randomized dietary intervention study enrolling Caribbean Hispanics. Individuals were screened for LIPC rs1800588 genotype prior to enrollment, and genotype-associated differences in response to diet were evaluated. The study was designed to test the following hypotheses: 1. Carriers of the T allele consuming a low fat (LF) diet will have decreased hepatic lipase activity as compared with subjects with the CC genotype at the -514(C/T) polymorphism. Conversely, in individuals consuming a high fat (HF) diet, T carriers will exhibit an impaired ability to down regulate hepatic lipase activity. 2. Based on differences in hepatic lipase activity, the investigators hypothesized that a significant and clinically relevant proportion of the individual variability in fasting plasma HDL-C responses to changes in dietary fat intake would be due to variability at the LIPC locus. Specifically, CC subjects will respond to increases in total dietary fat consumption with significant increases in HDL-C concentration. Conversely, increased fat consumption in T carrying subjects will result in decreased HDL-C concentration.</detailed_description>
