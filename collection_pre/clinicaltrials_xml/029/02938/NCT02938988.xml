	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as an adjuvant of scaling and root planning for treatment of periodontal disease in patients with Down's Syndrome. After scaling and root planning, half of patients received antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with methylene blue dye and laser and the sessions were repeated after 3, 7 and 14 days. The other half received only scaling and root planning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy as an Adjunct Treatment for Periodontal Disease in Down's Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been widely used in Periodontics to obtain reduction of periodontopathogenic bacteria with absence of systemic side effects and minimal bacterial resistance. Therefore, a good adjuvant alternative for periodontal disease treatment arises, especially for patients with Down syndrome (DS) who present greater severity and high prevalence of periodontal disease. Usually aPDT is used as an adjunct therapy to scaling and root planning.</detailed_description>
