	<brief_title>Telenutrition Weight Loss Study for Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial of a home telenutrition weight loss program for men with obesity and at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The primary aims are to: 1. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the male-targeted telenutrition weight loss program in terms of recruitment, retention and satisfaction and 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the telenutrition program compared to usual care (informational only) with regard to primary and secondary outcome measures at 12 weeks. We hypothesized that men receiving virtual and telephonic support from a registered dietitian nutritionist would have greater weight loss and greater improvements in diet quality than men who were only provided educational materials.</detailed_description>
