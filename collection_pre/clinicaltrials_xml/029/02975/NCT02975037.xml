	<detailed_description>Subjects suitable for this study will be admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before dosing, and they will be overnight-fasted from 9P of Day -1. Urine collection is scheduled from 12 hours before sildenafil administration to 12 hours after administration. Subjects will be administered sildenafil (oral) around at 9A of Day 1. Subjects will perform scheduled procedures including clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and blood samplings for pharmacokinetic, pharmacometabolomic and mRNA assessment. Subjects will be administered either erythromycin or itraconazole (oral) around at 9A on Day 3 and 9A/9P on Day 4. Urine collection is scheduled from 0 hour to 12 hours after Day 3 erythromycin or itraconazole administration. Subjects will perform scheduled procedures including clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and blood samplings for pharmacokinetic, pharmacometabolomic and mRNA assessment. On Day 5, sildenafil will be administered with erythromycin or itraconazole around at 9A. Urine collection is scheduled from 12 hours before Day 5 drug administration to 12 hours after administration. Subjects will perform scheduled procedures. After subjects perform scheduled procedure, the study will be discharged (around 9A of Day 6). Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 12-14).</detailed_description>
