	<brief_summary>A "can't intubate, can't oxygenate" situation is life-threatening and the physician must be prepared to react quickly. Similarly, a difficult intubation with adequate ventilation is associated with complications. In both of these situation and as recommend by different societies, a supra-glottic airway (SGA) device can be used to help ventilation, or as an intubation conduit to ease the airway access. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to establish which SGA, between the AuraGain, AirQ Blocker and I-Gel, allows the fastest intubation time in an adult population, with the objective of minimizing complications related to these situations. The investigators will conduct a three-arm trial to compare different outcomes related to the installation of the SGA and its use as an intubation conduit. The results of this trial will inform the anesthesiologist on which device to use on to have close in case of airway emergencies.</brief_summary>
