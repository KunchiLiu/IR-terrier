	<brief_title>Blood Flow Analysis of the Human Mucosa After Vestibuloplasty Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vestibuloplasty is the common name of those procedures designed to widen the zone of attached gingiva. The apically repositioned split thickness flap with a xenogeneic collagen matrix or with a combination of strip gingival graft and a xenogeneic collagen matrix are frequently used surgical techniques, however no data are available, how these graft tissues affect the microcirculation of the healing gingiva. LSCI is a non-invasive, two dimensional method to evaluate microcirculation of different tissues. This new method let us monitor the entire surgical area real-time during the healing period. The aim of the present study is to define blood flow patterns, which might characterize the wound healing of such surgical procedures during the first 6 months of healing in order to facilitate treatment.</detailed_description>
