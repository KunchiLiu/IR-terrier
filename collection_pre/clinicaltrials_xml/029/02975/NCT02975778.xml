	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to validate the use of Pain Monitor™ device, not invasive and simple of employment, for old people able to answer to a digital scale of pain intensity. The main objective is to develop and to validate a model of prediction of the pain in old subject at the time of the care, using the measure of variation of the skin conductance.</brief_summary>
