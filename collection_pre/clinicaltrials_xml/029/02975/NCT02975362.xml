	<brief_summary>The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke patients. In this 8-week, assessor-blind, a Multi-center randomized, controlled study of acupuncture as additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 240 patients with stroke patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment (n =120) or rehabilitation treatment (n =120). (40 sessions, 5 sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured using Fugl-Meyer Scale and Modified Barthel Index. Change in the stroke syndromes over time are measured using stroke syndrome of TCM Scale. Change in the quality of life over time are measured using SS-QOL scale. The study will be conducted at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University, Hua Shan Hospital.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture Treatment on Motor Dysfunction in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional disorder is a common and serious consequence of stroke. A large proportion of stroke patients develop motor dysfunction in the early stage after stroke. Acupuncture is often used as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. It has been widely applied to be a kind of effective treatment for stroke in China. But, there is meta-analysis suggests that with stroke rehabilitation, acupuncture has no additional effect on motor recovery but has a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo effect and varied study quality. The efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies. The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke patients. In this 8-week, assessor-blind, a Multi-center randomized, controlled study of acupuncture as additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 240 patients with stroke patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to acupuncture combined with rehabilitation treatment (n =120) or rehabilitation treatment (n =120). (40 sessions, 5 sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured using Fugl-Meyer Scale and Modified Barthel Index. Change in the stroke syndromes over time are measured using stroke syndrome of TCM Scale. Change in the quality of life over time are measured using SS-QOL scale.The study will be conducted at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University, Hua Shan Hospital.</detailed_description>
