	<brief_title>Simulator of Pompage Technique for Physiotherapists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Manual techniques are taught and trained with practical demonstration without technology support to measure them, so they are difficult to reproduce. This difficulty increases in Pompage technique because the student is not able to estimate the displacement on the skin. In this research, to parameterize and train the technique was developed and validated an anatomical model of the cervical region, with silicone and latex rubber. The anatomical model simulates the soft tissues and a plastic resin structure represents the cervical spine bone. An optical sensor was used to measure the displacements performed on simulated skin versus time. The Likert scale was used for assessing the similarity of the anatomical model relative to the size, shape, texture, elasticity and displacement of the skin as well as the curvature of the cervical spine. Five experienced professionals (GP) in the technical performed five series of Pompage technique. With the mean of data collected were determined benchmarks for technical and implemented in a standard guide to train the volunteers. Twenty-six volunteers (GE) with no experience performed the Pompage technique, with the anatomical model following the standard guide. A physical therapist (VE) was selected to evaluate the volunteers (GE) before and after training in the simulator.</detailed_description>
