	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin when given together with temozolomide and irinotecan hydrochloride in treating pediatric patients with solid tumors that have come back after a period of time during which the tumor could not be detected or has not responded to treatment. Nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin, temozolomide, and irinotecan hydrochloride may work better in treating pediatric patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin (ABI-009) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) (administered on days 1-5) in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. II. To define and describe the toxicities of single-agent ABI-009 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors. III. To define and describe the toxicities of ABI-009 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan (administered on days 1-5) in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors. IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ABI-009 in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of ABI-009 in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan within the confines of a phase 1 study. II. To assess the biologic activity of ABI-009 by examining S6K1 and 4E-BP1 expression status in archival tumor tissue from solid tumor pediatric patients using immunohistochemistry. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin. Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 beginning on course 1. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) and irinotecan hydrochloride PO on days 1-5 beginning on course 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
