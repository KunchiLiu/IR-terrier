	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) has far-reaching effects on both motor outcomes and quality of life in PD patients. Furthermore, deep brain stimulation (DBS), now an evidence-based treatment for certain cases of PD, has the risk of causing deficits in multiple areas of cognition. As such, the purpose of this study is to understand the neuroanatomical and neurophysiologic basis for impaired cognition in PD. The aim is to identify neural correlates of cognition by measuring brain signal activity while PD patients are engaged in cognition on a computer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Participants: For this study, the investigators will recruit approximately 100 healthy control participants and 100 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients that are undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) as routine standard of care. Screening: For healthy control participants, investigators will approach adults, aged 18-90, for possible involvement in our study. Potential participants will be asked if they have ever been diagnosed with a movement disorder, psychiatric disorder, or dementia. For PD patients undergoing evaluation for DBS, investigators will first consult with their neurologist and neurosurgeon. Next, investigators will approach the participant and explain the study. Healthy Controls: Healthy controls will complete standardized questionnaires and play a computer game to assess cognition, taking no longer than 30 minutes. PD Participants: As part of the usual DBS process in the treatment of side effects of PD at University of Florida (UF), PD participants will asked to participate in this trial. There are three evaluation time points: before surgery, during surgery, and possibly after surgery. Before surgery, the PD patients will complete standardized questionnaires and be trained on a computer game to assess cognition. During surgery, the participants will play the same computer game while brain signals are recorded. When the patients return to University of Florida for DBS programming visits within 12 months after surgery, they will repeat the standardized questionnaires and computer game once again.</detailed_description>
