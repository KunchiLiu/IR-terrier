	<brief_summary>The main objective is to establish the feasibility of 166-Holmium microspheres for intratumoral injections in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of the tongue. Participants will receive intratumoral injections with a low radioactive 166-Holmium microspheres followed by surgical resection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of Holmium-166 Micro Brachytherapy in Head and Neck Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>166-Holmium microspheres poly lactic acid microspheres are currently used in selective internal radiation therapy. These microspheres emits beta radiation. The majority of the radiation dose will be absorbed within 3.2 mm with a maximum penetration in tissue of 9 mm. Therefore this can result in a high local tumor ablative dose with minimal dose to healthy adjacent tissue.</detailed_description>
