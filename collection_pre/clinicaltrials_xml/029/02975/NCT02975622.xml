	<brief_summary>Ultrasound (US)-guided central venous catheterization is now considered standard of care according to recent clinical evidence, at least considering jugular vein approach. Recent trials suggested that even US-guided subclavian approach could be more effective that landmark technique. However, studies comparing both sites employing US are still lacking. We, therefore, designed a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial to compare these sites, both using US guidance, according to immediate complications following central venous catheterization.</brief_summary>
