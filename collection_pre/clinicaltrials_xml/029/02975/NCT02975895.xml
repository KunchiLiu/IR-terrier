	<brief_summary>Cataract, is a clouding of the lens in the eye gradually leading to reduction of the visual acuity. In most cases it can be managed with surgery, removing the own lens and replacing it with an artificial lens, intraocular lens (IOL). These lenses are made in different materials with different properties. Uveitis refers to an inflammation in the iris, ciliary body and choroid. Patients with this disease have an increased risk of developing cataract due to the inflammation itself and treatment with steroids. They also have an increased risk of complications during surgery and postoperatively. In this group the selection of IOL might be of greater importance. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study is to compare the outcome of hydrophobic and hydrophilic intraocular lenses in patients with and without uveitis</brief_summary>
