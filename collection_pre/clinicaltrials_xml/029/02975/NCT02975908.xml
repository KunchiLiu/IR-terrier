	<brief_summary>ARDS is a critical respiratory disease caused by endogenous and exogenous factors. The mortality of ARDS varies from 30 to 70%. In 2012, a new international diagnostic criterion has been put forward. Yet, its feasibility, reliability and validity need to be tested. Meanwhile, the correlation of different severity and prognosis remains unclear. As so far, the epidemiological information about ARDS in China is lacking. Investigators plan to conduct a multi-center observational study（real-life study） to investigate the risk factors, morbidity, management and prognosis of ARDS in China, in order to facilitate standardization of diagnosis and management of ARDS and provide basic data and idea for further clinical intervention studies.</brief_summary>
