	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this investigation are to show that the performance of CBL-101 Eye Drops is non-inferior to that of Vismed® Multi eye drops in subjects with moderate to severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca after 28 days, and to assess the safety of CBL-101 Eye Drops during a 90-day period with treatment administered 3 to 6 times per day.</brief_summary>
