	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to establish whether patients with dry eye disease (DED) are able to tolerate receiving Brimonidine: 0.15% eye drops two times a day for twelve weeks (primary tolerability objective) and to investigate the preliminary efficacy of Brimonidine 0.15% topical eye drop solution in treating MGD (primary efficacy objective). Meibomian Gland dysfunction can happen with numerous conditions such as Rosacea, Sjögren's syndrome, and oGVHD. In order to limit the influence of differing etiologies on the outcome of this trial, the investigator has limited the screening to MGD that accompanies oGVHD.</brief_summary>
