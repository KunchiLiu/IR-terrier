	<brief_summary>The aim of this protocol is to find out about the safety and effectiveness of M2951 in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Patients will be placed into 1 of 3 groups to receive M2951, placebo or tecfidera for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, the patients on placebo will be given M2951.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of relapsing multiple sclerosis (may include subjects with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) with superimposed relapses provided they meet the other criteria) in accordance with revised McDonald criteria for MS and Lublin and Reingold Male or female aged 18 to 65 years One or more documented relapses within the 2 years before Screening with either: a) One relapse which occurred within the last year prior to randomization or b) the presence of at least 1 Gd+ T1 lesion within 6 months prior to randomization would make the patient eligible. Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0 to 6 at Baseline Women of childbearing potential must use a supplementary barrier method together with a highly effective method of contraception (according to International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] guidance M3[R2]) for 4 weeks prior to randomization, throughout the trial, and for 90 days after the last dose of IMP. Signed and dated informed consent (subject must be able to understand the informed consent) indicating that the subject has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrolment and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Progressive MS Disease duration &gt; 15 years in subjects with EDSS of 2 or less Use of the following, as determined in the protocol ; rituximab, ocrelizumab, mitoxantrone, or lymphocytedepleting therapies, lymphocyte trafficking blockers (eg, natalizumab, fingolimod), intravenous (IV) immunoglobulins (Ig), plasmapheresis, immunosuppressive treatments, Binterferons or glatiramer acetate, Systemic glucocorticoids, teriflunomide Exposure to Tecfidera within 6 months prior to randomization Any allergy, contraindication, or inability to tolerate Tecfidera Treatment with dalfampridine (fampridine, Ampyra) unless on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days prior to randomization Inability to comply with MRI scanning Immunologic disorder other than MS, with the exception of secondary wellcontrolled diabetes or thyroid disorder, or any other condition requiring oral, IV, intramuscular, or intraarticular corticosteroid therapy Vaccination with live or liveattenuated virus vaccine within 1 month prior to Screening Severe drug allergy or history of anaphylaxis, or allergy to the IMP or any of its incipients Active, clinically significant viral, bacterial, or fungal infection, or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with parenteral antiinfectives within 4 weeks of Screening, or completion of oral antiinfectives within 2 weeks before or during Screening, or a history of recurrent infections (ie, 3 or more of the same type of infection in a 12month rolling period). Vaginal candidiasis, onychomycosis, and genital or oral herpes simplex virus considered by the Investigator to be sufficiently controlled would not be exclusionary.

Indeterminate QuantiFERON® Subjects with current household contacts with active TB will also be excluded History of splenectomy or any major surgery within 2 months prior to Screening History of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular event as per the protocol History of attempted suicide within 6 months prior to Screening or a positive response to items 4 or 5 of ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) An episode of major depression within the last 6 months prior to Screening On anticoagulation, fish oil supplements, or antiplatelet therapy other than daily aspirin for cardioprotection and treatment of Tecfidera induced flushing History of cancer, except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Breastfeeding/lactating or pregnant women Participation in any investigational drug trial within 1 month or 5 halflives of the investigational drug, whichever is longest, prior to Screening Subjects currently receiving (or unable to stop using prior to receiving the first dose of IMP) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) History of or current alcohol or substance abuse Clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram or screening chest Xray Clinically significant laboratory abnormality</criteria>
