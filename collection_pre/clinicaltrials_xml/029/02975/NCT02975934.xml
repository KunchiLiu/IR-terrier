	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and evidence of a homologous recombination gene deficiency, respond to treatment with rucaparib verses treatment with physician's choice of abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or docetaxel.</brief_summary>
