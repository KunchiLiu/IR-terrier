	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the safety and effect of intralymphatic allergen specific immunotherapy in increasing doses. Patients with allergy to grass or birch will be treated with three intralymphatic injections in an up-dosing protocol; 1000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U and 10 000 SQ-U, or placebo. ***IMPORTANT INFORMATION!*** The up-dosing protocol is changed due to adverse events at 5000 SQ-U. One patient had general utricaria 15 minutes after injection (moderate reaction). One patient had a serious adverse event with anaphylactic reaction 6 minutes after intralymphatic injection. (1000 SQ-U and 3000 SQ-U have been given with no serious adverse events.) New regimen: 1000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U.</brief_summary>
