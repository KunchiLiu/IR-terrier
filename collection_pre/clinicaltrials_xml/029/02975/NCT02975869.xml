	<brief_title>A Collaborative Palliative and Oncology Care Model for Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to compare two types of care - standard leukemia oncology care and standard leukemia oncology care with collaborative involvement of palliative care clinicians to see which is better for improving the experience of patients and families with AML undergoing treatment. The investigators aim to find out whether introducing patients and families undergoing AML treatment to the palliative care team that specializes in symptom management can improve the physical and psychological symptoms that patients and families experience during their hospitalizations for their leukemia care as well as enhance the quality of patients' end of life care.</detailed_description>
