	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IV, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, 2-arm, multicenter study. The primary objective will be assessed by the difference in the mean number of ranibizumab injections applied up to Month 11 between the 2 treatment arms. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment arms; i.e. Arm 1 ranibizumab monotherapy, Arm 2 ranibizumab with Grid&amp;Direct short pulse laser photocoagulation combination therapy. There will be 3 periods in this study: Screening Period (visit 1), Treatment Period (visit 2 to Visit 13) and Follow-up Period (visit 14). In addition to screening and Baseline (visit 2), there will be monthly visits from Month 1 to Month 12. This study will include male and female patients (≥20 years old) diagnosed with visual impairment due to ME secondary to BRVO. Assuming an approximate 20% drop out rate, approximately 70 patients will need to be screened to have at least 56 patients found eligible and commencing treatment in the trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of visual impairment exclusively due to ME secondary to BRVO Bestcorrected visual acuity score at Screening and Baseline (Day 1) between 0.5 and 0.05 decimal (i.e., between 73 and 19 letters in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing) with Landolt C charts inclusively (i.e., approximate logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units of 0.3 to 1.30). At Baseline (Day1), a maximum BCVA gain of 0.2 units logMAR conversion inclusively from screening is allowed as long as the BCVA score does not exceed the upper limit of 0.3 units logMAR. Increased central subfoveal thickness (&gt; 300 µm at Baseline (Day 1) when measured by SDOCT) Duration of vision deterioration ≤6 months (determined by selfreport) at screening Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Stroke or myocardial infarction less than 3 months before Screening Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as systolic value of &gt;160 mm Hg or diastolic value of &gt;100 mm Hg at Screening or Baseline (Day 1) Antihypertensive treatment can be initiated and must be taken for at least 30 days after which the patient can be assessed for study eligibility a second time Any active periocular or ocular infection or inflammation (e.g., blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) at the time of Screening or Baseline (Day 1) in either eye Uncontrolled glaucoma (intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥30 mm Hg on medication or according to investigator's judgment) at the time of Screening or Baseline (Day 1) or diagnosed within 6 months before Baseline (Day 1) in either eye Neovascularization of the iris or neovascular glaucoma in the study eye Use of any systemic antiVEGF drugs within 6 months before Baseline (Day1) (e.g., sorafenib (Nexavar®), sunitinib (Sutent®), bevacizumab (Avastin®), zivaflibercept (ZALTRAP®)) Treatment (or anticipated treatment in the fellow eye for nonRVO indications during the study) with any antiangiogenic drugs (including any antiVEGF agents) within 3 months before Baseline (Day1) in fellow eye or before Baseline (Day 1) in the study eye (e.g., pegaptanib (Macugen®), ranibizumab (Lucentis®), bevacizumab (Avastin®), and aflibercept (EYLEA®)) Panretinal laser photocoagulation within 1 month before Baseline (Day1) or anticipated or scheduled within the next 12 months (Study periods) following Baseline (Day1) in the study eye Any giving of focal or grid laser photocoagulation before Baseline (Day1) in the study eye Use of intra or periocular corticosteroids (including subTenon) within 3 months before Screening in the study eye. Any use of intraocular corticosteroid implants (e.g., dexamethasone (Ozurdex®), fluocinolone acetonide (Iluvien®)) in the study eye</criteria>
