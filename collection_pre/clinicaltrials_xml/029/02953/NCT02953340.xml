	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of SPI-2012 with pegfilgrastim in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) to prevent and reduce Neutropenia that is associated with cancer chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of SPI-2012 Versus Pegfilgrastim in the Management of Chemotherapy Induced Neutropenia in Early- Stage BReast Cancer Patients Receiving Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (RECOVER)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety of SPI-2012 with pegfilgrastim in breast cancer patients treated with TC chemotherapy to prevent and reduce Neutropenia. Approximately 218 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms: Each cycle will be 21 days. Total 4 cycles will be evaluated for this study. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive TC chemotherapy. On Day 2 of each cycle, patients will received study drug (SPI-2012 or pegfilgrastim). All patients who have received at least one dose of study drug will be followed for 12 months after the last dose of study treatment for safety.</detailed_description>
