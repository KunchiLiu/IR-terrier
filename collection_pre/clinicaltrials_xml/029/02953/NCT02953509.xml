	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b/2 trial will evaluate Hu5F9-G4 in combination with rituximab. Hu5F9-G4 is a monoclonal antibody which is designed to block a protein called CD47, which is widely expressed on human cancer cells. Blocking CD47 with Hu5F9-G4 may enable the body's immune system to find and destroy the cancer cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody drug that is used for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other types of cancer. The major aims of the trial are: (Phase 1b) to investigate the safety and tolerability of sequential dose cohorts and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose for Hu5F9-G4 in combination with rituximab, and (Phase 2) to evaluate the efficacy of Hu5F9-G4 in combination with rituximab in patients with indolent lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as measured by the overall response rate.</brief_summary>
