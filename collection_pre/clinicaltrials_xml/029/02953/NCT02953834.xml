	<criteria>Inclusion/ History: stable weight for previous three months, no active illicit drug use, no history of a medication reaction requiring emergency medical care, no difficulty with blood draws. Physical examination: systolic BP &lt; 140 mm Hg, diastolic &lt; 90 mm Hg, Laboratory studies: (per MGH reference ranges) normal hemoglobin, unless hypogonadal then no lower than 0.5 gm/dL below the lower limit of the reference range for normal women (as men and women with hypogonadism have lower hemoglobin levels off of treatment) hemoglobin A1C &lt; 6.5% BUN, creatinine not elevated AST, ALT &lt; 3x upper limit of normal negative serum pregnancy test (for all women) Additional Criteria by Study Population Healthy Men: no history of chronic disease, no history of diabetes in a first degree relative. Healthy Women: no history of chronic disease, except well controlled thyroid disease, no history of diabetes in a first degree relative, no use of contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings within last 4 weeks. Postmenopausal Women: no history of chronic disease except hypercholesterolemia, thyroid disease, and osteoporosis, no history of diabetes in a first degree relative, normal activated protein C resistance screen, if applicable, able to undergo appropriate washout from hormone therapy. Men and Women with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT): diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance by oral glucose tolerance test, all medical conditions wellcontrolled. Men and Women with Hypogonadism diagnosis of hypogonadism, all other medical conditions wellcontrolled, if applicable, able to undergo appropriate washout from hormone therapy.</criteria>
