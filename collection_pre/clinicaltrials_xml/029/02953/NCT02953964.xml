	<brief_title>Memory Encoding Strategies for People With Mild Cognitive Impairments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with dementia experience a cognitive decline that affects their functional performance. It has been identified that encoding is less effective in people with dementia. Rehabilitating at the encoding stage is, therefore, essential. A recent systematic review found that effective interventions needed to include training in individually selected memory encoding strategies. These strategies are classified as either perceptual (visual) or semantic (association) memory encoding strategies. Based on the above literature, the chief investigator (Associate Professor Karen Liu) ran a pilot study on an integrated home and community centre cognitive training programme for 20 elderly people with memory problem using a pre-test and post-test comparison design. Extending on the positive results, the aim of this project was to investigate the effectiveness of perceptual and semantic encoding strategies (and compare with a control intervention). It also aims to promote the understanding of memory loss and dementia and the need for early intervention for family members of the participants.</detailed_description>
