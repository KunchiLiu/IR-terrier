	<brief_summary>This is an early phase clinical trial to test the efficacy of elevating lung volume with positive expiratory pressure (PEEP) as a controller therapy for asthma in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2. There will be two phases to this trial. Phase I: In the first phase we will determine the optimal duration of PEEP that is effective as a controller therapy in asthma. Up to 9 participants will complete this this phase. Phase II: The 2nd phase will be a randomized double-blinded controlled trial of PEEP 0 versus PEEP 10 (using the duration of PEEP determined in phase I) as a controller therapy for asthma. Twenty participants will complete this phase.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effect of 10 versus 0 cmH2O PEEP on airways responsiveness to inhaled methacholine will be studied using an adaptive "3+3" phase I/II study design. Dose Titration Phase (phase I): The efficacy of 8 hours of PEEP on airway responsiveness will be tested in three subjects. Efficacy will be defined as a 25% improvement in the impedance response to methacholine in all three subjects. If this occurs in all subjects, shorter durations of PEEP will be studied (4 hours then one hour). Conversely, if "dose escalation" is required, 3 nights, then 7 nights of PEEP will be studied. Randomized-controlled study phase (phase II): Participants will be randomized to PEEP 10 or PEEP 0. The duration of PEEP will be determined in the dose titration phase. The effect on response to inhaled methacholine, lung function and asthma control will be determined.</detailed_description>
