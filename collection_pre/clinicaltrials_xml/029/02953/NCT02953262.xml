	<brief_summary>Patient-facing eHealth technologies are those that connect patients and the healthcare system, and include online patient portals. Although many organizations are adopting patient portals, there is limited understanding of how the different portal features help improve health outcomes. This study is designed to develop and test an intervention to improve adoption and use of patient portal features for diabetes management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Diabetes Care Through Effective Personalized Patient Portal Interactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently over 3 million Veterans have adopted the VA Patient Portal, My HealtheVet (MHV), however actual use of the portal varies considerably, and the investigators have little data on how the portal features can best improve patient outcomes, or whether effective use varies by subgroups. By examining the patient portal features associated with improved outcomes and clarifying how patients can best leverage these features to better manage their diabetes, the investigators will develop and test an intervention to improve adoption and use of the patient portal for diabetes management. The goal of this small scale study, using a randomized encouragement design, is to to test the feasibility of engaging Veterans in a supported adoption intervention to promote effective MHV use, in a sample of Veterans with diabetes (with or without comorbid mental health problems). The investigators will recruit from Veterans at the study sites who have uncontrolled glucose (HbA1c &gt;= 9%) and have not used the patient portal. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) Encouragement and 2) Comparison. Participants randomized to the encouragement arm will receive a mailing to emphasize the importance of setting health goals and explain how MHV can help and will have the opportunity to participate in the Supported Adoption intervention. Those in the intervention will receive a one-on one session (to sign up and learn how to use secure messaging), a group training session (which will emphasize the features most meaningful for diabetes management) , and follow-up support after the training sessions to to provide further encouragement. Those in the comparison condition will receive a mailing with only the goal setting content (no MHV nor intervention component offer).</detailed_description>
