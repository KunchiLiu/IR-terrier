	<brief_summary>This is the first study in which GSK2315698 will be administered in Japanese population. The primary objective of the study is to investigate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics after single intravenous infusion in healthy subjects. This will be a single center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending study. Subjects in Cohort 1 will attend 3 dosing sessions, and will be randomized to one of the 3 groups. Each group will receive GSK2315698 and Placebo in a defined sequence. The dose levels of GSK2315698 are set to 10 milligrams (mg) per hour (hr), 20 mg/hr, and 40 mg/hr, to be administered over 1 hour. Dosing sessions 1 and 2, and dosing sessions 2 and 3, will be separated by a washout period of at least 8 and 10 days, respectively. Subjects in Cohort 2 will attend a single dosing session, and will be randomized to receive either GSK2315698 20 mg/hr or Placebo, over a period of 15 hours. A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized such that 18 subjects (9 in each cohort) complete the study. The duration of participation for any subject in this study will be approximately 59 days.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant must be 20 to 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent Participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures Peripheral veins suitable for venous blood sampling and cannulation Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.524.9 kg per meter (m) squared (inclusive) Male: A Japanese male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment period and until follow up visit Capable of giving signed informed consent History or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; constituting a risk when taking the study treatment; or interfering with the interpretation of data Clinically abnormal hypotonia or hyperpiesia as determined by the investigator Previous surgical procedures on the upper digestive tract including cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal), and/or cholelithotomy (gallstone removal) Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5 multiplied by upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) QTcF &gt;450 millisecond (msec) QTcF is either machineread or manually overread. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc) for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used Past or intended use of overthecounter or prescription medication including herbal medications within 14 days prior to dosing. Specific studydefined medications may be allowed History of donation of blood or blood products &gt;=400 mL within 3 months or &gt;=200 mL within 1 month prior to screening Exposure to more than 4 new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day Current enrollment or past participation within the last 3 months, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) before signing of consent in this or any other clinical study involving an investigational study treatment or any other type of medical research The subject is positive for Serological test for syphilis (Rapid plasma reagin test [RPR] and Treponema pallidum Latex Agglutination [TPLA]), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, or Human Tcell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1) antibody at screening Positive prestudy drug screen Regular use of known drugs of abuse Regular alcohol consumption within 6 months prior to the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;14 units for males. One unit is equivalent to 350 mL of beer, 150 mL of wine or 45 mL of 80 proof distilled spirits Smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening; Sensitivity to any of the study treatments, or components thereof, or drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates participation in the study</criteria>
