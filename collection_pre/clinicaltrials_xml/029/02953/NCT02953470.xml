	<brief_summary>The aim for the study is to examined the effect of an individually tailored integrated behavioral medicine in physiotherapy intervention including functional exercise, for older adults, having chronic musculoskeletal pain, living alone and dependent on formal care. The study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with one intervention group and one control group. The intervention is a 12-weeks home-based program. The intervention consists of an individually tailored intervention and aims to enhance ability to perform everyday activities by improving physical function and reduce pain-related beliefs and pain-related disability. The comparison group achieves general advice about physical activity. All participants will be tested at baseline, a post-assessment at 12 week and a three month follow-up. Primary outcome is pain interference by the Brief Pain Inventory and physical function by Short Physical Performance Battery. Secondary outcomes measures if the goal setting is reached, self-efficacy in relation to the goal setting, pain catastrophizing, level of physical Activity, falls efficacy and Health related quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Study of on Intervention on Pain, Function, Health and Behaviour for Older Adults Living With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention group The base for the intervention is to identify a problematic everyday activity and identify factors, including physical, psychological and environmental factors, that can inhibit and/or promote the ability to perform the activity. The exercise that will improve the physical factors will be based on functional exercise such as Balance training and muscle strength training, e.g. fast walking in circle, marching on the spot with a high knee lift, leg lifts, power walking and stair walking, squats, lunge, turning trunk and head while standing, and walking over obstacles. Number of exercises and the dosage are based on how much the participant are able to do and want to do and will increase progressively considering the changes in function and health status of the participants. The content of the visits is as follow: Session: Identification of a problematic everyday activity and advice about physical activity. Session 2: Doing functional behavioural analyse including goal setting, discuss performance dosage of training. Session 3-5: Training in the basic physical and psychological skills relevant to goal setting. Session 6-9: Training to apply basic skills adequately for the goal setting, application of basic and applied skills to other behaviours, starting with subsequent activity goals. Discussion about how the participant can be able to maintain their new behaviour. Discussion of problem-solving strategies, how he/she can prevent and address new activity problems that may arise related to the goal setting and in relation to being physically active. During the intervention period will the participant receive visits by a physiotherapist during intervention weeks 1-8 and 12. Under week 10 will the participants receive one telephone call for support. Non-intervention Group The comparison group will receive standard care which means that the participants get one visit from physiotherapist which consist of written and oral information about general advice regarding physical Activity..Further will the comparison group receive telephone Calls to remind them of being physically active according to the advice during week 1-8 and week 10.</detailed_description>
