	<criteria>1. Patient is 1885 years of age 2. Patient has evidence of ESCN, within the last 3 months, patient demonstrated a new diagnosis or a reconfirmed diagnosis of squamous MGIN or HGIN of the esophagus 3. On endoscopic examination, subject has at least one USL that measures at least 3 cm in at least one dimension and is greater than ¼ of the esophageal circumference and has MGIN or HGIN on biopsy, confirmed by central pathologist 4. All lesions are completely flat (type 0IIb) both on WLE and Lugol's chromoendoscopy 5. The maximum allowable linear length of "USLbearing esophagus" is 12 cm 6. Baseline endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (if applicable) shows no exclusionary findings for the trial 7. Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and upper third of the abdomen (if applicable) shows no exclusionary findings for the trial 8. Based on the judgment of the study endoscopist, the patient is eligible for treatment and followup endoscopy and biopsy as required by the protocol 9. The subject is willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in this clinical study and understands the responsibilities of trial participation 1. Patient has esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 2. Any nonflat (Paris type 0I, 0IIa, 0IIc, 0III) abnormalities anywhere in the esophagus 3. Any USL with MGIN or worse on biopsy outside the treatment area 4. Esophageal stricture preventing passage of a therapeutic endoscope 5. Any prior endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) 6. Any esophageal dilation in the past 12 months 7. Any history of a nonsquamous cell cancer of the esophagus, or any history of a squamous cell cancer of the esophagus (any stage) 8. Any previous ablative therapy within the esophagus (photodynamic therapy, multipolar electrical coagulation, argon plasma coagulation, laser treatment, or other) or any radiation therapy to the esophagus. 9. Previous esophageal surgery, except fundoplication without complications (i.e., no slippage, dysphagia, etc.) 10. Evidence of esophageal varices detected within last 6 months or at initial RFA procedure 11. Patient has active reflux esophagitis grade C or D. 12. Evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis on endoscopy and/or histology 13. Inner diameter of the esophagus measuring less than 18mm 14. Report of uncontrolled coagulopathy with international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2 or platelet count &lt;75,000 platelets per µL (note: a complete blood count is not required for all subjects in this study) 15. Patient is using aspirin, clopidogrel, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that cannot be discontinued 7 days before and after therapeutic sessions 16. Patient has an implantable pacing device (examples: automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator, neurostimulator, cardiac pacemaker) and has not received clearance for enrollment in this study by specialist responsible for the pacing device 17. Patient has life expectancy less than 2 years 18. Patient suffers from psychiatric or other illness and/or has a known history of unresolved drug or alcohol dependency that would limit ability to comprehend or follow instructions related to informed consent, post treatment instructions, or followup guidelines 19. Patient is considered to be part of a vulnerable population (e.g. prisoners or those without sufficient mental capacity) 20. The subject has participated in an investigational drug or device research study within 30 days of enrollment that would interfere with this study 21. Patient is pregnant or has plans to become pregnant in the ensuing 12 months (confirmation of nonpregnant status in women of childbearing age and ability required with urine or blood test to be eligible)</criteria>
