	<brief_summary>Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) has long been the mainstay of treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases (BM). Meanwhile, Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has been increasingly employed in the management of multiple BM to spare healthy tissue. Hence, GKRS is expected to cause fewer cognitive side effects than WBRT. Treatment of multiple BM without cognitive side effects is becoming more important, as more patients live longer due to better systemic treatment options. There are no published randomized trials yet directly comparing GKRS to WBRT in patients with multiple BM, including objective neuropsychological testing. CAR-Study B is a prospective randomized trial comparing cognitive outcome after GKRS or WBRT in eligible patients with 11-20 BM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Outcome After SRS or WBRT in Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases (CAR-Study B)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAR-Study B is a prospective randomized trial comparing cognitive outcome after GKRS or WBRT in eligible patients with 11-20 BM on a triple dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI-scan. Neuropsychological assessment will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be combined with 3-monthly MRI-scans. Patients will be randomized to either GKRS or WBRT. Groups will be balanced at baseline (prior to radiotherapy), taking into account several (stratification) factors that may influence cognitive functioning over time, such as: total tumor volume in the brain, systemic treatment, KPS, age, histology, and baseline HVLT-R total recall score.</detailed_description>
