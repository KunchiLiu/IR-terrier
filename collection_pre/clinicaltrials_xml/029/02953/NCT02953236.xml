	<brief_title>INSTRUMENTED-MANUAL PHYSIOTHERAPY VERSUS NONINSTRUMENTED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: There are several therapies currently used to treat myofascial trigger points, including conservative and invasive techniques. It has been shown that conservative techniques including therapeutic massage, stretching, transcutaneal electrical nerve stimulation, spray and stretch, cold laser treatment, and ultrasound are the most applied treatments for myofascial pain syndrome, but no single strategy has proved to be universally successful. Instrumented massage has shown clinical effectiveness on shoulder pain, low back pain, and only one study (case report) on myofascial trigger points. This study aimed to verify the mechanical and clinical effects of instrumented massage on myofascial trigger points of trapezius muscle in adult subjects. Methods/Design: The study includes 31 volunteers with myofascial trigger points on right trapezius muscle. Clinical and patient data were obtained from questionnaires, VAS, algometry, sono-myoelastography and myotonometry. Also, physiotherapist grip strength was measured. Subjects were randomly allocated into one of two groups: Instrumented massage or Manual massage. The intervention consisted in a single 20 minutes session of massage on the back and neck by the same therapist, depending of the group, massage was applied manually or instrumented.</detailed_description>
