	<brief_summary>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is increasingly applied in patients with brain metastases (BM) and is expected to have less adverse effects on cognitive functioning than Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT). Because cognitive functions are essential for daily functioning, and may affect therapy compliance and quality of life in general, a full understanding of cognitive functioning in patients with BM after SRS is essential. CAR-Study A is a prospective study to evaluate cognitive functioning in patients with 1-10 BM accepted for treatment with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Outcome After Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Patients With Brain Metastases (CAR-Study A)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAR-Study A is a prospective study to evaluate cognitive functioning after GKRS in patients with 1-10 newly diagnosed brain metastases on a triple dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI-scan. Neuropsychological assessment will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 21 months after treatment. Follow-up assessments will be combined with 3-monthly MRI-scans.</detailed_description>
