	<brief_title>The CloudUPDRS Smartphone Software in Parkinson's Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition, which when treated can result in fluctuating motor activity - sometimes too much movement, sometimes too little. A series of tests, run on a smartphone, will be used to evaluate the motor signs of Parkinson's and related to a clinical evaluation based on the Unified Parkinson's DIseae Rating Scale. 60 participants will be recruited - data from 30 participants will be used to 'train' the smartphone, whilst data from the other 30 will be used to test how good the software is. A second phase of the study will ask patients to subjectively diary their symptoms, comparing a smartphone-based method with reminders, to a standard paper-based method.</detailed_description>
