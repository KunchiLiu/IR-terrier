	<brief_summary>Staple-line leak is the most frequent and incapacitating complication after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the staple-line leak rate after LSG according to the use of a bougie calibre of 36 or 48-Fr, assuming that a higher diameter is correlated with a lower risk of leak, without lowering long-term weight loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bougie Sleeve Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become an increasing bariatric procedure. The most common complication is gastric leak from the staple line, observed in approximately 3% of cases, and can result in long and incapacitating treatment. The diameter of the bougie used to calibrate the remnant stomach could impact the rate of gastric leak, a higher diameter being correlated with a lower risk of leak, without lowering long-term weight loss. The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the outcomes of LSG according to the use of a bougie calibre of 36 or 48-Fr on postoperative gastric leak and mid-term weight loss.</detailed_description>
