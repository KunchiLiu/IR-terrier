	<brief_summary>1. Observe and compare the chrono-chemotherapy IMRT and conventional chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy term efficacy of the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 2. Evaluation chrono-chemotherapy IMRT and conventional chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma safety and tolerability. 3）observing the adverse reaction and effects of two groups,expected chrono-chemotherapy group can achieve lower toxicity, improve the curative effect, for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma provides a more reasonable way.</brief_summary>
