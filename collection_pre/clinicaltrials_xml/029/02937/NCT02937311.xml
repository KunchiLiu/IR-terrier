	<brief_title>Kinesio Tape vs Neuromuscular Stimulation For Conserative of Treatment Hemiplegic Shoulder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemiplegia in the shoulder complex and upper limb is a common secondary impairment as a result of a cerebrovascular event. Although most stroke survivors regain independent ambulation, many fail to regain functional use of their impaired upper limb. Actually the pathogenesis of post-stroke shoulder pain seems to be multifactorial; differential diagnosis is often difficult. Changes in the shoulder complex makes the glenohumeral joint vulnerable to subluxation, which may cause pain. Traction of capsule and soft tissue related subluxation of the shoulder may take place in the early stages; limited range of motion due to spasticity may develop in the later stages of stroke. These biomechanical problems may be the possible reason for pain. Rotator cuff tears and rotator cuff and deltoid tendinopathies are also possible symptoms related to hemiplegic shoulder observed in magnetic resonance imaging findings. These problems in the shoulder disturb the kinetic chain system that connects the segments and works sequentially from proximal to distal to achieve the targeted movement. When a biomechanical impairment happens in the shoulder or any other segment of the body, a loss in the energy produced in the body and transferred to the upper extremity occurs. This loss adversely affects the quality of the movement . Regaining functional use of the upper limb after a stroke is a challenging task for the patient, which has a significant impact on the individual's physical, psychological, and emotional well-being. Lack of functional ability in the upper extremities after stroke restricts use and causes asymmetric posture and contracture in daily life, thus exacerbating functional limitations of the upper limb. Also, low upper limb motor function is related to the risk of soft tissue injury during rehabilitation. A patient experienced a stroke may not feel any pain due to subluxation. However, different muscle groups may be vulnerable to overstretching, increased contraction, and premature fatigue. This can decrease the coordination of muscular activity and inhibit the functional use of the upper extremity. The posterior fibers of the deltoid, the supraspinatus, and the infraspinatus are the most important muscles that prevent the subluxation of the glenohumeral joint.</detailed_description>
