	<brief_title>Study to Compare Ferric Carboxymaltose With Placebo in Patients With Acute Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Trial (RCT). The 52 weeks observation period following randomisation is considered appropriate to investigate the primary endpoint of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death. To evaluate the effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (IV FCM) in iron deficient subjects with AHF, subjects will be enrolled during a hospital stay (Index hospitalisation) after the acute care treatment of the index event has been stabilised. All subjects will continue to receive their established standard therapy for HF and medical emergencies will be treated according to local routine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 Currently hospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (AHF) where AHF was the primary reason for hospitalisation. 2. Subject is iron deficient (ID) defined as serum ferritin &lt;100 ng/mL or 100 ng/mL ≤ serum ferritin ≤299 ng/mL if transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;20%. 3. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% (assessed and documented within 12 months prior to randomisation). 4. Male or female aged ≥18 years old. 5. Subject (or legally acceptable representative) has provided the appropriate written informed consent. 1. Dyspnoea due to noncardiac causes such as acute or chronic respiratory disorders or infections (i.e., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, primary pulmonary hypertension). 2. Temperature &gt;38°C (oral or equivalent), active infective endocarditis, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or any other active infection requiring antimicrobial treatment at any time during an Index hospitalisation. 3. Clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome, transient ischemic attack or stroke, within the last 30 days prior randomisation. 4. Coronaryartery bypass graft, cardiac resynchronisation therapy device implantation, percutaneous intervention (e.g., cardiac, cerebrovascular, aortic; diagnostic catheters are allowed) or major surgery that led to significant blood loss, including thoracic and cardiac surgery, within the last 3 months prior to randomisation. 5. Subject has a body weight &lt;35 kg at randomisation. 6. Subject at an immediate need of transfusion or with a Hb &lt;8 g/dL or with a Hb &gt;15 g/dL. 7. Subjects with a known anaemia not attributed to ID (e.g., other microcytic anaemia) or with an evidence of iron overload (e.g., haemochromatosis) or disturbances in the utilisation of iron. 8. Subject has known hypersensitivity to any of the study products to be administered or known serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products. 9. Renal dialysis (previous, current or planned within the next 6 months). 10. Chronic liver disease (including active hepatitis) and/or alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase above 3 times the upper limit of the normal range. 11. Subjects with known hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and/or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid positivity. 12. Subject is pregnant (e.g., positive human chorionic gonadotropin test) or breast feeding.</criteria>
