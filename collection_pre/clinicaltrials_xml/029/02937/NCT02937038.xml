	<brief_summary>Purpose: 1. Develop reference values for hydration biomarkers for children of 3 to 13 years old 2. Explore the association between children's and parents' hydration markers and fluid intake habits in children aged 3-13 y 3. Evaluate the equivalence of spot urine osmolality to 24h urine osmolality in children aged 3-13 y 4. Evaluate the differences in hydration markers between school and non-school days in children aged 3-13 y 5. Examine the role of different foods and fluids on hydration in children (3-13 y) and parents</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reference Values and Determinants of Hydration in Children 3-13 y</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies in children have indicated that greater water intake and/or lower urine concentration are associated with better overall nutrition, increased physical activity, improved mood state, and enhanced cognition; which is specifically related to superior attention and memory when compared to sub-optimally hydrated children. Separately, ancillary water is being investigated as a potential treatment possibility for pediatric obesity. Although, causality cannot be directly confirmed, it is apparent that ample water intake in children, above and beyond the body's compensatory mechanisms, is preferable for psychological and physiological health. However, the prevalence of failure to meet water recommendations and hypohydration in children remains high. Still it is unclear if elevated hypohydration reports within the pediatric population are due to a general failure of children to meet water recommendations, or due to inadequacy of the published guidelines</detailed_description>
