	<brief_title>Influence of Superstructure Material on Crestal Bone Resorption and Esthetic Outcome of Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transfer of occlusal forces to the implant bone interface greatly influence the long term prognosis of implants and crestal bone resorption. Accordingly this study will investigate the influence of metal ceramic crowns and monolithic zirconia crowns on crestal bone resorption under loading. Also these crown materials greatly influence the final aesthetic outcome of the definitive restoration, which will be evaluated using the pink and white aesthetic scoring systems.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients above 18 years old. 2. Patients able to read and sign the informed consent document. 3. Medically free patients or with controlled systemic disease. 4. Patients with good bone quality and quantity evaluated using C.B.C.T. 5. Patients willing to return for followup examinations and evaluation. 6.
