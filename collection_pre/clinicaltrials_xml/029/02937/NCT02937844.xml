	<brief_summary>CAR T cell immunotherapy has achieved great success in CD19+ B-cell malignancies. Whether this new generation of cell-based immunotherapy can be applied to solid tumors remain to be investigated, partly due to hostile immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment which favors tumor growth but not immune system. Signaling pathway of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 plays an important role in suppressing immune response against tumors. PD-L1 is over-expressed in 88% of glioblastoma. We constructed a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) containing the extracellular domain of PD1 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28. CSR modified T cells are able to recognize PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and transduce signals to activate T cells, which results in tumor killing. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CSR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CSR T cells when necessary. This pilot study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous CSR T cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
