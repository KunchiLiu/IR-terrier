	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory study with the primary objectives to 1) establish that PET/CT of the lung can reliably distinguish healthy, non-asthmatic volunteers from patients with asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype and 2) to examine the utility of PET/CT for demonstrating that reslizumab produces a reduction in lung inflammation in patients with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Females that are either surgically sterile, are 2 years postmenopausal, or have a negative pregnancy test at screening Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal), have to use a medically accepted method of contraception and have to agree to continue to use of this method for the duration of the study and for 5 months after study drug administration. Subjects and patients with less that 10pack year history of smoking. Have a previous diagnosis of asthma. Patients taking inhaled fluticasone at a dosage of at least 440 mcg daily, or equivalent. The patient's baseline asthma therapy must be stable for 30 days prior to screening and judged by their treating physician to be able to continue without dosage changes throughout the study. Patients with a blood eosinophil level of at least 400/μL at screening. Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information Patients requiring treatment with oral, intramuscular, or iv corticosteroids within 6 weeks of the Part 1 baseline visit. Patients with any other confounding underlying lung disorder including but not limited to: bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, smoking ≥10 pack year history, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and lung cancer. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Patients with pulmonary conditions and blood eosinophilia other than eosinophilic asthma Patients with clinically meaningful comorbidity that can interfere with the study schedule or procedures, or compromise the patient's safety. Patients that are current smokers (ie, have smoked within the last 12 months prior to screening). Patients using systemic immunosuppressive, immunomodulating, or other biologic within 6 months prior to screening. Patients who have previously received an antihuman interleukin5 (antihIL5) mAb (eg, reslizumab, mepolizumab [Nucala®]) or anti IL5 receptor mAb (eg, benralizumab). Patients who had concurrent infection or disease that may preclude assessment of active asthma. Patients with a history of concurrent immunodeficiency (human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or congenital immunodeficiency). Patients that had an active parasitic infection within 6 months prior to screening. Patients with any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery). Known hypersensitivity to study drug or to FDG/contrast agents Treatment with metformin. Compromised renal function Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
