	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate whether the adoption of the use of a range of wound care products from a single manufacturer makes training in appropriate product selection more effective and results in more accurate selection of the appropriate product for the wound and for the patient's lifestyle, thereby incurring less waste and reducing the number of referrals by the community nursing team to the Tissue Viability Team. One community nursing team will switch to using a full range of dressings and compression products from BSN medical UK for three months. Nurse training on the products will be given and nurse competencies and confidence in woundcare and appropriate product selection will be tested at the start and end of the study. The number and type of referrals to the Tissue Viability Team will be measured. Total anonymised data on numbers of referrals, wound closure, numbers of wounds and quantity and cost of products used will be collected and compared with the historical record for three months prior to the study. Patients will complete a Quality of Life questionnaire at enrolment and exit from the study. Patients for whom BSN medical UK products are not appropriate or not desired by the patient will not be enrolled and will receive the usual range of products available to the community nursing team.</brief_summary>
