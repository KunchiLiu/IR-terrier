	<brief_title>Effects of Alpha Lipoic Acid Supplementation in G6PD Deficient Individuals After Acute Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized double-blind, crossover design, 12 adult volunteers with G6PD deficiency of both sexes will be supplemented with either 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid (experimental condition - EC) or placebo (control condition - CC) every day for 4 weeks. Before intervention, all participants will be informed about the study protocol, fill a medical history questionnaire and sign an informed consent form. Moreover, measurements of anthropometric characteristics and physiological parameters, as well as a VO2max test will be performed. Participants will perform 4 trials of exercise (70% VO2max for 45min and 90% till exhaustion) before and after each condition. Blood samples will be collected before, immediately after and 1 hour after exercise. Moreover, measurements of anthropometric characteristics and physiological parameters will be performed before and after each condition. There will be a washout period of at 4 weeks between conditions.</detailed_description>
