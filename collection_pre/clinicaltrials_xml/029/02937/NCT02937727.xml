	<brief_summary>Deep Brain Stimulation represents the golden standard for surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not optimally effective for controlling every motor sign and adverse events are not so infrequent. Therefore,other approaches should be considered. New Approaches in MRI at 3T Dedicated to Targeting Subthalamic Nucleus on Parkinson Patients.</brief_summary>
