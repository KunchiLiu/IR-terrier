At Visit 1, FEV1/FVC ratio must be &lt;0.70 At Visit 1, postbronchodilator FEV1must be &gt;30% and &lt;80% predicted normal value, calculated using The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reference equations. Exclusion criteria: Significant diseases other than COPD, i.e., disease or condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study. Women who are pregnant or lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or women of childbearing potential who are not using an acceptable method of contraception. Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, have a current diagnosis of asthma. Subjects who have been hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or during the runin period (Visit 1 to Visit 2). Subjects who have poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or during the runin period (Visit 1 to Visit 2). Subjects with a diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma will be excluded, regardless of whether or not they have been treated. Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to Î²2agonists, glycopyrronium or other muscarinic anticholinergics, or any component of the MDI.</criteria>
