	<brief_summary>First-degree relatives of patients with melanoma have a greater risk of developing melanoma. Patients are advised orally to inform their first-degree relatives that they should protect their skin from UV radiation and ask for a skin examination from a general practitioner or dermatologist. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a written sheet in addition to the usual oral counselling to increase acceptance of skin examination by the first-degree relatives. If effective, written counselling provided to the patient for relatives should be recommended and generalized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Strategies for Counseling Skin Examination and Sun Protection in First-degree Relatives of Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanoma (MM) is a common cancer affecting 11,000 new cases per year in France and the incidence has tripled in 30 years. It now includes young people, and is responsible for 1600 deaths /year in France. Greater tumor thickness and delayed diagnosis are associated with higher mortality. Prevention and early detection on a large scale in the general population are effective but expensive. First-degree relatives have a greater risk of developing MM. A study carried out in the USA found that a biennial consultation is justified and cost-effective in first-degree relatives of MM patients. The best way to deliver the message of sun protection and screening by a dermatologist, and the reality of behavioural changes induced by counseling and the psychological determinants of adherence to medical skin examination are not fully understood. A pilot study performed in our center suggested the value of a short written advice provided for participants to give to their relatives to promote sun protection and medical skin examination. The participants reported a significant increase in interest in medical skin examination by their relatives (p=0.006), but the investigators do not know whether the relatives really consulted for examination. The aim of the multicenter cluster-randomized study is to demonstrate that a higher ratio of relatives will in fact consult their GP or dermatologist for skin examination in the centers randomized to the intervention arm, i.e advice leaflet and usual oral counselling, compared to the centers randomized in the control arm, i.e. usual oral counselling. Participants and their relatives in the intervention group will be asked to undergo psychological tests to identify potential barriers to skin examination and sun protection. If effective, the investigators expect to improve the written information and to generalize its distribution at national level.</detailed_description>
