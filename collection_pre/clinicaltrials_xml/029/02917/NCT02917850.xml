	<brief_summary>Post-stroke patients often present with gait disorders due to several physical impairments. Hip flexor deficit is one of the more prevalent trouble and is associated with gait capacities. This study aims at evaluating the impact of an isokinetic hip flexors strengthening rehabilitation program in the subacute phase after stroke. Patients will be randomized to an intervention group (isokinetic rehabilitation) or a control group (conventional rehabilitation) and assessed at the end of the rehabilitation program, at 3 and at 6 months.</brief_summary>
