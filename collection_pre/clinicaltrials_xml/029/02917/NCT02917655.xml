	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA), and particularly knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a disorder that greatly impairs the quality of life of patients and its incidence increases with longevity, obesity and lower socioeconomic and educational level. It is expected that 40% of people over 60 have symptomatic OA of the knees and hips. The core treatment of OA is education, weight loss and increased physical activity. We create an educational program that improved function of the patients given by the five-times-sit-to- stand test (FTSST). However, weight loss, an important foundation of clinical treatment, was only effective (more than 2 points in BMI) in 10% of the program participants. For greater effectiveness in weight loss and adherence to physical activity, we prepared an intensive program with more intensive nutritional care, psychological, physical therapy and physical trainers and compare the existing program educators. OBJECTIVE: To compare an educational program isolated to an educational program associated with nutritional consultations, group therapy sessions and progressed physiotherapy sessions to sessions with physical educators in patients with KOA and comorbidities (metabolic syndrome). METHODS: Ninety patients with OAJ and co-morbidities (Two or more of: overweight or obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, high blood pressure) will be divided into two groups: study (S) and control (C). Both groups will attend the two-day multi-professional classes on OA with two months interval. But the study group will also make three group consultations about nutrition, 1 extra session of group therapy with psychology team and 7 exercise sessions in groups with physical therapy and subsequently 7 sessions with physical educators. The groups will be evaluated for weight, height (to calculate BMI), waist-hip ratio, percentage of body fat, consumption of daily medications, WOMAC, Lequesne, IPAQ, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), test sits and rises, timed-up- and-go (TUG) and six minute test. At inclusion, six, twelve and 24 months after the classes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>P.A.R.Q.V.E III - Comparison of the Educational Program With and Without Multidisciplinary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the inclusion criteria, patients undergo pre-evaluation by the multidisciplinary group composed of teams of orthopedic doctors, nutritionists, physical therapists, physical educators: Orthopedics - it is treating the patients according to the guidelines of OARSI, offering everything we have for the treatment of OA at the Hospital das Clinicas. Nutrition - It will measure the skinfold of all patients at baseline and at six and twelve months. As the draw, will attend the study group at 1, 3 and 5 months after the first class and the control group lose weight significantly less than the study group will meet the control group after one year in the same manner than has undergone the study group . Physiotherapy - Undertake the test and sit ups, Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test and Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand (FTSST) including six, twelve and 24 months after inclusion. The physiotherapy group will care study group sessions in a group of patients once a week for 4 weeks, 2 times a week for 1 month and 1x / month in the third month, giving exercises to be performed daily and charging them through the registration of patients. If the results of six and twelve months show better in the study group, the control group will do the same interventions the study group one year later. Physical Education - will apply the questionnaire International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and will make up test and down stairs and evaluating short version flexibility, inclusion, six, 12 and 24 months. After three months of exercise guided by physiotherapists, the study group will begin an exercise program with physical education teachers to become able to carry out alone or join a gym at the end of the sixth month of the program. It will also provide weekly classes for 1 month, biweekly in the second month and last month in the third charging the daily activities in the record of the patient's notebook.</detailed_description>
