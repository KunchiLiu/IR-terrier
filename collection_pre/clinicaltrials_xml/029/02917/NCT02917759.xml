	<brief_title>Liver and Biliary Tumor Tissue Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study establishes a tissue and blood registry at Mayo Clinic Florida to support translational investigations into the biology, etiology and prognosis of liver and biliary masses such as through the use of patient-derived xenografts. Patients having surgery to remove a liver or biliary mass will be asked to donate a portion of the removed mass for research purposes. Only portions of the mass not required for clinical diagnostic evaluation, or surgical waste, will be used in this research study. Tissue will be collected in fresh media for cell culture and implantation into immune incompetent mice for purpose of developing cell lines and tumor graft models. Tissue will also be frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA analysis at a later date. Tissue may also be collected in formalin and paraffin embedded to be used for protein analysis. The tissues acquired will be stored and used for any specific, hypothesis driven protocols that are IRB approved. Serum and plasma samples may also be obtained at enrollment. Clinical patient data from medical charts that may be correlative to outcomes will be collected and stored in a password secure data base. Data will be extracted from medical records charts.</detailed_description>
