	<brief_title>Study of Two Intrathecal Doses of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is an open-label, unmasked, uncontrolled phase I and II trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of two injections of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients. Patients will be recruited trough a web-based registration system, open for all ALS Brazilian patients. The patients will be enrolled after in-person screening at the University of Sao Paulo Medical School Clinics Hospital and inclusion criteria fulfilled. There will be 9 national calls for registration, two months apart each. The enrolled patients will be followed for 3 months before bone marrow aspiration (BMA). Patients will receive 2 intrathecal MSC injections, 1 and 2 months after BMA. The patients will be followed for 6 months after the interventions.</detailed_description>
