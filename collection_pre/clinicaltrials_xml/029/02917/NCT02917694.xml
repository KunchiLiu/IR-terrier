	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the feasibility of obtaining details about a patients previous level of function from the patient of friend/relative, after they have been admitted an intensive care unit (ICU). It will also assess the feasibility of re-assessing level of function at 6 months after the patient has been discharged from ICU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study to Assess Pre Admission Status and Six Month Outcomes After Major Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently there is no standardised way of obtaining details about a patients pre-admission level of function. the process of gaining this history is often done by several different people with no standard questions asked. There is also a need to be able to measure what happens to patients after they leave ICU, and compare their abilities to preadmission status. This feasibility study will aim to investigate: - the time taken to train the physiotherapy team in the use of the outcome measure - the ability to obtain pre admission functional status from patients/friend/relative on admission to ICU - the ability to follow patients up at 6 months post discharge with re-assessment of the outcome measure</detailed_description>
