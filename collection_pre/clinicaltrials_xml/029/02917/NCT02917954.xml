	<brief_summary>Canadian and international health care systems require solutions on how to address the needs of a relatively small population that take up a large portion of health care resources. In Ontario, 10% of the population accounts for 79% of total system costs, with similar trends found in other parts of Canada and internationally. Most high-cost users are seniors, older adults, with multiple chronic conditions and complex care needs who are living in the community. Beyond the cost issues, older adults experiencing multi-morbidity are at higher-risk of poor health outcomes and experience lower quality of life as compared to individuals experiencing single illness only. Since April 2013 the electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) mobile application and portal, has undergone a multi-phased, user-centred design evaluation approach to develop a tool designed to meet the needs of older adults with complex care needs and their primary care providers. The ePRO tool is designed to collect person-centred, person-reported indicators to improve care by supporting primary care delivery and enhancing patient self-management. The ePRO tool includes two features: 1) My Goal Tracker and 2) Health Journal. My Goal Tracker allows patients and providers to collaboratively create goal-oriented patient care-plans, and helps patients to track outcomes related to their goals using a mobile device. The Health Journal allows patients, their caregivers and primary care providers to monitor patients' symptoms and outcomes. The ePRO tool was re-evaluated and modified following each previous study phase (I-IV). This project marks the final phase of the study in which the investigators will conduct a pragmatic trial of the ePRO tool in 22 Family Health Teams in Ontario through a cluster randomized control trial with an embedded case study. In this evaluation of the tool the investigators will assess outcome, process and context measures to identify how the tool affects patients, providers and the system at point-of-care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) Mobile Application Pragmatic Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pragmatic trial will take place at 22 FHTs in Ontario utilizing a cluster randomized control method with an embedded case study of implementation at four sites. Cluster randomization will assign (through number generator or coin flip) each of the 22 FHTs to either intervention or control group and their respective participants will be assigned accordingly. Providers and patients recruited at intervention sites will receive training on how to use the ePRO tool prior to the start of the trial. Intervention patients will receive one-on-one training with a research assistant; and provider training will occur in a group setting. Training will be led by a member of the research team and will take between 30-60 minutes. Patients and providers will also be provided with a manual and training video on how to use the tool and portal, and patients will be offered refresher training sessions at 3, 6, and 9 months. Following consent, all patients regardless of study arm will complete surveys at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and post study (12 months). Intervention patients will complete an additional survey at study closeout to capture tool usability feedback. It is anticipated survey completion will take 20-35 minutes at baseline and post study. Additionally, intervention patients are requested to attend a minimum of two scheduled appointments with their provider during the study. The first (on-boarding) visit will have the patient and provider collaboratively discuss and set monitoring protocols for tracking. The second (off-boarding) visit, following the 12-month monitoring period, will allow patients and providers to privately discuss their experience with the ePRO, before participating in their respective focus group or interview. In accordance to earlier study phases on-boarding and off-boarding visits typically take 30 minutes. As was the case in the usability pilot and exploratory trial, investigators anticipate that patients will have additional appointments with their providers during the 12 month period at which point they can use the tool to discuss patient progress towards goals. Intervention patients are requested to attend 4-5 scheduled appointments with their provider during the study. Embedded within the pragmatic trial will be case studies of 4 intervention sites. Provider and patient participants at case sites will participate in post-intervention semi-structured interviews to capture implementation enablers and barriers. To adequately capture organizational level barriers and enablers the investigators will additionally conduct semi-structure interviews with organizational leaders (executive directors and/or clinical leads). In addition, the investigators will also collect relevant documents from intervention sites (i.e. organizational policies regarding the use of mobile applications or provider trainings and manuals in using technology as part of usual care).</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Chronic Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. a FHT patient at one of the 22 FHT sites selected and is 65 years or older; 2. physical capability to use a tablet and/or a caregiver who can use the tablet on their behalf; 3. ability to read and write in English and/or the availability of a caregiver who can do so on their behalf; 4. has complex care needs defined as two or more chronic conditions and 10 or more visits to their primary health care provider within the last 12 months; and 5. be thinking about or ready to make changes to support their selfmanagement. In addition patients can selfidentify and join the study, as well as providers can identify other patients they feel fit our eligibility criteria that may not have been pulled from the EMR system. This allows eligible patients to enroll into the study that may have been missed when identifying patients through the EMR system. 1. Absence of Inclusion Criteria</criteria>
