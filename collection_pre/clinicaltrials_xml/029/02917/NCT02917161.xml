	<brief_summary>MRI findings after successful PAE in patients suffering from BPH suggest a complete necrosis of the prostate after this intervention. Thus, PAE might also play a role in the treatment of prostate cancer. This proof of concept study assess the impact of PAE in patients with proven prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostatic Artery Embolization Before Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer: A Proof-of-concept Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRI findings after successful PAE in patients suffering from BPH suggest a complete necrosis of the prostate after this intervention. Thus, PAE might also play a role in the treatment of prostate cancer. This proof of concept study assess the impact of PAE in patients with proven prostate cancer. PAE is performed in patients that are planned to undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for proven localized prostate cancer. The impact of neo-adjuvantly performed PAE on histological tumor regression, surgical margins as well as on safety parameters are assessed.</detailed_description>
