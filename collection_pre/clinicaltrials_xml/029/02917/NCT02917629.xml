	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well ACTOplus met XR works in treating in patients with stage I-IV oral cavity or oropharynx cancer that are undergoing definitive treatment. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep oral cavity or oropharynx cancer from forming or coming back. The use of ACTOplus met XR may slow disease progression in patients with oral cavity or oropharynx cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACTOplus Met XR in Treating Patients With Stage I-IV Oral Cavity or Oropharynx Cancer Undergoing Definitive Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether 14-21 days of treatment with ACTOplus met XR will result in a 50% decrease in proliferation index (Ki-67) expression in oral cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare differences in proliferation index (Ki-67) expression from baseline to post-exposure in visually normal appearing oral cavity/oropharyngeal tissue. II. Compare immunohistochemical differences in the apoptosis biomarker cleaved caspase 3 from baseline to post-exposure in oral cavity/oropharyngeal adjacent visually normal appearing tissue and tumor tissue samples. III. Compare immunohistochemical differences from baseline to post-exposure in oral cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue samples with regard to cyclin D1, p21 and biguanide or PPAR gamma associated pathway biomarkers; prospective biomarkers on the panel will include phosphorylated (p)AKT, pAMPK, pS6 (metformin), and PPAR gamma. IV. Compare immunohistochemical differences from baseline to post-exposure of oral cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue samples with regard to tumor infiltrating immune cells (effector CD8 [CD8+IFNg+]), regulatory CD4 T regulatory (Treg) (CD4+Foxp3+), tumor associated myeloid cells (CD68), PD1 and PD-L1. V. Compare and correlate pre- and post-ACTOplus met XR treatment human ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing (seq) gene analysis on total RNA samples from oral cavity/oropharyngeal adjacent visually normal appearing tissue and tumor tissue pre-and post-study treatment. VI. Determine human papillomavirus (HPV) status in pre-treatment tumor tissue using p16 immunohistochemistry. VII. Compare pre- and post-study treatment positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans to determine any change in tumor fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake/metabolism. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive ACTOplus met XR orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14-21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue ACTOplus met XR PO QD for a maximum of 25 days if end of treatment biopsy/surgical treatment is delayed beyond day 22. GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD daily for 14-21 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant has a newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, stage IIV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or oropharynx and will be undergoing definitive surgical, radiotherapy, or chemoradiation treatment OR Participant has a lesion in the oral cavity or oropharynx that is not yet biopsied but is highly suspicious for cancer; (randomization will be placed on hold until the presence of cancer is histologically confirmed, a standard of care staging PET/CT scan is completed and a treatment plan is established; if the presence of cancer is not confirmed, the participant will be considered a screen failure) The participant's primary tumor is accessible to biopsy in the outpatient clinic setting and the participant is willing to have baseline and end of study (day 1526) 4 mm punch biopsies of tumor and adjacent visually normal appearing tissue for biomarker analysis If the participant has a biopsyconfirmed cancer, the baseline biopsy to collect tissue for biomarker analysis will be in addition to the prestudy diagnostic biopsy If the participant is having surgical treatment, the end of study biopsies may be collected at the time of surgery unless surgery is delayed beyond day 26 If the participant is not having surgical treatment, the end of study biopsies will be collected prior to initiation of nonsurgical treatment Participant is able to complete a minimum of 14 days of study agent dosing prior to initiation of definitive treatment for their cancer Participant is scheduled for an end of study biopsy within 22 days of starting study agent and within 36 days of their study screening visit; (if the participant is scheduled for surgical excision of the tumor and the surgery is delayed for any reason after the participant has started taking the study agent, study agent dosing may be extended up to a maximum of 25 days without compromising the evaluability of the end of study biomarkers) A standard of care staging PET/CT scan has been or will be performed prior to randomization Participant is willing and able to have another FDG PET/CT performed within 36 hours of their day 1526 end of study biopsy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status = 0 or 1 Life expectancy is &gt;
