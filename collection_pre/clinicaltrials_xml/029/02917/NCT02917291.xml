	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of FAB117-HC (a medicinal product containing human allogeneic adipose derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2, HC016 cells) administered at a single-time point to patients with acute thoracic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The study will also include initial exploration of potential clinical efficacy. Dose levels of 20 million and 40 million cells will be administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of FAB117-HC in Patients With Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FAB117-HC is an investigational medicinal product whose active substance is HC016, allogeneic adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single administration of FAB117-HC using: a) two sequential escalating doses administered between 72 and 120 hours post-injury, to patients with acute traumatic SCI with AIS grade A; and b) the determined maximum tolerated dose administered between 48 and 72 h post-injury to patients with ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grading of A or B. The study includes also initial exploration of efficacy. Treatment is administered by intramedullary injection into the injured spinal cord, during the decompression and stabilization surgery (DSS) of the fracture. DSS is routinely performed on almost all SCI patients. The study has been divided into two phases: Phase 1 (open label): 6 AIS A patients with lesion located between D5 and D10 will be included in 2 sequential cohorts. Phase 2 (randomized, controlled, double-blind): 40 AIS A or B patients with lesion located between D1 and D12, will be randomly divided into two groups (control and treated) that will be balanced in AIS grade.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase 1 (2 Cohorts) 1. Male or female subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years. 2. ASIA impairment grade A. 3. Either a level of injury between D5D10 both inclusive (cohorts 1 and 2). 4. Single traumatic spinal cord injury as defined by MRI. 5. Injury occurred between 72 and 120h before undergoing DSS and treatment. 6. Clinically and haemodynamically stable enough to undergo DSS. 7. Able to give informed consent either in writing or orally in the presence of a witness. Phase 2 (2 Groups) 1. Male or female subjects ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years. 2. ASIA impairment grade A or B. 3. An injury between D1 and D11, both inclusive, and D12 without motor zone of partial preservation (ZPP). 4. Single traumatic spinal cord injury as defined by MRI. 5. Injury occurring between 24 and 72 h before undergoing DSS and treatment. 6. Clinically and haemodynamically stable enough to undergo DSS. 7. Able to give informed consent either in writing or orally in the presence of a witness. 1. Participated in a previous clinical study and received an investigational product within 28 days of SCI (within 5 years of SCI if the investigational product is a cellbased medicine). 2. Radiological or MRI or DSS evidence of complete spinal cord transection or equivalent severe lesion or abnormality. 3. Inability to unequivocally identify the injection sites. 4. Multiple injuries to the neurological spinal cord at different levels. 5. Patients with any of these additional conditions: 1. Penetrating spinal cord injuries. 2. Associated trauma or injury to the brachial and / or lumbosacral plexus. 6. Active infection in the surgical area. 7. Haemodynamic instability contraindicating DSS procedure in the time frame defined for inclusion in the trial. 8. Multiple organ failure. 9. Significant head injury (Score on the Glasgow scale less than or equal to 13 and / or abnormal MRI/CT, meaning oedema, axial lesion and/or haemorrhage) or other injury that in the investigator's opinion is sufficient to interfere with the assessment of spinal cord function or compromise the validity of patient data. 10. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation that does not allow a prior clinical examination. 11. Inability to communicate with the neurological examiner so that the validity of patient data could be unreliable. 12. Coma or significant impairment in the level of consciousness, including unconsciousness due to sedativeanalgesic medications, that interferes with the performance or interpretation of assessments specific in the protocol. 13. Preexisting or current significant diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV, epilepsy, neoplastic disease or other diseases that could cause neurological deficits including syphilis, myelopathy, and polyneuropathy. 14. Background or acute episode of GuillainBarre syndrome. 15. History of meningitis or meningoencephalitis. 16. History of current autoimmune disease. 17. Patients with uncontrolled blood diathesis or under anticoagulant or antiplatelet pharmacological therapy. 18. Presence of any psychiatric illness, as defined by the DSMIVTR, or medically unstable illness which can reasonably be expected to pose an increased risk to on participating in the study, or which causes a significant deterioration of the clinical course of the patient. Secondary depression is expressly excluded. 19. Drug abuse as defined by DSMIVTR during the 6 months prior to SCI. 20. Pregnant women or women of childbearing age who are not using an appropriate method of contraception and, moreover, are not willing to continue to use it for the duration of the trial. If the patient is menopausal or sterile, it must be documented in the medical record. 21. Women who are breastfeeding if unwilling to stop at the time of recruitment. 22. History of lifethreatening allergy or immune reaction. 23. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of FAB117HC. 24. Patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillin, streptomycin, enzymes (trypsin or collagenase), bovine serum or DMSO.</criteria>
