	<brief_title>A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multicenter Study of Ixazomib Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Adult Japanese Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, open label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The patient population will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, and who meet other outlined eligibility criteria. Patients will receive study drug (ixazomib 4.0 mg) on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients may continue to receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first. Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities. Patients with a low creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min will receive a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be escalated to 15 mg once daily after 2 cycles if the patient is not responding to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. If renal function normalizes (ie, creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min) and the patient continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be escalated to 25 mg once daily. Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in the study: four times a treatment cycle for the first 2 cycles, twice a treatment cycle for the 3rd cycle, and then once a treatment cycle for the remainder of their participation in the active treatment and, if applicable, the PFS and OS follow-up phases of the study. Response will be assessed by investigator according to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria for all patients every 4 weeks until PD. Central laboratory data will be used for serum M-protein, urine M-protein and serum free light chain. All patients will be followed for survival after progression. Patients will be contacted every 12 weeks until death or termination of the study by the sponsor. The study will be closed at 24 months from the enrollment of the last patient.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female Japanese participants 20 years of age or older. 2. Multiple myeloma diagnosed according to standard criteria either currently or at the time of initial diagnosis. The initial diagnosis must be symptomatic MM, although the relapsed disease does not need to be symptomatic. 3. Participants must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3 measurements based on central laboratory data: Serum Mprotein: &gt;=1 g/dL (&gt;= 10 g/L). Urine Mprotein: &gt;=200 mg/24 hours. Serum free light chain assay: involved free light chain level &gt;=10 mg/dL (&gt;= 100 mg/L), provided that the serum free light chain ratio is abnormal. 4. Participants with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior therapies. This participant population includes the following 3 categories of participants: Participants who relapsed from their therapy(s) but were not refractory to any previous therapy. Participants who were refractory to all lines of previous therapy(s) (ie, participants who have never responded to any therapies received). Participants who were relapsed from at least 1 line of therapy AND additionally were refractory to at least 1 line of therapy. For the purposes of this study, refractory MM is defined as PD on therapy or PD within 60 days after the last dose of a given therapy. A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment program. This may consist of 1 or more planned cycles of singleagent therapy or combination therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy. Autologous and allogenic transplants are permitted. 5. Participants must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL and platelet count &gt;= 75,000/mm3. Platelet transfusions to help participants meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days prior to screening. Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt; 3 x ULN. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 mL/min. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 7. Participants who received prior allogenic transplant must have no active graftversushost disease (GVHD). 8. Participants who meet the following conditions: Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 24 months before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR Females of childbearing potential must: 1. Have a negative pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 to 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to starting Cycle 1 of lenalidomide 2. Agree to practice true abstinence or to begin TWO reliable methods of birth control (1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME) for at least 28 days before starting study treatment through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment. 3. Agree to ongoing pregnancy testing 4. Adhere to the guidelines of the RevMate program Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), must: Agree to avoid sexual intercourse completely 90 days after the last dose of study treatment. Agree to practice true abstinence or to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and 90 days after the last dose of study treatment if their partner is of childbearing potential, even if they have had a successful vasectomy, and Adhere to the guidelines of the RevMate program 9. Thromboembolism prophylaxis is required based on published standard or institutional standard of care. 10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 11. Participant is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 1. Participants who were refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome inhibitorbased therapy at any line. Refractory disease is defined as PD on treatment or PD within 60 days after the last dose of a given therapy. Participants who progressed the disease after 60 days from the last dose of a given therapy will be considered relapsed and are eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants who were refractory to thalidomidebased therapy are eligible. 2. Female participants who are breast feeding or pregnant. 3.
