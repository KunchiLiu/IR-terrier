	<brief_summary>Thyroid disorders, in particular hypothyroidism, are associated with gastrointestinal impairment, such as celiac disease. A study reported an increased prevalence of celiac disease in a large cohort of children affected by congenital hypothyroidism, underlying the relationship between these two conditions. The hypothesis of our study is that the onset of celiac disorder may be related to the gut concentration of thyroid hormone (TH) in hypothyroidism patients treated with replacement therapy. In fact, TH replacement therapy showed a low bioavailability with a consequent high gut concentration. Two different pharmaceutical formulations (liquid and solid, per os) are available. The liquid one has a better absorption profile and bioavailability than the solid; therefore, it is associated with a low TH intestinal concentration. According to our hypothesis, the solid TH formulation could increase the microbial diversity in the gut instead of the liquid form, due to the high local TH concentration. Based on these findings, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of two different pharmaceutical formulations of TH on the gut in terms of modification of gut microbiota, inflammatory parameters and gut absorption.</brief_summary>
