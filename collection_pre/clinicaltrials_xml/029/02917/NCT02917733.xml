	<brief_summary>This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY3039478 (study drug) has been specially prepared to contain radiolabeled carbon [¹⁴C]. [¹⁴C] is a naturally occurring radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help determine how the drug appears in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered by mouth to healthy people. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will last about 10 weeks for each participant.</brief_summary>
