	<brief_summary>This project aims to assess the ability of cardiac imaging (cardiac MRI and Doppler-echocardiography) post-processing tools to predict a combined end-point of intraventricular thrombosis, silent brain infarcts, clinical stroke and peripheral arterial embolism in patients with first acute myocardial infarction and ventricular dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Silent Brain Infarct And Thrombosis in Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a clinical situation that entails an increased risk of both subclinical and clinically devastating cardioembolic events. This increased risk of embolic phenomena may be related to blood stasis caused by alterations in the blood flow inside the left ventricle (LV) after AMI. Using flow velocity measurements obtained by cardiac MRI and Doppler-echocardiography it is possible to quantify the stasis in the LV and assess its relation to the risk of embolic events. The ability of cardiac imaging (cardiac MRI and Doppler-echocardiography) post-processing tools to predict embolic events in a cohort of 92 patients with a first AMI and left ventricular dysfunction shall be addressed. The potential confusion generated by the possible existence of paroxysmal AF will be controlled by implanting cardiac monitoring devices in random order in a subset of patients.</detailed_description>
