	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the effectiveness of passive ultrasonic irrigation with that of traditional syringe irrigation on the removal of bacteria and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) from root canals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Passive Ultrasonic Irrigation on the Reduction of Bacteria and Endotoxins in Root Canals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty teeth with apical periodontitis were randomly allocated into two groups according to the irrigation protocol, passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI, n = 20) and syringe and needle irrigation (NI, n = 20). Microbiological sampling was performed before (S1) and after the root canal preparation (S2), after the tested irrigation protocols (S3). Total bacteria counts were determined by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay; and the endotoxin levels by the LAL assay.</detailed_description>
