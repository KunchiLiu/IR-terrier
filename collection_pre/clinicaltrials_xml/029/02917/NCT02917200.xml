	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Different DAV132 Dose Regimens in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to evaluate the performances of different DAV132 dose regimens in healthy volunteers: - To capture antibiotic residues in the colon without interfering with its systemic pharmacokinetics. - To prevent antibiotic-induced changes of the intestinal microbiota. In addition, the security of DAV132 given at different dose regimens during 7 days will be evaluated. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, repeated doses, 12 parallel groups, open-label study, blinded to analytical and microbiological evaluations.</detailed_description>

Considered as healthy individuals according to a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history and full physical examination). 4. Normal vital signs after 10min rest in supine position: systolic blood pressure 95 140 mmHg inclusive, diastolic blood pressure 45 90 mmHg inclusive and heart rate (pulse rate) 50 100 bpm inclusive. Out of range values can be accepted if judged clinically non relevant by the Investigator. 5. Normal 12lead ECG after 10min rest in supine position: PR interval 120 220 msec exclusive, QRS complex &lt;120 msec, and QT interval &lt;430 msec if male or &lt;450 msec if female. 6. Normal hematology and blood biochemistry test results. Out of range values can be accepted if judged clinically non relevant by the Investigator excepted for potassium and magnesium for which normal values are required. 7.

Subjects with a family history of, or actual glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency should be excluded. Subjects with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption should be excluded. 6. Contraindications to charcoal, or risk factors for adverse events associated to charcoal other than those already included into the inclusion/exclusion criteria: known hypersensitivity to charcoal, risk of gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation or hemorrhage, recent digestive tract surgery. 7.

Any vaccination within the last 28 days. 11. Blood donation, regardless of the volume, within 2 months before inclusion and during the study. 12. Any previous administration of medication and any previous intake of herbal products known to interfere with drug metabolism such as St John's Wort within the last 14 days, with the exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone replacement therapy or paracetamol. Criteria associated with addiction 13. History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse (alcohol consumption more than 40 g per day). 14.
