	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep TMS (dTMS) for treatment of different psychiatric and neurological disorders. Subjects will be randomized into two groups: experimental (treated with pharmacotherapy and TMS) and control group (treated only with pharmacotherapy). They and their clinicians will complete a battery of instruments that measure relevant symptoms, global functioning and quality of life. The first measurement will be done after the inclusion and before treatment. The second measurement will be made immediately after the end of treatment (after 4 weeks). The other measurements (follow-up) will be made after 3 and 6 months.</brief_summary>
