	<brief_title>Health-Related Quality of Life in Cases of Cubital Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As there are many different surgical procedures to address cubital tunnel syndrome, HRQOL will be used to determine if anterior intramuscular transposition provides patients with positive outcomes. To measure HRQOL 3 specific scales will be administered: 1. A generic scale, the Short Form-36 2. A condition specific scale, the Patient-Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation (PRUNE) 3. A utility scale, the EuroQOL, five dimension questionnaire These scales are widely reported in the literature, are valid, reliable and easy to fill out. Using these scales we can determine HRQOL as well as Quality Adjusted Life Years, which, allows us to do a cost-utility analysis (economic evaluation) on this specific procedure. Patients will be asked to fill out the above mentioned questionnaires, as well as perform 2 performance tests (grip strength, and a moving 2-point discrimination test) at the following time points: 1. 1 week prior to surgery 2. 1 day prior to surgery 3. 3 months post surgery 4. 6 months post surgery 5. 12 months post surgery</detailed_description>
