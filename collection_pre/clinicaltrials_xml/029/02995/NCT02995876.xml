	<brief_summary>When missing tooth structure or teeth are replaced, minimal biologic risk should be involved to re-establish function and esthetics. The increased use of the adhesive technique and preservation of dental tissues have greatly impacted conservative tooth preparation design. The development use of zirconia technology and all-ceramic systems has opened the potential for fabrication inlays zirconia bridges with durability and good aesthetics. The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the placement of inlay bridge made of a Y-TZP framework veneered with a pressed ceramic and bonded with a completely adhesive approach in the replacement of a single missing tooth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Performance of Inlay Zirconia Bridges</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluates the use of inlay bridge made of Zirconia and all ceramic systems with three designs in the replacement process of one single tooth (i.e. a missing premolar or molar.) The first design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface from e-max press. The second design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface from e-max press and the internal surface coated with glaze layer to improve the adhesion. The third design is going to be fabricated with CAD/CAM Zirconia and the occlusal surface from e-max press and the internal surface coated with a layer of e-max ceramic press to improve the adhesion.</detailed_description>
