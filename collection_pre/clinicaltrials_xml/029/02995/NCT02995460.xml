Patients have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and a higher body mass index. A pilot study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has shown positive effect on inflammation after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether high-intensity interval training affects the disease activity in psoriatic arthritis. This intervention is believed to result in benefits in terms of inflammation, body composition and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
