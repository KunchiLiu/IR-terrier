	<brief_summary>To determine the effect of using a robotic exoskeleton to allow walking practice after stroke, compared to usual physiotherapy care, on recovery of walking ability and secondary outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exoskeleton for Post-Stroke Recovery of Ambulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants admitted to inpatient stroke rehabilitation for physiotherapy services will be randomly assigned to either the Exoskeleton Program or Usual Care Program. Individuals in the Exoskeleton Program will have their usual physiotherapy sessions replaced with the exoskeleton intervention. The exoskeleton will allow standing and walking from the first sessions in rehabilitation, as the exoskeleton provides the physical support to allow walking in full weight-bearing without being limited by therapist fatigue and lifting requirements. Individuals in the Usual Care Program will receive standard physiotherapy care, which is individualized and hands-on with their therapist to regain walking, mobility, and independent function. Both groups will be conducted 3-5 days a week, 30-60 minutes per session until discharge (to a maximum of 8 weeks). Participants will be assessed at baseline, discharge, and 6-months after starting rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
