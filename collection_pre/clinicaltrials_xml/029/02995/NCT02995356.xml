	<brief_summary>Patients who have doubt for ectopic pregnancy will be enrolled for our study. These patients will be determined with using irregular increased human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) results and no embryo reported ultrasonography results. Plasma and cervical fluid samples will be taken from these patients and axonemal dynein heavy chain 5 and creatine kinase levels of samples will be compared between patients who have doubt for ectopic pregnancy and patients who have intrauterine pregnancy. Concentration of these proteins in samples will be evaluated. If any difference will be found between groups in favour of ectopic pregnancy, these results might be interpreted as these proteins useful for early detecting of the ectopic pregnancy.</brief_summary>
