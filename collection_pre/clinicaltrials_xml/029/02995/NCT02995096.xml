	<brief_summary>Recurrence after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents an important cause of mortality for this surgical population. In addition to tumor characteristics, It has been suggested that pre-treatment and sirolimus-based immunosuppression may affect recurrence and survival. With data from the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR) database, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of tumor characteristics, pre-transplant treatment and immunosuppression regimens on survival after liver transplantation for HCC.</brief_summary>
