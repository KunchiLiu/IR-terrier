	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility study to evaluate dual-energy (DE) contrast-enhanced (CE) digital mammography to detect breast cancer in patients with increased breast density (BI-RADS category c or d). Eligible patients will be invited to have full-field digital mammography and dual-energy (DE) contrast-enhanced (CE) digital mammography to compare accuracy of the imaging methods for the detection of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
