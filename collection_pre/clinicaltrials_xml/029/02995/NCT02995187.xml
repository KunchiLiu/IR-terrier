	<brief_title>Study of Apatinib as Third-line and Later Therapy in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although fist-line therapy with Cisplatin and etoposide(EP)or Carboplatin and etoposide(CE)and second-line therapy with topotecan has been given, patients with extensive small cell lung cancer(ED-SCLC) still relapse and 2-year survival is less than 10%. There is no standard treatment recommendation for this group of patients who failed to second-line therapy and had good performance status. Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects and better patient tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in small cell lung cancer is still lack of evidence-based medicine. And this clinical trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in recurrent SCLC patients in our center.</detailed_description>

Signed and dated informed consent.Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedure. 1. Patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer; 2. Imaging (CT or MRI) results indicate that the existence of central tumors locally invading the large vessel could be detected, or apparent pulmonary cavity or necrotizing tumors; 3. Patients with clinical symptoms of brain metastases or meningeal metastasis; 4. Patients with poorcontrolled arterial hypertension (systolic pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) despite standard medical management; 5. Suffered from grade II or above myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, uncontrolled arrhythmias (including QT interval male ≥ 450 ms, female ≥ 470 ms).

Patients who received major surgical operations or experienced severe traumatic injuries, bone fracture, or ulcers within 4 weeks before screening; 9. Patients who had obvious hemoptysis within 2 months before screening, or experienced daily hemoptysis with a volume more than half a tea spoon (2.5ml) or above; Patients who experienced bleeding symptoms of clinical significance , or with confirmed bleeding tendency such as hemorrhage of digestive tract, hemorrhagic gastric ulcer, baseline occult blood in stool ++ and above, or vasculitis, etc; 10.

Allergic to any ingredients of Apatinib; 12. Evidence of significant medical illness that in the investigator's judgment will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and completion of the study.</criteria>
