	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this trial is to determine if hydrodistention at the time of intradetrusor injection of botulinum toxin A has additional benefit in patients with refractory overactive bladder (OAB) and urgency symptoms compared to intradetrusor injection of botulinum toxin A alone. Consented patients will be randomized to hydrodistention at a pressure of 80 cm H2O for 5 minutes, prior to the intradetrusor injection of 100 units of botulinum toxin A (hydrodistention group) or intradetrusor injection of 100 units of botulinum toxin A alone (botulinum toxin A alone group). The primary aim will be subjective improvement measured as change from baseline at 12 weeks using the OAB-q bother subscale.</brief_summary>
