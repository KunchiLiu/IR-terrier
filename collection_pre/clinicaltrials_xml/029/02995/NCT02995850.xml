	<brief_title>A Phase Ib/II Study of Efficacy and Feasibility of Cytoreductive Surgery, Extensive Peritoneal Lavage, Hyperthermicintraperitoneal Chemotherapy and Post-operative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Combination in Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal metastases in gastric cancer are considered to indicate terminal disease due to poor prognosis because systemic chemotherapy is unlikely to accumulate in peritoneal nodules in cytotoxic concentrations. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested to improve survival in select patients with limited peritoneal spread, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of 8 to 14 months. It remains unclear, however, which regimen is best and who have benefits from CRS and HIPEC. Herein, we has conducting prospective phase Ib/II trial of CRC and HIPEC with intraperitoneal paclitaxel and cisplatin, and oral S-1 in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient age of 19 years or older and age of 75 years or younger. 2. Histologically proven gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma with peritoneal metastasis under diagnostic laparoscopy. 3. Primary tumor measured as resectable in preoperative images. 4. Performance status based on ECOG : 0~1 5. No prior treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.) 6. Adequate hepatic, renal, and hematologic function ANC≥1,500/uL, hemoglobin≥9.0g/dL platelet≥100,000/uL total Bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 × upper normal limit Creatinine&lt;1.5mg/dL AST/ALT, ALP ≤ 2.5 x upper normal limit 7. Patients who can understand this study and sign the consent form. 1. Patient who has distant metastasis or paraaortic lymph node metastasis or retroperitoneal metastasis except peritoneal metastasis. (But the patient who has ovarian metastasis with resectable status can be enrolled.) 2. Primary tumor cannot be resected because of direct invasion to other important organ. (But, if the invaded organ can be resected together, such as spleen, gallbladder, distal pancreas, and liver, the patient can be enrolled) 3. HER2 positive patient 4. Patient with active viral infection (for example, HIV, HBV, HCV, except stable status of HBV infection) 5. Pregnant patient, or patient in breastfeeding, or who is planning pregnancy. 6. Patients in exclusion criteria of TS1, cisplatin, paclitaxel Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to these drugs Patients with severe bone marrow depression patients who has severe hepatic, renal disorder patients who has hereditary problem or galactose intolerance, lapp lactase deficiency, or glucosegalactose malabsorption 7. Patients who has important medical problem or infection Cerebrovascular accident(CVA) within 1 year Heart attack within 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure(CHF), severe arrhythmia Major operation or injury within 28 days Severe and not recovered wound, ulcer, fracture Uncontrolled bleeding disease Recent active gastric infection 8. Patient with another primary cancer within last 5 years 9. Patient on medication which can interact with the drugs used in this study (fluoropyrimidinegroup antineoplastic agents, flucytosine, phenytoin, etc) 10. Patients with other systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy 11. Patients with psychiatric or neurologic disorder so that he or she cannot understand and sign the consent form.</criteria>
