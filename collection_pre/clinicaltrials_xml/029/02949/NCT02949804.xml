	<brief_summary>Almost everyone is aware these days is aware about the risk of smoking. Still many people start this habit specially in early life and during college year. We aim to investigate in this study if there is a drive to smoke in people with vasovagal tendency to improve their symptoms, even if not aware of this. Vasovoagal symptoms are common and include dizziness, smoking, sweating, abdominal pain, fatigue and syncope. Some studies have shown correlation between smoking and a positive tilt table test which is indicative of vasovagal tendency. By collecting the information regarding smoking habit and vasovagal symptoms analysis can be done to see if there is correlation between these two factors</brief_summary>
