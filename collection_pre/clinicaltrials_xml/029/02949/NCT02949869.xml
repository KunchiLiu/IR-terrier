	<brief_summary>The reported rate of unsuccessful traditional LP in children (defined as the inability to obtain cerebrospinal fluid or obtaining a traumatic puncture) is as high as 50%. Many factors affect LP success including provider experience. CSF is obtained by puncturing the subarachnoid space (traditionally at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspinous process space), and many have hypothesized that the width of this space may predict success. Anecdotally, trainees and those with less experience, tend to perform the LP too low (caudally), where the subarachnoid space tapers, or too laterally (off the midline) resulting in higher failure rates. The investigators seek to determine if planned LP insertion sites vary between training and attendings, and if so, could the decreased success be explained by smaller subarachnoid spaces.</brief_summary>
