	<brief_summary>This study evaluates difference of the endotracheal tube cuff pressure between a tapered- versus a cylindrical- shaped cuff after changing from neutral to hyperextension of neck. Fifty patients undergoing thyroidectomy are randomly allocated into two groups (tapered- and cylindrical-shaped cuff). Endotracheal tube cuff pressure is initially set at 20 cmH20 in the supine neutral position and is measured after the change to the neck extension.</brief_summary>
