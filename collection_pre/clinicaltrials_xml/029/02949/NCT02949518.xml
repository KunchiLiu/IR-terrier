	<brief_summary>Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways have been shown to decrease length of stay and perioperative complications in a range of surgical specialties. To date, ERAS has not been studied in patients presenting for spine surgery. The investigators have recently developed an interdisciplinary pathway for spine surgery patients based on the latest available evidence and guidelines. The aim of this trial is to compare the investigators ERAS pathway with conventional perioperative management in patients undergoing 1-2 level posterior lumbar fusion.</brief_summary>
