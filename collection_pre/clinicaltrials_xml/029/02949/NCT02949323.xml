	<brief_summary>The incidence of nephrolithiasis in children has been reported to increase by approximately 6-10% annually, and the incidence is currently 50 per 100,000 children with high recurrent rate. Investigators aimed to determine the metabolic risk factors in Chinese children through metabolic evaluation. In order to identify diagnostic criteria of hypocitraturia and hyperoxaluria in western country wether adapt to Chinese children, investigators aim to determine normal urine levels of oxalate and citrate in children without kidney stone.</brief_summary>
