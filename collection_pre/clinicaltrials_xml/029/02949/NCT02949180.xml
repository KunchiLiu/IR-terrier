	<detailed_description>Introduction This algorithm was validated earlier in a clinical trial with retrospective Data. The results were published accordingly.The algorithm is implemented in the commercial App Preventicus Heartbeats. DETECT AF is designed as prospective follow up trial. Study design Prospective, blinded, multicenter international trial. Methods The subjects will be asked to position a smartphone on their index finger to allow their pulse curve to be recorded for five minutes. At the same time, an ecg will be recorded using an digital mobile ecg recorder as a reference. Data will be collected on person-related information, comorbidities and medication (estimated overall duration/patient &lt;20 min). No follow-up is planned. Analogous to predecessor studies, the pulse wave curve data are coded with the patient's identification number (ID) and externally analyzed at Preventicus; based on the results, the subjects will be assigned to SR/AF groups. After evaluation of all files, the grouped results will be aggregated, unblinded and evaluated under monitoring. Primary target parameters are the app's sensitivity and specificity in correctly detecting atrial fibrillation compared to an automatically interpreted ECG. Secondary target parameters include the proportion of non-evaluable recordings in the overall study.</detailed_description>
