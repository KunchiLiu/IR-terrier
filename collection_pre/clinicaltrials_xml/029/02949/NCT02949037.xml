	<brief_summary>Multi-site feasibility study designed to assist type-2 diabetes patients in self-care activities. The study includes Bluetooth-enabled medical devices (i.e. scales, blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, and activity monitors) for both intervention and control groups. Those in the intervention group will have the devices linked too a mobile health care environment that provides key benefits that include: device data trending, reinforcing tailored behavioral messages, and enhanced communication with the clinic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multi-site phased study, conducted within the Military Health System that includes a user-centered design phase and a patient centered medical home (PCMH)-based feasibility trial. In Phase I the investigators will assess both patient and clinician preferences and usability regarding the enhancement of the enabling technology capabilities for Type 2 diabetes chronic self-care management. The data from the experience will be coded and analyzed by the research team and the technology will be adapted accordingly before Phase II. Phase II research is a single-blinded 12-month feasibility study that seeks to include the enabling technology to support diabetes self-care management with tailored behavioral messaging aimed at reinforcing and encouraging self-care behavior based on patients' readiness. We have included safety thresholds that alert patients and clinical team under certain conditions.</detailed_description>
