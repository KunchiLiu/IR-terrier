	<brief_summary>Tracheal resection and reconstruction (TRR) is the treatment of choice for most patients with tracheal stenosis or tracheal tumors .The postintubation tracheal stenosis is the common indication for (TRR).The immediate postoperative period can be anxiety provoking for some reasons such as requirement to maintain a flexed neck, oxygen mask, and surgical pain which inadequately treated. Bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) is a popular regional anesthesia technique for its feasibility and efficacy. The use of regional anesthesia in combination with general anesthesia may lighten the level of general anesthesia required , provide prolonged postoperative analgesia and reduce the requirements for opioid analgesics Local anesthetic infiltration into the surgical incision can relieve pain at the wound site after surgery, as part of multimodal analgesic approach. Levobupivacaine, is "S"-enantiomer of bupivacaine, has strongly emerged as a safer alternative for regional anesthesia than bupivacaine . Levobupivacaine has been found to be equally efficacious as bupivacaine, but with a superior pharmacokinetic profile. Clinically, levobupivacaine has been observed to be well tolerated in regional anesthesia techniques both after bolus administration and continuous post-operative infusion.</brief_summary>
