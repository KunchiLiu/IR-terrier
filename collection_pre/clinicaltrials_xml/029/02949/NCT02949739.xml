	<brief_title>Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Amongst South Asians With Central Obesity and Prediabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the proposed iHealth-T2D study are: 1. Determine whether intensive lifestyle modification vs usual care reduces risk of T2D (primary endpoint) amongst South Asians with i. central obesity; ii. prediabetes and iii. overall (with central obesity and / or obesity). 2. Investigate secondary endpoints, including health gains in family members. Identify social, demographic and environmental factors influencing primary and secondary endpoints. 3. Carry out a health economic analysis of lifestyle modifications vs usual care for prevention of T2D on the Indian subcontinent and Europe. Quantify the cost-effectiveness of screening by waist circumference vs HbA1c.</detailed_description>
