	<brief_summary>Scirrhous gastric cancer, also known as linitis plastic or Borrmann type 4, is an aggressive tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. Aggressive surgical procedures and adjuvant chemotherapies have not improved the survival rate. The purpose of this study is to determine whether neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with SEEOX regimen via intra-arterial and intravenous administration are effective in the treatment of Borrmann type 4 gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With SEEOX Regimen for Borrmann Type 4 Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer patients who diagnosed as Borrmann type 4 would be included in this study.They would receive 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with SEEOX regimen via combined intra-arterial and intravenous administration. The treatment schedule consisted of 3 courses (each, 2-week administration and 1-week withdrawal) of intra-arterial administration of oxaliplatin (150mg), etoposide (100mg) and epirubicin(30mg) by Seldinger method on day 1 and oral S-1(120mg) on days 1-14, followed by radical surgery.The efficacy and toxicity of SEEOX regimen would be examined.</detailed_description>
