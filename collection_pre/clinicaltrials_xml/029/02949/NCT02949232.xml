	<brief_summary>Treatment with prednisolone can be used as a proof of concept to investigate the possibility of immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia. It is expected that daily treatment with prednisolone in addition to antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptoms and improves cognition, as compared to placebo. The investigators propose to investigate the effects of administering the corticosteroid prednisolone versus placebo in addition to standard antipsychotic medication in patients with early stage schizophrenia or related disorders, hypothesizing that a decrease in the overall low-grade cerebral inflammation due to prednisolon treatment will be expressed as a decrease in overall symptom severity., Secondly, addition of prednisolone is hypothesised to slow down cognitive deterioration in recent-onset psychosis patients. Finally, the investigators aim to determine whether indirect immunological parameters of the hypothesised low grade inflammation status in schizophrenia are shifted due to the addition of prednisolone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prednisolone Addition for Patients With Recent-onset Psychotic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the current study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of additional treatment with prednisolone on symptomatic improvement, global functioning, cognition and on immunological parameters in patients with early-stage psychotic disorder, applying a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled add-on design. A placebo-controlled design was chosen in order to differentiate between clinical effects of prednisolone and effects associated with experimental treatment, such as induced expectations of participants. Prednisolone or placebo is provided next to existent antipsychotic medication as the investigators do not intend to replace existing treatment, this study being a Proof of Concept trial. It would carry considerable risks for patients to taper down existent antipsychotic medication and randomize patients to either placebo or a type of therapy for which the efficacy still has to be proven, even for a short period of time. 90 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder, or psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) will be included, with an age of 18-70 years and a time interval between the onset of psychosis and study entry not exceeding seven years. All 90 in- and outpatients will be randomized 1:1 to either prednisolone or placebo daily for 6 weeks. Prednisolone will be initiated at 40mg/day for 3 days and the 4 remaining days of the first week 30mg/dag will be used. During the treatment period, patients will be seen at weekly intervals to assess symptom severity, depressive mood and suicidal ideation, global functioning and side effects.</detailed_description>
