	<brief_summary>A UK prospective, single-centre feasibility study investigating the effects of exercise therapy on functional capacity in patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation.

The following will be assessed at weeks 0, 6 and 12 weeks: feasibility (recruitment, compliance, safety, patients perception), functional capacity (ISWT, SPBT), psychological wellbeing (HADS questionnaire) and quality of life (EQ-5D)</brief_summary>
