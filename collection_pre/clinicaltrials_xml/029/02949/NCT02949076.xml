	<brief_summary>Cancer and its treatment can have profound effects on skeletal muscle, the most well-recognized being atrophy, weakness and diminished oxidative capacity. These adaptations negatively impact quality of life, treatment decisions and survival. Despite these consequences, the factors promoting these adaptations remain poorly defined and understudied in human patients. To address this gap in knowledge, our goal in this study is to examine the role of muscle disuse as a regulator of muscle size and function in human cancer patients</brief_summary>
