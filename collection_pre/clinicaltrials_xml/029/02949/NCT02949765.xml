	<brief_summary>Anemia and sideropenia are a common effect of untreated celiac disease. In a portion of patients a certain degree of hypoferritinemia persist after the diagnosis, despite a good compliance and clinical response to gluten-free diet. These patients are usually premenopausal women in whom the cyclic menstrual bleeding and the oral iron intake are not balanced. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of a pharmacological therapy, frequently not tolerated, and a dietary approach through a iron-rich diet in this subset of patients.</brief_summary>
