	<brief_summary>Background: Previous suicide attempt is known to be a strong risk factor for repetition and repetition is common within the first year after an episode of deliberate self-harm (DSH). There has been growing interest in brief interventions for this population that are focused on maintaining long-term contact and/or offering re-engagement with services when needed. Despite telephone-delivered interventions have shown promising results in suicide reattempt prevention, subjective impact of such brief contact interventions and effectiveness mechanisms have never been evaluated.</brief_summary>
