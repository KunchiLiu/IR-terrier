	<brief_title>A Study of Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy Using the Caudal-to-cranial Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the caudal-to-cranial approach with the medial-to-lateral approach in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for the advance right colon cancer. A prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed in the GI department,the Guangdong provincial hospital of Chinese Medicine from October 2016 to October 2024.The sample size，150 cases with advanced right colon cancer, will be needed after calculated by the statistics .The 150 cases will be randomly divided into two groups: laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy using the caudal-to-cranial(CtC) approach(GroupCtC) and laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy using the medial-to-lateral(MtL) approach (GroupMtL). Primary outcomes are the operative time，The secondary outcomes are the total blood loss,the number of lymph nodes dissected,the average time of ground activities,the time to first flatus,the hospital stay,the intra-operative complication and the post-operative complication，and others' outcomes are the Disease-free survival rate(DFS) at 3 years and 5 years,the Overall survival rate（OS）at 3 years and 5 years.The data in two groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
