	<brief_title>Radiological Evaluation of Radiesse Implantation in the Hands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiesse dermal filler is radiopaque and shows no overt radiographic safety concerns in a study of 58 patients after facial implantation, with Radiesse not always visible on plain X-rays. This Post Approval Safety study will evaluate if there are concerns after Radiesse implantation in the dorsum of hands, specifically if implantation interferes with radiological assessment by obscuring the bones of the hand. Hands will be scored according to the 5 point Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS), which ranges from 0 (No loss of fatty tissue) to 4 (Very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons).</detailed_description>
