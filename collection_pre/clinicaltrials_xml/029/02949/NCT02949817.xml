	<brief_summary>This study was designed to establish the clinical evidence for effect of video-game based rehabilitation therapy system using IMU sensors as a game interface, newly-developed in Korea, on upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy. First, the investigators would compare the effect of video-game based rehabilitation therapy to conventional occupational therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Digital Rehabilitation System With Wearable Multi-IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) Sensors on Upper Limb Functions in Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Purpose: to elucidate the effect of video-game based rehabilitation therapy system on upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy compared to conventional occupational therapy - Subjects: total 30 children with cerebral palsy whose upper limb functions are impaired (all 30 children will receive the conventional occupational therapy, but 15 of these children will receive the additional video-game based rehabilitation therapy) - Intervention: 4 weeks of therapy (6 days per week) - Studies: functional MRI, computerized motion analysis, upper limb functional assessment (MUUL, ULPRS), ADL evaluation, cognitive evaluation - Evaluation plan: 1) pre-intervention, 2) post-4 weeks of intervention, 3) 8 weeks after end of intervention</detailed_description>
