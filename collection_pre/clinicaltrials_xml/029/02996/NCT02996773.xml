	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of substituting day +4 cyclophosphamide with post-transplant bendamustine in myeloablative (MAC) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HHCT) for advanced leukemia and lymphoma patients. The phase I component of the study is to evaluate the safety of completely substituting the second dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) given on day +4 with bendamustine (PT-BEN). The phase II component of the study will continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subjects who receive PT-CY on day +3 and PT-BEN on day +4. Approximately, a total of 32 subjects will be treated under this protocol. Approximately 12 to 15 subjects will be used as control, subjects that receive no PT-BEN, for direct comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haploidentical BMT With Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide and Bendamustine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will follow the standard-of-care bone marrow transplant (BMT), with the only exception being to gradually substitute post-transplant cyclophosphamide (on day +4 after BMT) with bendamustine. Three dose levels are planned for the phase I component of the study, consisting of a combination of sequentially reduced doses of cyclophosphamide and increased doses of bendamustine (on day +4 after BMT) with the full dose cyclophosphamide on day +3 after BMT remaining unchanged. Control patients will be patients that have declined to participate in the main trial but will receive haploidentical BMT with the current standard of two days of PT-CY (and no PT-BEN) and will be consented for the immune monitoring studies only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be willing and able to provide written consent/assent for the trial. Diagnosed with one of the following highrisk malignancies, which require hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) but do not have an available Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)matched related or unrelated donor or acceptable cord blood High risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 1st complete remission (CR1) or greater High risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in CR1 or greater High risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) failing or intolerant to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) or in accelerated, blastic phase, or in second or subsequent chronic phase Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) Lymphoma, (Hodgkin and NonHodgkins Lymphoma including marginal zone, follicular lymphoma, chemotherapysensitive largecell, mantle cell lymphoma, gray zone, and Burkitt's lymphoma in remission). At least one haploidentical related donor is available for bone marrow harvest. Molecular based HLA typing for the HLAA, B, Cw, beta chain (DRB1) and DQ Beta 1 Locus (DQB1loci) to the resolution is needed to establish haploidentity. A minimum match of 5/10 is required. No availability of an 8/8 HLAmatched related or unrelated donor or clinical urgency for transplant (e.g., needed within 48 weeks) at which time an acceptable unrelated donor will not be available. Refractory acute leukemia (&gt;5% blasts) or progressive disease Untreated or progressive central nervous system leukemia Refractory to chemotherapy lymphoma Comorbidities precluding patient's ability to tolerate BMT Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)/ Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Direct Bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN Creatinine greater than &gt;2 x ULN for age or creatinine clearance/glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;40 ml/min/1.73m2 Pulmonary function: Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 40% of normal or O2 Sat &lt;92% Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35% Active infection or documented fungal infection within 3 months of BMT HIV positive Karnofsky score (adults) &lt; 60% or Lansky score &lt; 50% (pediatrics). Please refer to section 25 of the protocol for the Karnofsky/Lansky assessments. Positive pregnancy test for women of childbearing age. Severe psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance to treatment unlikely and/or informed consent impossible. Any reason, at the investigator's discretion, that the participation of the patient in this protocol would not be in patient's best interest, or where the patient would be unable to adhere to the study requirements.</criteria>
