	<brief_summary>The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test is an in vitro diagnostic immuno-chromatographic assay intended for the qualitative detection of influenza A and influenza B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens in symptomatic patients. It is intended to aid in the rapid differential diagnosis of influenza A and/or B viral infections. This test is not intended for the detection of influenza C viruses. A negative test is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by cell culture of an FDA cleared molecular device. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Clinical Performance of the ARROW-FLU System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter prospective study will include nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients who present with flu-like symptoms and have undergone routine testing for influenza virus strain types A or B. The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test System qualitative results will be compared to a reference method for identification of Influenza A or B to determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the device. The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&amp;B Test system will be performed at CLIA-waived and non-CLIA waived clinical sites. Device operators at CLIA-waived sites will be untrained intended users (e.g. nurses, physician assistants, medical assistants, etc). A subject's participation in this study will consist of a single visit. Following completion of the informed consent process and a review of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to determine eligibility, each subject will receive a unique study identification number. After standard of care sampling, two (2) nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs will be obtained from each subject enrolled in the study. The swabs will be collected from the same nostril and alternated in their order of designation for testing (i.e. one for ARROW-FLU Influenza System testing and the other for reference testing. Any swab specimens required for standard of care testing will be collected prior to the specimens for this investigation. Investigational device operators will be blinded to standard of care testing results.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The subject may be of any age and either gender. 2. Preliminary assessment of the subject by the Investigator/Designee should be suggestive of influenza virus infection. Subject should present with an influenzalike febrile respiratory illness defined as both Presentation within that last 48 hours of developing a subjective feeling of being feverish and/or a temperature recorded at the clinic within the last 48 hours of greater than or equal to 100.5 F and At least two of the following symptoms: cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, headache, myalgia. 3. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to study enrollment: 1. A subject who is 18 years or older must be willing to give written informed consent and must agree to comply with study procedures. 2. The legal authorized representative of a subject who is under the age of 18 must give written informed consent and agree to comply with study procedures. Active written assent should be obtained from children of appropriate intellectual age (as defined by the clinical site's IRB). 1. The subject underwent a nasal wash/aspirate as part of standardofcare (SOC) testing during this study visit. 2. The subject is undergoing treatment currently or within the past seven (7) days of the study visit with either A nasallyadministered influenza vaccine (FluMist) Antiviral medication, which may include but is not limited to Amantadine (Symmetrel), Rimantadine (Flumadine), Zanamivir (Relenza), Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), or Ribavirin. 3. The subject is currently receiving or has received within the past thirty (30) days of the study visit anu experimental biologic, drug, or device including either treatment or therapy.</criteria>
