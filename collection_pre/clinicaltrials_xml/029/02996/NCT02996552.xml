	<brief_summary>The therapeutic strategy making in patients with ≤2 + functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is extremely controversial: some observational studies have suggested that perform the tricuspid annuloplasty in all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery have a dilated tricuspid ring, regardless of the degree of failure, may provide a clinical benefit, while in other observational studies such benefit has not been documented. The ESC Guidelines assign the class IIa recommendation in patients with tricuspid regurgitation≥ 2+ and dilated annulus, if surgery is concomitant to the repair or replacement of the mitral valve; this means that although the debate still ongoing, experimental evidence or expert opinion is in favor of the effectiveness and usefulness of the intervention in the patient with these clinical features. The aim of the study will be to establish the effectiveness of the tricuspid annuloplasty in the early stage. The investigators enrolled patient with TR≤2+ and annular dilation undergoing mitral valve repair. Primary end-point will be the freedom from recurrence of TR≥3+ and from progression by 2 degrees compared to pre-operative, at discharge and 12 months after surgery, assessment by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary endpoints are to demonstrate the superiority of combined treatment (M &amp; T Repair Group) compared to single treatment (Mitral-Only Group) at 5 and 10 years after surgery. This will be an experimental superiority, prospective, spontaneous, single-center, randomized trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to two parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1, to receive mitral repair only (Mitral-Only group) ore both mitral and tricuspid repair (M &amp; T Repair group).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Annuloplasty for Not-Severe TR in Patient Undergoing MV Repair Versus Mitral Repair Only (NOSTRUM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current guidelines recommend surgical treatment of secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with mild or moderate TR undergoing mitral valve (MV) surgery if significant dilatation of the tricuspid annulus is documented. Indeed, several observational series and small randomized studies have shown that in the presence of tricuspid annulus dilatation, not treating less than severe secondary TR may lead to progression of the tricuspid disease despite correction of the associated left-sided lesion. The vast majority of those data, however, come from series that did not include patients with functional mitral regurgitation (MR) or included a very limited number of them. Only a few reports describe the evolution of mild or moderate TR in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and results are usually limited to early or mid-term follow-up. In the past, the concept that less than severe secondary TR decreases after MV surgery alone was widely accepted and the size of the tricuspid annulus was not used to guide the decision-making process in terms of TR correction. The aim of the study will be to establish the effectiveness of the tricuspid annuloplasty in the early stage. The investigators enrolled patient with TR≤2+ and annular dilation undergoing mitral valve repair. This will be a single center single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to two parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1, to receive one of two surgical procedures. Patients that will match the inclusion criteria at the preoperative evaluation will be recruited. Patient will be randomized according to a computer-generated list of casual numbers. Information about patient allocation will be kept in closed opaque envelopes and nobody will know patient allocation before randomization. Patients will be blind to allocation. The day of surgery patients will be subsequently randomized into two arms: 1. M &amp; T Repair Group 2. Mitral-Only Group Each group will consist of 71 patients. All patients will receive the mitral valve repair and in patients enrolled in the M &amp; T Repair Group an Edwards MC3 Tricuspid ring will be implanted. Primary end-point will be the freedom from recurrence of TR≥3+ and from progression by 2 degrees compared to pre-operative, at discharge and 12 months after surgery, assessment by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary endpoints are to demonstrate the superiority of combined treatment (M &amp; T Repair Group) compared to single treatment (Mitral-Only Group) at 5 and 10 years after surgery. For statistical analysis the data will be expressed as "average + or - standard deviation" or a percentage. A "probability value" less than 0.05 will be considered as "statistically significant." Outcomes will be compared using the "X2" analysis for categorical variables and the "t-test" for those continuous. The data will be analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). Survival and freedom from reoperation and TR≥3+ or TR progression&gt; 2+ compared to preoperative, will be analyzed by the method of Kaplan-Meier. The analysis "univariate" and possibly "multivariate" of risk factors will be performed with "Cox proportional hazards regression".</detailed_description>
