	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether achieving 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH] Vit D) levels (&gt;40 ng/mL) among myocardial infarction patients will result in a reduction of cardiovascular-related adverse events. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive standard of care and half will receive clinical management of 25[OH] Vit D levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluating Vitamin D Normalization on Major Adverse Cardiovascular-Related Events Among Myocardial Infarction Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low 25[OH] Vit D levels have become a public epidemic with increasing recognition of its widespread insufficiency both in the United States and worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have associated low 25[OH] Vit D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, randomized trials are needed to establish the relevance of 25[OH] Vit D status to cardiovascular health. While a few randomized trials have evaluated vitamin D supplementation, none have "treated to target" (i.e., individual dosing so that adequate 25[OH] Vit D levels are obtained), but have rather given "blanket" doses regardless of 25[OH] Vit D level.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients, both male and female, &gt;18 years old 2. Undergone angiography for a MI (troponin positive [&gt;0.04 ng/mL] and ACS diagnosis) within the past month 3. Receive followup care at an Intermountain Healthcare facility 4. Not taking or taking &lt;1000 IU of vitamin D daily within the last 3 months 5. Willing to provide informed consent and participate in followup visits 1. Hypersensitivity to vitamin D products 2. History of previous vitamin D supplementation of &gt;1000 IU daily within the past 3 months (i.e., &gt;40% of the days during the past 3 months). 3. Systemic disease (including terminal cancer, cirrhosis, end stage COPD, etc) with a reduced (&lt;12 months) life expectancy 4. Hypercalcemia (calcium levels &gt;10.6 mg/dL) 5. Subject participation in previous investigational interventional studies within 30 days of the current study. 6. History of psychiatric illness/condition that would interfere with their ability to understand or complete the requirements of the study, a condition that in the opinion of the investigator or their designee places the subject at an unacceptable risk as a participant. 7. Pregnant and/or lactating women and women of child bearing potential who are not using acceptable means of contraception as determined by the clinical investigators.</criteria>
