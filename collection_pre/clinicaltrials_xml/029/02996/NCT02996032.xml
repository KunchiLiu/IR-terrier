	<brief_title>CRUSH STUDY: Calculating Readmission Risk by Ultrasound for Heart Failure Failure Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure (HF) resulting in congestion is the leading cause for admission in persons â‰¥65 years of age and 20-25% of such patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Efforts to treat HF are difficult without a simple method to detect early signs of congestion to direct therapy. Ultrasound can detect evidence of congestion by increased cardiac filling pressures two weeks prior to other markers of congestion such as weight gain or patient symptoms. Corrected flow time (FTc) measured by ultrasound, is an easy to perform vascular measure and correlates with cardiac filling pressures. Despite the relationship between FTc and filling pressures, this measure has never been studied in HF. The primary aim is to determine if FTc can predict patients at risk of readmission within 30 days. As a secondary aim, the investigators plan to validate a small study of patients reporting the ability of pulmonary ultrasound to predict readmissions. This study demonstrated pulmonary ultrasound was 100% sensitive and 68% specific for predicting readmission at 3 months, however this investigation was small and validation is needed. It is expected ultrasound will be able to accurately and safely predict patients who will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge. This proposal is aimed at identifying a noninvasive measure to better assess congestion from HF and predict readmissions.</detailed_description>
