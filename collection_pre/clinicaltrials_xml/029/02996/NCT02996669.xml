	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter longitudinal study that aims to identify, develop and validate a set of measures that can be used as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive and reliable objective measures of social impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that could serve as markers of long term clinical outcome. The main study will include 275 individuals: 200 ASD subjects between 6-11 years old, and 75 TD subjects roughly matched by age and sex to the ASD group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autism Biomarker Consortium for Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specified aims of this study are to accelerate the development of effective treatments for social impairment in ASD by validating outcome measures that will be sensitive and reliable assessments of response to treatment and electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers. These hypothesized outcomes could then be used to reduce the heterogeneity of samples via stratification, could possibly indicate early efficacy, and/or demonstrate target engagement. The consortium will conduct a naturalistic, longitudinal study of preschool and school-aged (6-11 years) children with ASD and typical development (TD) with intelligence quotient(s) (IQ) ranging from 50-150. Children will be assessed across three time points (Baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks) using clinician, caregiver and lab-based (LB) measures of social impairment, along with a battery of conceptually related EEG and ET tasks and independent ratings of clinical status.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For All Subjects: Males and Females Age 6 11 (&lt;11:5 at timepoint #1) Written parental consent obtained prior to any study procedures. IQ 60150 (ASD) and 80150 (TD) as assessed by the Differential Ability Scales 2nd Edition Participant and parent/guardian must be English speaking. For ADS Participants: Diagnosis of ASD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5), the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS2), and the Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised, short form (ADIR). Diagnostic evaluations will be completed by research staff and supervised by a licensed psychologist. If parents are biological, a minimum of the child and one parent (if accompanying the child at study visits) will be required to participate in the blood draw procedure. It is preferred that the child and both biological parents participate in the blood draw procedure, but the inability to obtain blood samples will not be exclusionary. For All Subjects: Known genetic or neurological syndrome with an established link to autism (in addition to ASD for ASD participants), but not events in which link to ASD is less well known/established (e.g., 16p11.2 CNVs, CHD8 mutations, Trisomy 21, 22q deletion syndrome). History of epilepsy or seizure disorder (except for history of simple febrile seizures or if the child is seizure free (regardless of the seizure type) for the past year). Motor or sensory impairment that would interfere with the valid completion of study measures including significant hearing or vision impairment not correctable by a hearing aid or glasses/contact lenses. Medication is not exclusionary, but subject must have been stable for 8 weeks on medication. History of significant prenatal/perinatal/birth injury (birth &lt;36 weeks AND weight &lt;2000 grams (approximately 4.5.lbs). History of neonatal brain damage. (e.g., with diagnosed hypoxic or ischemic event) Any other factor that the investigator feels would make assessment or measurement performance invalid. For ASD Participants: â€¢ Any known environmental circumstances that is likely to account for picture of autism in the proband (severe nutritional or psychological deprivation etc.). For TDs Participants: Known historical diagnosis of ASD or a sibling with ASD. An active psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc.). Participants will be screened using the Child/Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI5). Due to the instrument's high sensitivity and potential for false positives, any score in the clinical range will be reviewed by research staff for determination of eligibility. Criteria for removal from the study: Participant cannot keep study appointments. Participant cannot complete any EEG or ET testing at T1 because it was too difficult or they did not understand the tasks. Participant would not cooperate and follow directions, including consenting to the blood draw.</criteria>
