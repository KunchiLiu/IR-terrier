	<brief_summary>This pragmatic trial will compare two team-based care models for managing hypertension, Best Practice Clinic-based Care and Telehealth Care with pharmacist management, in a large care system in Minnesota. Clinics in the study are randomized to offer one of the two treatment models to participants with uncontrolled hypertension. The investigators aim to determine a) whether one model is more effective than the other for lowering patient's blood pressure and b) which model patients prefer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pragmatic Trial Comparing Telehealth Care and Optimized Clinic-Based Care for Uncontrolled High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are: Aim 1: Compare the effects of two evidence-based strategies on lowering blood pressure and other outcomes important to patients: best-practice clinic-based care and home-based telehealth care. - Hypothesis 1.1: Compared with patients in clinics assigned to clinic-based care, patients in clinics assigned to telehealth care will have a 5 mm Hg greater change in systolic blood pressure over 12 months of follow-up. - Hypothesis 1.2: Compared with patients in clinics assigned to clinic-based care, patients in clinics assigned to telehealth care will report: a) fewer treatment side effects; b) better ratings of patient experience of hypertension care; and c) higher self-monitoring rates and confidence in self-care. Aim 2: Conduct an evaluation of the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the telehealth care and clinic-based care interventions using a mixed-methods approach supported by the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).</detailed_description>
