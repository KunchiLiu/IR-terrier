	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate whether using vancomycin orally can prevent CDI in patients who are colonized with C. diff who are admitted to the hospital and need antibiotics for another infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening to Prophylax Against Clostridium Difficile Infection -</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening to Prophylax against CDI (SToP CDI) is a prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of vancomycin vs. placebo for preventing CDI in patients colonized with toxigenic C. difficile and receiving high-risk antibiotics. The investigators plan to screen 2500 patients to randomize 200. Consented patients will have a stool sample collected and tested for presence of toxigenic C. difficile by PCR. Patients who test negative will simply be followed for development, severity and outcome of CDI. Patients who test positive (are colonized with C. difficile) will be randomized to one of two arms: Arm 1: Patients receive 125 mg vancomycin PO q6 hours as prophylaxis against C. difficile for the duration of their antibiotic treatment +3 days. Arm 2: Patients receive placebo PO q6 hours for the duration of their antibiotic treatment +3 days.</detailed_description>
