	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of mirvetuximab soravtansine and gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with folate receptor (FR) alpha-positive ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, endometrial, or triple negative breast cancer that has come back. Monoclonal antibodies, such as mirvetuximab soravtansine, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Given mirvetuximab soravtansine and gemcitabine may work better in treating patients with FRalpha-positive ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, endometrial, or triple negative breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirvetuximab Soravtansine and Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With FRa-Positive Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, Fallopian Tube, Endometrial, or Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) when given in combination with mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853) to patients with FRalpha-positive recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, endometrial cancer, or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the toxicity, response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) in three expanded cohorts of heavily pre-treated FRalpha-positive a) TNBC patients; b) endometrial cancer patients; and c) ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer patients, all treated at the initial recommended phase II dose. II. To provide additional safety data from the expanded cohorts to help inform on the RP2D for each cohort. III. To evaluate the relationship between intratumoral levels of DM4, tumoral expression of FRalpha, and plasma concentration of DM4 at 48 and 72 hours following the first dose. IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DM4 and gemcitabine when given in combination. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the role of archival FRalpha expression as a substitute for the 48-72 hour (H) expression in determining intratumoral concentration of DM4. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive mirvetuximab soravtansine intravenously (IV) on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are follow up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
