	<brief_title>Evaluation of Single Ascending Doses of Subcutaneous Exendin 9-39 in Patients With Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH) is a debilitating rare disease afflicting 0.2-6.9% of post-bariatric patients, characterized by repeated severe hypoglycemic episodes with neuroglycopenic symptoms and marked disability. There are no effective medical therapies. While the cause is not known, exaggerated postprandial secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) as a result of altered nutrient transit likely plays a major role. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone secreted primarily by the distal ileum that contributes to postprandial glucose regulation. Exendin 9-39 (Ex9) is a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist, that when given via continuous IV infusion, has been shown to effectively prevent postprandial hypoglycemia in patients with PBH. Subcutaneous (SC) injection of Ex9 may represent a safe, effective and practical therapeutic approach to treating PBH.</detailed_description>
