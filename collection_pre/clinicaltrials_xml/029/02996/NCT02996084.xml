	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the normative range of brain volume and brain volume change in healthy control (HC) participants whose age, race, and gender distribution is approximately matched to the age, race, and gender distribution of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) enrolled in Study 888MS001. The secondary objective is to use the results of the primary endpoint to ensure consistency of brain volume measurements across MS PATHS centers.</brief_summary>
