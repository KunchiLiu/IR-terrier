	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of breast cancer patients' own electronic reporting of side effects to chemotherapy in a treatment setting has an impact on the handling of side effects and on the number of hospitalizations, febrile neutropenia and dose adjustments. We are using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) for the patients' reporting of side effects.</brief_summary>
