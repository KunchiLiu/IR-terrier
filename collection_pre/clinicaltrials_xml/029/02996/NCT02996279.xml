	<detailed_description>Histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) may lead to the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate S100A12, a marker of innate immune activation, in mothers with or without HCA and in their infants. Concentrations of S100A12, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated in maternal, cord, and neonatal blood of very preterm infants. Histologic examinations of placentae and umbilical cords were performed.</detailed_description>
