	<brief_summary>Endoscopic lung volume reduction coil treatment is a treatment option for selected patients with severe emphysema. In the advanced stages, emphysema may lead to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. In this observational study the safety and efficacy of endoscopic lung volume reduction coil treatment in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is evaluated.</brief_summary>
