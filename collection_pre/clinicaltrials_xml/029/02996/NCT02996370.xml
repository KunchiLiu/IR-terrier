	<brief_summary>Regenerating a predictable inter-implant papilla is the most complex and challenging aspect of implant dentistry. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of I shaped incision technique and conventional midcrestal incision technique for interimplant papilla reconstruction in a 6 month clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of I-Shape Incısıon Technique on Inter-Implant Papilla: A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 40 implants were placed in 12 patients. Groups were determined at second stage surgery, I shape technique used in test group and mid-crestal technique used in control group. The clinical parameters, including modified plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, keratinized tissue level were recorded baseline, 3 and 6 month. The vertical distance between the crests top-contact point was evaluated with digital periapical radiographs at baseline 3 and 6 month. Also the clinical photographs were taken baseline, 3 and 6 month. Two T shaped full-round hexagonal straight filaments, each 5 mm, were used in the taking of standardized images. With these images the ratio of the papilla area in proportion to the embrasure area and the papilla classification was measured. Non-parametric test were used for statistically analysis.</detailed_description>
