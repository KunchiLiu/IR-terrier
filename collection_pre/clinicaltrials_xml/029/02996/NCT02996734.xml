	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to present the outcomes of patients with giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) who were treated with surgery and/or medical treatment in a single institution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Giant Cell Tumor of the Extremities Treated With Surgery and/or Medical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators retrospectively review patients treated for GCTB of the extremities between 1990 and 2013 in a single institution. We evaluate the recurrence free survival rate after surgical and medical treatment of patients with GCTB of the extremities to determine the influence of the surgical approach, denosumab therapy, local tumor presentation, and demographic factors on the risk of recurrence.</detailed_description>
