	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, 2-part, 2-arm, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center study to compare the PK of etrolizumab administered SC by AI (test device) or a PFS-NSD (reference device) in healthy participants. The study will comprise a pilot cohort to estimate the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and variability of the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to confirm or determine the sample size for the pivotal cohort. The pivotal cohort will demonstrate exposure comparability of Cmax, AUC from hour 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUClast), and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf), values for a single dose of etrolizumab administered subcutaneously either by an AI or PFS-NSD.</brief_summary>
