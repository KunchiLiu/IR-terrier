	<brief_summary>Background: People get Zika virus from infected mosquitos. They usually don t get very sick. But birth defects were reported in babies born to mothers who had Zika infection. In rare cases, people with Zika infection had a nervous system disease that causes severe muscle weakness and can be life threatening. A new vaccine made from DNA in the code for a Zika virus protein could help the body build an immune response against the virus. Objectives: To see if a new vaccine against Zika virus disease is safe and causes any side effects. To study specific immune responses to the vaccine. Eligibility: Healthy people ages 18 50 Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Urine tests Participants will have 18 visits over 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. All will get 3 vaccines at 3 separate monthly visits. They will receive the vaccine in the upper arm muscle. Some will get it by needle and syringe, others by a device that uses high pressure to push the vaccine through the skin. Vaccine visits last 4 6 hours. Participants will get a thermometer to measure their temperature and a ruler to measure any skin changes at the injection site. They will record this data for 7 days after each injection. Other visits last 1 2 hours. These include: Evaluation of any health changes or problems Blood tests: Some samples may be used for future research. Participants with side effects may have extra visits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VRC 320: A Phase I, Randomized Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Zika Virus DNA Vaccine, VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP, Administered Via Needle and Syringe or Needle-free Injector, PharmaJet, inHealthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN: This is a Phase I, randomized clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 3 dose vaccination regimen with the Zika virus (ZIKVwt) DNA vaccine, VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP. Subjects will be randomized to one of three groups to receive a full 4 mg dose: 1) full dose by one intramuscular (IM) injection with needle and syringe; 2) split dose given as two 0.5 mL IM injections with needle and syringe; 3) split dose given as two 0.5 mL IM injections with PharmaJet, a needle-free injection device. The primary hypothesis is that the investigational ZIKVwt DNA vaccine will be safe and well tolerated in healthy adults. A secondary hypothesis is that the vaccine will elicit a ZIKV-specific immune response. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine in healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the vaccine and vaccination regimens. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: The investigational vaccine, VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP, was developed by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is composed of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid (VRC 5283) that encodes the wild type (wt) precursor membrane M (prM) and envelope (E) proteins from the H/PF/2013 strain of ZIKV. ZIKVwt SUBJECTS: Healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age. STUDY PLAN: Forty-five subjects will be enrolled at the NIH Clinical Center and randomized to 3 groups to receive study product on Day 0, Week 4 and Week 8. The protocol requires about 18 scheduled clinic visits and a telephone follow-up contact after each study product administration. Solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card. Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study. VRC 320 STUDY SCHEMA: - Group 1: - Administration Method = Single Dose Needle and Syringe; - Subjects = 15; - Administration Schedule = Day 0 (ZIKVwt DNA(1 (1 mL) injection)), Week 4 (ZIKVwt DNA (1 (1 mL) injection)), Week 8 (ZIKVwt DNA (1 (1 mL) injection)) - Group 2: - Administration Method = Split Dose Needle and Syringe; - Subjects = 15; - Administration Schedule = Day 0 (ZIKVwt DNA(2 (0.5 mL) injections)), Week 4 (ZIKVwt DNA (2 (0.5 mL) injections)), Week 8 (ZIKVwt DNA (2 (0.5 mL) injections)) - Group 3: - Administration Method = Split Dose PharmaJet; - Subjects = 15; - Administration Schedule = Day 0 (ZIKVwt DNA(2 (0.5 mL) injections)), Week 4 (ZIKVwt DNA (2 (0.5 mL) injections)), Week 8 (ZIKVwt DNA (2 (0.5 mL) injections)) - Subjects Total = 45 (All injections total a dose of 4 mg. ** Up to 50 total enrollments are permitted if additional subjects are needed to assess safety or immunogenicity.) STUDY DURATION: Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immune responses throughout the study for 44 weeks following the first vaccine administration. Durability of immune responses will be evaluated at two long term follow-up visits, occurring at 18 and 24 months</detailed_description>
