	<brief_title>Bilateral Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Exparel Verus Continuous Epidural Analgesia With Bupivacaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator goal is to compare the analgesic efficacy of TAP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) and continuous epidural blocks in patients who are scheduled for major lower abdominal surgery. To assess whether TAP block with Exparel is noninferior to continuous epidural analgesia on pain management, defined as noninferior for both pain control and total opioid consumption for 72 hours, in patients who had major lower abdominal surgery.</detailed_description>
