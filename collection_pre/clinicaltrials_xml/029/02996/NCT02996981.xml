	<brief_title>Cranberry Effect on Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women undergoing pelvic floor gynecologic surgery is high, ranging from 10-64%. A recent randomized trial showed that cranberry juice capsules significantly reduced the incidence of UTI in patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery (19% vs 38%; odds ratio 0.38 with confidence interval 0.19-0.79). Cranberry juice capsules were incorporated into the standard practice of Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates, TriHealth Inc in mid-March 2016. Currently, all patients who undergo pelvic floor gynecologic surgery and are discharged from the hospital with an indwelling urinary catheter postoperatively are prescribed cranberry juice capsules to reduce the risk of UTI. The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of cranberry juice capsules to the discharge medication regimen for patients discharged home with an indwelling urinary catheter following pelvic floor gynecology surgery significantly reduced the incidence of UTI, compared to a separate cohort that did not have cranberry prescribed.</detailed_description>
