	<brief_summary>This study will assess the impact of fever prevention on fever burden and short- and long-term neurologic outcomes in brain injured patients. Half of the subjects will undergo fever prevention using a targeted temperature management system and half of the subjects will be treated for fever should it develop.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Fever Prevention in Brain Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple studies demonstrate that fever / elevated temperature is associated with poor outcomes in brain injured patients; however, there are no conclusive studies that demonstrate that fever prevention/controlled normothermia is associated with better outcomes. This study will be conducted to assess the impact of advanced temperature control to prevent fever in brain injured patients. The fever prevention group will use the Arctic Sun Temperature Management System and will be compared to standard care patients in whom fever may spontaneously develop. If fever develops in a patient in the standard care group, they will be treated with standard fever care measures according to a step-wise algorithm, consisting primarily of intermittent antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) and cooling blankets and, when necessary, advanced targeted temperature management devices.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Admitted with a primary neurological diagnosis of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage 2. Prior to onset of acute symptoms, was considered functionally independent (mRS 02) 3. Meets diseasespecific criteria 1. Fever (≥38°C) prior to study enrollment 2. Preexisting neurological, psychiatric, or other condition that would confound neurological assessment or would make it difficult to accurately assess neurologic and/or functional outcome 3. Has a premorbid condition with poor likelihood of survival to 6 months 4. Has a premorbid mRS ≥3 5. Diagnosed with brain death 6. Is undergoing therapeutic hypothermia therapy 7. Has sustained neurological injury felt to be catastrophic with little chance of recovery 8. Has a skin condition in which the use of the ArcticGel Pads is contraindicated (i.e., skin that has signs of ulceration, burns, hives, or rash) 9. Has poor skin integrity or poor tissue perfusion 10.
