	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the non-inferiority of the new sirolimus-coated balloon catheters in comparison to the paclitaxel-coated SQP with regard to acute tolerance, safety and efficacy in coronary DES in-stent restenosis. Patient population will consist of male and female adults suffering from coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis, which is to be treated by a study balloon according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria as defined below. In Late lumen loss lesion (difference between the angiographic in-lesion MLD post procedural and at 6 months follow-up) will be evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). The study will be performed as a single-blind, SQP controlled study in 4 - 6 study centers in 50 patients.</detailed_description>
