	<brief_summary>Several studies have investigated an association between cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, or both, and hypothesized that CAN is involved in the pathogenesis of nephropathy. However, most of these studies had focused on Caucasians and were limited to a small number of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, or had used a conventional Ewing battery of tests based on dynamic cardiovascular maneuvers.Yet, there is consistent data showing that Asian diabetic populations, including the Chinese, have a higher risk of renal complications than Caucasians do. The present study investigated an association between heart rate variability (HRV) parameters and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, specifically through time and frequency domain analyses of HRV and urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).</brief_summary>
