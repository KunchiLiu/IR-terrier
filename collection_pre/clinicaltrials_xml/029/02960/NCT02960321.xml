	<brief_summary>A prospective study aiming to analyse the relation between different variables and high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) elevation within a group of patients undergoing a coronary angiography with or without subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study tries to seek potential causes and context of subclinical myocardial injury within patients with baseline concentration of hsTnI below the 99th percentile value upper reference limit or with demonstrated fall of hsTnI levels.</detailed_description>
