	<brief_title>uPAR PET/CT for Staging Advanced and Localised Oral and Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare the diagnostic value of uPAR-PET/CT for prognostication compared to the current imaging options (CT, MRI and ultrasound) by observer-blinded readings. The reference that will be used as "gold standard" is the pathological examination of the surgically removed tissues. The new imaging modality (uPAR-PET/CT) will be used in two separate groups of patients with head and neck cancer: Study I: Patients with oral cancer without clinical evidence of spread (OSCC in stage cN0) Study II: Patients with metastatic oral cancer (OSCC in stage cN +) and patients with metastatic oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC in stage cN +).</detailed_description>
