	<brief_summary>Sepsis related to the development of cardiac complications. However, the investigators understanding regarding this condition remains incomplete. Possible explanations raised include coronary perfusion decrease, activation of the coagulation system and release of inflammatory mediators, including endotoxins, cytokines and others. In this study the investigators wanted to examine the impact of any infectious disease, (not necessarily Pneumonia), on the QT interval in patients hospitalized for acute infectious disease.</brief_summary>
