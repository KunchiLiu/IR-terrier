	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving a modified stem cell transplant is less likely to cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to patients with certain types of blood disorders or blood cancers make patients less likely to develop GVHD. Participants will also receive melphalan and fludarabine as part of their regular chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) regimen. Before participant receives the stem cell transplant, it will be "modified" to remove certain types of T cells that cause GVHD. GVHD occurs when transplanted immune tissue, such as T cells and stem cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central Venous Catheter: The chemotherapy and some of the other drugs in this study will be given by vein through participants' central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle that will be placed into a large vein while participant is under local anesthesia. Blood samples will also be drawn through participant's CVC. The CVC will remain in participant's body during treatment. Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to them in more detail, and they will be required to sign a separate consent form. Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Infusion: Participant will receive 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatments (high-dose regimen or reduced-intensity regimen) that will be chosen by their doctor. The treatment will be selected based on participant's age and health. The high-dose regimen includes a higher dose of melphalan than the reduced-intensity regimen. The doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are the same. Study Drug Administration: On Day -7 (7 days before receiving the modified stem cell transplant), participant will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein. On Day -6, participant will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes and fludarabine by vein over 1 hour. Fludarabine and melphalan are given to treat the cancer and lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of rejecting the donor cells. On Days -5 through -3, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour. On Day -2, participant will receive total body irradiation (TBI). TBI involves the delivery of high doses of radiation designed to destroy cancer cells and/or lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of the body rejecting the new stem cells. On Day -1, participant will "rest" (not receive chemotherapy). On Day 0, participant will receive the modified stem cell transplant by vein. The infusion will last anywhere from about 30 minutes to several hours. On Days +3 and +4, participant will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. Cyclophosphamide is given to lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of GVHD. Participant will also receive mesna by vein over 30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide. Starting on Day +5, if participant is one of the first 6 patients enrolled in the study, they will receive tacrolimus to help lower the risk of GVHD. Tacrolimus will be given by vein as a continuous infusion for about 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks of taking tacrolimus by vein, participant will take tacrolimus by mouth as a pill for at least 4 months. Starting on Day +7, participant will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day, until their blood cell levels are high enough. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of a type of healthy white blood cells that fight infection. Depending on the type of disease, participant's doctor may decide to give them rituximab by vein over several hours on Days -13, -6, 1, and 8. Rituximab is given to help the body get rid of abnormal white blood cells. Participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Study Testing: Before participant is sent home from the hospital and/or clinic, they will receive additional written instructions. These instructions will include how often participant will come to the hospital/clinic, which standard drugs they will take at home, and what side effects they may have and what to do for them. After finishing the chemotherapy and cell infusion, participant's follow-up care will be routine standard of care follow-up that all patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation receive. At each visit, participant will have a physical exam and will be checked for symptoms of GVHD. Participant will be asked about any side effects they may have had. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Mouse protein antibodies are used in the T cell removal process. If participant's body becomes immune to these proteins, they may develop antibodies against the mouse antibodies (called "human anti-mouse antibodies" or HAMA). Blood samples drawn before the modified stem cell transplant and about 3 months after the modified stem cell transplant will be used to compare against a sample of participant's blood collected after the transplant is complete, to make sure they have not developed an immune system reaction against these mouse protein antibodies. If participant leaves the study before 3 months after the stem cell transplant, blood will be drawn to check for HAMA, if possible. If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. Blood (up to about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to test the genetic makeup and function of the modified stem cells and to check the status of the disease about 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the modified stem cell transplant. Length of Treatment: Participant will be on study for up to about 2 years. Participant may be taken off study early if the doctor thinks it is in their best interest, if the disease gets worse or comes back and needs more treatment, if intolerable side effects occur, if they are unable to follow study directions, or if they choose to leave the study early. If for any reason participant wants to leave the study early, they must talk to the study doctor. It may be life-threatening to leave the study after participant has started to receive the study drugs but before they receive the stem cell transplant because their blood cell counts will be dangerously low. This is an investigational study. The study drugs are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of blood cancers and/or stem cell transplant. The way the researchers remove the T cells and the infusion of the modified stem cell transplant is investigational and is not FDA approved. Up to 12 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
