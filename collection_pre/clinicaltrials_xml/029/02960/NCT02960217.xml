	<brief_title>Crossover Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of UX007 in the Treatment of Movement Disorders Associated With Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UX007G-CL301 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of UX007 in Glut1 DS. The study will enroll approximately 40 pediatric, adolescent, and adult subjects who are not on KD and are having disabling paroxysmal movement disorders. A movement disorder event is defined in this study as a period of time when the subject experiences one or more movement disorder symptoms, including symptoms that are experienced during a movement disorder event alone or significant worsening of continuous movement disorders. In this study, movement disorder events are defined as disabling if they affect or limit a subject's activities of daily living. During the 6-week Run-in Period, subjects will record disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events in a daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary; if the minimum criterion for number of events is not met or subjects complete &lt;80% of the daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary, the subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be randomized. Individuals may be allowed to rescreen, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, subject to approval by the Medical Monitor. At the end of the Run-in Period, eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to one of two treatment sequences (UX007/placebo or placebo/UX007). At Randomization, subjects will begin a 10-week double-blind Treatment Period 1. Treatment Period 1 will consist of a 2-week titration period and an 8-week Maintenance Period. At the end of Treatment Period 1, subjects will discontinue treatment and begin a 2-week washout period to minimize any potential carryover effect. Subjects will crossover to the second randomized, double-blind treatment assignment (placebo to UX007, UX007 to placebo) for an additional 10 weeks during Treatment Period 2. Treatment Period 2 will consist of a 2-week titration period and an 8-week Maintenance Period. At the end of the blinded crossover period (Week 22), all active subjects will have the option of rolling into the open-label Extension Period, to continue UX007 treatment for up to 3 years or until one of the following occurs: the subject withdraws consent, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator, the study is terminated, or until commercial availability of the study drug in a subject's region, whichever occurs first. Long-term safety and maintenance of effect of UX007 will be assessed during the open-label Extension Period. A Safety Follow-up Phone Call will be conducted 30-35 days after the last dose of UX007G-CL301 study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of Glut1 DS confirmed by SLC2A1 mutation 2. Males and females, aged ≥6 years old at the time of informed consent 3. At least 8 disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events in the 12 weeks prior to the Screening, by subject or caregiver report or At least 6 disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events in any 6 consecutive week period, over the last 12 week period prior to the Screening, by subject or caregiver report 4. At least 4 disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events in 6 week Runin Period, reported in the daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary 5. ≥80% compliance with daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary completion during the Run in Period 6. Not on KD, modified KD, or ketosisinducing modifiedfat diet for at least 3 months prior to Screening 7. Plasma level of betahydroxybutyrate (BHB) ≤ 1 mmol/L (nonfasting) at Screening 8. Provide written or verbal assent (if possible) and written informed consent by the patient(if an adult), or by a legally authorized representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any researchrelated procedures 9. Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be willing and able to complete key aspects of the study and be likely to complete the 22week, placebocontrolled, treatment period 10. Patient (or caregiver) must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be able to comply with accurate completion of the study daily electronic Glut1 DS symptom diary 11. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and Baseline and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not to be of childbearing potential include those who have not experienced menarche, are postmenopausal (defined as having no menses for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause) or are permanently sterile due to total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy. 12. Participants of child‐bearing potential or fertile males with partners of childbearing potential who are sexually active must consent to use a highly effective method of contraception as determined by the site Investigator from the period following the signing of the informed consent through 30 days after last dose of study drug 1. Any known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin or safflower oil that, in the judgment of the Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects 2. Prior use of triheptanoin within 30 days prior to Screening 3. History of, or current suicidal ideation, behavior and/or attempts per CSSRS at Screening or Baseline 4. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding an infant at Screening or Baseline 5. Participants unwilling or unable to discontinue use of a prohibited medication or other substance that may confound study objectives [MCT oil, barbiturates,pancreatic lipase inhibitors, KetoCal or other KD supplements, and/or KD]) 6. Glut1 DS treatment regimen, including AEDs, should be stable for at least 30 days prior to Screening 7. Use of any investigational product (drug, medical food, or supplement, including medium chain triglyceride [MCT] oil, including coconut oil) within 30 days prior to Screening 8. Has a concurrent disease or condition, or laboratory abnormality that, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or introduces additional safety concerns 9. Feeding or nutrition that, in the opinion of the dietitian, potentially affects consistent administration of study drug</criteria>
