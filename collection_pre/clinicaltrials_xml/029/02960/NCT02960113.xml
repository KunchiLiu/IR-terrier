	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of reducing intra-cesarean section nausea and vomiting with regional anesthesia in subjects who will receive scopolamine patch with acupressure point P6 stimulation versus subjects that receive just scopolamine patch versus subjects that receive just acupressure point P6 stimulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scopolamine Patch and Acupressure Point P6 Stimulation for Reduction of Nausea and Vomiting During Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nausea and vomiting are very common and unpleasant events experienced during cesarean section under regional anesthesia and in the postoperative period following cesarean section. These side effects are distressing for both the parturient and her family. In addition, intraoperative vomiting causes significant challenges for the surgeon, such as increased procedure length, increased risk of bleeding, increased risk of gastric content aspiration, and potential surgical trauma. To combat the nausea and vomiting seen in all above anesthetic modalities, but to a greater degree in regional anesthesia, a number of pharmacological interventions are currently used with varying degrees of effectiveness in the perioperative period. These medications come from a wide range of drug classes including serotonin and dopamine receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, sedatives and anticholinergics. In our study, we would like to compare the effectiveness of antiemetic agents or technique which cause less severe adverse reactions to the mother and her fetus. Out of the available pharmacological agents for reduction of intra-cesarean section nausea and vomiting, transdermal scopolamine patch is one of the safest medications. We would like to compare the effectiveness of the transdermal scopolamine patch with acupressure point P6 stimulation versus just transdermal scopolamine patch versus just acupressure point P6 stimulation.</detailed_description>
