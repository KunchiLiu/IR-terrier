	<brief_title>Dysphagia Evaluation After Stroke- Incidence and Effect of Oral Screen Intervention on Swallowing Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to investigate the effect of oral screen training in stroke patients with persistent oral- and pharyngeal dysphagia 6 (±2) weeks after stroke onset. Interventional study with PROBE-design (prospective randomized open-label blinded evaluator). Randomization will be made web-based with minimization program. Patient with oro-and pharyngeal dysphagia within 96h after stroke stroke onset enrolled at Umeå stroke centre will be followed up at 6 (±2) weeks after stroke onset. Sixty stroke patients (30 intervention group; 30 control group) with persistent oro- and pharyngeal dysphagia 6 (±2) weeks after stroke onset will be included in the present study. The intervention group will be offered to undergo oral screen training alongside traditionally compensatory training for 6 months. The control group will only be offered traditionally compensatory training for 6 months. The participants' status regarding swallowing ability, dysarthria, oral health, quality of life related to swallowing and somatic-and neurologic function will be assessed before and after completed intervention period, 3 months into the the intervention period and 12 (±3) post-intervention. The investigators hypothesis that swallowing intervention with oral screen is more effective than traditional rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
