	<brief_title>Genetic Variability in CYP2D6 in U.S Active Duty Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose to enroll a group of active duty service members in order to determine individuals' 2D6 isoenzyme genotype, an enzyme belonging to the hepatic cytochrome P450 oxidase system. The 2D6 isoenzyme is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs including the anti-malarial drug primaquine (PQ). By knowing the genotype, the investigator can then categorize each volunteer by CYP2D6 phenotype i.e., expected impact on drug metabolism. In order to further substantiate the relationship between CYP2D6 activity, inadequate metabolism and subsequent primaquine failure, the investigator proposes to assess the effect of 2D6 genetic polymorphisms on PQ metabolism by measuring the PQ pharmacokinetics (PK) over 24 hours following a single 30 mg oral dose in a subset of these Active Duty subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Active duty Service member, (male or female) 18 to 60 years of age (inclusive) at the time of enrollment Written informed consent for phase 1 must be obtained Written informed consent for phase 2 must be obtained from the subject before the screening procedures Free of significant health problems as established by medical history, laboratory and clinical examination before entering the study If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential (either surgically sterilized or one year postmenopausal) or, if of childbearing potential, she must be capable of preventing pregnancy, have a negative pregnancy test at the time of the administration of primaquine , and must agree to continue such precautions until 48 hours after primaquine administration. Normal (nondeficient) G6PD (glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase) phenotype (range: 4.6 to 13.5 units/gm hemoglobin) Subjects must obtain approval from his or her supervisor per Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Policy 0615 in order to be participate in the PQ PK portion of phase 2 Exclusion criteria: Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug within 30 days preceding the primaquine dosing. Pregnant (positive urine Î²HCG) or nursing at screening or plans to become pregnant or nurse from the time of enrollment until 48 hours after primaquine dosing. Allergy to primaquine Use of medications known to cause drug interactions with primaquine or CYP2D6 Acute or chronic, clinically significant, pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic, or renal functional abnormality, as determined by history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation History of hemolytic anemia Any abnormal baseline laboratory screening tests listed below (normal values are defined by the current Quest Diagnostics reference guide on file in the CTC): ALT (alanine aminotransferase)above normal range Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below normal range for the subject's ethnicity Hemoglobin below normal range Hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as determined from the medical history or by physical examination Use of any drugs that may cause hemolytic anemia and/or bone marrow suppression such as quinacrine, dapsone, rifampin, colchicine, ribavirin, penicillamine and sulfonamides. Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the investigator would increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in this study</criteria>
