	<brief_summary>In Multiple Sclerosis the multiplicity of physical and psychological dysfunctions have been shown to exhibit a number of life-altering problems such as fatigue, limb weakness, alteration of upper extremity fine motor coordination, loss of sensation, spasticity. These problems affect performance of many daily living activities (ADL) such as dressing, bathing, self-care, and writing, thus reducing functional independence and self-rated quality of life. Twenty people with Multiple Sclerosis will receive neurorehabilitation treatment comprising a combination of aerobic training and upper limb task-oriented training. The aim of this pilot crossover study is to evaluate the effects of neurorehabilitation on upper limb performance and on fatigue in People with Multiple Sclerosis.</brief_summary>
