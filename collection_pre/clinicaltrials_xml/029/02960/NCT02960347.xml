	<brief_summary>The current study examined the feasibility of High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) in reducing epileptiform activity in a 30-month-old child suffering from early onset epileptic encephalopathy. HD-tDCS was administered over 10 intervention days spanning two weeks including pre- and post-intervention video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring.</brief_summary>
