	<criteria>Male or female, 2 to 59 months of age. Excluded from enrollment in Innovative Treatment in Pneumonia (ITIP) 1 and ITIP2 clinical trials due to presence of any of the following: Hypoxia (SaO2 &lt; 90% on room air, as assessed by a pulse oximeter). Severe respiratory distress (e.g., presence of grunting, nasal flaring, head nodding, or severe chestindrawing). Severe malaria, classified by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on hospital care for children, including a positive malaria rapid antibody test result. Severe anemia, classified by WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor) only if a positive malaria rapid antibody test result. severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (i.e., weight for height/length &lt; 3 SD, midupper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;115, or edema). HIV1 seropositivity or HIV1 exposure, assessed as follows: An HIVpositive result upon rapid antibody testing. If a child is less than 24 months of age and has an HIVnegative result upon rapid antibody test documented from the past three months, the child's biological mother's HIV status will need to be assessed. If the mother is HIVpositive, the child will be included. If the mother does not have documentation of an HIVnegative test result from the past 3 months, she will be tested via rapid antibody testing to determine the child's eligibility for this study. Ability and willingness of child's caregiver to provide informed consent and to be available for followup (in the inpatient ward, returning to KCH for a scheduled study followup visit, and by phone) for the planned duration of the study. Possible tuberculosis (coughing for more than 14 days). Stridor when calm. Severe anemia, classified by WHO IMCI guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor) if a negative malaria rapid antibody test result. Known allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin. Receipt of an antibiotic treatment in the 48 hours prior to the study based on caregiver's selfreport and/or documentation in child's medical record. Living outside Lilongwe urban area, the study catchment area. Any medical or psychosocial condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigators, would interfere with the conduct of the study or for which study participation might jeopardize the child's health. Participation in a clinical study of an investigational product within 12 weeks prior to enrollment or planning to begin participation during this study. Prior participation in ITIP1, ITIP2 or ITIP3 during a previous pneumonia diagnosis.</criteria>
