	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of PGT121 Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-viral efficacy of the PGT121 monoclonal antibody for HIV prevention and therapy. PGT121 mAb is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets a V3 glycan-dependent epitope region of the HIV envelope protein. PGT121 mAb was chosen for this study because it is potent, neutralizes a wide array of HIV viruses, and can prevent and treat simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus monkeys.</detailed_description>
