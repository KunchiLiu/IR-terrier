	<brief_title>Trial of Isatuximab (SAR650984) in Patients With High Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Participant will receive isatuximab by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle during the first month. During Months 2-6, participant will receive isatuximab on Days 1 and 15. After Month 6, participant will receive isatuximab on Day 1 only. Participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Study Visits: On Day 1 of all cycles: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for anti-drug antibody, and to check the status of the disease. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons ) will be drawn for genetic testing. - Starting at Cycle 2, urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - If participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for a pregnancy test. On Day 2 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic testing. - Urine will be collected for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. On Days 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of participant's disease. - On Day 15 only, urine will be collected for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - On Day 15 only, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected to check for anti-drug antibody. - If participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for a pregnancy test. On Day 28 of Cycles 6, 18, and 30: - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for genetic testing. - Participant will have a skeletal survey to check the status of the disease. - Participant will have bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease, genetic testing, and for biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers). - If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an MRI and/or an FDG-PET/CT scan. If participant can become pregnant, and participant has a regular menstrual cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test 1 time each week during Cycle 1 and then 1 time every cycle after that. If participant has an irregular menstrual cycle, participant will have this test 1 time each week during Cycle 1 and then 2 times every cycle after that. If the disease appears to get worse, at any time the doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have all or some of the above tests and procedures repeated to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: Participant may continue taking isatuximab for up to 30 months. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on this study will be over after long-term follow-up has been completed. End of Treatment: Two weeks after the last dose of isatuximab: - If participant is able to have children, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for a pregnancy test. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected to check for anti-drug antibody. Follow-Up: Within 28 days after participant's last dose of study drug: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for anti-drug antibody, and to check the status of the disease. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for genetic testing. - Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the disease. - If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. If participant has an irregular menstrual cycle, participant will also have this test within 14 days after participant's last dose. Long-Term Follow-Up: After participant's last dose of study drug, participant will be called by a member of the study staff and asked how participant is doing, if participant has had any side effects, and if participant has started any new anti-cancer treatment. This call should last about 15-20 minutes. Participant will receive these calls at least every 6-12 months after the end of the study. If participant has any serious side effects, participant may be called more often to check up on participant. This follow-up will stop if the disease gets worse. If participant has routine clinic visits with participant's doctor, these questions will be asked on participant's clinic visit and participant may not receive a phone call. This is an investigational study. Isatuximab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 61 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 42 will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically confirmed SMM based on the following criteria. Both criteria must be met: (a) Serum monoclonal protein (IgG or IgA) &gt;/= 3 g/dL or urinary monoclonal protein &gt;/= 500 mg per 24 hours and/or clonal bone marrow plasma cells 1060 % (b) Absence of myeloma defining events or amyloidosis. 2. Additionally, patients must meet criteria for high risk of progression to multiple myeloma by PETHEMA CRITERIA (patients must have at least 2 risk factors present) 1. &gt;/=95% abnormal plasma cells/total plasma cells in bone marrow compartment (This is measured as a percentage of the total abnormal versus normal plasma cells in the bone marrow compartment using standard flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate. Having &gt;/=95% abnormal plasma cells/total plasma cells constitutes a risk factor for progression to multiple myeloma by PETHEMA criteria) 2. Immunoparesis (This term refers to the patient having low uninvolved immunoglobulins in peripheral blood, for example if a patient has IgA smoldering multiple myeloma, then either having a low IgM and/or low IgG will qualify as a risk factor for progression to multiple myeloma) *2 of 2 risk factors: high risk for progression at a rate of 72% at 5 years 3. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/= 40 ml/min. CrCl will be calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. 4. Age &gt;/= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of Isatuximab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study. 5.

Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the ULN, and AST and ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN. 8. Females of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method of contraception (2 barrier method or 1 barrier method with a spermicide or intrauterine device for 2 weeks prior to screening, during and 12 weeks after the last dose of trial medication. Adequate methods of contraception are provided as examples. Other acceptable and effective methods of birth control are also permitted (eg, abstinence). 9. Men must agree to not donate sperm while on the study and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug(s). Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to the first administration of isatuximab and at the end of treatment visit. A negative urine pregnancy test is required prior to each subsequent isatuximab dose administration. 10. Subjects must be able to give informed consent 1. Evidence of myeloma defining events or biomarkers of malignancy due to underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder meeting at least ONE of the following: 1. Hypercalcemia: serum calcium &gt;0.25 mmol/L (&gt;1 mg/dL) higher than the upper limit of normal or &gt; 2.75 mmol/L (&gt; 11 mg/dL) 2.

Plasma cell leukemia 4. Pregnant or lactating females. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with isatuximab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with isatuximab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. 5. Active hepatitis B or C infection. 6. Known HIV infection 7. Intolerance to infused protein products, sucrose, histidine or polysorbate 80. 8. Concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy is not permitted. 9.
