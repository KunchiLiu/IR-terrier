	<brief_title>A BIOmarker Driven Trial With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab or VEGFR tKi in Naïve Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Hypothesis: Molecular groups of ccrcc will define patients who will respond to nivolumab alone, nivolumab combined with ipilimumab, or VEGFR-TKI (sunitinib or pazopanib) in subjects with previously untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Conditions: - Advanced or metastatic RCC: previously untreated in metastatic setting. - Frozen tumor samples available for molecular group determination. Determination of molecular subgroup and stratification on : IMDC prognostic score (0 vs 1−2 vs 3−6). Product(s): - Nivolumab administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab administered IV over 30 minutes at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or nivolumab a l o n e administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (molecular group 1 and 4), or TKI (molecular group 2 and 3), pazopanib or sunitinib according to investigator's choice until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons specified in the protocol. Exploratory biological assessments: Molecular subgroups (1 to 4) will be defined for all patients based on frozen tumor tissue samples or freshly conditioned in "RNA later". Further exploratory biological assessments will be performed in order to define predictive biomarkers of response to N+I, N alone or C: - Molecular subgroups will be assessed on FFPE tumor tissues (Nanostring or RNAseq technology) and compared to those obtained with frozen samples - Pan-immune related gene expression will be assessed from FFPE tumor tissue of the primary tumor and /or metastasis biopsies at baseline and from metastasis biopsies at progression. - Immune cell infiltrates (CD3, CD8, CD20) and immunosuppressive markers (PD-1, PD-L1&amp;2, LAG-3, TIM3, CTLA-4) will be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the primary tumor. - The phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) will be analyzed at 3 time points (baseline, early on treatment and at progression) using inhibition and regulatory markers and cytokines (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, Perforine, CTLA-4, Foxp3…) - Inflammatory protein will be analyzed in the plasma at baseline at 3 time points (baseline, cycle 2 (W6) and at progression), using ELISA or nephelometry. Statistical Considerations: An adaptative design will be used to ensure that conclusions can be made with a limited number of patients in each molecular group, which is the major constraint of the study. Sample Size: Approximately 150 patients are planned to be treated. Given an expected failure rate of molecular grouping of less than 20%, 180 patients must be included.</detailed_description>

(Note: fine needle aspiration [FNA] and bone metastases samples are not acceptable for submission). Molecular group has to be determined prior to randomization. Formalinfixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor tissue available for biomarker (gene expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC)) analysis. Key Any untreated CNS metastases. Patients with CNS metastases will be eligible if they are: asymptomatic, without significant oedema, not on corticosteroids, not eligible for radiation therapy/surgery or have already received radiation therapy.

Prior treatment with an antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD1), antiprogrammed deathligand 1 (PDL1), antiPDL2, antiCD137, or anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways. Any active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune disease or recent history of a syndrome that required systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or immunosuppressive medications except for syndromes which would not be expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.
