	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Stabilizing Splint (Michigan-type Occlusal Splint) Versus Anterior Repositioning Splint .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effectiveness of Michigan-type occlusal splint and anterior repositioning splint in patients with temporomandibular joint anterior disc displacement with reduction. PICO: Population (P): Patients with symptomatic anterior disc displacement with reduction. Intervention (I): Michigan splint. Comparator (C): Anterior repositioning splint (ARS) . Outcome(O): Primary outcome: Patients' subjective pain experience. Each patient will be asked to rate his or her current and worst pain intensity on numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 with zero being no pain and ten corresponds to the worst pain that the patient ever had. Secondary outcome: 1. Maximum mouth opening (MMO). Assessment of MMO will be performed by measuring the distance in mm between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors using a ruler. 2. lateral excursion . Assessment of lateral excursion will be performed by measuring the distance in mm between midline of upper and lower jaws 3. protrusion. distance in mm from the incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor to the incisor edge of the mandibular incisor will measured in the maximum protruded position.</detailed_description>
