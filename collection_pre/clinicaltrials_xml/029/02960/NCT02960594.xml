	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-1400 alone or in combination with INO-9012, delivered by electroporation in subjects with high-risk solid tumor cancer with no evidence of disease after surgery and standard therapy. Subjects will be enrolled into one of six treatment arms. Subjects will be assessed according to standard of care. Restaging and imaging studies will be performed to assess disease relapse per NCCN guidelines. RECIST will be used to validate the findings in cases of relapse.</brief_summary>
