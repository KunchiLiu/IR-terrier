	<brief_summary>Inguinal hernia is a common disease in children. Treatment of this disease by laparoscopic high ligation of the hernia sac has been accepted by domestic and foreign scholars. Since laparoscopic inguinal hernia was introduced in 1990,it has now become the most commonly performed hernia repair in children. The conventional approach this is done with2small trocars to 1trocar . however the wound complications of infection and pain and the recurrent rate have not been resolved. The aim of the study was to described a new way of extra-peritoneal high ligation of hernia sac. This method combines the single-port laparoscopic could eliminated rate of wound complications and recurrence in inguinal hernia repair in children. The investigators hoped that this study will prove that the extra-peritoneal single-port laparoscopic repair is at least a s effective and efficient as the conventional technique in the cure of inguinal hernia and may results in lower recurrence and reduce incidence of wound complications.</brief_summary>
