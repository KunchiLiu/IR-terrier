	<brief_summary>The Phase 1 portion of this study will determine the safety of TAS4464 and the most appropriate dose for patients with Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma. The Phase 2 portion of the study will investigate the efficacy and safety of TAS4464 in patients with Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Finding Study Followed by a Safety and Efficacy Study for Patients With Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and Rationale: • TAS4464 is an investigational NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, a compound which may affect cancer cell growth and survival. Thus, TAS4464 may help in the treatment of cancer. Phase 1: Primary: - To investigate the safety and tolerability of TAS4464 - To identify a tolerated dose of TAS4464 Secondary: - To investigate the preliminary efficacy of TAS4464 - To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacogenomics (PGx) of TAS4464 - To investigate the pharmacodynamics of TAS4464 Phase 2: Primary: • To investigate the efficacy of TAS4464 Secondary: • To further investigate the safety profile of TAS4464</detailed_description>
