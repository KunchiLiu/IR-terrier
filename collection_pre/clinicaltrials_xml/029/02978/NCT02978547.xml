	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, non-randomized phase II study of neoadjuvant metformin in resectable PDAC. Twenty patients will be enrolled and treated with metformin 500 mg BD for a minimum of 7 days, until 2 days prior to surgery. Patients will undergo laboratory investigations at baseline, prior to surgery and 4-10 weeks after surgery. Patients eligible for and consented to the optional MRI substudy will undergo diffusion-weighted MRI 1 to 14 days before surgery. At surgery, resected tumour and normal tissue will be collected and banked. FFPE specimens will be used for sectioning, histological analysis and IHC for Ki67 (cell proliferation marker), pAMPK, ACC targets, p53 and mTOR targets, apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl-2, caspases 3, 8 and 9). Fresh frozen tumour and matched normal tissue samples will be used for western blot analysis of insulin and IGF receptors, total and activated ERK and Akt, and RNAseq analysis. Pre-metformin biopsy samples will be retrieved for molecular analysis. Fasting blood samples at baseline and before surgery will be analyzed for glucose and insulin levels. Plasma and whole blood will also be processed and banked for circulating tumour DNA analysis. Urine samples will be sent for metabolomic profiling.</brief_summary>
