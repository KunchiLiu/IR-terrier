	<brief_summary>The NIAAA estimates that 16% (40 million) of adults in the US are drinking at unsafe levels. More than 50% of alcohol health consequences occur in risky, non-dependent drinkers. Increasing the efficacy and efficiency of brief interventions in medical setting could significantly reduce the public health impacts of risky drinking. There is intense interest in conducting motivational interviewing (MI) informed brief interventions for risky alcohol use in medical settings, but little empirical information is available regarding which MI behavioral and interpersonal style components drive effectiveness. The field would benefit greatly from empirically-based Stage 1 treatment development and modeling studies to delineate the degree to which adding motivational interviewing components to brief intervention improves outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NIAAA estimates that 16% (40 million) of adults in the US are drinking at unsafe levels, placing them at risk for a variety of physical, mental health, and social consequences. More than 50% of alcohol health consequences occur in risky, non-dependent drinkers. Increasing the efficacy and efficiency of brief interventions in medical setting could significantly reduce the public health impacts of risky drinking. Despite overall positive findings for brief interventions, there are high levels of variability in effects, with meta-analyses reporting significant unexplained heterogeneity in outcomes that is likely accounted for by differences in intervention components and strategies. There is intense interest in conducting motivational interviewing (MI) informed brief interventions for risky alcohol use in medical settings, but little empirical information is available regarding which MI behavioral and interpersonal style components drive effectiveness. Following promising efficacy trials from counseling applications, MI was translated into brief (5-15 minute) interactions and subjected to randomized controlled trial methodology. Lack of mixed-methods, Stage 1 treatment development is evidenced by our inability to provide consistent delineation of key intervention components and mechanisms of action. Variability in these factors is likely responsible for the wide variability in effects observed in meta-analyses of brief interventions. Many MI skills and behaviors require significant training and supervision and increased patient-provider interaction time. The field would benefit greatly from empirically-based Stage 1 treatment development and modeling studies to delineate the degree to which adding motivational interviewing components to brief intervention improves outcome.</detailed_description>
