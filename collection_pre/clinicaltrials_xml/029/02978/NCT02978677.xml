	<brief_title>Proton Dose Escalation for Patients With Atypical or Anaplastic Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial intends to optimize treatment for grade II and grade III (atypical or anaplastic) meningioma. Standard treatment for atypical or anaplastic meningioma is surgery. For grade III (anaplastic) meningiomas, post-operative radiotherapy would be performed in all cases using standard fractionation schedules to a total dose of ~60 Gy. For grade II (atypical) meningiomas, although some small patient datasets support early onset of radiotherapy, the standard treatment is still to irradiate if tumours are recurrent or if resection was macroscopically incomplete. Total doses of 54 to ~60 Gy are applied using standard fractionation schedules. A major problem of the treatment of atypical or anaplastic meningioma is that beyond surgery and radiotherapy, there are only experimental treatment options and the probability of local recurrences is 50-100% within the first 5 years for grade II and grade III meningioma. The present trial has been developed to evaluate efficacy of a dose-intensified radiotherapy treatment schedule for incompletely or not resected meningioma to a total dose of 68 (grade II) or 72 Gy (grade III). To minimize normal tissue toxicity, the boost dose or the complete radiotherapy is applied using protons. The expectation is a higher recurrence-free survival compared to previous reports on outcome of standard dose (60 Gy) radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
