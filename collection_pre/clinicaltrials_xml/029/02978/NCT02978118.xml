	<criteria>Group A: Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if ALL of the following criteria apply: 1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Clear cell and nonclear cell carcinoma (such as papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, and medullary) allowed. 2. Evidence of metastatic disease in any site on most recent imaging scan 3. Planned initiation of treatment with immune modulatory agent targeting any of the following: PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, CD27, OX40, or LAG3 4. Age &gt; 18 years. 5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Group B: Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if ALL of the following criteria apply: 1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. Nontransitional cell carcinoma (such as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) allowed. 2. Evidence of metastatic disease in any site on most recent imaging scan 3. Planned initiation of treatment with immune modulatory agent targeting any of the following: PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, CD27, OX40, or LAG3 4. Age &gt; 18 years. 5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make participation in a blood drawing protocol difficult or not feasible at the discretion of the principal investigator or coinvestigator(s). 2. Treatment with systemic steroids of any dose or formulation (including hydrocortisone, prednisone, methylprednisolone (Solumedrol), dexamethasone), within 4 weeks of consent or planned initiation of steroids after consent (unplanned steroid initiation for treatment of immune related adverse events is allowed). Chronic treatment with steroids for physiological replacement for adrenal insufficiency is allowed. 3. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents (including mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept), mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic), rituximab (Rituxan), tacrolimus (Prograf), sirolimus (Rapamune), cyclosporine (Sandimmune), TNFa inhibitors such as infliximab, etanercept or adalimumab, methotrexate, azathioprine, and dactinomycin) within 4 weeks of consent or planned initiation of any of these agents for 12 weeks after consent.</criteria>
