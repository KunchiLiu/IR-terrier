	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized vanguard trial of trauma patients admitted to the trauma surgery service at Intermountain Medical Center who are deemed to be at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Once identified and enrolled, subjects will be randomized to receive bilateral lower extremity duplex ultrasound surveillance versus no surveillance. The study will compare the two groups with regard to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding episode rates, both during the index hospitalization and at 90 days post-discharge.</brief_summary>
