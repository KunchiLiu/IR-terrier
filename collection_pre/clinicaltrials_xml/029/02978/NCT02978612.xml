	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2, randomized study where the aim of the study is to investigate the tolerance of adjuvant chemotherapy, measured by functional decline, after surgery for colon cancer stage III in elderly patients. Secondary aims are disease-free survival, toxicity, late functional outcome, quality of life, to establish a geriatric assessment for selection of patients, and to examine the prognostic value of gene signature tests / biomarkers for stage III colon cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients ≥ 75 years who have undergone surgery for colon cancer stage III, are eligible for inclusion in the study. Non-eligibility includes patients with obvious impaired cognitive or physical function or patients living in nursing homes. After signing informed consent, the patients first undergo geriatric assessment. Patients that are classified as having fit or intermediate function, and with no significant cardiovascular disease, are randomized with a 2:1 randomization process to either chemotherapy (Arm A: Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid day 1-14 q3 weeks, 8 cycles) or no chemotherapy (Arm B: observation). The purpose of this study is to examine the tolerability of chemotherapy in elderly (&gt; 75 years) patients operated on for colon cancer stage III. There is little evidence of benefit and tolerability of this therapy in the elderly; it is recommended individual consideration in elderly. In the study, a comprehensive geriatric a comprehensive geriatric assessment is performed first, to exclude frail patients or patients with serious comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. Fit or intermediate patients will then be randomized so that 2/3 will receive chemotherapy with capecitabine tablets for 6 months, and 1/3 will not receive chemotherapy. A new geriatric assessment is performed after 6 and 12 months. The main objective of the study is to examine whether chemotherapy leads to significant loss of function, but secondary aims include survival, quality of life, and prognostic effect of biomarkers. The study may provide useful information on selection of patients who tolerate and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
