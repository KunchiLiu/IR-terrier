	<detailed_description>The cold ischemia of organs, has harmful effects on the tissues due to oxidative stress and inflammation. This is physiopathologically defined as ischaemia/re-perfusion injury (IRI) in organ transplantation. Parathyroid allotransplantation has an increased popularity at the last decade. But the cold ischemia due to transportation of the transplant tissue is a very important problem. Calcium sensing receptor plays a crucial role in regulating Parathormone secretion which means controlling of the calcium-dependent systemic ion homeostasis. The investigators developed a new tissue transporting solution for parathyroid allotransplantation and the investigators measured the parathyroid cell viability and the the amount of calcium sensing receptor of the parathyroid cells at the 0., 6., 12. and 24. hours of the parathyroid cells which were placed into our new solution.</detailed_description>
