	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec works and nivolumab in treating patients with lymphomas that do not responded to treatment or non-melanoma skin cancers that have spread to other places in the body or do not responded to treatment. Biological therapies, such as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block a protein needed by tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving talimogene laherparepvec and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with lymphomas or non-melanoma skin cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talimogene Laherparepvec and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Refractory Lymphomas or Advanced or Refractory Non-melanoma Skin Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the frequency of patients responding (response rate) to talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) monotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the local response rate to T-VEC in injected tumors. II. To determine the response rate to T-VEC + nivolumab (NIVO). III. To identify potential pre-treatment and on-treatment correlative biomarkers of local and systemic immune response. OUTLINE: Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) on day 1. Patients without response at week 12, may also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 or 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years.</detailed_description>
