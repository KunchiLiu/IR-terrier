	<brief_summary>First in human study, assessing the safety profile, the pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of GM102, a new compound (a monoclonal antibody), administered alone in patients with previously treated gynecological cancers bearing the AMHRII (anti-mullerian Hormone Receptor II) receptor. The primary objective of the study is to determine the GM102 recommended dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First In Human Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumoral Activity of GM102 in Gynecological Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMHRII is reexpressed in a subset of gynecological cancers. GM102 is a humanized low fucose monoclonal antibody with a high affinity to AMHRII receptor. GM102 acts through enhanced capability to engage immune effector cells (macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells) to trigger ADCC (antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity) and phagocytosis of tumor cells. Patients with gynecological tumors expressing AMHRII receptor on the tumor cells in archived tissue as determined prior to study entry will be eligible for C101 study. C101 consists of a phase I part (dose escalation) and a phase Ib part (expansion). The phase I part is designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) using the classical 3+3 dose-finding design. In six successive escalating dose cohorts, patients will receive GM102 infusions every 2 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will analyze and qualify the toxicities and will provide recommendations according to the dose administration rules defined in the protocol. At the end of the phase I part, the RP2D will be determined by the TSC, taking into account dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), overall toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics effects of GM102. The Phase Ib part of the study will confirm the tolerance of the selected dose (RP2D) and will assess antitumoral activity of GM102 in two cohorts of patients with Sex Cord-Stromal tumors and other AMHRII positive gynecological tumors. Patients will be treated for a maximum of 12 cycles.</detailed_description>

Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy. Concurrent chronic corticosteroid treatment. Known severe anaphylactic or other hypersensitivity reactions secondary to a prior exposure to human antibodies or to any protein product. Washout period before treatment initiation: &lt; 3 weeks or 5 times the halflife, whichever is shorter, for prior antitumor therapy (small molecules and/or antibodydrug conjugates, radiotherapy) or 6 weeks for monoclonal antibodies. Any active concomitant malignancy. Serious concomitant illness e.g. active infection requiring systemic antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral drug, or physical examination or laboratory abnormalities, that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise protocol objectives.

Nonresolution of any prior treatment related toxicity to &lt; Grade 2, except for alopecia according to National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) v4.03. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.
