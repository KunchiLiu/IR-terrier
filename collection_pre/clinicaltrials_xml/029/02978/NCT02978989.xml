	<brief_title>Solo and Non-solo Approach for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laporoscopic cholecystectomy usually requires three surgeons, including an operator, a camera assistant, and other instrument assistant. Recent advancement of technology made it possible to develop the conveniently adjustable holders for camera and other laparoscopic instruments. The application of these instruments enables "solo-surgery" wherein an operation is driven by single surgeon. During surgery, human assistant(s) are helpful because of their instant assistance according to the operation's need. Therefore, the utilization of instruments instead of human assistants would be cumbersome. However, the utilization of instruments would be helpful by enabling operation-driven repositioning of the camera and instrument(s). Currently, no attempt has been made to objectively compare the merits and demerits of these two procedures. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the safety and feasibility of solo laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is defined as the application of solo surgery to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, by comparing consecutive non-solo procedures conducted by a surgeon in the presence or absence of human assistant(s).</detailed_description>
