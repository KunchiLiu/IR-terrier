	<brief_summary>Patients, scheduled for elective arthroplasty were monitored with Lithium Dilution Cardiac Output monitor (LiDCOplus™) before and 45 minutes after spinal anesthesia. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg or ≥ 30% decrease from baseline. Associations between hypotension and the hemodynamic changes after preanaesthetic fluid loading and spinal anesthesia were analysed by logistic regression analyses.</brief_summary>
