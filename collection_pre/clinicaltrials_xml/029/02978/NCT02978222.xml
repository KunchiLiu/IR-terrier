	<brief_summary>This is a blinded, randomized, parallel groups Phase II trial. Patients with platinum sensitive ovarian cancer (defined as time to progression &gt; 6 months in the penultimate platinum containing regimen) and who had either a tumor response or a stable disease upon completing their last platinum containing regimen will be randomized to either vaccine regimen with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF adjuvant alone as a control group. Treatment will be administered as a consolidation therapy within 12 weeks of the last administration of platinum. The vaccination phase will include 6 administrations of the study drug at 4-week intervals. Unless they progress or go off-study, patients will be monitored for tumor response and for relapse or progression every 12 weeks after enrollment. Once a patient is off-study, they will be followed by quarterly contact until study completion for survival and cancer status. The total duration of the patient's participation in the study will be 2 years. Assessment for tumor response, disease progression and recurrence will be conducted every 12 weeks from the end of treatment until documented disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine With GM-CSF Versus GM-CSF Alone in Patients With Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter double-blind controlled randomized Phase II study to evaluate the activity of folate receptor alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine as a consolidation treatment following completion of no less than 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive, non-mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients enrolled will have received two or more previous platinum-containing regimen. Patients must be determined as platinum sensitive after completion of their penultimate platinum therapy prior to enrollment on this study. Platinum sensitivity is determined as &gt;6 months and &lt;24 months after completion of the patient's final platinum dose. In addition the patients will have demonstrated a tumor response or stable disease upon their last platinum-containing regimen (per RECIST v1.1 and/or CA125 GCIG criteria) prior to enrolment in this study. Following consent the patient eligibility will be confirmed. Patients will need to start treatment with study drug within 12 weeks of the last dose of a chemotherapeutic agent of the platinum-containing regimen. Following randomization, patients will be administered TPIV200 with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF control alone. Patients will have tumor assessments done every 12 weeks ± 1 week for up to 2 years, until objective disease progression or the patient withdraws consent.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Female patient &gt; 18 years 2. Willing and able to give informed consent 3. Recurrent platinumsensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have completed at least 2 previous courses of platinum (these not needing to be consecutive) containing therapy (i.e. carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin). 4. Penultimate and last platinumbased chemotherapy courses must have consisted of a minimum of 4 treatment cycles each [but these courses do not need to be consecutive]. 5. Histologic documentation of diagnosis of carcinoma is required and the following histologic subtypes are eligible: high grade (grade ≥3+) serous or endometrioid carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, or poorlydifferentiated adenocarcinoma, or mixed (including above subtypes only). Note that synchronous serous or endometrioid uterine or fallopian cancers are allowed. 6. For the penultimate platinum based chemotherapy course prior to enrollment: A patient must have been defined as platinum sensitive after this treatment with disease progression (evidence of tumor marker progression with doubling of CA125 from nadir confirmed by repeat measurement at least 1 week apart, and/or image guided RECIST v1.1 progression) that was greater than 6 months and less than 24 months after completion of the last dose of platinum chemotherapy. 7. For the last chemotherapy course prior to enrolment: This course must be a platinum containing regimen and patient must have demonstrated an objective response (PR or CR) or stable disease (SD); and this response must be stable (without progressive disease) until randomization: 8. Patients must receive their first dose of vaccine within 12 weeks of completion of their final dose of a chemotherapeutic agent of the platinumcontaining regimen. 9. Adequate normal organ and marrow function within 14 days prior to first vaccine administration: 10. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L 11. Platelet &gt; 100 x 109/L 12. Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL 13. Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN (unless Gilbert's syndrome without concurrent clinically significant liver disease 14. AST/ALT &lt; 2.5 ULN unless liver metastasis in which case it must be &lt; 5 x ULN 15. Serum creatinine CL &gt; 40 mL/min by CockcroftGault formula. 16. Female subjects must either be of nonreproductive potential (i.e. postmenopause by history: &gt; 60 years old and no menses for &gt; 12 months naturally or secondary to radiation/chemotherapy; OR serum FSH, LH and estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range; OR history of hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal ligation; OR history of bilateral oophorectomy), or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry 17. Life expectancy &gt; 24 weeks 18. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 19. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor sample from the primary or recurrent cancer must be available for central testing. 1. Histology consistent with nonserous, nonendometrioid (i.e. mucinous or clear cell), or lowgrade or borderline serous ovarian carcinoma 2. Patients with a history of other cancers (other than nonmelanoma skin cancers [i.e. basal or squamous cell]) within the past 3 years. 3. Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological/cell therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) &lt; 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 4. Receipt of the last dose of platinum &gt; 12 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. 5. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days prior to the fist dose of study drug with the exception of topical, intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid. 6. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years Note: patients with vitiligo, Grave's disease or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment within the past 2 years are not excluded 7.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent 9. Subjects who are pregnant or are breast feeding. 10. Subjects who or of reproductive potential, and are either: Not abstinent; Not in an exclusive relationship with a partner who is surgically sterile; Not employing an effective method of birth control. 11.
