	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory failure is the leading cause of ICU admission of immunocompromized patients. In this subgroup of patients, the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation occurs in about 50% of cases and is associated with very a high mortality rate, reaching 70% of cases. Therefore, noninvasive oxygenation strategies have been developed to avoid intubation. More than 15 years ago, 2 trials have suggested that NIV could decrease intubation and mortality rates of immunocompromized patients as compared to standard oxygen through a mask. However these results have not been confirmed in a recent large trial. HFNC is a recent and well-tolerated oxygenation technique. In a recent trial, HFNC alone could decrease mortality and intubation rates in patients with ARF as compared to NIV. Similar findings have been reported in a post-hoc analysis on immunocompromized patients excluding those with profound neutropenia. Likewise in a retrospective monocentric cohort of immunocompromized patients, we reported better outcomes with HFNC than with NIV.</brief_summary>
