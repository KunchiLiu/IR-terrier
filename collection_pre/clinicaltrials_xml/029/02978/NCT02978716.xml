	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of trilaciclib (G1T28) in preserving the bone marrow and the immune system, and enhancing chemotherapy antitumor efficacy when administered prior to carboplatin and gemcitabine (GC therapy) for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The study is open-label and approximately 90 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1:1 fashion) to 1 of the 3 following treatment groups: - Group 1: GC therapy (Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles) only (n=30) - Group 2: GC therapy (Days 1 and 8) plus trilaciclib (G1T28) on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles (n=30) - Group 3: GC therapy (Days 2 and 9) plus trilaciclib (G1T28) on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 of 21-day cycles (n=30) The study will include 3 study phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Survival Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first dose with study treatment and completes at the Post-Treatment Visit.</brief_summary>
