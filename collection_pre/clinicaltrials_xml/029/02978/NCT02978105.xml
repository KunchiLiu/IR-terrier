	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that hypnosis is an alternative technique that could be applied to help patients with obesity to lose weight. The possibility that a self-conditioning technique (self-hypnosis) added to traditional approach (diet, exercise and behavioral recommendations) will be effective in determining weight loss with respect to the traditional approach in subjects with a body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 50 kg/m2 will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Self-conditioning Techniques in Promoting Weight Loss in Patients With Obesity. A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is a serious health concern. Most lifestyle interventions fail over time; indeed, overeating often involves loss of control and compulsive behaviors. Hypnosis could increase the ability to control emotional impulses. Self-conditioning techniques borrowed from hypnosis (self-hypnosis) increase self-control and self-management of emotions. Recent hypnosis techniques with a rapid-induction phase allow the trained patients to go into self-hypnosis in a few minutes and to repeat the experience in complete autonomy, employing a short time of the day only.</detailed_description>
