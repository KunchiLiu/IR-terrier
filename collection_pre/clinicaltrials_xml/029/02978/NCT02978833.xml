	<brief_summary>Gluteus medius tendinopathy, which is often referred to as Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome, is characterized by pain in the lateral aspect of the hip that is aggravated by side lying, stair climbing, and walking. Treatment is currently limited to lifestyle modifications, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, and open and endoscopic surgical repair. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections contain important growth factors that are essential in the healing and tissue formation processes. However, the extent to which PRP is more efficacious than whole blood in tendinopathy remains unclear. In this double-blind randomized trial, patients will be allocated to receive either a PRP or whole-blood injection. Post-procedure assessments will occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year.</brief_summary>
