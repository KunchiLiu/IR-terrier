	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of ST266 Ophthalmic Drops Compared to Placebo to Treat Allergic Conjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a multi-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, modified conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. The primary endpoints of ocular itching and conjunctival redness will be evaluated at the subject's final visit. Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (1:1). Randomization will be stratified by average post-CAC itching scores at baseline. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline and on Days 6, 7 and 8.</detailed_description>
