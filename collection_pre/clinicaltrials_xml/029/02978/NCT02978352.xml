	<brief_summary>Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness characterized by reduced attention, impaired cognition and perception, usually resulting from general physical conditions. Delirium contributes to longer hospital length of stay, increased mortality, increased healthcare costs, and long-term cognitive and functional impairment. However, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. E-learning (electronic learning) proves to be a time-efficient, flexible and convenient training method, making it suitable for a large organization like Siriraj hospital where there is a large employee turnover rate. So the investigators want to compare the passing rate between the e-learning group and the traditional learning group.</brief_summary>
