	<brief_summary>A randomized double blinded clinical trial will be conducted comparing the effect of three simple basic moisturizers only different in the concentration of carbamide (urea). Three concentrations of carbamide will be tested, 5, 7.5, and 10 %, respectively. The study will be conducted as a split-body-study and will contain three arms randomized to comparing 5 and 7.5 %, 5 and 10 %, and 7.5 and 10 % carbamide, respectively. 20-30 patients with at least clinically verified Ichthyosis Vulgaris will be enrolled to each study arm. The effect of the moisturizers will be assessed by clinical examination (score), patients assesment of effect and measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and other skin parameters.</brief_summary>
