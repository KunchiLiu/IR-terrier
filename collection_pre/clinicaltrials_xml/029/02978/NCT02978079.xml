	<brief_summary>Horner's syndrome (HS) is a result of interruption of the sympathetic innervation to the eye and ocular adnexa, which can occur due to carotid artery dissection (CAD), along which the sympathetic nerve fibers travel to reach the eye. Dissection of the carotid artery is one of the etiologies for ischemic stroke in young patients. In our current study, we will explore the diagnostic accuracy of automated binocular pupillometry in the diagnosis or HS, and its potential in identifying dissection of the carotid artery in patients of young age who suffer ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
