	<detailed_description>Investigating the efficacy of Cetuximab Monotherapy versus Continuation after induction treatment with chemotherapy + Cetuximab in inoperable or irresectable and non-progressive metastatic colorectal cancer after first line induction treatment for 24 weeks with mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI and Cetuximab treatment. Reinduction treatment will be done in case of progression. This treatment is continued until progression or severe toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological proof of colorectal cancer (in case of a single metastasis, histological or cytological proof of this lesion should be obtained); Distant metastases (patients with only local recurrence are not eligible); Unidimensionally measurable disease (&gt; 1 cm on spiral CT scan or &gt; 2 cm on chest Xray; liver ultrasound is not allowed). Serum CEA may not be used as a parameter for disease evaluation; In case of previous radiotherapy, at least one measurable lesion should be located outside the irradiated field; Ongoing or planned first line treatment with 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI plus Cetuximab. At randomisation: WHO performance status 01 (Karnofsky PS &gt; 70%); Laboratory values obtained ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomisation: adequate bone marrow function (Hb &gt; 6.0 mmol/L, absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L), renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN and creatinine clearance, Cockroft formula, &gt; 30 ml/min), liver function (serum bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN, serum transaminases ≤ 3 x ULN without presence of liver metastases or ≤ 5x ULN with presence of liver metastases); Negative pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential; Expected adequacy of followup; Institutional Review Board approval; Written informed consent Exclusion criteria; History or clinical signs/symptoms of CNS metastases; History of a second malignancy ≤ 5 years with the exception of adequately treated carcinoma of cervix or basal/squamous cell carcinoma of skin. Prior adjuvant treatment for stage II/III colorectal cancer ending within 6 months before the start of induction treatment; Any prior adjuvant treatment after resection of distant metastases; Previous systemic treatment for advanced disease.</criteria>
