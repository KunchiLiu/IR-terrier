	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of an oral Vitamin D on the body's immune system. An interest has been growing because studies have shown that Vitamin D may reduce inflammation and harmful effects in the body, however, the best dose for Vitamin D is still unknown. Inflammation is the body's physical response to infection, injury, or long term disease. Pain, redness, heat, and sometimes loss of function are all signs of inflammation in the body. This study will look at product use, testing skin irritation in healthy volunteers and seeing how Vitamin D may help stop or reduce inflammation and skin irritation, which could one day help doctors prescribe Vitamin D to patients with long term disease to relieve their symptoms.</brief_summary>
