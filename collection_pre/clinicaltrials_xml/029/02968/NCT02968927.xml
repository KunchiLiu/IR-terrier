	<brief_title>TB Host Directed Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of 4 TB HDT candidates: 1. Safety (treatment emergent serious adverse events and SUSARs) 2. Microbiologic effects in sputum (culture conversion, change in MGIT TTP) and blood (WBA) 3. PET/CT imaging 4. Serum markers of inflammation 5. Effects on Mtb-specific and general immune function 6. Pulmonary effects (spirometry, 6MWT, O2 saturation, and St. George Respiratory Symptom Questionnaire) In each case, TB HDT effects will be determined by comparison to patients treated with standard TB therapy alone with regard to a common set of primary and secondary endpoints. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS 1. For auranofin, everolimus, and vitamin D: the proportions of patients experiencing suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). 2. For CC-11050: the proportion of patients experiencing treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs).</detailed_description>
