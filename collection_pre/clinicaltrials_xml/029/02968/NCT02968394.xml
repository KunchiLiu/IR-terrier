	<brief_title>Omalizumab Treatment in Venom Immunotherapy With Systemic Reactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some honey bee venom allergic patients cannot be treated with venom immunotherapy due to systemic reactions during immunotherapy - immunotherapy failure due to systemic reactions. High basophil allergen sensitivity is a risk factor for venom immunotherapy failure due to systemic reactions. Omalizumab decreases basophil sensitivity. Venom immunotherapy failure patients will be co-treated with omalizumab during another attempt of immunotherapy introduction. Patients will be clinically and immunologically followed up after the introduction.</detailed_description>
