	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this study is to further understand the memory response to HPV vaccination in subjects who have received 2 versus 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Although memory responses can be detected shortly after immunization, the best approach to measure the long-lasting anamnestic response is to challenge with a booster dose years (&gt; 5) after the original exposure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Immune Memory Responses to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Following 2 Verses 3 Doses of Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, interventional study to evaluate long term memory response to Q-HPV vaccination and to natural infection. Memory response will be assessed by measuring seroprotection 8-10 years post Q-HPV vaccination and to challenge with a booster dose years after the original exposure to measure the long-lasting anamnestic response.</detailed_description>
