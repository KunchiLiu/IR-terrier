	<brief_summary>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has a relatively high prevalence in adolescents. Exercise is the most common conservative therapy for mild AIS patients. There are increasing evidences suggesting that physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE) can halt the curve progression. Nevertheless, the evidence concerning PSSE is inadequate and low quality. The aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of PSSE on Cobb's angle, rotation angle, fall index, pulmonary function, bone quality, and health related quality-of-life (HRQoL) for mild AIS patients, and to promote PSSE's application in Shanghai. Prior to inclusion, all subjects will be examined by the physiatrists. A parent of each subject will be asked to sign an informed consent form before the subject participate in the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized by a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer either to the intervention group, in which they will perform PSSEs; or the control group, in which they will perform generalised physiotherapy exercises. All subjects will be assessed at the initial visit and 6 months. A multidimensional, comprehensive evaluation including aesthetic appearance, radiographic measurement, static balance test, pulmonary function test, bone quality, and HRQoL will be used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercises in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional deformity of the spinal column, including scoliosis in the coronal plane, fixed rotation of the vertebral body and physiological curvature loss in the sagittal plane. AIS has a relatively high prevalence in adolescents. Exercise is the most common conservative therapy for mild AIS patients and has been widely used to reduce spinal deformity and halt curve progression. There are two kinds of exercises: generalised physiotherapy exercises and physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE). Little evidence is in favor of generalised physiotherapy exercises. There are increasing evidences suggesting that PSSE can halt the curve progression. Nevertheless, the evidence concerning PSSE is inadequate and low quality. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of PSSE on Cobb's angle, rotation angle, fall index, pulmonary function, bone quality, and health related quality-of-life (HRQoL) for mild AIS patients, and to promote PSSE's application in Shanghai. The AIS patients will be recruited from and investigated at the Xinhua Hospital, Xinhua Hospital Chongming Branch, Shanghai First Rehabilitation Hospital, Shanghai Yangzhi Rehabilitation Hospital, and Shanghai Yangpu Daqiao Community Health Service Centre. Prior to inclusion, all subjects will be examined by the physiatrists. The subjects' height, weight, shoulder, chest, back and pelvic asymmetries, and the Adams forward bend test will be evaluated and recorded. The following information will be obtained for all subjects, including demographic data (for example, age and sex), menarche status for the girls, and family history. A parent of each subject will be asked to sign an informed consent form before the subject participate in the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized by a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer either to the intervention group, in which they will perform PSSEs under the guidance of an experienced physiotherapist with expertise in scoliosis in an outpatient clinic; or the control group, in which they will perform generalised physiotherapy exercises. All subjects will receive the treatment as allocated and will be assessed at the initial visit and 6 months. A multidimensional, comprehensive evaluation including aesthetic appearance, radiographic measurement, static balance test, pulmonary function test, bone quality, and HRQoL will be used.</detailed_description>
