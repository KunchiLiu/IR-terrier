	<brief_title>Alzheimer's Disease and Physiological, Cognitive Function and BDNF Levels of Plasma Adaptation After Exercise Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Present in greater amounts in the regions of the hippocampus and cortex, the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to both learning and memory processes. This protein is found in lower amounts in people with AD. Acute physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity would increase the levels of plasma BDNF whether for a healthy person or a person with AD. Nevertheless in rest, healthy people have higher level of BDNF than individuals with AD. There are no studies on the effect of chronic exercise based on BDNF level at rest in people with AD. In a hypothetical endurance training of 18 sessions, whether interval or continuous training the levels of BDNF would increase in people with AD at rest. Their physiological and neuropsychological performances would also show a rise.</detailed_description>
