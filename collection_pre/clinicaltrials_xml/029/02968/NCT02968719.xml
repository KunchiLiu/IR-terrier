	<brief_summary>A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label, 3-Way Crossover, Pilot, Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate the Steady State Pharmacokinetics of a Once-Weekly Application of Corplex Donepezil Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) Compared to Daily Oral Administration of Aricept in Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1, Corplex™ Donepezil Trans-dermal System Compared to Oral Aricept®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 male and female subjects will be enrolled Subjects will receive 2 versions of once-weekly Corplex Donepezil TDS and QD oral Aricept; each administered for 35 days in 3 different treatment periods. For each treatment period; Subjects will receive a lead-in dose of approximately 5 mg donepezil/day for 7 days before commencing a dose of 10 mg donepezil/day for 28 days. Blood samples for donepezil PK and red blood cell (RBC) AChEI (as a potential pharmacodynamic [PD] marker) will be collected pre-dose through Week 8. Adhesion and skin irritation will be monitored throughout TDS Treatments. A washout period of at least 21 days between the last study drug administration (oral administration or removal of TDS, as appropriate) in each treatment period and the first application of TDS or oral drug administration, as appropriate, in the following treatment period. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting, repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations</detailed_description>
