	<brief_summary>There are 10 million atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in China, and the patients are risk of stroke, heart failure and sudden death. Persistent AF is still a refractory disease, and single catheter ablation only has a success rate around 30-50%. Hybrid strategy consisting of thoracoscopic epicardial ablation and transvenous endocardial ablation seems to be an attractive procedure to improve the treatment of persistent AF. However, only a few centers reported their preliminary results, and the conclusions are controversial. The investigator previously reported a minimally invasive surgical ablation from left thoracoscope only and achieved good results. Recently, the investigator successfully explored a hybrid procedure combing this unique surgical technique and transvenous catheter ablation. Here, the investigator present a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this novel hybrid procedure. The hypothesis is that a hybrid approach is more efficient than surgical ablation alone in the treatment of persistent AF. This study is a non-randomized controlled study within a single institution. Isolated persistent AF patients admitted to the cardiovascular surgery department of Shanghai Xinhua Hospital will be screened for enrollment of this study. The study will recruit 180 patients in total. Based on their own willingness, the patients will be divided into hybrid group and minimally invasive (MIS) group. The MIS group patients only have surgical ablation surgery from left thoracoscope as the investigator reported before, while the hybrid group patients will have additional transvenous catheter ablation after the surgical ablation is done during the same operation. The ratio of hybrid to MIS group is expected to be 1:1, so that each group contains 90 patients. The perioperative data is collected, and the patients will be followed for 6 months. The primary outcome is the rate of sinus rhythm at 6 months post operation. The secondary outcomes include off antiarrhythmic drug rate, perioperative complications, major cardiovascular events, stroke, left ventricular systolic function, medical expense, serum brain natriuretic peptide level and quality of life. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this novel hybrid procedure, therefore to provide more evidence of the hybrid strategy in the treatment of persistent AF.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Isolated atrial fibrillation, without structural heart disease. 2. Persistent atrial fibrillation (Af last time &gt; 7 days, including persistent long standing atrial fibrillation) 3. Patients with symptomatic AF that is refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medication; symptomatic patients are those who have been aware of their AF at any time within the last 5 years before enrolment. Symptoms may include, but are not restricted to, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, left ventricular dysfunction, or other symptoms, or any combination of these. 4. Patient admitted with intent to treat by either hybrid or surgical ablation 5. Consent Exclusion Criteria 1. Previous surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation 2. Concomitant other cardiac diseases which require surgery at the same procedure, such as heart valve disease, congenital heart disease, coronary disease, dilated cardiomyopathy etc. 3. With other forms of severe arrhythmia 4. Ejection fraction of left ventricle less than 30% 5. Anteroposterior diameter of left atrial over 60mm 6. Tumor, active infection, pregnancy. 7. Previous surgeries with left thoracotomy, or expected left pleural adhesion, such as history of tuberculosis infection, pleural effusion, pneumothorax etc. 8. Hyperthyroidism 9. Thrombosis within left atrial appendage 10. General conditions too weak to tolerate the surgeries 11. Patient's circumstance that precludes completion of followup and/or obtaining information from the 1year followup 12. Other conditions not appropriate for this study based on the investigators' judgments</criteria>
