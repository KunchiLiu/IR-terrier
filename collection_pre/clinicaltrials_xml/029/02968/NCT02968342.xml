	<brief_title>Role of Progesterone in Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Steroid hormones play fundamental roles in sexual behaviour. Sexual activity is related to hormone concentrations and ovulation in women. Women's sexuality, unlike that of most mammals, is not solely defined by sexual receptivity during the short window of fertility. Women are also prone to initiate luteal-phase sex when serum levels of progesterone are highest in the menstrual cycle.As a result of ovarian hormonal cessation after menopause women may face alterations in sexual desire. The role of progesterone supplementation in improving sexual desire in the menopausal period is investigated.</detailed_description>
