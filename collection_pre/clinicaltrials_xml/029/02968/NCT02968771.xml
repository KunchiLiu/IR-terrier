	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to analyze metabolomic pattern of patients after cardiac stress in order to detect differences based on the type of stress (physical or pharmacological with adenosine agonists) and result of test (positive or negative for ischemia) and to indentify biochemical markers with prognostic value. Clinical data of enrolled patients regarding demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, pretest probability and previous cardiovascular disease will be recorded. Follow up will be at one, three and five years and will be performed by clinical recordings or phone call when necessary. Blood samples of patients undergoing myocardial perfusion SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) are taken before, immediately after stress and 2h after stress. Serum samples will be analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance in order to know metabolomic profile.</brief_summary>
