	<brief_summary>Our primary aim is to determine whether licorice gargling provides meaningful analgesia after oral surgery. Specifically, we propose to test the primary hypothesis that gargling with licorice solution reduces pain after oral surgery more than gargling with sugar water. Because effective analgesia can reduce pain and/or opioid consumption, we will jointly evaluate verbal response pain scores and overall morphine consumption considering licorice to be beneficial only if it proves non-inferior on both measures and superior on at least one.</brief_summary>
