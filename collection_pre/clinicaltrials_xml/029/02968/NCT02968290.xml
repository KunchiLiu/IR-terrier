	<brief_title>Quantification of Posterior Capsule Opacification in Cataract Pediatric.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eye exam at the first appointment will consist of anamnesis, external motor, evaluating strabismus and nystagmus, visual acuity with and without correction, biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, binocular ultrasound biometry, pachymetry and specular microscopy. The surgery will be performed by a single surgeon under general anesthesia. All participants will receive primary intraocular lens implantation as the randomization process, or hydrophobic acrylic material or hydrophilic acrylic. The implanted intraocular lens differ primarily in the material. The lens of hydrophobic acrylic materials (AcrySof SA60AT, Alcon Lab) single, folding part, material acrylate / methacrylate with UV protection AcrySof filter, optical diameter of 6.0 mm, total length of 13.0 mm, haptic angle of 0 degree with 360 degree double square edge, spherical convex earlier. The lens hydrophilic acrylic material (Akreos ADAPT, Bausch and Lomb) single, folding piece with optical diameter 6.00 mm and length de10.7 mm aspheric convex in anterior and posterior with absorbent UV, haptic angle 0 degree angulation . It has 4 attachment points (haptics) with 360 degree square double edge.</detailed_description>
