	<brief_summary>Poor adherence to tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is common and the leading cause of therapeutic failure. The investigators need better ways to measure adherence in patients on PrEP. This application will address the need to measure adherence by evaluating an integrated technology system, Proteus Discover, when combined with Truvada. The Proteus Sensor System (PSS) will confirm that Truvada was taken, monitor adherence in both recent and long term dosing, and provides feedback to encourage adherence. The goal of this study is to determine whether the use of the PSS with Truvada will vary the drug concentrations of FTC/TDF. Participants will have 2 study visits where they will be randomized to either start with the combined PSS with Truvada or just Truvada alone. Study participants will come to the Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center (CTRC) in the morning and take the assigned dose and will then have blood drawn at about .25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 hours after medication is taken. Participants will then return to the CTRC for blood draws 24, 48, and 72 hours after they took the dose on the first day. The second visit will mimic the first except that the participant will take the other dose form.</brief_summary>

Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant within 3 months of study completion 3. Currently breastfeeding 4. High risk of HIV1 infection (for example: sexually active with an HIV infected partner; men who have sex with men who may engage in condomless intercourse with HIVinfected partners or partner of unknown status during the study; males or females who exchange sex for money, shelter, or gifts; active injection drug use or during the last 12 months; newly diagnosed sexually transmitted infections in last 6 months) 5. Positive HIV+ ELISA or suspected acute HIV infection in the opinion of the clinician. (example signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection include combinations of fever, headache, fatigue, arthralgia, vomiting, myalgia, diarrhea, pharyngitis, rash, night sweats, and adenopathy cervical or inguinal) 6. Positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen test. 7. Uncontrolled or symptomatic bone disease or history of nontraumatic bone fractures 8. Active psychiatric illness or alcohol/drug abuse that, in the opinion of the investigators, would interfere with study requirements 9. Creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min, or history of serious renal disease 10. Urine dipstick protein ≥ 2+ 11. Total bilirubin and/or hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST) ≥ 2.5x upper limit of normal 12. Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,500/mm3, platelets count ≤ 100,000/mm3, or hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL. 13. Any laboratory value or uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the opinion of investigators, would interfere with the study conditions or increase risk to the participant 14. &gt; Grade I abnormalities in screening laboratory tests (Complete Blood Count, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Lipase, Phosphorus) per Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Grading Table 15. Contraindicated concomitant medications based upon product information or that, in the opinion of the investigators, would interact with the study medications or increase risk to participant such as: investigational agents (within 30 days of enrollment), aminoglycosides, ganciclovir/valganciclovir, chronic highdose acyclovir/valacyclovir (&gt;800mg acyclovir or &gt; 500mg valacyclovir for &gt; 7 days), cyclosporine, amphotericin B, foscarnet, and cidofovir, and products with same or similar active ingredients as the study medications including TRUVADA®, ATRIPLA®, COMPLERA®, EMTRIVA®, VIREAD®; or drugs containing lamivudine or adefovir, which are close analogs of FTC and tenofovir. 16.
