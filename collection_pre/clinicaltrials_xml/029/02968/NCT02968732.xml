	<brief_summary>A prospective, investigational study to assess the accuracy of standardized cystoscopic evaluation with tissue sampling performed immediately prior to definitive radical cystectomy to predict pathologic tumor stage and identify patients who may benefit from bladder preservation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystoscopic Evaluation Predicting pT0 Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Archival specimen of prior diagnostic TUR will be prepared as 10-20 unstained 5-10 micron slides to under-go next generation sequencing and be compared to final cystectomy specimen to investigate potential pre-treatment signatures predictive of response to chemotherapy and to understand genomic evolution of primary tumors after chemotherapy. All patients will also have urine, PBMC, and serum/plasma collected at baseline, day of procedure, 4-6 weeks post-procedure, and 6 months post-procedure. The baseline samples will be collected prior to any chemotherapy administration and prior to the procedure. On the day of the patient's radical cystectomy, standard rigid cystourethroscopy will be performed. A urine sample will be collected from the bladder. A plasma sample will be collected while the patient is under anesthesia or in pre-op holding area. Visible tumor and prior tumor sites will be targeted for tissue sampling (no more than two sites will be targeted). A standardized tumor quantification system will be employed to document location and presence of tumor and previous biopsy sites. To this end, the investigators have developed a novel scoring system that allows for objective quantification of endoscopic findings at the time of cystoscopy and indexes presence and location of papillary tumor, erythema, and scar. Two additional random biopsies will be obtained, one from the posterior wall and one from the lateral wall for assessment of genomic signatures within normal-appearing mucosa. Tumor location and its relationship to the ureteral orifices will be noted in order to assist the surgeon in performance of radical cystectomy. The patient will then undergo radical cystectomy as per standard of care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients age &gt;18 years at the time of consent. 2. Patients with a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma clinical stage T1T4NanyM0. 3. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 03. 4. Patients must have a clinical decision to proceed with radical cystectomy by any conventional approach (open, laparoscopic, robotassisted laparoscopic). Time from decision to surgery is usually 38 weeks for those who do not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 1014 weeks for those who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. During this time, eligibility for study participation will be verified. 5. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA authorization document or a legally authorized representative who has the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA authorization on behalf of the participant. 6. Women of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive measure. 1. Patients who undergo cystectomy with noncurative intent will be excluded. 2. Patients who have undergone any prior pelvic irradiation. 3. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Radical cystectomy and prolonged general anesthesia would place the fetus at considerable risk of demise. The prolonged recovery and debility of the patient would severely limit the patient's ability to nurse and care for an infant.</criteria>
