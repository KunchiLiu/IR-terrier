	<brief_title>Building a Community-based Network to Promote Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is growing concern about the use of tobacco among women in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, nearly all of them reported that they had not attended smoking cessation services provided by the government and other organizations, of which only 6.7% indicated that they would like to attend, demonstrating the need for population-based smoking cessation interventions targeting female smokers in Hong Kong. In response to the increased number of female smokers and their low usage rates of smoking cessation services, the first smoking cessation hotline for female smokers in Hong Kong was established in 2006 by the University of Hong Kong. The aim of this study was to describe the development of a community-based network to promote the smoking cessation hotline among female smokers in Hong Kong.</detailed_description>
