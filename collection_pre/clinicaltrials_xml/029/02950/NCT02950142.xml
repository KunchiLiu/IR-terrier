	<brief_title>Evidence-based Laboratory Test Order Sets in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cluster randomised controlled trial in Belgian primary care practices. Participants will be primary care physicians working in primary care practices affiliated to one of three collaborating laboratories in the Leuven, Ghent or Antwerp regions. Primary care practices will be allocated and randomized to either the intervention or control group. Physicians in PCPs randomized to the intervention will be offered order sets based on indication when using the CPOE for ordering laboratory tests. The effect of order sets will be analyzed for the five most common indications for ordering laboratory tests in Belgian primary care: follow-up of diabetes mellitus, follow-up of hypertension, follow-up of cardiovascular disease, general check-up, and fatigue.</detailed_description>
