	<brief_title>Physician Mental Health Study for Medical Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wearable sensors and mental health platforms delivered via smartphones offer an opportunity to passively and actively acquire quantifiable signs and symptoms related to mental health status. These features include both physiological and cognitive performance measures. Collectively they serve as a set of metrics whereby an estimation of a person's mental state can be gauged. Additionally, use of these platforms allows those who are identified as high risk for mental illness to have targeted therapy delivered via their smartphone and if necessary connected with a suitable healthcare provider. Applications of such technology platforms serve to potentially reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality in a population at increased risk for mental illness and burnout.</detailed_description>
