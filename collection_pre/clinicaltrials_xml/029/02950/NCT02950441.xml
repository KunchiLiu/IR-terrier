	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the physiological consequences of elevating Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) availability using Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) supplementation in skeletal muscle tissue, and examine its effect upon muscle metabolic phenotype.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide and Skeletal Muscle Metabolic Phenotype</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-NAD+ sensitive metabolic decline in ageing, including sarcopenia, leads to a reduction in energy metabolism, contribute to chronic inflammation, disposing individuals to metabolic disease and overall decreased later-life health. Prominent metabolic changes include a decline in NAD+ content and deterioration in muscle NAD+ mediated signalling and mitochondrial function, ultimately compromising skeletal muscle and whole body energy homeostasis. The most efficient means to boost NAD+ in muscle appears to be oral delivery of NR, and participants will be supplemented with 1000mg NR (2x x250mg tablets twice daily) for 3 weeks. - Hypothesis: elevating skeletal muscle NAD+ bioavailability using NR supplementation will increase markers of mitochondrial function and that will manifest as a more favourable metabolic profile. - Study Setting: the study will be carried out at the NIHR/Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.</detailed_description>
