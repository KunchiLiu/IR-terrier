	<brief_title>Anesthesia for Pain After Ankle Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will test the hypothesis that prolonged regional peripheral nerve block will reduce development of chronic pain in patients undergoing surgery for ankle fracture. Regional nerve block using local anesthetics delivered by ambulatory pump is used in some types of surgeries but is not routine for ankle fracture patients in our hospitals. Patients will be randomized to standard care (single shot peripheral nerve block prior to surgery) or experimental (the same single shot nerve block, followed by continuous popliteal nerve block with ropivacaine starting just after surgery). The primary outcome will be scores on a validated ankle/foot pain questionnaire that includes questions on function. Subjects will be followed for one year. Secondary outcome will be postoperative opioid use.</detailed_description>
