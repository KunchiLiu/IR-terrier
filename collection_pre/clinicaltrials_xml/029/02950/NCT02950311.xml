	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of children, age 6 months to 3 years, with a diagnosis of Otis media with effusion (OME) based on examination by a provider at a Duke- affiliated otolaryngology clinic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Xylitol for Otitis Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal xylitol in young children with otitis media with effusion as measured by the resolution of middle ear effusion based on physical examination and tympanometry at 6-, 12-, and 18 and 24-weeks post-treatment. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either intranasal xylitol spray or a nasal saline spray placebo and will be observed for 24-weeks following initiation of daily xylitol spray or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, the time to middle ear effusion resolution with and without the xylitol nasal spray, will be analyzed using either a two-sample t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon test, depending on whether the time is normal or non-normal. Risks include epistaxis, diarrhea, and allergic reaction. Serious adverse events are not anticipated.</detailed_description>
