	<brief_title>Does Prehabilitation Improve Exercise Performance and Insulin Resistance After Surgery for Oesophago-gastric Cancer?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial objectives are as follows: Primary: To evaluate the effect of a prehabilitation programme during neo-adjuvant therapy on CPX performance prior to resection for oesophago-gastric cancer. Secondary: To investigate the impact of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on insulin resistance; to determine whether a prehabilitation exercise programme is feasible during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy; to determine whether rehabilitation has a positive impact on quality of life outcomes; to investigate the impact of prehabilitation on clinical outcomes; to assess the effect of prehabilitation on nutritional status; to determine whether prehabilitation affects the stress response to surgery. This study is a randomised controlled trial where patients will be stratified into 'fit' and 'unfit' groups based upon their anaerobic threshold and then randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive multimodal prehabilitation or standard care prior to OG cancer surgery, during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
