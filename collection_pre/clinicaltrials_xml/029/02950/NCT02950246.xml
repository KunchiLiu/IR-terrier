	<brief_summary>Implementation of perineural catheters may lead to infection by catheter colonization. Catheters may be colonized by the bacteria present on the skin. This is most often commensal organisms as Staphylococcus or gram negative bacilli. In a large study of 1416 peripheral nerve catheters, 28.7% of catheters were cultured positive. This colonization is most often silent because in the same study only 3% of patients had signs of local inflammation and one psoas abscess was observed (0.07%). The germs are most often coagulase negative staphylococci (61%) and gram negative bacillus (21.6%).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alcoholic Chlorhexidine Compared to Povidone Iodine to Limit Perineural Catheter Colonisation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential interest of alcoholic Chlorhexidine 2% to reduce the colonization of implanted catheters More recently, it is the antiseptic solution that has been the subject of several studies, including the latest on laying intravascular central catheters, highlights the superiority of alcoholic chlorhexidine 2% compared to povidone iodine alcohol [ 5]. Indeed, it was observed a reduction in the risk of bacterial infection 6 (RR 0 • 15, 95% CI 0 • 05-0 • 41) and of colonization by 5 (RR: 0.18 (95% Cl 0.13-0.24) through the use of alcoholic chlorhexidine with 2% applicator. Such a study comparing the efficacy of the antiseptic (chlorhexidine vs Povidone-iodine) on the establishment of perineural catheters does not exist what motivated the establishment of our study.</detailed_description>
