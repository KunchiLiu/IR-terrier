	<brief_summary>Food intake pattern and lifestyle are associated with the nutritional status and intestinal microbiota composition, and such factors are important for the proper growth and development during early childhood, as well as for the health throughout life. This cross-sectional and multicenter study will include a total of 200 children aged between 1-3 years, enrolled in early childhood public schools from different regions of Brazil (Santo André, Uberaba, Porto Alegre and Natal). Data on birth and gestational history will be collected in a form. Nutritional status will be assessed by determining the weight and height, with subsequent calculations and classification of nutritional indices. A single blood sample will be collected to investigate the blood levels of vitamins A and D, iron, calcium, alkaline phosphatase and zinc, and feces will be collected for intestinal microbiota analysis. Food intake will be assessed by direct weighing of food in 2 non-consecutive days. Considering the importance of a well-balanced diet and its effects on the child's growth, development and intestinal colonization, this study purpose is to investigate potential associations among food intake, nutritional status and intestinal microbiota of early childhood infants from four regions of Brazil.</brief_summary>

The interviewer shall complete a questionnaire to obtain information on the birth and gestational history and current information on the child. A single blood sample will be collected for analysis of vitamins A and D, calcium, iron, ferritin, hemoglobin, zinc, selenium, alkaline phosphatase and lipids (cholesterol - total and fractions - and triglycerides), and a stool sample will be collected for analysis of parasites and microbiota in the feces.</detailed_description>
