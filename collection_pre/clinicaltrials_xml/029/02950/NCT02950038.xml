	<brief_title>Study of Ibrutinib Followed by Ibrutinib in Combination With Nivolumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle will be 28 days. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, during Cycle 1, you will take ibrutinib alone. Ibrutinib should be taken by mouth 1 time each day with a glass of water. You should take the study drug at the same time every day. You may take your dose of ibrutinib with or without food. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day. You should not take any extra doses on the following day to make up for any forgotten doses. Beginning with Cycle 2, you will receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 15 of every cycle. You will continue to take ibrutinib as you did during Cycle 1. You will be given a pill diary to complete. You should record in the diary each dose of medication you take and when you took it. You should bring this diary with you to each study visit. Study Visits: On Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of all cycles: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Between Days 21 and 28 of Cycle 1: - You will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing and to check your immune system's response to the study drug. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for cytokine/chemokine testing. On Day 28 of Cycle 1 only, you will have a CT of the neck and chest to check the status of the disease. On Day 28 (+/- 7 days) of Cycle 1 and then every 8 weeks after that: - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid function. - You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. If you can become pregnant, you may have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test at any time the doctor thinks it is needed. Length of Study: You may receive ibrutinib for up to 2 years. You may receive nivolumab for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. Follow up: Within 30 days after the last dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. Long-term follow up: Every 6 months for up to 2 years after your first dose of study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It is considered investigational to use this drug to treat NSCLC. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer, or recurrent nonsmall cell lung cancer which is not amenable to curative intent therapy. 2. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria 3. Patients must have experienced progressive disease following at least one platinumbased chemotherapy regimen in the setting of advanced disease or have progressed within 6 months of receiving chemotherapy as part of locoregional therapy. 4. Patients must have biopsy accessible disease and must be willing and able to undergo a biopsy 5. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 2 7. Ability to take pills by mouth 8. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes &gt;/= 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,000/mcL independent of growth factor support platelet count &gt;/= 100,000/mm3 independent of transfusion support OR &gt;/= 50,000/mm3 independent of transfusion support if bone marrow involvement total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;/= 3 Ã— ULN creatinine clearance &gt;/= 25 mL/min 9. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases are allowed, as long as they are treated, stable, and do not require treatment with anticonvulsants or escalating doses of steroids. Maximum daily dose of steroids should be prednisone 10 mg or equivalent. Radiation therapy for brain metastases must be completed at least 14 days prior to treatment on protocol. Patients with untreated brain metastases who are stable, asymptomatic and not requiring treatment with anticonvulsants or escalating doses of steroids are eligible. 10. Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active must be practicing a highly effective method of birth control during and after the study consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects participating in clinical trials. Men must agree to not donate sperm during and after the study. For females, these restrictions apply for 3 months after the last dose of ibrutinib and 6 month after the last dose of nivolumab. For males, these restrictions apply for 3 month after the last dose of study drugs. 11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (bhCG)) or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to treatment initiation and when clinically indicated every 4 weeks +/ 7 days while receiving study drugs, as shown in study calendar. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are ineligible for this study. 12.
