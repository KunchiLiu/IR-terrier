	<brief_summary>There is no accepted standard for the frequency of monitoring endotracheal tube cuff pressures (ETCP). We plan on comparing two strategies for monitoring ETCP in mechanically ventilated patients. The two strategies will be the currently employed practice protocol as outlined in the Respiratory Therapy Protocol at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) which requires ETCP to be assessed immediately after the endotracheal tube is placed and after any manipulation of the endotracheal tube to include repositioning, manipulation of the cuff volume, or presence of an audible leak. We will compare this current practice to a more intensive monitoring of ETCP which is employed at some hospitals and includes the same elements as noted in the current practice plus monitoring ETCP every work shift (every 8 hours or three times per day).</brief_summary>

There is no accepted standard for the frequency of monitoring endotracheal tube cuff pressures (ETCP). We plan on comparing two strategies for monitoring ETCP in mechanically ventilated patients. The two strategies will be the currently employed practice protocol as outlined in the Respiratory Therapy Protocol at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) which requires ETCP to be assessed immediately after the endotracheal tube is placed and after any manipulation of the endotracheal tube to include repositioning, manipulation of the cuff volume, or presence of an audible leak. We will compare this current practice to a more intensive monitoring of ETCP which is employed at some hospitals and includes the same elements as noted in the current practice plus monitoring ETCP every work shift (every 8 hours or three times per day). The ETCP will be assessed using a standard manometer. The two practices will be compared between patients assigned to odd and even beds in the medical ICU (8400 ICU) with odd numbered patients having the current ETCP practice and those in even rooms having the addition of ETCP assessments every shift. It is important to note that the respiratory therapists carrying out the ETCP assessments are simply performing their jobs as therapists in a normal manner to include the assessment of ETCPs. The respiratory therapists come in to work in the ICU and carry out their jobs according to the current protocol in that unit. ETCP assessments are a routine part of their job. They will be simply carrying out their job according to protocol based on the room number the patient is in. Assessing ETCPs takes less than 1-2 minutes to carry out. The respiratory therapists working in the medical ICU will be carrying out their jobs in a normal way. Respiratory therapy practices and protocols are frequently changed over the course of time. The therapists will continue to carry out their jobs in a routine manner in the medical ICU. I.9 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol") Our hypothesis is that increased monitoring frequency of ETCP will not result in any reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation for patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of BJH or reduction in ventilator-associated events. I.10 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project. (do not indicate "see protocol") Currently there is no accepted gold standard for the frequency of monitoring ETCP (1). There are widely different strategies reported for monitoring ETCP to include continuous monitoring. The goal of ETCP monitoring is to maintain the ETCP between 20-30 cmH2O in order to minimize cuff leaks and pressure injury to the tracheal mucosa. It is known that 20 to 30% of the time the ETCP may deviate above or below this threshold. However, the impact of such deviation on clinical outcomes is not well described in the medical literature (2). The two most common methods for assessing ETCP is the use of a manometer and performing a minimal leak, with the former being the most accepted method (3). However, the optimal frequency for conducting manometric monitoring of ETCP is unknown. One recent study suggests that the act of measuring ETCP frequently in order to achieve a desired pressure level results in the removal of air from the cuff and can result in under inflation of the cuff (4). However, a recent animal study suggests that the material used to manufacture the endotracheal tube cuff may play a more important role in determining the presence or absence of mucosal injury, with polyurethane being better than polyvinylchloride (5). The main problem with these studies is the failure to assess clinical outcomes at the bedside with the use of various strategies to maintain an appropriate endotracheal tube cuff seal. A recent survey of intensivists in Queensland Australia and accompanying systematic literature review made the following conclusions regarding ETCP monitoring "Twenty-eight out of twenty-nine respondents reported routinely monitoring tracheal cuff function, primarily employing cuff pressure measurement (26/28). Target cuff pressures varied, with 3/26 respondents aiming for 10 to 20 cmH2O, 10/26 for 21 to 25 cmH2O, and 13/26 for 26 to 30 cmH2O. Fifteen out of twenty-nine reported they had no current guideline or protocol for tracheal cuff management and only 16/29 indicated there was a dedicated area in the clinical record for reporting cuff intervention. Our results indicate that many ICUs across Queensland routinely measure tracheal cuff function, with most utilising pressure monitoring devices. Consistent with existing literature, the optimum cuff pressure remains uncertain. Most, however, considered that this should be a routine part of ICU care"(6). Thus, the available literature on ETCP and their relationship to clinical outcomes is lacking.</detailed_description>
