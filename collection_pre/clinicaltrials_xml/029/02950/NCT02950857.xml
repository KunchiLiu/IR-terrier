	<brief_summary>An open-label study in which 6 patients will receive once-weekly subcutaneous injections of EPEG for 4 weeks. Final visit will occur 60 days after study entry</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of EPEG in Beta Thalassemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following the provision of informed consent, screening visit procedures to be performed will include: a detailed medical history (including concomitant medications), physical exam, vital signs (non-invasive systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry,), laboratory testing of blood samples collections for safety (hematology and chemistry), and urinalysis (dipstick and microscopy, if necessary). A serum pregnancy test for all female patients (of child-bearing potential) will be measured during the Screening Visit. Urine pregnancy test for all female patients (of child-bearing potential) will be measured at each dosing visit prior to dosing. Eligible patients will receive either subcutaneous injection of EPEG (0.9 µg/kg, 1.2 µg/kg, and 1.5 µg/kg,) for four weeks followed by follow up for 5-6 weeks after 4th dose of IP. Vital signs will be recorded for study documentation at 1 hour after dosing and at discharge of the day (to occur 2 hours after the time of dosing). All patients will receive standard of care as per investigative site standard practice.</detailed_description>
