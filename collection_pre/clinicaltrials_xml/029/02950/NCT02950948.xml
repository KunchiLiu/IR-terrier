	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study will be to assess the efficacy of natural progesterone at a daily dose of 25 mg in restoring a normal luteal phase. The primary end-point will be the ongoing pregnancy rate. The secondary objectives will be the rate of endometrial biopsy showing an in phase endometrium after 3 months of treatment. The length of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle after treatment will also be assessed and compared with the initial duration (from LH peak to onset of menstruation).</brief_summary>
