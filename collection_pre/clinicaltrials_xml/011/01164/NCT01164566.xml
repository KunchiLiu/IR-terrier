	<brief_title>Esophagoscopy in Evaluating Treatment in Patients With Stage I-IV Head and Neck Cancer Who Are Undergoing Radiation Therapy and/or Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the prevalence of esophageal pathology (any esophageal abnormality, specifically: esophagitis, stricture/web, infections, neoplasms) as identified by esophagoscopy in patients with HNCA before and 3 months following primary radiation and/or chemotherapy. II. To assess the changes in self-reported dysphagia symptoms as measured by the Eating Assessment Tool. OUTLINE: Patients undergo transnasal esophagoscopy at baseline and 3 months following completion of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
