	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether mixed H. pylori strain infection is the reason for eradication failure during treatment of H. pylori infection. The investigators present the results got from extensive sampling of biopsy samples taken from individuals diagnosed with H. pylori connected disease. The investigators were looking for individuals that were not able to eradicate H. pylori although they had susceptibility testing tailored antibiotic therapy. On their control visit after 2 months they presented again with H. pylori although at their first visit they had H. pylori isolated from biopsy sample sensitive to all antibiotics prescribed. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) was used to prove the sequence type of H. pylori and E test was used to determine susceptibility of H. pylori to antibiotics.</brief_summary>
