	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable or refractory thyroid cancer treated with everolimus. Secondary - To evaluate overall survival of these patients treated with everolimus. - To evaluate progression-free survival of these patients. - To evaluate toxicity of this therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.</detailed_description>
