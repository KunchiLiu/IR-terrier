	<brief_summary>Several stimulation protocols have been used in in vitro fertilization (IVF) in a cycle of egg donation; recombinant FSH and human FSH are included. The effect of each kind of hormone on aneuploidy rate it is unknown. If there was an increase on aneuploidy rate of one of these stimulation protocols, there will be a negative effect on the successful rates in the egg donation cycles. The aim of this study is to observe if there is a different in aneuploidy rate and morphological oocyte parameters between different stimulation protocols.</brief_summary>
