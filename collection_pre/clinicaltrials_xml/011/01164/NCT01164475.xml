	<criteria>Age 18 to 78 years (inclusive) Patients diagnosed with NHL who were to receive treatment with an autologous peripheral stem cell transplant for the first time Biopsyconfirmed diagnosis of NHL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and all variants were excluded) Weight less than or equal to 70 kg In first or second complete remission or partial remission, defined for the purpose of this study as complete or partial response following first or secondline therapy only At least 4 weeks since last cycle of chemotherapy and/or other cancer therapy including rituximab Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Recovered from all acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy Negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B, and active hepatitis C from assessments performed within 3 months before signing informed consent Signed informed consent form (ICF) White blood cell count (WBC) greater than (&gt;) 2.5*10^9 per liter (L) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1.5*10^9/L Platelet (PLT) count &gt;100*10^9/L Creatinine clearance &gt;=80 milliliter per minute (mL/min) (estimated by CockcroftGault formula or 24 hour urine collection) Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin less than 2.5*upper limit of normal Cardiac and pulmonary status sufficient to undergo apheresis and transplantation All patients agreed to an effective method of contraception while on study treatment and for at least 3 months following plerixafor treatment (including both female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential) A comorbid condition which, in the view of the Investigator(s), rendered the patient at high risk from treatment complications Failed previous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) collections or collection attempts Prior autologous or allogeneic transplant Less than 6 weeks off 1,3bis (2chloroethyl)1nitrosourea (BCNU) prior to first dose of GCSF Active central nervous system involvement, active brain metastases, or any history of carcinomatous meningitis (active or inactive) Bone marrow involvement &gt;20 percent (%), as assessed by bone marrow biopsy within 4 months of the first screening assessment, unless a bone marrow biopsy was performed immediately prior to the last chemotherapy and was negative and the patient responded to last chemotherapy achieving a complete or partial remission Received radiation therapy to the pelvis Received granulocyte/macrophagecolony stimulating factor (GMCSF) or pegfilgrastim within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) for mobilization Received GCSF within 14 days prior to the first dose of GCSF for mobilization Received prior radioimmunotherapy with ibritumomab tiuxetan or tositumomab iodine Active infection, including unexplained fever (&gt;38.1 degree Celsius / 100.4 Fahrenheit), or antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of GCSF Positive pregnancy test (female patients) Lactating (female patients) Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with clinically significant rhythm disturbance (ventricular arrhythmias) or other conduction abnormality in the last year that, in the opinion of the Investigator(s), warranted exclusion of the patient from the trial Previously received experimental therapy within 4 weeks of enrolling or who were currently enrolled in another experimental protocol during the G CSF and plerixafor treatment period</criteria>
