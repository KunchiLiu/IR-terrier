	<brief_summary>This open-label, non-randomized study will assess the mass balance, metabolism, routes and rates of elimination as well as efficacy and safety of RO5185426 (RG7204; PLEXXIKON; PLX4032) in previously treated or untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will receive continuous twice daily oral treatment with RO5185426. On Day 15, a 14C-labeled dose will be administered. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression occurs.</brief_summary>
