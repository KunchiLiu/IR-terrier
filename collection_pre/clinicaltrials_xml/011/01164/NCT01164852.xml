	<brief_summary>How best to manage preeclampsia remote from term is controversial because of conflicting maternal and neonatal risks. Gestational age is the most important determinant of neonatal outcome. There are two basic approaches when delivery is not clear indicated by assessment of maternal and fetal well-being. The interventionist care when the delivery is planned within 48 hours and the expectant care which refers to pregnancy prolongation during which time women and fetuses are carefully monitored for indications for delivery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes with expectant vs interventionist or aggressive management of severe preeclampsia at 28 to 33 weeks of gestation.</brief_summary>
