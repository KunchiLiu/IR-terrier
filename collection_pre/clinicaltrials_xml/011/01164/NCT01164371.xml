	<brief_summary>The initial manifestation of symptomatic coronary disease can range from angina (or symptoms of angina), unheralded acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or unheralded coronary death. A better understanding of gender differences in initial presentation of coronary disease and the rate and predictors of progression to subsequent stages in coronary disease could help to identify which gender- specific factors might reduce or slow transition to more serious disease states and improve outcomes. The investigators' research focuses on the role primary care management of cardiovascular risk factors plays in gender differences in the progression to subsequent disease states and to mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gender Differences in the Development, Treatment and Prognosis of Coronary Disease: A CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial manifestation of symptomatic coronary disease can range from angina (or symptoms of angina), unheralded acute coronary syndrome, or unheralded coronary death. Gender differences in initial presentation of coronary disease and the rate and predictors of progression to subsequent stages in coronary disease are not well understood. Furthermore, while the management of coronary risk factors in primary care is hypothesized to play a key role in the rate and timing of such transitions, little is known about the impact such management has on gender differences these transitions and outcomes. Study Objectives: 1. To determine gender differences in probabilities of transitions from symptom-free state to mortality for each of three patient coronary disease pathways, where the initial disease manifestation is angina, myocardial infarction or unheralded coronary death. 2. To determine the role management of coronary risk factors in primary care has in explaining any gender differences in transitions from symptom-free state to mortality for each of the three patient coronary disease pathways. A statistical analytic protocol for the first part of this study, comparing patients with unheralded coronary death to patients free of symptomatic coronary disease, dated June 2010, is available on request. A second statistical analytic protocol for the second part of this study, comparing initial presentation of coronary disease, within a framework of competing risks of atherosclerotic disease, dated December 2011, is available on request. This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).</detailed_description>
