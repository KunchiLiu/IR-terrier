	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a combined N-of-1 trial (N-1-T) of MPH (methylphenidate) for amelioration of fatigue in children with cancer, and to evaluate the N-1-T design both for individual clinical decision making and for clinical trials in symptom management in pediatric oncology patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Because no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will receive liquid MPH on some days and a placebo on other days. We will compare how the participant feels on MPH days with how they feel on placebo days to determine whether MPH makes a difference. - Participants will take 3 days of MPH in a row and 3 days of placebo in a row, which will make up one study treatment pair. Participants will receive a total of 3 study treatment pairs. - On the days that the participant takes the MPH or placebo, they will answer one question asking to rate their fatigue. They will also be asked to complete study drug diary as well as a sleep diary. - After every 3 days of either MPH or placebo, the participant will complete an additional survey about their fatigue, other symptoms, and possible side effects from MPH.</detailed_description>
