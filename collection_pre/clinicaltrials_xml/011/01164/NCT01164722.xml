	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Infrared coagulator ablation may be effective in preventing the development of anal cancer in patients with anal neoplasia PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying infrared coagulator ablation to see how well it works compared to observation in preventing anal cancer in HIV-positive patients with anal neoplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infrared Coagulator Ablation or Observation in Preventing Anal Cancer in HIV-Positive Patients With Anal Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the complete response rate at 3 months and 1 year in HIV-seropositive patients with high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) treated with infrared coagulator (IRC) ablation versus observation. Secondary - Determine the tolerability and safety of IRC ablation versus observation in these patients. - Compare the proportion of patients with HGAIN at 1 year. - Evaluate the response and recurrence rates at 1 year of individual lesions in patients treated with this regimen vs observation. - Determine the incidence of metachronous lesions in these patients. - Compare the response and recurrence rates at 2 years of individual lesions in patients under observation who subsequently received IRC ablation with the response and recurrence rates at 1 year in patients initially treated with IRC. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to site. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Infrared coagulator (IRC) contact tip is placed in direct contact with lesion under high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) guidance for 1.5 seconds. IRC ablation is reapplied until the level of submucosal vessels are reached. - One week after each IRC ablation, patients complete a questionnaire regarding pain, bleeding, and other complaints. - Arm II: Patients receive standard of care and undergo observation. After 12 months, patients may receive IRC ablation to all anal intraepithelial neoplasia lesions. NOTE: Patients may receive a maximum of 6 IRC treatments while on study (3 per year). Patients undergo a physical exam, digital rectal exam, anal cytology, and HRA at baseline and periodically during study. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>
