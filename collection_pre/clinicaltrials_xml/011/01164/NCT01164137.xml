	<brief_title>Eliminating Risk of Preventable Adverse Drug Events at the Hospital-community Interface of Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this initiative are to decrease the risk for medication errors at the hospital community interface of care, thus decreasing preventable adverse drug events and preventable drug-related health system utilization following hospital discharge. This initiative has four objectives that aim to: 1. Develop and test a community-based medication reconciliation process/intervention. 2. Design and conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the intervention on post-discharge health services utilization by comparing a set of outcome variables between intervention and non-intervention groups. 3. Design a risk prediction model that helps identify patients discharged from in-patient care with the highest level of need for the intervention. 4. Determine whether a community-based medication reconciliation process/intervention adds risk reduction value to individuals who have undergone an in-hospital medication reconciliation.</detailed_description>
