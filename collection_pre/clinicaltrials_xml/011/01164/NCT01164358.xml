The first study arm includes patients of the preceding study "Intrastromal Correction of Ametropia by Femtosecond Laser (study ISCAF), study arm 1, Presbyopia sub-group: treatment pattern 5-Rings" and the second study arm includes patients of the previous "Intrastromal Presbyopia Correction by Means of Femtosecond Laser (study # 0905)". The hypothesis of the study is that patients after a INTRACOR treatment are satisfied in the long term. By detailed patient information and a clarification conversation it is guaranteed that every interested and agreeing patient fulfils the inclusion criteria of this study. The quantitative measuring values of the patient perception are assessed by a questionnaire. For measuring the subjective / objective diagnostic data only certificated diagnostic devices are used.
