	<detailed_description>The study encompasses two experiments: The first one involves patients with chronic pain, receiving 10 sessions of stimulation, active or sham (parallel design). The second experiment involves involves healthy subjects, receiving active or sham tDCS over the primary motor cortex (crossover design).</detailed_description>
