	<brief_summary>Objective: The primary goal of this study is to investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of CD25-blocking therapies in high inflammatory multiple sclerosis (HI-MS). The secondary goal of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of CD25-blocking therapies in HI-MS. Study population: Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled: - Long-term daclizumab therapy cohort: Up to 15 daclizumab-treated patients with relapsing-remitting (RR-MS) or secondary-progressive MS (SP-MS) previously classified as HI-MS based on MRI/clinical criteria, who have been treated with IV daclizumab for a minimum of 1 year and responded to this therapy with significant (&gt;70%) decrease in contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) or stabilization/improvement of disease activity (&gt;60% decrease in MS relapses and stable or improved EDSS disability score). - New treatment cohort: Up to 15 HI-MS patients (RR- or SP-MS) with inadequate therapeutic response to first-line, FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapies for MS or who cannot, for any reason, be treated with first-line, FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapies for MS. Design: This is an open label, Phase I trial of 150 mg of daclizumab high yield process (DAC HYP) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks for a total of 3 years. Outcome measures: Because the main goal of this study is to investigate the MOA of CD25-blocking therapies in MS, the primary outcomes are mechanistic immunological studies performed on clinical samples (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and skin biopsies) derived from DAC HYP-treated patients. The secondary outcome measure is long-term safety and tolerability of subcutaneous DAC HYP in HI-MS patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: The primary goal of this study is to investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of CD25-blocking therapies in high inflammatory multiple sclerosis (HI-MS). The secondary goal of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of CD25-blocking therapies in HI-MS. Study population: We will enroll up to 70 patients. We expect to screen up to 40 HI-MS participants to yield 31 patients that will receive study drug. Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled for the treatment part of the protocol: A. Long-term daclizumab therapy cohort: 16 daclizumab-treated patients with relapsing-remitting (RR-MS) or secondary-progressive MS (SP-MS) previously classified as HI-MS based on MRI/clinical criteria, who have been treated with IV daclizumab for a minimum of 1 year and responded to this therapy with significant (&gt;70%) decrease in contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) or stabilization/improvement of disease activity (&gt;60% decrease in MS relapses and stable or improved EDSS disability score). B. New treatment cohort: 15 HI-MS patients (RR- or SP-MS) with inadequate therapeutic response to first-line, FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapies for MS or who choose not to, for any reason, be treated with first-line, FDAapproved immunomodulatory therapies for MS. Up to 30 subjects with inflammatory MS will be screened to yield 20 controls for immunization and skin biopsy studies (Cohort C: MS controls). Design: This is an open label, Phase I trial of 150 mg of daclizumab high yield process (DAC HYP) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks for a total of 3 years. Outcome measures: Because the main goal of this study is to investigate the MOA of CD25-blocking therapies in MS, the primary outcomes are mechanistic immunological studies performed on clinical samples (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and skin biopsies) derived from DAC HYP-treated patients. The secondary outcome measure is long-term safety and tolerability of subcutaneous DAC HYP in HI-MS patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study population will consist of 2 cohorts of patients with an accrual ceiling of 40 subjects: A. Longterm daclizumab therapy cohort: Up to 16 patients with HIMS (both RRMS and SPMS) who have been successfully treated with IV daclizumab for a minimum of 1 year. B. New treatment cohort: Up to 15 patients with HIMS (both RRMS and SPMS) who have not been successfully treated with or have not tolerated standard FDAapproved immunomodulatory therapies, or who, for whatever reason, choose not to be treated with standard FDA approved immunomodulatory therapies. INCLUSION CRITERIA: MS as defined by the modified McDonald criteria (Polman, Reingold et al. 2005) HIMS (RRMS or SPMS) before initiation of daclizumab therapy, defined as: greater than or equal to 3 CEL on a single predaclizumab MRI or greater than or equal to 1 MS exacerbation per year before initiation of daclizumab therapy or progression of sustained disability by greater than or equal to 1.0 point on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in the year preceding daclizumab therapy Age 1860, inclusive EDSS 0 to 6.0, inclusive Able to provide informed consent Willing to participate in all aspects of trial design and followup Females of childbearing potential are willing to commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control (i.e., hormonal contraception including birth control pills, injected hormones or vaginal ring; intrauterine device; barrier methods with spermicide, specifically diaphragms or condoms they have undergone surgical sterilization, such as hysterectomy or tubal ligation) for the duration of the study and continued 4 months after conclusion of the study. ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERION FOR THE LONGTERM DACLIZUMAB THERAPY COHORT ONLY: IV daclizumab therapy for at least 1 year with a treatment response consisting of:&lt;TAB&gt; greater than or equal to 70% reduction of CEL after starting daclizumab; or stabilization or improvement of sustained neurological disability on daclizumab.
