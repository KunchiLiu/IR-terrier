	<brief_summary>The study is conducted to examine the suitability of partially respectively extensively hydrolyzed low protein infant formulae with and without pro- and prebiotics for healthy, term infants. Primary hypothesis to be tested is: an infant formula based on a Protein hydrolysate with modified protein content is non inferior compared to a standard infant formula based on a Protein hyrolysate in respect to proper growth of healthy, term infants within the first four month of life. 4-year follow-up (without further Intervention) will focus on body composition and allergic predisposition.</brief_summary>
