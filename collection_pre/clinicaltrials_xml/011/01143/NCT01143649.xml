	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether noninvasive brain stimulation associated with motor learning offers an additional benefit than motor learning alone in patients with stroke. The investigators hypothesis is that active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) will induce a greater motor function improvement as compared with sham tDCS combined with CIMT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Coupled With Constraint Induced Movement Therapy in Stroke Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this 3 experiments study we will evaluate the effect of tDCS and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) in stroke patients (exp 1) as well as in healthy subjects (control population - exp 2). Finally we will investigate the effect of tACS - transcranial alternating current stimulation - as an alternative to tDCS, on motor function in healthy subjects (exp 3). The two experiments on tDCS are parallels (exp 1 &amp; 2), while the experiment on tACS uses a crossover design (exp 3). For stroke patients (Exp1), our primary outcome measure is a clinical scale (Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test), while for healthy subjects (Exp 2) we investigate the effect of tDCS and CIMIT on cortico-spinal excitability using TMS - transcranial magnetic stimulation. Finally, for the third experiment using tACS, our primary outcome is cortical oscillation, as measured by EEG - electroencephalogram.</detailed_description>
