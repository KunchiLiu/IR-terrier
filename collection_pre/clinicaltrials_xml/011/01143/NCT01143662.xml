	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label and positive controlled Phase II Clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of Ypeginterferon alfa-2b, once a week, in 3 dose-groups: 90mcg, 135mcg and 180mcg, respectively, for treatment of chronic hepatitis B characterized by HBeAg positivity, with Pegasys 180mcg/week as positive control. It is aimed to establish a dose response and safety relationship sufficient to allow the subsequent design and conduct of Phase III trials, and generate pharmacokinetic data of Ypeginterferon alfa-2b in hepatitis B patients to satisfy regulatory requirements.</brief_summary>
