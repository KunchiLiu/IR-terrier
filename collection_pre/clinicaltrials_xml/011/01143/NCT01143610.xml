	<brief_summary>Different surgical techniques have been proposed for root coverage, showing varying results especially in areas of deep recessions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly forming bone technique (NFB)as an alternative treatment for Miller class I or II deep recessions, requiring regeneration of lost periodontal tissues. Sample should be comprised of patients aged 18-45 years, both genders, presenting at least one site with marginal tissue recession &gt;4mm. Patients will be randomly assigned to either one of the groups, based on treatment technique: newly forming bone (NFB) or subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG). Clinical examinations will be performed by a single blinded examiner at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months after surgery. Intra-group analysis will be performed by one way analysis of variance for repeated measures. Inter-group analysis will be performed by unpaired t-test for each of evaluation periods.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Both gender patients presenting Miller class I or II recession defects &gt;4mm were selected. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups: newly forming bone graft (NFBG) or subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCT). Patients were treated in the period of February 2008 and March 2008 and monitored during 9 months.</detailed_description>
