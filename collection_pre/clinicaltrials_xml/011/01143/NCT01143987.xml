	<brief_summary>Active parathyroid glands among renal dialysis patients contribute to calcified and hardened blood vessels. Such damage to the blood vessels, in turn, takes a significant toll in terms of cardiovascular disease. Calcimimetics has been suggested to lower the risk of vascular calcification. Role of cinacalcet was demonstrated in animal model but human data are lacking. The investigators designed an open label pilot study to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet in 20 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome is the aortic pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cincalcet and Vascular Arterial Stiffness Among Peritoneal Dialysis Patients With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mineral metabolism disturbance and hyperparathyroidism contribute to arterial stiffness and vascular calcification. The vascular damage, in turn, contributes to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of end-stage renal disease patients. Calcimimetics has been suggested to lower the risk of vascular calcification. Role of cinacalcet was demonstrated in animal model but human data are lacking. We design an open label pilot study to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet in 20 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome is the aortic pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment.</detailed_description>
