	<brief_title>Vax Facts Human Papillomavirus (HPV): Study of a Computer-based Tailoring System and Mothers' Intentions to Vaccinate Their Daughters Against HPV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized controlled intervention trial for HPV vaccine-hesitant mothers of adolescent (ages 11-15 years old) girls. Mothers will complete a three-item measure that assesses their baseline intentions for having their adolescent daughter vaccinated against HPV. Mothers will then fill out a short, computer-based survey that assesses demographic factors, prior experience with HPV-associated illnesses and views about a variety of potential barriers to HPV vaccination. Following the survey, the intervention group (40 mothers) will receive a two-page print brochure that uses their survey data to generate the brochure such that it addresses each mother's top three concerns about the HPV vaccine. The control group (40 mothers) will receive a generic, two-page brochure that is similar in appearance to the intervention, but contains only untailored, generic information about the vaccine. HPV vaccination intention will be assessed a second time after reading the brochure, using the same three-item measure as before the survey. The vaccine administration records of the adolescent daughters of these mothers will be accessed three months after mothers' participation in the study to assess whether any HPV vaccine doses were provided.</detailed_description>
