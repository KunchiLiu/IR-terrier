	<brief_summary>With the aim to restrict inappropriate fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions to critically ill patients, a randomized clinical trial will be conducted in a subgroup of intensive care (ICU) patients undergoing an invasive procedure. The objective is to assess the effectiveness and costs of omitting prophylactic FFP transfusion compared to current practice of prophylactic transfusion, in non-bleeding ICU patients with a coagulopathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transfusion of Fresh Frozen Plasma in Non-bleeding Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is an effective therapy to correct for a deficiency of multiple coagulation factors during bleeding. In past years, use of FFP has increased, in particular in patients on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and has expanded to include prophylactic use in patients with a coagulopathy prior to undergoing an invasive procedure. Retrospective studies suggest that prophylactic use of FFP does not prevent bleeding, but carries the risk of transfusion-related morbidity. However, up to 50% of FFP is administered to non-bleeding ICU patients. Objective: With the aim to restrict inappropriate FFP transfusions to critically ill patients, a randomized clinical trial will be conducted in a subgroup of ICU patients with a coagulopathy undergoing an invasive procedure. The objective is to assess the effectiveness and costs of prophylactic FFP transfusion (current practice) compared to no prophylactic transfusion, in non-bleeding ICU patients with a coagulopathy, prior to undergoing an invasive procedure (e.g. placement of central venous catheter, tracheostomy, chest tube). Study design: Prospective, multicentre, randomized, open-label, blinded end point evaluation (PROBE) design.</detailed_description>
