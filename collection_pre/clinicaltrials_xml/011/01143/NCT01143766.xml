	<brief_summary>The standard approach to sedation in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) involves the use of benzodiazepines and opiates to achieve a moderate depth of sedation. There is data to suggest supplementing this regimen with gabapentin may lead to reduced pain, higher patient satisfaction and lower opiate requirements. The investigators are conducting a clinical trial to study this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
