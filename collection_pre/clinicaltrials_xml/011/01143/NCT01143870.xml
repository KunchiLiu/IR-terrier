	<brief_summary>The percent of glycosylated hemoglobin, also known as a hemoglobin A1C value, is the standard way that clinicians assess a patient's diabetes control. Numerous studies have shown that maintaining a hemoglobin A1C value less than 7% is associated with lower rates of diabetes-related complications. Clinicians use this value to determine whether a patient with diabetes requires changes in their disease management. The main problem with this practice is that many patients do not understand what this number means. The goal of this project is to examine ways to make feedback about glycemic control easier for patients to understand. The hope is that improved patient understanding will result in an improvement in diabetic control and thus a reduction in disease-associated complications. Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes and a hemoglobin A1C value greater than 8% within the preceding three months will be eligible for the study. Pregnant women will be excluded. Given the nature of the intervention we will also exclude patients with cognitive deficits. In this study, patients will be randomized to three groups. The first group with be told their HgbA1C value only, the second group will be told a letter grade interpretation of that value, and the third group will be shown a face. The face emotions will range from happy to sad reflecting the level of control. The main outcome will be trend in hemoglobin A1C values over time. Secondary outcomes will include patient understanding of disease state and the number of hemoglobin A1C values checked following the intervention.</brief_summary>
