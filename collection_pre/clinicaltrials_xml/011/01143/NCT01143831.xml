	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate factor levels of the pro coagulant factors II, VII, IX, X, and the anticoagulant factors protein C and S in healthy volunteers during the intake of elevated levels of vitamin K in order to investigate whether there is any evidence that high dose vitamin K intake increases plasma coagulation factor activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Factors II, VII, IX, X, and Proteins C and S, Following High-dose Vitamin K Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Recruit 8 male healthy individuals with no prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis (2 each from each of the following age ranges: 20-34, 35-49, 50-64, &gt;65). 2. Visit 1: Measure baseline activity levels of Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, and levels of D-Dimer, TAT complexes, protein C and S activities. Also measure thrombin generation potential. Collaboration with a research laboratory will be sought to also determine factor VIIa levels. 3. Visit 2: Measure activity of Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, levels of D-Dimer, TAT complexes, protein C and S activities and thrombin generation potential at the end of the 2 week period. 4. Have each individual consume 20 mg of Vitamin K2 orally per day for two weeks. 5. Visit 3: Measure Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, D-Dimer, TAT complexes, protein C and S activities and thrombin generation potential at the end of the 2 week period. 6. Total length of study is 4 weeks. 7. Analyze the data sets for changes in levels / activities due to Vitamin K supplementation.</detailed_description>
