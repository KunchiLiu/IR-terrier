	<brief_summary>This study examines the pharmacokinetic profile of Armstrong's proposed Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP, an HFA-MDI (E004), in healthy male and female adult volunteers. Safety of E004 will also be evaluated, under augmented dose conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, evaluator-blind, single dose, three-arm, crossover, PK study, to be conducted in ~18 healthy, male and female, adult volunteers. PK will be studied at two dose strengths (Arm T1 and Arm T2). A currently marketed, non-labeled, Epinephrine CFC-MDI will be used as a Reference Control (Arm C). - At the Screening Visit and the beginning of each Study Visit, each subject will be trained on the correct self-administration of MDI. The following three randomized treatments will be self-administered, at three Study Visits: - Treatment T1: Ten (10) inhalations of the low dose E004(125 mcg/inhalation), totaling 1.25 mg of epinephrine; - Treatment T2: Ten (10) inhalations of the high dose E004 (160 mcg/inhalation), totaling 1.60 mg of epinephrine; - Treatment C: Ten (10) inhalations of Epinephrine CFC-MDI (220 mcg/inhalation, totaling 2.2 mg of epinephrine base equivalent). - PK blood samples will be taken from a vein at scheduled time points. - Safety parameters and adverse drug events, if any, will be monitored and documented at each study visit. An End-of-Study (EOS) safety evaluation will be conducted.</detailed_description>
