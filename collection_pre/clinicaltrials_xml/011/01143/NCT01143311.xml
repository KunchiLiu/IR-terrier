	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to analyze the differential expression of the miR transcriptome in the distinctive stages of the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (C-SCC). In this aim the investigators plan to recruit a cohort of 20 patients suffering of C-SCC and to collect from each of them, biopsies corresponding to i) non UV-exposed areas ii) UV-exposed areas, iii) actinic keratosis and iv) tumoral regions. Total RNAs will be prepared from each biopsy and the miRNA profiles will be characterized using a dedicated miR array.</brief_summary>
