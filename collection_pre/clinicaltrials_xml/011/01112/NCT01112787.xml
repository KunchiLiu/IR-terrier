	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Irritation Potential of Tazarotene Foam on Skin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam to induce cutaneous irritation using a 21 day cumulative irritation assay in healthy adult volunteers. Approximately 40 healthy male and female volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65 years will be enrolled. All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam, vehicle foam, sodium lauryl sulfate 0.5% (positive control), and distilled water (negative control). Each set of patches will be applied to the same randomized sites once daily for 21 days; patches will be removed after 24 Â±1 hours and the patch sites will be evaluated for signs inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema, edema, papules) and superficial effects.</detailed_description>

Participation in any patch test study within 4 weeks of the Day 1 visit. Inability to evaluate the skin in and around the potential patch test sites on the back due to sunburns, unevenness in skin tones, tattoos, scars, excessive hair, freckles, birthmarks, moles, or other skin damage or abnormality. Clinically significant skin diseases that may contraindicate participation or interfere with patch test site evaluations, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin cancer. Any major illness within 4 weeks of the Day 1 visit. Considered immunocompromised. A clinically relevant history of or current evidence of abuse of alcohol or other drugs.
