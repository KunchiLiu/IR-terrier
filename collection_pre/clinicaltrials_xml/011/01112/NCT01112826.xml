	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with triple negative breast cancer randomised to treatment with standard adjuvant chemotherapy alone or to standard adjuvant chemotherapy followed by 1 year of Capecitabine (Xeloda) metronomic therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Capecitabine Metronomic Chemotherapy to Triple-negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease without tumor-specific treatment options. Patients with triple-negative disease had an increased likelihood of distant recurrence and death within 5 years of diagnosis. Median time to distant recurrence was significantly shorter.This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of Capecitabine (Xeloda) to standard adjuvant therapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard chemotherapy (according to NCCN guideline), or standard chemotherapy followed by 1 year of metronomic Capecitabine (650mg/m2, twice every day). The anticipated time on study treatment is 6-12 months, and the target sample size is 424 individuals.Disease-free Survival (DFS) will be primary end point.</detailed_description>
