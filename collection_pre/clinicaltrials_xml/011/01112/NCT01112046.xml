	<brief_title>Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Laparoscopic Resection for Early Colorectal Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal pathologies. The recent progress in endoscopic technologies and interest in colorectal cancer screening have enabled the diagnosis of a larger number of early colorectal neoplasms, including benign polyps and early cancers. Colonoscopic polypectomy remains the cornerstone of therapy for the majority of colorectal polyps and helps prevent colorectal cancer. However, if colorectal neoplasms are too large or cannot be removed "en bloc" endoscopically, operative procedures are required to reduce risks of incomplete removal and local recurrence. Laparoscopic resection represents a minimally invasive alternative for treating colorectal neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc endoscopic resection. However, laparoscopic surgery has to be done under general anesthesia, is associated with operative morbidity, and is expensive. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a revolutionary endoscopic procedure that enables en bloc resection of large gastrointestinal tumors, irrespective of the size of the lesion. ESD, which was pioneered in Japan for the treatment of early gastric neoplasms, has now been successfully applied to the colon and rectum. ESD has been shown by recent studies to be a safe and effective resection technique for large early colorectal neoplasms. However, no report can be found in the literature comparing ESD and laparoscopic resection for early colorectal neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc endoscopic resection with conventional techniques. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether ESD is less invasive than laparoscopic surgery in terms of systemic inflammatory and cytokine responses, and all these may have implications for cancer recurrence. We propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to compare the short-term clinical outcomes and systemic inflammatory/cytokine responses of ESD versus laparoscopic resection for early colorectal neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc endoscopic resection with conventional techniques. The overall costs of the two therapeutic approaches will also be compared. Findings of this proposed project may provide evidence-based clarification of the efficacy and safety of ESD in treating early colorectal neoplasms. We hypothesize that ESD is associated with lower morbidity, earlier recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower costs when compared with laparoscopic resection. A faster recovery and earlier discharge after ESD may reduce financial burden to the hospital and health care system. The results of this proposed project may have a significant impact on the future treatment strategy for early colorectal neoplasms, and may provide new insights into the systemic inflammatory responses of ESD.</detailed_description>
