	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the novel treatment of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could decrease the pain perception of those with spinal cord injury. We will also determine whether these changes are correlated with the clinical outcome (pain reduction).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The active tDCS stimulation sessions will be compared to sham stimulation. More study details will be provided by Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.</detailed_description>
