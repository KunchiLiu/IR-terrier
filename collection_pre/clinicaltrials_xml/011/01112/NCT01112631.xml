	<brief_summary>The patients from 12 centers were included into the study. pN2 patients received PORT, pN1 patients did not. PORT was 3D-planned and consisted in 54-56 Gy in 27-28 fractions. One month after surgery, all patients completed EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaires and had pulmonary function tests (PFT); cardiopulmonary symptoms were assessed by modified LENT-SOM score. Two years after, all patients free of disease repeated the same examinations. Changes in QLQ, LENT-SOM score and the results of PFT were compared for patients receiving and not PORT.</brief_summary>
