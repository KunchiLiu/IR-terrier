	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the typical behavior of children ages 15 months to five years around a microwave oven. The UCH Burn and Complex Wound Center has observed scald burn injuries in young children operating and/or removing hot liquids from microwave ovens. The knowledge we hope to gain is the developmental age that a child is able to open and/or operate a microwave oven safely. This work may influence future microwave oven design to protect young children from microwave-related scald burn injuries. These injuries have resulted in visits to the emergency room, stays in the hospital and debridement and skin grafting procedures in the operating room.</brief_summary>
