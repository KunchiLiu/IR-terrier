	<brief_summary>Previous studies showed that combination of endoscopic therapy with vasoconstrictor is better than either vasoconstrictor or endoscopic therapy alone in achieving the successful hemostatsis of acute variceal bleeding. The rationale of using vasoconstrictor is to enhance the efficacy of hemostasis by endoscopic therapy. Nowadays, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as the endoscopic treatment of choice in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. EVL alone can achieve hemotasis up to 97% even in cases of active variceal hemorrhage. However, early rebleeding due to ligation-induced ulcer may be encountered. It appears that prevention of esophageal ulcers and bleeding by a proton pump inhibitor may be more logical than using a vasoconstrictor after cessation of bleeding by EVL.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous studies showed that combination of endoscopic therapy with vasoconstrictor is better than either vasoconstrictor or endoscopic therapy alone in achieving the successful hemostatsis of acute variceal bleeding. The rationale of using vasoconstrictor is to enhance the efficacy of hemostasis by endoscopic therapy. Nowadays, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as the endoscopic treatment of choice in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. EVL alone can achieve hemotasis up to 97% even in cases of active variceal hemorrhage. However, early rebleeding due to ligation-induced ulcer may be encountered. It appears that prevention of esophageal ulcers and bleeding by a proton pump inhibitor may be more logical than using a vasoconstrictor after cessation of bleeding by EVL. Thus, we designed a controlled trial to compare the initial hemostasis, early rebleeding rate in cirrhotic patients presenting with acute variceal bleeding receiving either emergency EVL plus somatostatin infusion or losec infusion for 5 days. AIMS: To investigate whether the combination of EVL and somatostatin is superior to the combination of EVL and losec in terms of efficacy in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal bleeding and very early rebleeding.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The etiology of portal hypertension is cirrhosis. Age ranges between 1880 y/o. Patients presenting with acute esophageal variceal bleeding proven by emergency endoscopy within 12 hours. (Acute esophageal variceal bleeding was defined as: (1) when blood was directly seen by endoscopy to issue from an esophageal varix (active bleeding), or (2) when patients presented with red color signs on their esophageal varices with blood in esophagus or stomach and no other potential site of bleeding identified (inactive bleeding). EVL is performed after confirmation of acute esophageal variceal bleeding. Enrollment time: Immediately after EVL is completed and variceal bleeding is arrested. Association with severe systemic illness, such as sepsis, COPD, uremia Association with gastric variceal bleeding Failure in the control of bleeding by emergency EVL Moribund patients, died within 12 hours of enrollment Uncooperative Ever received EIS, EVL within one month prior to index bleeding ChildPugh's scores &gt; 13</criteria>
