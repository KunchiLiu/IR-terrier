	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of periarticular multi-drug regimen injection on the relief of pain in patients undergoing partial hip replacement. Total 258 patients will be randomized into one of two groups (groupC or groupI) based on Excel number generation. Patients in group C will receive no medication intraoperatively, and patients in group I will receive oral oxycodone and celecoxib preoperatively and a periarticular injection of multi-drug regimen during operation. Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption and the frequency at which patients pushed the button (FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system will be recorded at 1, 4, 7 postoperative day.</brief_summary>
