	<brief_title>An Observational Study for the Assessment of Compliance and Persistence to Rebif® Therapy of Patients With Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Evaluation of Potential Factors Influencing These Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the relapsing-remitting type of the disease the objective of the therapy is the reduction of relapse rate, duration and severity, as well as the delay of transition to the progressive form of the disease. Subjects' adherence to long-term therapy of MS plays a pivotal role in the optimization of therapeutic outcome and maximization of the derived clinical benefit for the treated subjects. Rebif current formulation has been developed by assessing and refining the physicochemical characteristics of existing formulations aiming at further improving product's tolerability profile. Studies performed for the assessment of Rebif have demonstrated a 3-fold reduction in injection site reactions as well as improved overall tolerability and safety profile. This is a multicentre, prospective, non interventional, non randomized, open label study for the assessment of the adherence to therapy with Rebif of subjects with RRMS. The participating subjects shall be already on treatment with (Rebif) prior to their enrolment into the study, according to the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the clinical, imaging and laboratory findings of the disease, as evaluated by their treating physician, in real life clinical practice. Data will be collected retrospectively from a sample of 150 subjects' medical files and through questions that will be posed to the subjects, and prospectively during the course of the study. The total duration of the study is estimated to be 18 months. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: - To assess the compliance and persistence with Rebif therapy in MS subjects, after six months of therapy, in "real life" clinical settings in Greece Secondary objective: - To investigate the potential factors influencing compliance and persistence to Rebif therapy.</detailed_description>
