	<brief_summary>Azathioprine is still considered the treatment of choice for the non-renal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with an estimated efficacy of 45%.Recently, several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil/enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium in those cases, but so far, no controlled, randomized comparative study between the two drugs has been conducted. The aim is to perform a randomized, controlled, phase III/IV study comparing enteric-coated mycophenolate (ECMs) with azathioprine for induction and maintenance therapy of the non-renal manifestations of SLE. Methods: Patients with non-renal SLE flares (SLEDAI≥6 and/or BILAG o 2B refractory to full doses of hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone (≥10 mg/d) or with relapsing flares will be included. Patients will be stratified according the flare severity (moderate (SLEDAI&lt;12)-severe (SLEDAI≥12)) and randomized (1:1) into two groups of treatment, EMCs (2gr/d) or AZA (2-2.5mg/kg/d) according to TMPT levels for 6 months. Dose will be progressively tapered based on clinical response up to completing a year of treatment. The main aim is the percentage of complete remission achieved ((SLEDAI &lt;4 and/or absence of any BILAG A o B) at week 12 and 24 for moderate and severe flares, respectively. Secondary objectives include evaluating the reduction in the steroid requirement, number of flares post-treatment, effect on the biological parameters, and impact on quality of life, damage and drug safety. To detect a 20% difference between the two drugs with a 80% statistical power (0.05 alpha error), considering a follow up loss of 20%, a total of 240 patients is required.</brief_summary>
