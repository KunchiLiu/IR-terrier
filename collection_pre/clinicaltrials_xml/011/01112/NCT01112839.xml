	<brief_summary>The purpose of the ENERGY trial is to explore whether two different programs that are focused on weight management, through increased exercise and a healthy diet, are feasible, and have an impact on body weight, quality of life and fatigue. Since obesity among breast cancer survivors is associated with recurrence and other co-morbidities, those will be assessed and their impact calculated. Blood samples will be collected to enable analysis of potential mechanisms and differential response across subgroups.</brief_summary>
