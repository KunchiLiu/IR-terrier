	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective study is to compare pain levels and pain medication dose requirements in patients with topical negative pressure (TNP) dressings removed in a standard manner (i.v. or p.o. pain meds) compared to dressings removed with lidocaine analgesia, via injection retrograde up the suction tube into the foam prior to removal. Our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in overall pain scores or medication requirements when patients receive a saline, control injection and pain medications, compared to when their dressings are changed with a lidocaine injection into the sponge, with pain medications. Our objective is to disprove this null hypothesis with statistical significance.</brief_summary>
