	<brief_summary>Fibrin sealant has been studied to reduce post-thyroidectomy drain and hospital stay as well. However, no strong evidence from well-designed clinical trials is available. Harmonic scalpel is a ultrasonic vibrating scissors which makes it easy to cut and coagulate the tissues, thus reducing op time and postoperative drain, which is important to minimize hospital stay. The investigators hypothesized that fibrin sealant combined with harmonic scalpel-assisted procedure could guarantee no-drain postoperative care in total thyroidectomy with anterior compartment neck dissection.</brief_summary>
