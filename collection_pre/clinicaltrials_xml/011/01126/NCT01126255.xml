	<brief_title>Progesterone vs Clobetasol Propionate in Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background A total of 62 female patients with first diagnosis of lichen sclerosus will be treated daily with either topical progesterone 8% or clobetasol propionate 0.05% for 12 weeks. Response to the treatment will be evaluated by macroscopic description of the dermatologic phenotype by using a specific lichen sclerosus score and photography-documentation. The symptoms and quality of life of the patients will be evaluated by standardized questionnaires. Additionally, tissue samples will be taken before and again after 12 weeks of treatment to evaluate the response status. Objective The purpose of this study is to compare progesterone with conventional clobetasol propionate in a superiority trial. Methods Prospective, randomized, controlled, superiority phase II pilot trial. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either progesterone or clobetasol propionate, with patients, physicians, assessors and analysts being blinded.</detailed_description>
