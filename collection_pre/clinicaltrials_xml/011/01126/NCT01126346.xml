	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: An orientation and patient education program and telephone counseling may help improve the quality of life in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies quality of life and survivorship care in patients undergoing surgery and chemotherapy for peritoneal surface malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Survivorship Care in Patients Undergoing Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess feasibility of instituting an orientation program, brief follow up care and phone calls in this patient population. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Reduce pre-treatment distress and anxiety. II. Improve pre-treatment self-efficacy. III. Provide educational material delivered by the SRB. IV. Improve overall post-operative QOL ratings at 3 months, relative to discharge. OUTLINE: Patients and their caregiver(s) receive a hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) orientation with a Survivorship Navigator (SN) over 90 minutes following their initial surgical consult. Patients then receive telephone calls over 20-30 minutes from the SN once weekly for 3 weeks prior to HIPEC. . After HIPEC, patients meet with the SN for 20-30 minutes to discuss adjustments and adaptation to the surgery and hospitalization 3-4 days post-HIPEC, biweekly for two weeks, and weekly thereafter until hospital discharge. After hospital discharge, patients receive telephone calls from the SN twice monthly for 1 month.</detailed_description>
