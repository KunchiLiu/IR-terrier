	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended 188Re-SSS Lipiodol activity for hepatic intra-arterial injection in patients with hepato-cellular carcinoma. The new radioactive isotope 188Rhenium associated with Lipiodol is expected to reduce the radioprotection constraints and hence the duration of the hospitalisation in a protected room from 8 to 1 day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>188RE-SSS Lipiodol to Treat HepatoCellular Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most prevalent primary cancers in many countries. In France, mortality due to HCC on viral C cirrhosis is going to increase of about 150% for men and 200% for women until 2020. Consequently, HCC is a problem of public health. The current treatment for HCC is mainly palliative with chemoembolization or intra-arterial radiotherapy, and intra-arterial targeted radiotherapy being the best tolerated method (iodine-131-labelled lipiodol being the most commonly used). However, since 2007, a new therapeutic approach can be considered with oral sorafenib, an anti-angiogenic drug which increases slightly the survival of patients. The key for an efficient treatment of HCC is presumably a co-treatment of sorafenib and intra-arterial radiotherapy. The 131I-lipiodol is a good candidate but presents disadvantages: it requires hospitalization in a radionuclide therapy room for one week. Therefore, it is necessary to find new radioactive labellings for lipiodol. In this objective, 188Re-SSS lipiodol, a new radioactive labeled stable complex has been developed. It has a short half-life and a tiny amount of gamma radiation compared to 131I-lipiodol, so it allows to reduce hospitalization in a protected room from 8 days to only one day. The aim of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and thus the recommended activity of 188Re-SSS lipiodol by intra-arterial injection in patients with HCC.</detailed_description>
