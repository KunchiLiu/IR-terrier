	<brief_title>Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) With Weekly Docetaxel and Cisplatin for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies have shown the superiority of concurrent chemoradiotherapy over radiotherapy only in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with high dose cisplatin has been universally used regimen. In a large-scaled phase II trial, however, conducted by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), docetaxel (100mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75mg/ m2) every three weeks regimen produced improved survival, nonetheless there was significant limitation to deliver full doses of treatment due to significant hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Previously, we showed the safety of the combination regimen of weekly docetaxel and cisplatin in concurrent chemoradiation treatment in a phase I study. We determined the MTD of docetaxel to be 20mg/m2 weekly when concurrently administered with conventional fractionation RT and weekly 20mg/m2 of cisplatin.</detailed_description>
