	<brief_title>Reduced Radiotherapy With Pac/Cis vs Standard Radiotherapy With 5-FU/Cis in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment for patients with advanced, unresectable head and neck cancer is a platin-based simultaneous radiochemotherapy (RCT) (Pignon JP et al., Lancet 2000;355:949-955). However, irradiation dose is still debatable regarding local tumor control and late toxicity. Moreover, it is still unclear which combination of different drugs might be more effective. In recent years, new drugs have been introduced in the field of head and neck cancer. The Taxanes, namely Docetaxel and Paclitaxel, have been investigated in several phase I/II-studies, and showed promising results concerning locoregional control rates and survival data. The RTOG 97-03 trial (Garden et al., J Clin Oncol 2004; 22:2856-64) compared a RCT either with Cisplatin/5-FU or Cisplatin/Paclitaxel. In this phase II-study an improvement of local tumor control and disease free survival of 15-20% in favour of the Cisplatin/Paclitaxel treatment arm was seen. Therefore, our phase III-trial compares a standard RCT (70.6 Gy) with Cisplatin/5-FU to a RCT with Cisplatin/Paclitaxel and reduced irradiation dose (63.6 Gy). Primary endpoint is to proof superiority of the experimental Cisplatin/Paclitaxel treatment arm concerning disease-free-survival. Secondary endpoints are locoregional tumor control, overall survival and quality of life.</detailed_description>
