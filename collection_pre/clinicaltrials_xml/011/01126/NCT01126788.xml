	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test two hypotheses: 1. The PADnet+ testing system produces clinically equivalent results as the Parks Flo-Lab testing system in a group of patients referred for evaluation of PAD of the limbs when performed by a Registered Vascular Technologist (RVT). 2. The PADnet+ testing system produces clinically equivalent results when the testing is repeated on the above patients and performed by staff specifically trained on the use of the PADnet+ system but are not vascular technologists nor hold the RVT certification.</brief_summary>
