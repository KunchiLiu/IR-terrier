	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is determine the effects of Tai Chi exercise, as compared to an education-based control intervention, on cardiovascular and balance system function in older people at risk of developing frailty. We hypothesize that long-term Tai Chi training will improve specific nonlinear properties associated of cardiovascular and balance dynamics in this population.</brief_summary>
