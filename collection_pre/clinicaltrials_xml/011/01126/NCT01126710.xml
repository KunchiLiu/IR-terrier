	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of an optical device designed and developed for monitoring the intravenous infusion site for infiltration. The hypothesis is that the changes in optical signals measured near the infusion site using the optical device can be used to monitor intravenous infusion for infiltration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will have peripheral IV catheter with active infusions that are anticipated to be in place and functioning for 4872 hours. The IVs and accompanying infusions are solely a part of the subject's medical care and are not started or terminated for the purposes of this Study. The rationale for choosing this time frame is that the rate of infiltration is likely to be increased the longer the IV infusion is taking place. Subjects are admitted to one of the institution's intensive care or intermediate care units, including Adult Emergency Department, Pediatric Emergency Department, Adult Medical Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Neonatal Intensive Care Unity, SurgicalTrauma Intensive Care Unit, Cardiothoracic Surgery Intensive Care Unit, Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit, Burn Intensive Care Unit, Transplant Intensive Care Unit, Coronary Care Intensive Care Unit, PostAnesthesia Recovery Unit, Pediatric Intermediate Care Unity, Surgical Intermediate Care Unit, and Medical Intermediate Care Unit.
