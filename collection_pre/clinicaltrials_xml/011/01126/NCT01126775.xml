	<brief_summary>"Silent" strokes are more frequent than clinical apparent strokes and can be detected noninvasively by MRI-investigations of the brain. Persons with silent strokes have a considerably increased risk for clinical apparent strokes as well as for the development of dementia. Intention of the study is the detection of silent strokes and microbleedings by standardized cranial MRI in 1000 participants (500 high-risk and 500 low-risk persons for cerebrovascular accidents) after a standardized neurological and neuropsychological examination. Results will be the base of early detection and early preventive strategies of cerebrovascular accidents in high-risk persons. In the course of a systematic follow-up examination without MRI the same 1000 patients (500 high-risk and 500 low-risk persons for cerebrovascular accidents) will be reinvited to the sites. In addition to the standardized neurological and neuropsychological examinations a surrogate parameter of nephropathy, microalbumin, will be examined as this parameter could be helpful in forecasting cerebral microangiopathy. The clinical investigation will be expanded by several tests in order to assess symptoms of cerebral microangiopathy.</brief_summary>
