	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) either in monotherapy or in combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with an inadequate response to treatment with MTX. Furthermore, in patients who have been able to achieve control of disease activity via the above therapy, we investigate the possibility of stopping TCZ and verify safety when TCZ is restarted after disease recurrence.</brief_summary>
