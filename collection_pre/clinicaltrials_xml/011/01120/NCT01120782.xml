	<mesh_term>Astigmatism</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. The subject must be between 18 and 40 years old. 2. The subject must have normal eyes. 3. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical protocol. 4. The subject must read and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and be provided a copy of the form. 5. The subject must have a subjective distance spectacle prescription in the range of 1.75 to 5.00 DS in each eye. 6. The subject must manifest 1.25 to 2.00 D of refractive astigmatism in each eye. 7. The subject's refractive cylinder axis must be 180 +/ 30 in each eye. 8. The subject must be an adapted wearer of soft toric contact lenses in both eyes. 9. The subject's best visual acuity (BVA) must be better than or equal to 20/25 in each eye. 10. Subjects must already possess a wearable pair of spectacles. 1. Ocular or systemic allergies or disease that may interfere with contact lens wear. 2. Systemic disease or autoimmune disease or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear. 3. Clinically significant corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining or any other abnormality of the cornea, which may contraindicate contact lens wear. 4. Clinically significant tarsal abnormalities that might interfere with contact lens wear. 5. Any ocular infection. 6. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. 7. Pregnancy or lactation 8. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV). 9. Diabetes 10. Strabismus</criteria>
