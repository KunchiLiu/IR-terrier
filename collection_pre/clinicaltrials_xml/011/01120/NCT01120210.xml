	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (how the study medication affects the body) and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the body and removed from the body over time) of an intravenous administration of JNJ-39588146 or placebo over a 3-hour period in patients with heart failure. The highest tolerated dose received during the first 3 hours of the study will be administered to some patients for an additional 18 hours. There will be up to 3 doses given throughout the administration period over a total of up to 21 hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of an Intravenous Solution of JNJ-39588146 or Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of JNJ-39588146 or placebo (which looks like the drug being studied but has no active ingredients) in patients with heart failure. This study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor patient knows the identity of the assigned drug) study of 3 intravenous doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered in 1-hr intervals (for a total of 3 hours) in 60 patients with heart failure. Part 2 is an extended infusion of JNJ-39588146 and placebo that will administer the highest tolerated dose from Part 1 for an additional 18 hours. The entire duration of the infusion could be as long as 21 hours. There is a 1 in 4 chance of getting placebo. The participation period is a maximum of 42 days, including a screening visit, a 2-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, patients will have a cardiac catheter in place to monitor heart function. Safety evaluations, which will include ECG (electrocardiograph, measuring the electrical currents in the heart), vital signs and monitoring of side-effects will be performed. Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected for evaluation. Part 1: Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) solution of three different doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered over 1 hour periods for a total of 3 hours. Part 2: Patients participating in the sub study will continue receiving an IV solution for 18 more hours for a total of up to 21 hours of administration.</detailed_description>
