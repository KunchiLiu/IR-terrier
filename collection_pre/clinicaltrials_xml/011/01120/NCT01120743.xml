	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this project is to identify the source of cytokines that are released into circulation during graft reperfusion. Seventeen patients scheduled to have adult cadaveric liver transplantation at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center were contacted as prospective participants. Blood samples were obtained from the radial artery, the portal vein, and from the graft irrigation. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was verified and compared with the amount of catecholamines used to maintain hemodynamic stability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Release of Cytokines From Liver Graft and Hemodynamic Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reperfusion of the graft is the most critical part of liver transplantation because of the difficulties in managing the resulting severe hemodynamic instability. The patients who are accepted to be listed for liver transplantation undergo evaluation of their cardiac function and are usually relatively stable with, at most, minimal cardiac problems (a requirement for inclusion in the liver transplantation program). Additionally, we observe completely unpredictable hemodynamic reactions during and after the graft reperfusion, requiring vastly different doses of catecholamine in order to maintain an acceptable level of perfusion pressure. The adverse cardiopulmonary effects are thought to be associated with the preexisting level of various proinflammatory factors, including cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and proinflammatory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) produced in the graft as a reaction to the conservation solution and cold temperature (necessary to keep the organ capable for transplantation) and released into the bloodstream during reperfusion. The massive release of cytokines after unclamping of the graft may be responsible for negative inotropy and significant vasodilatation.</detailed_description>
