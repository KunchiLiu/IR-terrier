	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis (LC) is the final outcome for chronic liver diseases. The liver transplantation is the sole effective therapy available to these patients. However, limited number of donors, post surgical complications, immunological rejection, and financial consideration are it`s crucial problems. The plasticity of stem cells in bone marrow (BM) to differentiate into Hepatocyte cells was recently confirmed, and several clinical studies have applied BMC injection to induce regeneration of myocardium and blood vessels. In this study, the investigators will study safety and feasibility of twice transplantation of Autologous bone derived marrow mono nuclear (BM-MNC) and enriched CD133+ hematopoietic stem cell through the portal vein in patients with decompensate cirrhosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BM Aspiration will be done twice (3months interval) from the iliac crest according to standard procedures under general anesthesia and is collected (200ML) in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. After precipitation of red blood cells, mononuclear cells will be collected by centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque density gradient. For separation of CD133+ cells the CliniMACS instrument will be used. Cells are injected twice (3months interval) via portal vein under sonography monitoring. After cell therapy, patients are followed up every week for 6 months, and laboratory data are analyzed for 6 months</detailed_description>
