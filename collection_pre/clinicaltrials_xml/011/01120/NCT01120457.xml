	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-936564 (MDX-1338) in relapsed Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other selected B-cell cancers and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the drug alone in relapsed/refractory AML</brief_summary>

Common to All Indications: Life expectancy at least 12 weeks ECOG Performance Status of 02 B. For Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) Subjects: First Relapse and primary induction failure in AML (M3 excluded) Secondary AML subjects from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or prior chemotherapy are eligible. MDSonly subjects are not eligible C. For Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse Large BCell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Subjects: Must be at least 4 weeks (for FL) or 2 weeks (for DLBCL) since prior cytotoxic, biologic, monoclonal antibody, or investigational therapy Ability to undergo tumor biopsy pretreatment and at end of monotherapy period (though not mandatory for all subjects) Subjects must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory disease D. For Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Subjects: Subjects must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory disease Must be at least 4 weeks since prior cytotoxic, biologic, monoclonal antibody, or investigational therapy, including corticosteroids A. Common to All indications: Prior antiCXCR4 therapy including BMS936564 (MDX1338) Less than 3 months from prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant Presence of active graft versus host disease B. For AML Subjects: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; institutional limits of normal C. For FL, DLBCL Subjects: (For DLBCL): Inadequate renal function defined as creatinine clearance (by CockcroftGault formula) &lt; 60 mL/min Major surgery, not related to debulking procedures, within 21 days of first dose Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening or Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) D. For CLL Subjects: No progression to more aggressive Bcell cancers, such as Richter's syndrome Major surgery within 21 days of Cycle 1, Day 1. Patients undergoing debulking procedures and minor surgery are allowed after a recovery period, in the judgment of the Investigator Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia</criteria>
