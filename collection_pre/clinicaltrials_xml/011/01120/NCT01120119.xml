	<brief_summary>Reduction in vitamin D levels has been reported in subjects with recent onset type 1 diabetes. Several studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation in early childhood decreases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, therefore vitamin D deficiency might play a role in the disease pathogenesis. We investigated whether the supplementation of the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) in subjects with recent-onset type 1 diabetes can protect residual beta cell function evaluated by C peptide and improve glycaemic control as evaluated by HbA1c and insulin requirement. Thirty-four subjects (age range 11-35 years, median 18 years) with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (&lt;12 weeks duration) and high basal C-peptide &gt;0.25 nmol/l were randomized in a double-blind trial to calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D, 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] ) at the dose of 0.25 ug/day or placebo, and followed up for 2 years.</brief_summary>
