	<brief_summary>Calcium sensitizer drugs such as Levosimendan may exert anti-ischemic effect in addition to positive inotropic and anti-stunning effects mediated by the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. The aim of the study is to test the myocardial protection effect of peri-operative iv infusion of Levosimendan in a cohort of neonates affected by transposition of the great arteries undergoing surgical correction by arterial switch.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levosimendan Administration in Neonates With Transposition of the Great Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Function of the myocardium of neonates with congenital heart disease may be affected by several factors in post operative phase: congenital insufficiency, cardiopulmonary bypass low perfusion, ischemima during the cross-clamp phase, low cardiac output syndrome, systemic inflammation. Furthermore, neonates have immature molecular mechanisms leading to calcium utilization inside myocytes. Calcium sensitizer drugs such as Levosimendan may exert anti-ischemic effect in addition to positive inotropic and anti-stunning effects mediated by the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. The aim of the study is to test the inodilator and myocardial protection effect of peri-operative iv infusion of 0.1 mcg/kg/min Levosimendan (without previuos bolus) in a cohort of neonates affected by transposition of the great arteries undergoing surgical correction by arterial switch.</detailed_description>
