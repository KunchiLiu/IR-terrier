	<brief_summary>The 3C study will investigate whether reducing exposure to calcineurin inhibitors (by using more potent antibody induction treatment and/or an elective switch to sirolimus) can improve the function and survival of kidney transplants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Campath, Calcineurin Inhibitor Reduction and Chronic Allograft Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved over the past decade despite reductions in the rate of acute rejection. The commonest cause of late graft loss is chronic allograft nephropathy which is frequently caused by calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. Therefore, it may be possible to improve long-term graft outcomes by reducing the amount of calcineurin inhibitor exposure. Two possible strategies to do this will be tested. Firstly, Campath-1H (a monoclonal lymphocyte-depleting antibody) will be compared to standard basiliximab-based induction. All patients will then receive tacrolimus-based maintenance therapy for 6 months (using lower doses in the Campath-1H arm). At six months, patients will be re-randomised between remaining on tacrolimus and converting to sirolimus (and therefore no longer take calcineurin inhibitors). Patients will then be followed-up in clinic and through routine NHS registries to collect information on relevant outcomes (including graft function, survival, hospitalisations and death).</detailed_description>
