	<brief_summary>The current research program aims to study how sleep disordered breathing, age and genetics affect memory in older adult veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The study will help researchers and clinicians better understand the relationship among PTSD, sleep disordered breathing, genetics and memory function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Sleep Disordered Breathing And Genetics: Effects On Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research project will clarify how sleep disordered breathing and Apolipoprotein (APOE) status affect cognitive decline in a population already at risk for accelerated decline-veterans with PTSD. To fill this knowledge gap properly, we will conduct a longitudinal study and data include analytic techniques designed specifically to identify moderators and mediators of clinical change.</detailed_description>
