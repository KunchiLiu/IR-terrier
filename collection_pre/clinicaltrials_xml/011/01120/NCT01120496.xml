	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is planned to investigate whether frequently inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) can relieve symptoms and signs faster than normal saline (NS) and shorten length of stay (LOS) significantly for moderately to severely ill infants with bronchiolitis without apparent adverse effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nebulized Hypertonic Saline Treatment in Hospitalized Children With Moderate to Severe Viral Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of bronchiolitis remains largely supportive with mechanical ventilatory support as needed .Other types of treatment remain controversial.We and other researchers have demonstrated that nebulized HS and bronchodilators decreased symptoms and LOS for infants with mild to moderate viral bronchiolitis .All the aforementioned studies used 3 times per day dosing, which is significantly less than the 3 to 6 times per hour regimens often used in children in respiratory distress.Frequently nebulized HS reduced the LOS for infants with moderately severe bronchiolitis.The present study is planned to investigate whether frequently inhaled HS can relieve symptoms and signs faster than NS and shorten LOS significantly for moderately to severely ill infants with bronchiolitis without apparent adverse effects.
