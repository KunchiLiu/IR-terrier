	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is a common phenomenon in cancer patients. Deteriorated nutritional status is associated with poor clinical outcome. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of hospital malnutrition and its impact on functionality, quality of life and mortality in cancer patients and to test the reference percentiles of phase angle values (Bosy Westphal et al JPEN 2006) as indicator of cancer cachexia and predictor of mortality. Hypothesis: The fifth reference percentile of the phase angle norm values is a prognostically relevant cut off value indicating cancer cachexia in terms of malnutrition, fatigue and impaired functional status, as well as predictive of 6-month mortality</brief_summary>
