	<brief_summary>Hypertension (HTN) affects up to 75% of kidney transplant recipients and is associated with premature death. Nocturnal HTN is a common complication of ongoing essential HTN or a secondary cause of HTN. Both the non dipping of systolic blood pressure (SBP) at night time and the reverse dipping is associated with increased target organ damage and adverse cardiovascular outcomes and possibly allograft survival. Treatment of Nocturnal HTN is critical. Chronotherapy has been shown to be effective in halting progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease. There is not enough data on prevalence and management of nocturnal HTN in transplant patients, which is the object of this study.</brief_summary>
