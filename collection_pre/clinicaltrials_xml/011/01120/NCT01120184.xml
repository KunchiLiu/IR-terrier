	<brief_summary>This randomized, 3-arm, multicentre, phase III study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with pertuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with pertuzumab-placebo (blinded for pertuzumab), versus the combination of trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) in patients with HER2-positive progressive or recurrent locally advanced or previously untreated metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (Arms A, B or C). Arm A will be open-label, whereas Arms B and C will be blinded.</brief_summary>
