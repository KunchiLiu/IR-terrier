	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : 1. Male or female adults aged ≥40 years, who had signed an informed consent form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedure. 2. Patients with severe to very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD (Stage III or IV) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines 2008. 3. Current or exsmokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years (Ten packyears were defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years). 4. Patients with a postbronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second ( FEV1) &lt;50% of the predicted normal value, and postbronchodilator FEV1/ Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70 at Visit 2 (day 14). (Post refers to 1 h after sequential inhalation of 84 µg (or equivalent dose) of ipratropium bromide and 400 µg of salbutamol). 5. A documented history of at least 1 COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months that required treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or antibiotics. 1. Pregnant women or nursing mothers (pregnancy confirmed by positive urine pregnancy test). 2. Women of childbearing potential 3. Patients requiring long term oxygen therapy (&gt; 15 h a day) on a daily basis for chronic hypoxemia. 4. Patients who had a COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics, systemic steroids (oral or intravenous) or hospitalization in the 6 weeks prior to visit 1 or between visit 1 (Day 21) and Visit 3 (Day 1). 5. Patients who developed a COPD exacerbation during a period between visit 1 and 3 were ineligible but were permitted to be rescreened after a minimum of 6 weeks after the resolution of the COPD exacerbation. 6. Patients who had a respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to visit 1 (Day 21) • Patients who developed an upper or lower respiratory tract infection during the screening period (up to visit 3 (Day 1) were not eligible, but were permitted to be rescreened 4 weeks after the resolution of the respiratory tract infection 7. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease, e.g. pulmonary tuberculosis (unless confirmed by chest xray to be no longer active), clinically significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disorder or pulmonary hypertension. 8. Patients with lung lobectomy, or lung volume reduction or lung transplantation. 9. Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator, have a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition such as (but not limited to): Unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (excluding chronic stable Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Patients with such events not considered clinically significant by the investigator may be considered for inclusion in the study history of malignancy of any organ system (including lung cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin uncontrolled hypo or hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia or hyper adrenergic state narrowangle glaucoma Symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladderneck obstruction or moderate to severe renal impairment or urinary retention. (Patients with a Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) were excluded from the study. Patients who underwent full resection of the prostate could be considered for the study, as well as patients who were asymptomatic and stable on pharmacological treatment for the condition). any condition which might have compromised patient safety or compliance, interfered with evaluation, or precluded completion of the study 10. Patients with any history of asthma indicated by (but not limited to) a blood eosinophil count &gt; 600/mm3 (at visit 2), or onset of symptoms prior to 40 years. Patients without asthma were excluded if their eosinophil count was &gt;600/mm3 at visit 2. 11. Patients with allergic rhinitis who used H1 antagonists or intranasal corticosteroids intermittently (treatment with a constant dose was permitted). 12. Patients with eczema (atopic), known high immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels or a known positive skin prick test in the last 5 years. 13. Patients with known history and diagnosis of alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency. 14. Patients who were participating in the active phase of a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program. 15. Patients with Type I or uncontrolled Type II diabetes. 16. Patients contraindicated for treatment with, or having a history of reactions/ hypersensitivity to any of the following inhaled drugs or drugs of a similar class or any component thereof: anticholinergic agents long and short acting beta2 agonists sympathomimetic amines. 17. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose corrected QT interval (QTc) measured at visit 2 (Day 14) (Fridericia method) was prolonged (&gt;450 ms for males and females) as confirmed by the central ECG assessor. 18. Patients with a clinically significant abnormality on the screening or baseline ECG who in the judgment of the investigator would be at potential risk if enrolled into the study. (These patients could not be rescreened). 19. Patients who needed treatments for COPD and allied conditions after the start of the study (visit 1) 20. Patients who needed treatments for COPD and allied conditions (e.g. allergic rhinitis) unless they had been stabilized 21. Patients taking other prohibited medications 22. Patients unable to use a dry powder inhaler (e.g. single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI), HandiHaler® device, or pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (rescue medication). 23. Patients unable to use an electronic patient diary. 24. Patients who were, in the opinion of the investigator known to be unreliable or noncompliant. 25. Patients who used other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives of visit 1 (day 21), whichever was longer. 26. Patients who had live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to the screening visit or during the runin period. Inactivated influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination or any other inactivated vaccine was acceptable provided it was not administered within 48 hours prior to screening and randomization visits. No additional exclusions were applied by the investigator, in order to ensure that the study population was representative of all eligible patients.</criteria>
