	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pivotal study is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of transcranial laser therapy (TLT) with the NeuroTheraÂ® Laser System in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. The initiation of the TLT procedure must be feasible for each subject between 4.5 and 24 hours of stroke onset.</brief_summary>
