	<brief_summary>Some of the most common and disabling consequences of brain injury are deficits in cognition, such as difficulty with sustained attention, memory, organization, and goal management. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop and test novel neuroscience-based cognitive assessment tools and interventions for improving attentional regulation and related "executive function" brain processes involved in goal-directed behavior.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Bases of Cognitive Rehabilitation for Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain injury often results in a disruption of attentional regulation processes, which reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive functions including learning, memory, problem-solving and goal management, leading to significant functional disability. Despite the importance of these problems, few effective interventions are available. Current projects involve developing novel theory-driven neural biomarkers and behavioral measurement tools and training interventions that target attentional control processes. The collection of results will help delineate neural mechanisms that support improved attention regulation that may serve as neurobiological targets for the development of novel interventions that enhance the benefits of rehabilitation. In a randomized, controlled intervention study design, individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic executive control dysfunction will participate in experimental or comparison interventions matched for time, with pre- and post-intervention measurements of performance on neurocognitive 'challenge' tests assessing targeted and non-targeted domains, functional performance in low structure 'real-world' settings, and functional MRI measurements assessing goal-directed information processing. The interventions are: Goal-Based Self Management (GBSM) training, paired with the comparison intervention Brain Health Education (EDU); Pathfinder Attention Process Training (PATH), paired with the comparison intervention Brain Health Education and Motor Skills Training (EDU/MOTOR), and Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training (TAPAT) paired with the comparison intervention Object Discrimination Training (ODT). Participants assigned to GBSM will start with EDU or GBSM. Assignment will be performed on a pseudo-randomized basis with pairing of individuals in the assignment process to ensure groups are closely matched on age, sex, education level and baseline cognitive status. Post-training assessments occur at week 5. Those who enter with EDU will cross-over to GBSM, while those enter with GBSM will have 5 weeks of only self-driven practice. There is no cross-over from GBSM to EDU in order to better assess potential maintenance effects after GBSM participation as well as reduce overall time commitment for patients and trainers given the time-intensive nature of the EDU intervention. Both groups participate in longitudinal assessments at week 10. Long-term follow-up will be at 6 months. Subjects assigned to the PATH or EDU/MOTOR interventions will be randomized into one of these two groups. The EDU/MOTOR group will participate in brain health education and motor speed computer games; the PATH group will enter the integrated protocol involving goal-directed attention regulation training with computer-assisted practice. Both groups will participate in Assessment 2 after the first study period. All subjects in the EDU/MOTOR group will be offered entrance to PATH at the completion of the first study period, and this will provide for an additional within-subjects comparison of effects. Subjects will undergo fMRI, neuropsychological and functional assessments at baseline, week 6, week 12 and at 6 months. Finally, to examine the effectiveness of the TAPAT intervention, subjects will be assigned to either TAPAT or ODT. TAPAT is designed to improve alertness at two levels: tonic attention of sustained attention and phasic alertness, or the capacity to rapidly and effectively interrupt an ongoing response pattern. Subjects will be presented objects on a computer screen and make speeded responses via button press to non-targeted objects and withhold button press to targeted objects. ODT will use the same stimuli and stimulus delivery parameters as TAPAT but consist of a stimulus discrimination task in which subjects will only be required to discriminate object categories, using a unspeeded, forced-choice format. TAPAT and ODT subjects will undergo fMRI, neuropsychological and functional assessments at baseline, week 6, and week 12.</detailed_description>
