	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying blood samples from patients with metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with bicalutamide and goserelin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S9346A Blood Samples From Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Bicalutamide and Goserelin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To test the association between serum PSA response (&lt; 4 ng/mL) at 7 months with inherited variability of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms, in a set of candidate genes, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with combination induction androgen-deprivation therapy comprising bicalutamide and goserelin. OUTLINE: DNA extracted from whole blood or serum samples is analyzed for inherited variability of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms.</detailed_description>
