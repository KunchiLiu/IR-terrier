	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% E Foam in Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia (CCCA) is an inflammation-induced hair loss starting in the central scalp and progressing centrifugally. The cause of CCCA is unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to stop or slow the progression of scarring and permanent hair loss. Once scarring occurs, the hair follicles are obliterated and the hair cannot regrow. Thus, anti-inflammatory medications are used to decrease inflammation. Current treatment includes topical and intralesional corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, and hair transplantation, all which may take months to years to show improvement. There is no evidence-based medicine on how to treat primary cicatricial alopecias. Clobestasol Propionate 0.05% Emollient Foam is an FDA-approved and marketed topical corticosteroid for the treatment of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid- responsive dermatoses of the scalp. Many studies found the foam to be less irritating than the original formulation.</detailed_description>
