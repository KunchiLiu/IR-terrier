	<brief_title>Efficacy &amp; Safety of Clindamycin and Tretinoin in Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne is a chronic disorder of the pilosebaceous glands characterized by inflammatory papules, pustules, opened and closed comedones, cysts and nodules. Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a condition in which an inflammation from a disease such as acne, trauma, or abrasion results in areas of the skin with increased melanin content compared to the surrounding skin. There are several treatments available for acne, which include benzoyl peroxide,antibiotics (topical or oral), and topical retinoids (tretinoin, tazarotene, adapalene). Combination therapy, such as topical retinoid and clindamycin, has been shown to be more effective than monotherapy in addressing all pathogenic factors of acne.</detailed_description>
