	<brief_summary>It was previously demonstrated in in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients that local injury of the endometrium during a spontaneous menstrual cycle that precedes IVF treatment doubled the rates of implantation and pregnancy. The hypothesis of our present study is that the endometrial injury procedure will have the same beneficial effect in patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Local Injury of the Endometrium Improve Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation (COH) + Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) Outcome?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to test our hypothesis, we will perform the simple procedure of local injury of the endometrium using a "Pipelle" biopsy catheter during the spontaneous menstrual cycle that precedes a COH + IUI treatment.</detailed_description>
