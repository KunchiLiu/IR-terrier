	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate if the mean value of brain neurokinin 1 (NK1)-receptor occupancy of participants treated with aprepitant is similar to that of participants treated with fosaprepitant at certain timepoints.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aprepitant and Fosaprepitant Time-on-Target PET (Positron Emission Tomography) Study (0869-183)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The third arm of the study (Aprepitant 250 mg) will only be conducted if the real-time assessment of the NK1-receptor occupancy data between fosaprepitant 150 mg &amp; aprepitant 165 mg reveals that the primary hypothesis will not be supported.</detailed_description>
