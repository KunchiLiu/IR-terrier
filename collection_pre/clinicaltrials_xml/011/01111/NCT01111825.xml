	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and benefit of two new drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. The patient is eligible for the study because their breast cancer has grown in spite of standard treatment. The two drugs tested in the study, Neratinib and Temsirolimus, will be given together. Also, this study will help the investigators learn why therapy directed against HER2 sometimes stops working.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Plus Neratinib for Patients With Metastatic HER2-Amplified or Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I Design A standard, 3+3, dose escalation schedule will be used. Between 6 and 12 patients will likely be necessary to determine the MTD of temsirolimus in combination with neratinib. There will be no intrapatient dose escalation. The starting dose of temsirolimus is 8 mg administered intravenously weekly (dose level 1). Three patients will initially be enrolled in each cohort. The Phase I portion is closed to enrollment. Phase II Design The phase II portion of this trial will be comprised of two cohorts—HER2-amplified and triple negative breast cancer—each of which has a Simon two-stage design to determine the efficacy of temsirolimus when administered in combination with neratinib. Both pathologic subtypes of patients will be studied separately though accrual will be simultaneous. Response (RECIST criteria) will be assessed every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles) after the start of therapy. As of 2/10/12, the Triple-negative cohort is closed to accrual. The HER2- amplified cohort will continue to enroll as planned up to a total of 34 patients.</detailed_description>

Washout period for lapatinib of 14 days. Radiographic progression of disease while on treatment with trastuzumab or lapatinib as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. No restriction on prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced stage disease. No restriction for prior hormonal therapy. No concurrent use of endocrine therapy is permitted. Phase II HER2amplified Cohort HER2 overexpression and/or amplification as determined by immunohistochemistry (3+) or FISH (≥2.0). Previously received trastuzumab as part of a regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting with evidence of progression. Washout period for trastuzumab of 14 days. May have previously received lapatinib as part of a regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting with evidence of progression of disease. Washout period for lapatinib of 14 days. Radiographic progression of disease while on treatment with trastuzumab as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Prior therapy inclusion: no more than four prior chemotherapy regimens allowed for advanced stage disease. No restriction for prior hormonal therapy. No concurrent use of endocrine therapy is permitted. In addition, a final cohort of up to 100 patients will determine the safety and efficacy of daily neratinib when combined with 8mg weekly temsirolimus during Cycle 1, followed by 15mg weekly temsirolimus during Cycle 2 and beyond. Phase I Triplenegative Cohort Invasive adenocarcinoma negative for estrogen receptor (&lt;5%) and progesterone receptor (&lt;5%) expression and a lack of HER2 overexpression and/or amplification as determined by immunohistochemistry (&lt;3+) or FISH (&lt;2.0). No restriction on prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced stage disease. No restriction for prior hormonal therapy. No concurrent use of endocrine therapy is permitted. Phase II Triplenegative Cohort As of 2/10/12, this cohort is closed to accrual Invasive adenocarcinoma negative for estrogen receptor (&lt;5%) and progesterone receptor (&lt;5%) expression and a lack of HER2 overexpression and/or amplification as determined by immunohistochemistry (&lt;3+) or FISH (&lt;2.0). Prior therapy inclusion: no more than four prior chemotherapy regimens allowed for advanced stage disease. No restriction for prior hormonal therapy. No concurrent use of endocrine therapy is permitted. Phase II HER2Positive Cohort with dose escalation HER2 overexpression and/or amplification as determined by IHC (3+) or FISH (≥2.0). Previously received trastuzumab as part of a regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting with evidence of progression. Washout period for trastuzumab of 14 days. May have previously received lapatinib as part of a regimen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting with evidence of progression of disease. Washout period for lapatinib of 14 days. Radiographic progression of disease while on treatment with trastuzumab as defined by RECIST v 1.1. Prior therapy inclusion: no restriction on prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced stage disease. No restriction for prior hormonal therapy. No concurrent use of endocrine therapy is permitted. Inclusion Criteria for ALL subjects (HER2Amplified and Triplenegative) Patients with a diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast confirmed by histology or cytology at MSKCC.
