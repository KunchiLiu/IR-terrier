	<brief_summary>Total knee replacement is a frequent procedure in Qu√©bec's hospitals and the muscular strength of the quadriceps is the best indicator of the patient's functional recovery post surgery. Thus, the importance of the patient's recovery leads to the evaluation of the influence of the femoral nerve block on the muscle strength. The purpose of the study is to compare the short term and long term recuperation of the quadriceps' motor strength of after a total knee arthroplasty using different types of analgesics such as the continuous femoral nerve block, the single dose femoral nerve block and the systemic analgesic, a patient controlled analgesic pump.</brief_summary>
