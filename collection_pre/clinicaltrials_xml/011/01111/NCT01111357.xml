	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affects between 0.3% and 1.0% of the population, it can lead to progressive joint destruction and severe disability. To date, two RA genetic susceptibility factors have been identified: HLA-DRB1-SE (Shared epitope) and PTPN22 620W alleles. The predictive value of the alleles for diagnosis of RA was previously investigated in cohorts of caucasians patients with early unclassified arthritis that showed restrained association between RA and HLA-SE. Despite the contribution of HLA to the overall genetic risk has been estimated to range from 30% to 50%, it has never been studied in the French west-Indian population.</brief_summary>
