	<brief_title>Stress Intervention for Chronic Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this single-arm, interventional pilot study is to evaluate the effect of psychological stress intervention for patients with chronic urticaria, as many of these patients report heightened levels of stress before and/or after the onset of the urticaria. Participants will meet individually with a University of Mississippi Medical Center psychiatry resident for one hour once a week for six consecutive weeks to be educated on psychological stress intervention techniques. There is no control group for this pilot study. All participants will complete a packet of psychological and dermatological questionnaires before the first session with the psychiatry resident and one week after the final session. All participants will record daily 1) their urticaria symptoms and 2) the type and number of medications taken for his/her chronic hives. If psychological stress intervention proves to be effective, then this therapeutic modality would benefit patients with chronic urticaria, while avoiding addition and/or continuation of medications that may have significant adverse side effects.</detailed_description>
