	<criteria>Written informed consent obtained from patient or parents/ guardian. Subject age &gt;= 18 Effective blood flow 350 ml/min and dialysate flow of 500 ml/min On hemodialysis for a minimum of 3 months Use of Cimino or Goretex shunts Routine dialysistreatment for 240 min Documented dialysis adequacy parameter that has been stable for past 3 months Plan to dialyze at participating hemodialysis centre for at least 3months duration. Free from any currently known unusual clotting or access problems Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) negative, documented within the past 90 days or Hepatitis B surface antibody (antiHBs) positive. Anti Hepatitis C Virus (AntiHCV) negative, documented within the past 90 days Anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Anti HIV) negative, documented within the past 90 days Hematocrit (HCT) between 25 and 40% or haemoglobin (Hb) not less than 8 g/dL, as documented 14 days prior to the first treatment Patients who are unable to tolerate an effective blood flow of 350 ml/min Patients using catheter for dialysis Pregnant or nursing woman. Women of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy during the study period by use of hormonal contraception (implantable; patch; oral) and/ or doublebarrier methods (any double combination of: IUD; condom with spermicidal gel; diaphragm; sponge; cervical cap) Previous plan for extended absences from the participating hemodialysis centre Expected to be transplanted (living related donor) within the maximum of 3 months for the study period Any serious medical conditions or disability, which in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with treatment or assessment or preclude completion of the study</criteria>
