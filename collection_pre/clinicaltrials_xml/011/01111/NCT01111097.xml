	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Dichloroacetate (DCA) in the treatment of recurrent malignant brain tumors (RMBTs). RMBTs are defined as either: 1) malignant tumors, originating in the brain, that have recurred at least once or 2) malignant tumors originating elsewhere in the body that have spread to the brain at least once. Otherwise, there are no limitations to the number of prior recurrences. There are no limitations to the number or types of prior therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Dichloroacetate (DCA) in Glioblastoma and Other Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant brain tumors are defined as any World Health Organization grade III-IV glioma and any solid tumor metastasis (spread) to the brain. Recurrent malignant brain tumors (RMBTs) are defined as either: 1) malignant tumors, originating in the brain, that have recurred at least once or 2) malignant tumors originating elsewhere in the body that have spread to the brain at least once. They share an increasing incidence, clinical and radiographic characteristics, lack of effective therapies, tendency to recur, and poor outcome. Importantly, recurrent malignant brain tumor's shared characteristics may be usefully exploited by an emerging class of biologic agents called metabolic modulators of which Dichloroacetate (DCA) is the drug in the class most thoroughly investigated clinically. DCA's mechanism of action and tolerability have been extensively demonstrated in the treatment of chronic metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the preciseness of DCA's mechanism of action appears to target abnormal tumor cell metabolism.</detailed_description>
