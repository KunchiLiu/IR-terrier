	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the profile of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha under inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane and intravenous anesthesia with propofol in healthy patients subjected to minimally invasive elective surgeries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty ASA-I patients, subjected to otorhinolaryngology surgery, were randomly allocated in one group to receive anesthesia with isoflurane 1 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) (n = 20). Other group with twenty ASA-I patients received propofol 2 to 4 microgram mL-1 (n = 20). Fentanyl 5 mg kg-1 and rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg kg-1 were also administered to all patients. Venous blood (10 mL) was collected from each patient at each of the following times: before the beginning of surgery and anesthesia (T1), 2 h after the beginning of surgery (T2), and on the day after the anesthetic-surgical procedure (T3). Plasma concentrations of interleukins IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were measured in each sample through flow cytometry technique by using the method Cytometric Bead Array (CBA). Venous blood samples from fifteen volunteers not subjected to stress were also collected as control, and the same cytokines were measured.</detailed_description>
