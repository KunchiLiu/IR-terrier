	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Clinical Effectiveness and Safety of the VFIX Device as Treatment for Apical Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assuming success of the VFIX anatomical observational study (protocol 300-08-009), in this pilot study approximately 20 subjects (excluding the Device Run-In (DRI) subjects) will undergo the VFIX procedure to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VFIX device in maintaining apical support for at least 6 months, in women with symptomatic apical prolapse.</detailed_description>
