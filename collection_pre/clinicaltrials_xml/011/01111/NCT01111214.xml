	<brief_summary>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of pneumonia, sepsis, bacteremia, and pneumococcal meningitis among infants and children worldwide. The 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar) has been introduced in the Greek Market in 2004. Additionally, as of 2006 Prevenar has been included in the Greek National Immunization Program. The effect of the mass vaccination on the incidence of pneumococcal serotypes involved in the occurring invasive pneumococcal disease, is an important factor to consider for the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.</brief_summary>
