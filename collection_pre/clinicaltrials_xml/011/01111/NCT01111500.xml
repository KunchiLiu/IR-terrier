	<brief_summary>Glenohumeral joint dislocation is the most frequent joint dislocation with a prevalence of 1.7/100000 citizens/year. It is treated by reduction, under sedation or anaesthesia, followed by an immobilization of the arm. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the healing of the labrum in first time anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation with a Bankart lesion in young patients by comparing an external rotation brace to an internal rotation brace to immobilize the injured arm.</brief_summary>
