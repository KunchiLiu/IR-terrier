	<brief_title>Study Evaluating a Heated Lidocaine and Tetracaine Topical Patch in the Treatment of Patients With Patellar Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the potential usefulness of a heated lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg topical patch for the treatment of pain associated with patellar tendinopathy. A number of efficacy variables will be employed to evaluate their utility for assessing painful responses in this population. The study will be a 2-week, open-label study conducted at a single study site in patients with pain associated with patellar tendinopathy in a single knee. During this out-patient study, patients will apply one study patch to the affected tendon twice daily for approximately 14 days. Patches will be applied morning and evening (applications separated by approximately 8-10 hours) and removed after 2-4 hours.</detailed_description>
