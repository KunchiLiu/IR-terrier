	<brief_title>Adding Sitagliptin or Pioglitazone to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Insufficiently Controlled With Metformin and Sulfonylurea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, 24-week study. Inclusion criteria: type 2 diabetes patients who were treated with stable doses of sulfonylurea and metformin to their half maximally dose (sulfonylureas &gt; half maximal dose, and metformin &gt; 1500 mg/d) for &gt; 10 weeks. &gt; 20 years old; A1C:&gt; 7.0 % and &lt; 11% Exclusion criteria: insulin use within 12 weeks of the screening visit, any contraindications for use of sitagliptin or pioglitazone, impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dl), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), current or prepare to pregnancy and lactation. Primary Purpose: compare the change in hemoglobin A1c and the proportion of patients achieving A1C &lt; 7% between the 2 groups Secondary Purposes: 1. Changes in fasting plasma glucose, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) 2. Homeostasis model assessment-β cell function(HOMA-β) will be calculated to assess changes in β-cell function and HOMA-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR)to assess changes in insulin resistance 3. Body weight change, proportion of side effects</detailed_description>
