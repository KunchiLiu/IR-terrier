	<brief_summary>Volume kinetics is a method mostly used, so far, to study the distribution and elimination of crystalloid solutions. Voluven (in Sweden the most commonly used colloid for replacement of bleeding during surgery) is poorly studied, though. Also, a recent study showed unexpected volume kinetics for a crystalloid solution when it was given after a colloid solution. The investigators aim to study the volume kinetics of crystalloids and colloids and also the combination of the two in more detail. The investigators will also compare the invasive hemoglobin measurements with measurements from a new non-invasive tool (Radical 7, from Masimo Inc.) which could help to make volume kinetics more practical for everyday use. Finally the investigators will also study the concentrations of a few coagulation factors to see if they can explain the variations in coagulability that has been described in earlier studies of infusion solutions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will study ten volunteers, each one on three occasions. Each volunteer will receive only crystalloid one time, only colloid another time, and on the third occasion first a colloid and then a crystalloid one hour later. The different protocols will be in random order in the different volunteers. During all these tests we will sample the hemoglobin (both invasive and non-invasive) every fifth minute in the beginning (every tenth minute later) after the infusion. On six to nine occasions during each test we will analyse Albumin, Cystatin-C, Ig-G, Ig-M as markers of hemodilution and D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, Factor VII, PK-INR (prothrombin complex international normalized ratio), and aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) as markers of coagulation. The volunteers are also monitored regarding non-invasive blood pressure and pulse rate.</detailed_description>
