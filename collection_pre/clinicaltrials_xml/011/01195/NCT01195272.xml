	<brief_summary>This open-label, single arm study will assess the effect of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) on neutrophils and monitor safety and benefit-risk of RoActemra/Actemra treatment in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to current biologic or non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra at a dose of 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks, either as monotherapy or in combination with their current non-biologic DMARD. Anticipated time on study treatment is 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
