	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if BMS-512148 (Dapagliflozin), after 12 weeks, can improve (decrease) blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled hypertension who are on an Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB).The safety of this treatment will also be studied</brief_summary>
