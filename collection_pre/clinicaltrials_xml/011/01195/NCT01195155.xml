	<brief_summary>Adipose tissue is a central organ involved in mediating metabolic health, and so the investigation of treatments which improve adipose tissue function is warranted. LC n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been shown to exert positive effects on adipose tissue gene expression in previous studies. However this has not been investigated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a population shown to display a degree of adipose tissue dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation on gene expression profiles of women with PCOS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Had a positive diagnosis of PCOS as defined according to the NIH criteria as chronic oligomenorrhoea (&lt; 9 menstrual cycles per year) and clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, in the absence of other disorders causing the same phenotype. Clinical criteria included hirsutism with a FerrimanGalwey score greater than 9, acne or male pattern alopecia; biochemical criteria included totaltestosterone, androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) greater than the laboratory reference range. Were between the ages of 18 and 40 Were under 18 years or greater than 40 years old, Were nonCaucasian Were pregnant, lactating or trying to conceive Had a body mass index (BMI) &lt;18kg/m2 or &gt;50kg/m2 Had a recent illness or any chronic illness likely to influence results Were taking any medications likely to influence the results including hormonal contraception, antihypertensives, lipid lowering medications, antiplatelet agents, antiinflammatory agents Were taking nutritional supplements Consumed greater than 2 portions of oily fish per week</criteria>
