	<brief_summary>Adipose tissue is a central organ in mediating metabolic health. There is some evidence that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a degree of adipose tissue dysfunction which may negatively affect their metabolic health. The aim of this study was to assess transcriptomic profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue of women with PCOS in comparison with a control population matched on the basis of age and body mass index (BMI). A secondary aim was to then relate these gene expression profiles to the biochemical environment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Had a positive diagnosis of PCOS as defined according to the NIH criteria as chronic oligomenorrhoea (&lt; 9 menstrual cycles per year) and clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, in the absence of other disorders causing the same phenotype. Clinical criteria included hirsutism with a FerrimanGalwey score greater than 9, acne or male pattern alopecia; biochemical criteria included totaltestosterone, androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) greater than the laboratory reference range.
