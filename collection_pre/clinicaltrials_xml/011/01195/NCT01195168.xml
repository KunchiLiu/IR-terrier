	<brief_summary>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more often overweight or obese and are more insulin resistant than women without the condition and may be at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

The aim of this study was to examine cardiovascular risk markers in women with PCOS versus a control population matched for body mass index (BMI), and or, insulin resistance</brief_summary>
