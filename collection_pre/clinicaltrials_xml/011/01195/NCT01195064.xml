	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on the endothelial function, before cardiovascular surgery, compared to non COPD non OSAS patients undergoing also a cardiovascular surgery, by an observational physiological study. An interim analysis will be performed when 100 patients will be included.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives of this clinical trial : - To evaluate the effect of COPD and/or OSAS on the systemic inflammation, insulin-resistance and oxydative stress, in comparison with non COPD non OSAS patients. - To evaluate the effect of COPD and/or OSAS on the inflammation and oxydative stress of the adipose tissue, in comparison with non COPD non OSAS patients. - To validate the STOP-BANG questionnaire in patients undergoing a cardiovascular surgery</detailed_description>
