	<brief_title>A 35 Day Study to Investigate the Effects of GSK1521498 on Bodyweight in Obese Subjects With Over-Eating Behaviours.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to test a new drug which may be used for treating over-eating behaviours and patterns that some overweight and obese people find difficult to control. The drug works by inhibiting the effects of messenger molecules called opioids. These opioids are naturally produced within the human body, and are involved in controlling how much we eat, and the pleasure we get from eating. We believe that GSK1521498 might be effective in the treatment of obesity because it is well known that drugs working on similar binding sites in the brain reduce the pleasure we get from eating, especially high fat or high sugar food. We also believe the effects of GSK1521498 will be greater in obese individuals with greater severity of over-eating behaviours, as measured for example by existing questionnaire scales for binge-eating or compulsive eating behaviour. We will perform a variety of simple tests using a computer, questionnaires and eating assessments to examine effects on behaviour. We will also ask people to complete questionnaires so that we can see if there are any effects on their mood.</detailed_description>
