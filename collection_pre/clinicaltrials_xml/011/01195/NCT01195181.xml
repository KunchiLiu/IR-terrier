	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection provokes thousands of deaths every year all over the world, being the major cause of progressive liver disease, primary hepatic cancer and liver transplantation. Today, a "curative" therapy is available, that can eradicate the viral infection and determine the regression of liver fibrosis, also in cirrhotic subjects. The current standard-of-care for HCV chronic infection is combination therapy with peginterferon (P-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). However, this treatment is not only expensive but determines several side effects, that can reduce drug tolerance and hence, patient adherence to therapy. There are two types of available P-IFN on the market: P-IFN alfa-2a (Pegasys速, F.Hoffmann-La Roche) administered at a flat-dose of 180 mcg/week and P-IFN alfa-2b (PegIntron速, Schering-Plough) given at a weight-based dose of 50 to 150 mcg/week. Since only a single amino acid differentiates these types of IFN, administration strategies depend on their pegilation with molecules of 40 or 12kDa, respectively, that accounts for differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-profile and influences probably also bioactivity. No comparative data are available on the benefits and costs of the licensed Peg-IFN plus RBV for the treatment of HCV infection in the real clinical practice, even if, the benefit and favourable cost-efficacy of this antiviral therapy is well established and of large consensus. Recently, the first randomized controlled mega-trial to compare antiviral therapeutic efficacy in na誰ve patients with HCV-genotype 1 infection during different regimens of P-IFN alfa-2b (at low and standard-dose) and P-IFN alfa-2a plus RBV, has been published, confirming a similar efficacy, of around 40%, obtained with the three schedules evaluated. In Italy, a regional program on the Surveillance and Control of HCV Infection, set up by the Regional Health Councillorship, has led to the development of a clinical and epidemiological observatory, constituted by a network of liver tertiary centres (Hepatological Cooperative Network of Veneto, HepCoVe). This collaborative group is connected on-line by a common database that, since 2003, has prospectively collected data on a cohort of more than 3000 patients with chronic HCV infection and, among them, of 506 na誰ve subjects that consecutively underwent combination therapy with P-IFN alfa-2a or alfa-2b plus RBV. The aim of this study was to rationalize and improve the social regional health program on antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis C by assessing the different schedules utilization of P-IFN plus RBV as well as the respective therapeutic effectiveness, safety and costs in the real clinical practice (Project A).</brief_summary>
