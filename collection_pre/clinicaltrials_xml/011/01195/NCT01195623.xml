	<brief_summary>Duplex imaging is costly and time-consuming, but is used increasingly for preoperative evaluation of varicose veins. Its value in terms of the long-term results of surgery is not clear. 293 patients (343 limbs) with primary varicose veins were randomized to operation with or without preoperative duplex imaging. Reoperation rates, clinical and duplex findings were compared at 2 months and 2 years after surgery. Routine preoperative duplex examination led to an improvement in results. However two years is a short time, and with a longer follow-up other mechanisms for recurrence may become more important, e.g. neovascularization (new vessel formation) or progression of disease, hence the value of a detailed preoperative diagnosis may be diminished. The aim of this phase of the investigation is to study the results after 8 years, in particular what mechanisms for recurrences were most important.</brief_summary>
