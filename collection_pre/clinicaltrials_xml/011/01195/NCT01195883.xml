	<brief_summary>A trial in which patients having open abdominal surgery are randomized to receive either crystalloids or colloids intraoperatively, guided by esophageal Doppler. The investigators test the primary hypothesis that goal-directed colloid administration during elective abdominal surgery decreases a composite of postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be given 5-7 ml/kg of crystalloid (lactated Ringer's) in the immediate preoperative period, which will be followed by 4 ml/kg/h crystalloid for maintenance normalized to ideal body weight [Men: Ideal Body Weight (in kilograms) = 52 kg + 1.9 kg for every 2.5 cm over 150 cm; Women: Ideal Body Weight (in kilograms) = 49 kg + 1.7 kg for every 2.5 cm over 150 cm]. They will then be randomly assigned to additional volume replacement, guided by esophageal Doppler, to either lactated Ringer's solution of Voluven starch.</detailed_description>
