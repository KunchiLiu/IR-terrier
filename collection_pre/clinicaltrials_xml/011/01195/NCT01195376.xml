	<brief_title>A Study of BEZ235 in Adult Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Patients with histologicallyconfirmed, advanced unresectable solid tumors who have progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard anticancer therapy exists. 2. At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST criteria for solid tumors. 3. Age ≥ 20 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG P.S.) of ≤ 2 5. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks 6. Patients must have the laboratory values Patients in the expansion part of this study have to meet the following criteria in addition to the criteria described above. 7. Availability of a representative tumor tissue specimen (either archival tumor or fresh tumor biopsy) for prescreening. 8. Patients whose molecular status proved to meet the criteria (PIK3CA mutation/amplification and/or PTEN mutation and/or low/null PTEN expression) during prescreening. 1. Patients who have brain metastases or who have signs/symptoms attributable and have not been assessed with radiologic imaging to rule out the presence of brain metastases 2. Patients with any peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2 3. Patients with unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 4. Patients with a history of photosensitivity reactions to other drugs 5. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding or adults of reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control. Barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the trial in both sexes. Women of childbearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least consecutive 1 years (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding consecutive 2 years), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 days prior to starting BEZ235.
