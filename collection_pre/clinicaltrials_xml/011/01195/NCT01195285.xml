	<brief_summary>This study will compare Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) cholecystectomy to traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), focusing on patient-reported outcomes and cost.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Versus Traditional Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) is accepted as a form of surgical treatment. Traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TLC) is well tolerated, with a low complication risk and high patient satisfaction; thus a SILS procedure needs to be at least equivalent to be a justifiable replacement, and should not result in higher costs.</detailed_description>
