	<brief_summary>This study addresses the problem of inadequate medication reconciliation as patients cross boundaries between inpatient and outpatient care (ambulatory care). The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new, computer-based application, integrated with electronic prescribing, improves erroneous discrepancies between pre-hospital medications and medications upon patients' return to ambulatory care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project will test a systems-based intervention of the electronic medical records system. The specific aims of this study are to integrate a new electronic medication reconciliation (MR) system with an electronic prescribing system, conduct a randomized controlled trial of MR, and determine whether electronic facilitation of MR alters MR and the incidence of medication errors in ambulatory care. On a patient's hospital admission, a new Web-based MR module will receive an automatically compiled outpatient medication list. Following discussion with the patient, medical personnel will update the list, which will then be delivered to the computer-based provider order entry system and become actionable for prescribing. Main outcomes include adverse drug events and erroneous discrepancies between the pre-admission medication list and the medication list upon the patient's return to ambulatory care. We hypothesize that electronic facilitation of inpatient MR will improve completion of MR and will decrease the incidence of drug-related medical errors.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients admitted to the Medicine Service during a 12month period Physicians who provide inpatient or ambulatory care for participating patients. Pharmacists who provide care for participating patients. Patients admitted but not seen in a primarycare clinic within the preceding 12 months If an enrolled subject is determined to be a prisoner or pregnant woman, then the study will discontinue the subject for research purposes or will submit an amendment at that time.</criteria>
