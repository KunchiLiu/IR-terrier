	<brief_summary>PUR 0110 is a 100% natural novel investigational medicinal product that has been demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immunomodulatory effects. This exploratory Phase 2a study is a first-in-patient study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, biomarker effect and efficacy of PUR 0110 rectal enema in patients with active mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative colitis (UC). The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study. To be eligible for inclusion into the study, patients must either be newly diagnosed or have on-going active mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative colitis of at least 3 months duration confirmed in either case by flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy at the Screening Visit. In addition, patients must have a modified Mayo score of ≥5 to ≤10 including a sigmoidoscopy inflammation grade and rectal bleeding scores of ≥2 each. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either PUR 0110 250 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg or placebo rectal enema in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Patients will self-administer the assigned study medication intrarectally once-daily at bedtime (10:00 p.m +/- 1 hour) for 2 weeks. Patients will be evaluated for safety by adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and concomitant medications. Efficacy evaluations will include the modified Mayo score, patient-defined response and remission, Investigator Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis Symptom Score, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and biomarkers of inflammation, apoptosis and total cell death, lipid peroxidation and in vivo oxidative stress, and antioxidant defense mechanisms in plasma, serum, urine, feces and biopsy tissue. Patients will have a flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy 12 hours after the last dose of study medication.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Safety/Primary Outcome Parameters: - Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events - Incidence, nature and severity of clinical laboratory test abnormalities Efficacy/Secondary Outcome Parameters: - Clinical remission defined as an endoscopy score of ≤ 1, a rectal bleeding score of 0, and an improvement or no change from baseline in the stool frequency score at the end of 2 weeks of treatment / withdrawal visit; - Clinical response rate defined as the percentage of patients with a drop of ≥3 points from the baseline overall modified Mayo score; - Patient defined response and remission rates; - Change from baseline in the overall modified Mayo score (Disease Activity Index); - Change from baseline in each of the 4 individual sub-scores of the modified Mayo score; - Change from baseline in Investigator Assessment of UC Symptom Score (total and individual symptom scores) - Change from baseline in IBDQ score (total and the 4 individual dimension scores) - Proportion of patients with treatment failure; - Change from baseline in serum lutein levels; - Change from baseline in C-reactive protein (CRP), high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fecal calprotectin (FCP), and fecal lactoferrin (FL). - Change from baseline in exploratory biomarkers including: serum interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, human beta-Defensin-2 (hBD-2), malondialdehyde (MDA), lipoxin A4 (LXA4), glutathione (GSH), M30 and M65 apoptosomes in serum and biopsies, and plasma and urinary isoprostane levels.</detailed_description>
