	<brief_summary>Typically, the collection of blood cells for autologous stem cell transplant is done after the drugs granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor have been given to activate the bone marrow stem cells to produce a certain type of blood cell, called CD34+ cells. Currently, plerixafor is given in the evening, about 11 hours before apheresis (removal of blood) begins the following morning. The purpose of this study is to test whether plerixafor can instead be given 17 hours before apheresis. This timing would be more convenient since plerixafor would be given during normal clinic hours, and so patients would be within a clinic environment if any side effects develop. The study will look for the activation of CD34+ cells in patients who receive plerixafor 17 hours before apheresis. We will follow the number of patients that achieve the target numbers of CD34+ cells, and the total number of CD34+ cells collected. These will be compared to the numbers in previous studies giving plerixafor 11 hours before apheresis. We will also assess the safety of giving plerixafor 17 hours before apheresis.</brief_summary>
