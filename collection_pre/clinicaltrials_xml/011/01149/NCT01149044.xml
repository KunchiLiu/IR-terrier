	<brief_summary>This is an international, randomized, controlled, parallel group study in which patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) will be allocated to one of the following: Manual aspiration thrombectomy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or PCI alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Versus PCI Alone in Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Undergoing Primary PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis for TOTAL is that the routine use of manual aspiration thrombectomy with an aspiration catheter (Export®) with PCI compared to PCI alone will reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or new or worsening NYHA Class IV heart failure (HF) at 180 days in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.</detailed_description>
