	<brief_summary>The ideal mean arterial pressure in patients with septic shock is unknown. The expert's recommandations have stated a target between 65 and 70 mm Hg. However the scientific basis are weak. Indead there are only few prospective studies which addressed this question without clear answer. Therefore we designed a RCT in order to assess the effect on mortality of two levels of mean arterial pressure in patients with septic shock.(800 patients, 30 centres)</brief_summary>
