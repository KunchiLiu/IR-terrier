	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the opiate sparing effects of intravenously administered dexamethasone in outpatient knee surgery. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid with well known antiemetic effects. However, the analgesic effects of dexamethasone have not been adequately researched. Following surgery, patients are typically discharged home with PO opiates to manage post-operative pain. The investigators believe that by using Visual Analog scales for Pain the investigators can show that a single dose of dexamethasone can reduce pain scales and opiate consumption post-operatively, on POD 0 and POD 1 when compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
