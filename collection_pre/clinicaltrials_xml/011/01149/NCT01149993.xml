	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing living donor renal transplant will be asked to participate to determine whether pre-operative dosing of immunosuppressive medication, and the donor organ receiving an additional dose of antibody induction therapy helps to alleviate potential damage to the transplanted organ post-transplant. A number of lab tests will be done post-transplant to determine how well the kidney is functioning.</brief_summary>
