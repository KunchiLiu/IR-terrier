	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase II Clinical Trial of Aplidin® (plitidepsin) in Patients with Primary Myelofibrosis and post polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (Post-PV/ET) Myelofibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Aplidin® in Patients With Primary Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial tries to assess response rate (ORR) of plitidepsin in patients with: primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF). Besides, the study results will allow to evaluate the effect of plitidepsin on bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood histology and to determine the quality of life (QoL) and symptoms or participant patients.</detailed_description>
