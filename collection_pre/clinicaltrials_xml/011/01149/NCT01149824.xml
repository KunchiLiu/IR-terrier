	<brief_summary>In this study, our aim is to determine an active but tolerable sublingual dose (range 100 to 4000 µg) of Salvinorin A (SA) in experienced subjects. This study is an ascending-dose, placebo-controlled, single-site design in 8 Salvia-experienced subjects. Subjects will receive SA doses from 0-4000 µg. Doses will be separated by at least one day. The first two doses (0 and 100µg) will be double-blinded while the last four (250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000µg) will be single-blind.</brief_summary>
