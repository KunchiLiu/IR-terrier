	<brief_title>Efficacy of L-carnitine Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue is one of the most frequent disabling symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). L-Carnitine is currently used in the symptomatic treatment of fatigue after chemotherapy in patients with cancers. It is also empirically used by numerous MS centers in the treatment of fatigue. However, this practice is not evidence-based (Cochrane review 2010). This study will evaluate the efficacy of L-carnitine versus placebo in the treatment of fatigue in MS patients in a randomized double blind national multicenter cross-over trial.</detailed_description>
