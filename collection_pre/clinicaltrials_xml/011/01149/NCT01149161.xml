	<brief_summary>Occult lymph node metastasis is common in micro papillary thyroid cancer. However, the role of lymph node dissection in the treatment of microPTC remains controversial. The investigators want to investigate the usefulness routine central dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy in prognosis of micro PTC. This is a prospective randomized control study. The investigators started this study from May of 2009 and this study will be continued until Dec. 2011.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extent of Central Lymph Node Dissection in Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will assign all patients to three groups; no dissection group (Group I), sentinel lymph node biopsy only group (Group II) and routine central neck dissection group (Group III). At first, to know the necessity of routine central neck node dissection for micro PTC,the investigators will compare the result of group I and group III. Additionally, the investigators can analyze the usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy for substitution of routine central neck node dissection for micro PTC.</detailed_description>
