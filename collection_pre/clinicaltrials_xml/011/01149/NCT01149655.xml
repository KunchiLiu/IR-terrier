	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a screening period, a conversion phase (Phase 1), a stabilization phase (Phase 2), and a double-blind maintenance treatment phase (Phase 3), and a follow up period. Subjects may be either outpatients or inpatients between screening and through the time they reach stabilization at the end of Phase 2; hospitalization is not a study requirement. However, eligible subjects must be outpatients at the beginning of Phase 3. Subjects will be assessed weekly during Phase 1, weekly for the first 4 weeks of Phase 2 and 3, and biweekly for the remaining weeks during each of Phases 2 and 3. Subjects will be encouraged to call the investigators with any exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and/or any tolerability issues. The investigator will also have the option to phone the subjects and their guardian(s) at any time to ensure clinical stability. A data monitoring committee (DMC) will provide oversight for safety monitoring and reviewing the interim analysis. One interim analysis is planned after 75% of the total expected number of impending relapse events (28 events) are achieved and will be conducted by an independent data analysis center. The DMC will make a recommendation about stopping or continuing the study based on safety and efficacy reviews. The results of the interim analysis and individual subject data will remain blinded to the sponsor during the course of the study until the DMC determines that the study will conclude based on the results of the interim analysis, or the study is completed after 37 endpoint events.</brief_summary>
