	<brief_title>Follow-up Study of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to Treat Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our first ongoing study (Efficacy Study of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to Treat Major Depressive Disorder) addresses whether tDCS is an effective treatment for depression treatment. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether tDCS is also an effective strategy for sustaining remission. We will enroll patients who presented remission using tDCS from our previous study and offer them to tDCS every other week for three months, than once a month for another three months. We will address whether tDCS prevents relapse by assessing depression scores once a month, using a time-to-event analysis. The importance of the present study is to determine whether tDCS is able to sustain remission during long-term follow-up of depressed patients.</detailed_description>
