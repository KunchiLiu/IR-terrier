	<brief_summary>In this study, TRV120027 (or a placebo) intravenous infusion will be given to people with heart failure to learn about the effects of TRV120027. The results of this study will help choose the proper range of TRV120027 doses to use in future research studies involving patients with acute decompensated heart failure.</brief_summary>
