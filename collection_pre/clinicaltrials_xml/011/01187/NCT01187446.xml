Prior courses of TSEBT (Note: localized skindirected radiotherapy is allowed if administered at least 4 weeks prior to initiation on study). 2. Concomitant use of any anticancer therapy or immune modifier. 3. Prior allogeneic or autologous transplant. 4. Active infection or have received intravenous antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal agents within 2 weeks prior to the start of the study drug. 5. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C. 6. History of prior malignancy with the exception of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and adequately treated localized prostate carcinoma (PSA &lt;1.0). Patients with a history of other malignancies must have undergone potentially curative therapy and have no evidence of that disease for five years. 7. Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness, condition, or circumstances that could limit compliance with the study, including, but not limited to the following: active infection, acute or chronic graft versus host disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, medically significant cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or hypertension, or psychiatric conditions. 8. Recent (in the past 6 months) medically significant cardiac event (i.e. myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery. 9. Congenital long QT syndrome. 10. QTc interval &gt; 480 msec on screening ECG. 11.
