	<brief_title>The Value of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Stage II Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical Stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma consisted of T2N0M0, T1N1M0, T2N1M0 three subgroups, the data came from conventional radiotherapy era showed that the prognosis of this three subgroups were different, the N1 groups suffered more distant metastasis than N0 group, and some literature showed that combined chemotherapy with radiotherapy in stage II patients can improve the treatment results. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)now is an widely used technique in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the preliminary results showed that IMRT can improve the quality of life in nasopharyngeal through salivary gland preservation. Compared IMRT alone with IMRT plus cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of stageII nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we hope to confirm whether stage II (and which subgroup) nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be benefit from concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</detailed_description>
