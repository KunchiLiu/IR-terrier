	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to carry out a pilot project comparing the effectiveness of two therapeutic approaches to temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) in adolescents. Eight female individuals diagnosed based on the Research Diagnosis Criteria for TMDs (RDC/TMD-axis 1)were randomly divided into two groups: 1) Massage therapy and muscle stretching (n=4); and 2) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (n=4). Regardless the treatment, ten sessions were held for each patient and two measurements (baseline and 10th session) were performed for the assessment of symptom evolution using a visual analog scale (VAS), maximum opening of the mouth (MOM) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). Statistical analysis wiil be carefully selected.</brief_summary>
