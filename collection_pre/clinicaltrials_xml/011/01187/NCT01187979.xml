	<brief_title>Reducing HIV in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact of the cash incentivised intervention will be assessed using a matched pair, cluster randomised controlled trial design. The 14 selected high schools in the Vulindlela School Circuit will be matched in pairs. The matched pairs of schools will be the unit of randomisation. Baseline measurements, using a standardised tool (structured questionnaire and biological specimens) will be undertaken simultaneously in each matched pair and will include all eligibly enrolled and consenting learners in the respective schools. On completion of baseline measurements in each matched pair of schools, the randomisation code for the pair will be revealed and the intervention will be implemented in the intervention school. All schools will receive the same prevention intervention but only the intervention school will receive the cash incentives. Follow-up measurements will be undertaken approximately 12 and 24 months after implementation of the intervention using a similar standardised assessment tool to that used at baseline. At baseline and during follow-up assessments in intervention and control schools, linked HIV and substance use testing will be undertaken in all learners and pregnancy testing in female learners. Other secondary endpoints will be assessed using a structured questionnaire.</detailed_description>
