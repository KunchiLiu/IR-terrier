	<brief_summary>The overall research plan is to test the hypothesis that intraoperative treatment of hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp (HNC) in cardiac surgical patients improves myocardial function and short-term outcomes compared with standard glucose management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of the Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemic Clamp on Myocardial Function and Utilization of Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim #1:To determine whether intraoperative use of HNC affords cardioprotective benefits measured by improved echocardiographic measures of myocardial function, serum markers of cardiomyocyte injury, and hemodynamic indices measured immediately (at end of surgery) and during the short-term (initial hospitalization). Specific Aim #2 and #3 To determine the mechanism of HNC by laboratory analysis of right atrial tissue. Specific Aim #2 To determine if HNC decreases flux via HBP and cellular markers of injury. Specific Aim #3 To determine if HNC augments glucose uptake and utilization.</detailed_description>
