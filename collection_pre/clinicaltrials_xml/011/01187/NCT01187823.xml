	<brief_title>The Effect of Adaptive Servo Ventilation and Oxygen Therapy in Central Sleep Apnea Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central sleep apnea(CSA) is associated with chronic heart failure(CHF). At present, both of nocturnal oxygen therapy and adaptive servo ventilation(ASV) are recognized as effective modalities. However,in fact, majority of CHF patients are complicated not only with CSA but with obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Recently, Philips developed Bipap® auto SV Advanced for such patients. It has auto-CPAP function as the modality of OSAS, in addition to ASV function. The present study is prospective randomised study to compare the effects of nocturnal oxygen therapy and Bipap® auto SV Advanced.</detailed_description>
