	<brief_summary>Dietary fiber consumption may contribute to weight regulation by improving satiety. In an earlier study the investigators found that a muffin containing resistant starch was more effective than other fibers in altering satiety. The objective of this study is to determine if 2 resistant starches consumed in muffins alter satiety and whether a mixture of resistant starches is more effective than either alone in enhancing satiety.</brief_summary>
