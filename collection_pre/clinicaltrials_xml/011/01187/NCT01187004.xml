	<brief_title>Extracardiac Complications After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To find out which are the main peri operative predictors of acute lung injury and other extracardiac complications, such as kidney injury, that prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay after cardiac surgery. The main goal is to evaluate whether mechanical ventilation, in particular tidal volume, can be predictor of acute lung injure in this kind of patients.</detailed_description>
