	<brief_summary>The objective of this pivotal study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the EVAHEART LVAS as a bridge-to-transplant for subjects with end stage heart failure. Subjects will be followed for 180 days after the EVAHEART LVAS implant or until cardiac transplant or explant for recovery (+ 60 days or discharge). If after 180 days post-implant the subject has not received a cardiac transplant or the device has not been explanted, the subject will continue to be followed monthly.</brief_summary>
