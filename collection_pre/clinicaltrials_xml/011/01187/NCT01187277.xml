	<brief_summary>The incidence of stroke in the industrial world is still high. Most of the patients are suffering from paresis of the affected side, speech and cognition problems. Modern concepts of motor learning after stroke favouring a task-specific repetitive high-intensity therapy approach to promote motor outcome. In the last couple of years robot-assisted therapy became an important part of modern rehabilitation after stroke. But so far there is no clear evidence that robot assisted therapy in combination with conventional therapy is more effective than conventional therapy alone to promote motor functions after stroke.</brief_summary>
