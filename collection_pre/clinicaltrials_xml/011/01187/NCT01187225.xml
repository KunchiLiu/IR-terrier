	<brief_title>Fibrinogen Concentrate In Children After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery in children may be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding. Perioperative excessive bleeding is associated with need of transfusion with allogeneic blood products such as red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelet pools, and cryoprecipitate. Furthermore, bleeding may result in re-exploration, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.Recent studies have shown that patients and children undergoing cardiac surgery with pump often experience a significant drop in their levels and function of fibrinogen, and it would be in part responsible for the bleeding. In most centre world-wide, it is common practice to treat bleeding in these patients with cryoprecipitate in order to substitute fibrinogen. Fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P)may reduce perioperative bleeding, requirements of blood transfusion and clinical outcomes in children undergoing cardiac surgery with pump, compared to cryoprecipitate.</detailed_description>
