	<brief_summary>A huge challenge in type 2-diabetes care is how to motivate patients towards health behaviour changes. In Denmark, the tendency is that nurses in general practice provide a large part of type 2 diabetes care. Observational studies support Self-determination Theory by finding autonomous motivation and perceived competence associated with improved HbA1c-levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hence, research is needed to develop and test interventions that are autonomy supportive. Aim To develop a training course for practice-nurses in autonomy support in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to evaluate the effect on patient outcomes. Methods The development of the intervention was based on literature research and expert meetings. The intervention is evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial with 40 Danish general practices, - where nurses, before enrolment in the study, provided consultations to patients with type 2 diabetes, - and about 2500 patients with type 2 diabetes, identified in a Diabetes Database. The patients will be followed 15 months from nurse-participation in the course. Data will be obtained from registers and patient-questionnaires. The hypothesis is that patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of education level, age, and gender will benefit from the intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The interventionstudy comprises 40 general practices were: 1. more than 50% of the patients with type 2 diabetes, who had participated in diabetesconsultations during the last year from the invitationdate to the project, were seen by a nurse at least once, stated by the practice. The diabetesconsultation should not only include examinations (blood tests and blood pressure measurement), but should also include communication about living with type 2 diabetes ; 2. enrollment in the project before registration deadline (three weeks after invitation). Patients with diabetes, alive and affiliated the practices by May 2011, were identified in a a validated diabetes database based on health registers; The national Patient Registry, The national Health Insurance Service registry, the prescription database and the laboratory database in the county.</criteria>
