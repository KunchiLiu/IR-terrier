	<brief_summary>Chronic mountain sickness is characterized by excessive red blood cell production which causes sludging of the vascular system. This high viscosity blood causes heart failure, cognitive dysfunction, and strokes. The investigators hypothesize that cobalt which has been previously been shown to be an environmental pollutant worsens the overproduction of red blood cells. The investigators plan to conduct a 6 week trial in which acetazolamide (already shown to improve chronic mountain sickness) and N-acetylcysteine (a drug that removes cobalt from the blood) are evaluated in their potential to improve chronic mountain sickness.</brief_summary>
