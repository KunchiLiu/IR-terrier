	<brief_summary>Although a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can be used to open up the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the heart muscle after myocardial infarction, there may be a significant amount of heart tissue that has been irreversibly damaged. Recent studies have shown that adult stem cells from bone marrow may be able to improve heart function and prevent from heart remodeling due to heart failure. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using adult bone marrow derived stem cells for improving heart function in MI patients with Left Anterior Descending (LAD) involvement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Derived AC 133+ and Mono-Nuclear Cells (MNC) Implantation in Myocardial Infarction (MI) Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient from both gender, who had acute MI within recent 3 Weeks in LAD territory and would underwent PCI are eligible for this study. The bone marrow derived AC 133+ and MNC would be intracoronary injected to the patients during PCI procedure. The control group would be received just serum during PCI. The patient would be followed every month and at the end of 6th and 18thmonth the case and control groups will be evaluated by stress echo and Tc99 scan. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusion into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach in terms of efficacy</detailed_description>
