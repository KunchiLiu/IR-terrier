	<brief_summary>Patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis have an extremely high rate of cardiovascular disease including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This, at least in part, is due to the chronic inflammatory status usually seen in these patients. Here we try to see if treatment with extended release nicotinic acid (Niaspan) can reduce their overall inflammatory burden (in general) and the atherosclerotic plaque inflammation (in particular).</brief_summary>
