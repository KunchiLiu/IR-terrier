	<brief_summary>Seborrheic keratoses (SK's) are very common, but harmless skin lesions that commonly appear during adult life. Patients with seborrheic keratoses frequently desire treatment due to symptoms of itching and irritation or for cosmetic purposes. Seborrheic keratoses can be easily removed and have been treated in a number of different ways. Two of the simplest and most successful ways to remove seborrheic keratoses are cryosurgery and curettage. The investigators are conducting this study to see which of these two treatments has the best result. Approximately 24-30 people will take part in this research study at the Hershey Medical Center.</brief_summary>
