	<brief_summary>It is assumed that patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) showing an infero- or posterolateral occluded culprit artery (OCA) during diagnostic angiography frequently elude standard 12-lead electrocardiogram diagnosis. In addition, coronary collaterals may have beneficial effects in patients with OCA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence of Occluded Culprit Arteries and Impact of Coronary Collaterals on Outcome in Patients With NSTEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We examined consecutive NSTEMI patients within 48 h of symptom onset. All patients underwent early invasive angiography plus optimal medical therapy. We compared baseline characteristics, procedural findings including analysis of TIMI-flow and collaterals using the Rentrop-classification, 30-day and 6-months major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with and without totally OCA.</detailed_description>
