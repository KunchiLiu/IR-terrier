	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different dose strengths of INX-08189 in healthy adults. The study will also look at how rapidly the drug breaks down in the body (pharmacokinetics or PK). The study objectives include: - To evaluate the safety of single ascending oral doses of INX-08189 in healthy subjects - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single ascending oral doses of INX-08189 in healthy subjects - To assess the food effect on the PK of a single oral dose of INX-08189</brief_summary>
