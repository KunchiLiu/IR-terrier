	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a capsule (SmartPill~) measuring pH, pressure and temperature from within the entire GI tract to determine gastric emptying time, combined small and large bowel transit time and total transit time. In addition, the Capsule will characterize pressure patterns and provide motility indices for the antrum and duodenum. It is believed that the condition of your digestive system can have a large impact on your overall physical health. Therefore,the investigators would like to assess whether using the pill device helps to determine any functional problems in patients in the ICU. The investigators are studying ICU patients because any change in their condition can have a large impact on their recovery.</brief_summary>
