	<criteria>1. Male or female patient with completely resected (R0 resection), pathologically proven stage IB, II or IIIA NSCLC. Patients are allowed to receive adjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy for the treatment of the current NSCLC between surgery and enrolment. 2. Written informed consent for PRAME gene expression screening on resected tumor tissue has been obtained from the patient prior to shipment of the sample for expression testing, and written informed consent for the complete study participation has been obtained before the performance of any other protocol specific procedure. 3. Patient is &gt;= 18 years of age at the time of signature of the first informed consent form. 4. The patient's tumor shows expression of the PRAME gene. 5. The surgical technique for resection of the patient's tumor is anatomical, involving at least a lobectomy or a sleeve lobectomy. The first ASCI administration will be given, either within 12 weeks after surgery or within 8 weeks after day 1 of last chemotherapy cycle and within 32 weeks after resection. 6. The patient is free of metastasis, as confirmed by a negative baseline computer tomogram (CT scan) of the chest and upper abdomen as well as CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. These tests are to be performed within 6 weeks for the CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen and within 12 weeks for the brain CT scan or MRI before first ASCI administration. 7. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2. 8. Adequate bonemarrow reserve, renal, adrenal and hepatic function as assessed by standard laboratory criteria 9. Female patients of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as current tuballigation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. 10. Female patient of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the patient: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to study product administration, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of administration, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the study product administration series. 11. In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. 1. The primary tumor was removed by segmentectomy or wedge resection. 2. The patient has received any anticancer specific treatment, including radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, except for the treatment of previous malignancies allowed by the protocol. 3. The patient requires concomitant treatment (more than 7 consecutive days) with systemic corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive agents. 4. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine, except influenza vaccine in the context of H1N1 massvaccination) other than the study product within the 30 days preceding the first dose of study product, or planned use during the study period. 5. The patient has previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites, except effectively treated nonmelanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or effectively treated malignancy that has been in remission for more than 3 years and highly likely to have been cured. 6. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study investigational product. 7. History of confirmed adrenal dysfunction. 8. The patient has an autoimmune disease such as, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with vitiligo are not excluded. 9. The patient has received a major organ allograft. 10. The patient is known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive. 11. The patient has an uncontrolled bleeding disorder. 12. The patient has uncontrolled congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension, unstable heart disease (coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction) or uncontrolled arrhythmia at the time of enrolment. 13. The patient needs home oxygenation. 14. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability to give informed consent, or to comply with the trial procedures. 15. The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to unacceptable risk. 16. For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating.</criteria>
