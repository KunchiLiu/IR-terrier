	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-site, unmasked phase IV study. Travacom(R) is a combination topical ocular agent, containing travoprost and timolol, which lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by complementary mechanisms of action. The safety and efficacy of both travoprost and timolol have been established as single and adjunctive therapy in well-controlled clinical studies in thousands of patients diagnosed with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of changing to Travacom from prior pharmacotherapy in uncontrolled patients with open-angled glaucoma or ocular hypertension across India.</brief_summary>
