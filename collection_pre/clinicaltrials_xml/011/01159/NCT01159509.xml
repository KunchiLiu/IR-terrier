	<brief_summary>The loss of sodium during infancy causes long term changes in sodium intake. Human research shows that the loss of maternal sodium during pregnancy and neonatal after birth causes an increase sodium intake during childhood. A study that examined sodium intake among infants that were treated with diuretics during the post-natal period found changes in sodium intake compared to controls. In this study we will test sodium intake in young children who have suffered from vomiting due to Hypertrophic Pyloric stenosis during early infancy.</brief_summary>
