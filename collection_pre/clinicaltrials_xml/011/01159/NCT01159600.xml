	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus prior to informed consent 2. Male and female patients on a diet and exercise regimen who are pretreated with immediate release metformin or immediate release metformin plus sulfonylurea (see below for minimum doses). The treatment regimen has to be unchanged for 12 weeks prior to randomisation. Minimum dose for metformin: &gt; or = 1500 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose or maximum dose according to local label Minimum dose for sulfonylurea: &gt; or = half of the maximal recommended dose or maximum tolerated dose or maximum dose according to local label 3. HbA1c of &gt; or = 7.0% and &lt; or = 11% at Visit 1 (screening) in order to be eligible for randomised treatment HbA1c of &gt; 11% at Visit 1 (screening) in order to be eligible for the openlabel treatment arm (25 mg BI 10773) 4. Age&gt; or = 18 5. Body Mass Index (BM)I &lt; or = 45 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) at Visit 1 (Screening) 6. Signed and dated written informed consent by date of Visit 1 in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Exclusion criteria: 1. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia with a glucose level &gt; 240 mg/dl (&gt;13.3 mmol/L) after an overnight fast during placebo runin and confirmed by a second measurement (not on the same day) 2. Any other antidiabetic drug within 12 weeks prior to randomisation except those mentioned in inclusion criterion 2 3. Myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 3 months prior to informed consent 4. Indication of liver disease, defined by serum levels of either ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), or alkaline phosphatase above 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) as determined during screening and/or runin phase 5. Impaired renal function, defined as eGFR&lt;30 ml/min (severe renal impairment) as determined during screening and/or runin phase 6. Bariatric surgery within the past two years and other gastrointestinal surgeries that induce chronic malabsorption 7. Medical history of cancer (except for basal cell carcinoma) and/or treatment for cancer within the last 5 years 8. Contraindications to metformin and/or sulfonylurea according to the local label for those patients that enter the study with the respective background therapy 9. Blood dyscrasias or any disorders causing haemolysis or unstable Red Blood Cell (e.g. malaria, babesiosis, haemolytic anaemia) 10. Treatment with antiobesity drugs (e.g. sibutramine, orlistat) 3 months prior to informed consent or any other treatment at the time of screening (i.e. surgery, aggressive diet regimen, etc.) leading to unstable body weight 11. Current treatment with systemic steroids at time of informed consent or change in dosage of thyroid hormones within 6 weeks prior to informed consent or any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder except Typ 2 Diabetes 12. Premenopausal women (last menstruation Â¿ 1 year prior to informed consent) who: are nursing or pregnant or are of childbearing potential and are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or do not plan to continue using this method throughout the study and do not agree to submit to periodic pregnancy testing during participation in the trial.
