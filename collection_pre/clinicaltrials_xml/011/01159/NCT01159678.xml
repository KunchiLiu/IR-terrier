	<brief_title>Online Psychoeducation for Sexual Dysfunction in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experiencing a diagnosis of cancer may dramatically alter the way a person feels about themselves, their body, and their significant relationships at sexual and intimate levels1. Cancer and its treatments affect the physiological, psychological, and sociological realms of a survivor's life and his/her ability to experience sexual health. Sexual health is recognized as an integral aspect of quality of life (QOL) during cancer and is increasingly receiving research and clinical attention. Sexual changes following the treatment of gynaecologic (i.e.: ovarian, endometrial, cervical) and colorectal cancers are common though often not discussed. Moreover, cancer survivors express dissatisfaction that sexual concerns, and treatment of them, are not discussed in the context of their cancer care. Oncologists frequently are faced with patients inquiring about sexual changes with cancer treatment, but are usually not equipped with accurate and comprehensive data on the precise sexual symptoms to expect or where to refer patients with sexual concerns. The aims of the study are to assess the efficacy of a 12-module online psychoeducational intervention for sexual health (OPES) on (1) the primary endpoint of sexual distress in male and female cancer survivors with sexual problems; (2) the secondary sexuality-related endpoints of sexual desire, arousal (women) or erection (men), orgasm, and sexual pain; (3) on mood, relationship satisfaction, and quality of life; and (4) to assess gender differences in the proportion of survivors improved on sexual distress.</detailed_description>
