	<brief_summary>To clarify that tacrolimus-sparing regimen with minimal tacrolimus dose together with mycophenolate sodium dose increment will preserve renal allograft function without rising adverse effects Primary endpoints: 1. estimated GFR (MDRD equation) 12 months after randomization 2. estimated GFR change from randomization to end of the study (calculated by MDRD equation and Nankivell equation)</brief_summary>
