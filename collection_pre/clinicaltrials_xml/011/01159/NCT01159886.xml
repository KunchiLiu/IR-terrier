	<brief_summary>During colonoscopy, the colonoscopist employs various maneuvers, including changing the patient's posture to left-lateral decubitus or supine, to achieve complete colonoscopic examination. Posture change has also been reported to increase the success rate of ileal intubation. However, there has been no randomized trial which has shown that a particular posture of the patient increases the success rate of ileoscopy. The present study will be carried out to determine the impact of the patient's posture (left lateral vs supine position) on success rate of ileal intubation.</brief_summary>
