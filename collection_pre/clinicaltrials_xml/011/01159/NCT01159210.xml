	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Prothromplex Total as a treatment for the immediate reversal of oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists in patients with acquired deficiency of prothrombin complex coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X). Upon enrolment, subjects will receive Prothromplex Total for the treatment of acute bleeding due to oral anticoagulants or for the prevention of excessive bleeding during the interventional procedure (Day 1). Additional doses of Prothromplex Total may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed during a period of 72 (Â± 4) hours after administration of the last dose of Prothromplex Total or until discharge from hospital, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>
