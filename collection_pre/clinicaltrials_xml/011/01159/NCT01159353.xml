	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To assess the effect of insulin glulisine on the post-prandial plasma glucose excursion during the first hour after a standard meal in comparison to insulin aspart in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Secondary Objectives: Pharmacodynamic objectives: - To assess the effect of insulin glulisine on the postprandial plasma glucose excursion during 6 hours after a standard meal in comparison to insulin aspart. Pharmacokinetic objective: - To assess post-prandial plasma insulin excursion after a standard meal, in each treatment groups Safety objective: - To assess the safety of insulin glulisine in comparison to insulin aspart</brief_summary>
