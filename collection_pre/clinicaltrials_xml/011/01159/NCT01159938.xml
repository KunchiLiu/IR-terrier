Have not smoked in the last 12 hours prior to the study visit. Have albuminuria but normal kidney function or normal UAER [UAER &lt; 20 micrograms per minute (mcg/min) or &lt; 30 milligrams/24 hours (mg/24h), respectively]. Participants with or without albuminuria but normal kidney function will be matched for age and body mass index (BMI). Participants have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments for clinic visits and all tests and examinations required by the protocol. Each participant must understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent document (ICD). Healthy participants are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria: Healthy participants 45 to 70 years of age, matched for age and BMI, who have not smoked in the last 12 hours prior to the study. Normal glucose tolerance and normal UAER (UAER between &lt; 20 Î¼g/min in the overnight urine collection or &lt; 30 mg/24h in the 24h urine collection). Healthy participants have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments for clinic visits and all tests and examinations required by the protocol. Each healthy participant must understand the nature of the study and must sign an ICD. Participants/healthy participants will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria: Have had a cardiovascular event [stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery procedure (bypass surgery or angioplasty), limb amputation due to ischemia, peripheral vascular disease] or coronary heart disease confirmed by exercise test or scintigraphy. Have arrhythmias. Have an acute infection. Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or device or offlabel use of a drug or device (other than the study drug/device used in this study), or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.
