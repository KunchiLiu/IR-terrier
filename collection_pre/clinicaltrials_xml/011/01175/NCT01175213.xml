	<brief_summary>The original purpose of the study was to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and practicability of the subcutaneous (SC) treatment with Immune Globulin Subcutaneous Solution (IGSC), 10% facilitated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) in participants with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID) who had completed Baxalta (formerly Baxter) Clinical Study Protocol No. 160603. Following a discussion with the FDA at the end of July 2012, all participants still active in the study stopped treatment with rHuPH20 to assure safety of the participants participating in the study and went into a safety follow-up. During this safety follow-up period, participants underwent either SC treatment with IGSC, 10% or intravenous (IV) treatment with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10%. The IV or SC administration route was at the discretion of the participant and the investigator.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IGSC, 10% is the same product as IGIV, 10%. IGSC, 10% is generally quoted when administration is subcutaneous (SC) and IGIV, 10% is generally quoted when administration is intravenous (IV). IGSC, 10% is abbreviated to IGI, 10% (IMMUNE GLOBULIN INFUSION (HUMAN), 10%) In the US the product is licensed (trade name GAMMAGARD LIQUID) for the IV and SC replacement therapy of antibody deficiency in patients with PID. In the EU this product is licensed (trade name KIOVIG) IGSC, 10% with rHuPH20 established name is Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase. US trade name is HYQVIA EU trade name is HyQvia</detailed_description>
