	<brief_summary>Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and hospitalization rates are increasing. In the US, impoverished children and children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. While National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines recommend daily preventive medications for all children with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma, studies indicate that many children in the US who should receive preventive medications are not receiving them. The overall goal of this project is to target an ethnically diverse population of inner-city schoolchildren with asthma and explore a school-based program to reduce asthma morbidity. We hypothesize that children receiving a comprehensive school-based intervention will experience less asthma-related morbidity compared to children receiving usual care. Our comprehensive school-based intervention consists of both administration of recommended preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines) and an environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reduction program in the home for smoke-exposed children. Our secondary hypothesis is that, among the subgroup of smoke-exposed children, those who receive the school-based intervention with ETS reduction will experience less asthma morbidity than those who receive usual care.</brief_summary>
