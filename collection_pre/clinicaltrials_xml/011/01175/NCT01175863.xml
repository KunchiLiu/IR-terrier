	<brief_title>Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) Versus Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) in Intermediate Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a prospective, randomized, open label, two arm designed multi-center trial. When diagnostic coronary angiogram shows that the target lesion is intermediate stenosis, IVUS and/or FFR will be performed in order to decide PCI or defer by 1:1 randomization. The patients would be followed up to 2 years clinically.</detailed_description>
