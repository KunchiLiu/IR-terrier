	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits). A male or female between, and including: 8 and 11 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination for subjects in the &lt;6S and &lt;6NS groups or 7 and 11 months at the time of the first vaccination for subjects in the 711S and 711NS groups or 12 and 23 months at the time of first vaccination for subjects in the 1223S and 1223NS groups (Note the second dose should be administered at 23 Months of age at the latest to allow, if needed, compliance with the National Recommendations on administration of the 23valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine in children with SCD as of 24 months of age). Written informed consent, signed or thumb printed, obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by a witness. Additional inclusion criteria for children with SCD (&lt;6S, 711S and 1223S groups): Children with diagnosis of sickle cell disease [homozygous sickle cell disease (hemoglobin SS disease), double heterozygous sickle hemoglobin C disease (hemoglobin SC disease) and the sickle ßthalassemias] and confirmed hemoglobin status by hemoglobin chromatography and electrophoresis (&lt;6S group) or electrophoresis (711S and 1223S groups). Free of any other known or suspected health problems (as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study), that would contraindicate the initiation of routine immunizations outside a clinical trial context Additional inclusion criteria for healthy children (&lt;6NS, 711NS and 1223NS groups): Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Children with negative diagnosis of sickle cell disease and confirmed hemoglobin status by hemoglobin chromatography and/or electrophoresis. Child in care Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of study vaccines and ending 30 days after. Locally recommended vaccines (recommended through the EPI program or through national immunization campaigns) for example inactivated influenza vaccine are always allowed, even if concomitantly administered with the study vaccines, but should be documented in the eCRF. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Previous vaccination or planned vaccination during the study with any pneumococcal vacccine. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Major congenital malformations. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period. Birth weight below 1500g. Serious chronic illness other than SCD. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be tympanic. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Additional exclusion criteria for children with SCD (&lt;6S, 711S and 1223S groups): • Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, (including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) other than SCD related conditions, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Additional exclusion criteria for healthy children (&lt;6 NS, 711NS and 1223NS groups): • Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).</criteria>
