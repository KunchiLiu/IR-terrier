	<brief_summary>The goal of this new translational project is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing school-based directly observed therapy of preventive asthma medications in a real-world setting, using state-of-the-art web-based technology for systematic screening, electronic report generation, and communication between nurses, caregivers, and primary care providers. With the use of a novel method to improve adherence and subsequently reduce morbidity, the investigators hypothesize that this novel adaptation of school-based asthma care will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school and community stakeholders, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). The investigators anticipate that enhancing preventive healthcare for young urban children with asthma through partnerships with the schools using a novel technology will yield improved health, prevention of suffering, decreased absenteeism from school, and reduced healthcare costs.</brief_summary>
