	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the change in blood carotene concentration between a food-based versus nutritional supplement-based intervention. This study will randomize up to 60 healthy volunteers to receive either carotenoid-enriched food; natural, mixed carotenoid supplementation; chlorophyll complex or placebo supplementation. Blood carotene levels will be measured before and after 28 days of supplementation. Preliminary data will also be collected on several biomarkers associated with vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. These biomarkers will be measured before and during a fast food control meal at the beginning and end of the intervention period.</brief_summary>
