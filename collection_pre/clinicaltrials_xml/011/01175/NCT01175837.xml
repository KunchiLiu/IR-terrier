	<brief_title>Short-Term Fasting Before Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and feasibility of short-term fasting prior to administration of chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate weight changes in patients who are exposed to short-term fasting prior to chemotherapy. II. Get a preliminary estimate of the longest feasible fasting period prior to chemotherapy. III. Evaluate the toxicity profile of systemic chemotherapy treatment in patients who undergo short-term fasting prior to treatment. IV. Investigate changes in plasma glucose, insulin, Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1binding proteins (BP) in patients who undertake short-term fasting. OUTLINE: COHORT I: Patients fast 24 hours before day 1 of course 2 of chemotherapy. If fast is well tolerated, patients may escalate fasting by 12 hours for each subsequent course of chemotherapy for up to 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. COHORT II: Patients fast at the longest fasting regimen found to be safe and tolerable in cohort I before day 1 of each course of course of chemotherapy for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
