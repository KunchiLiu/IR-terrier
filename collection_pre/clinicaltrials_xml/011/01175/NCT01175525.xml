	<brief_summary>Mastocytes were proven to have a central rule in their development of the lipoid plaque of the vascular system. Mastocytes also has an important role in the stabilisation of the plaque in the building of the brain barrier. Different animal studies show that the inhibition of the mastocyte activity decreases significantly the risk of secondary bleeding post ischaemic stroke.It was also shown that post stroke inflammation process was also blocked by the inhibition of mastocytes.Other studies showed up to 100% decrease in the brain barrier disruption and post stroke oedema, after treatment with mastocyte inhibitors. Cromolyn is a synthetic drug which has an anti-allergic effect by inhibition of the mastocytes. This drug is a well known,safe drug and is the main sub-substance that was used in the previously mentioned studies.</brief_summary>
