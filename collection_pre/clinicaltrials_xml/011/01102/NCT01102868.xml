	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to paresthesias, numbness and muscle weakness in the hand. Treatment of the condition often involves surgery. In this study we wish to se if there is an effect of using intramuscular stimulation (IMS) to release the tension of nervus medianus in the lower arm. The study will be performed by randomization to IMS of musculus pronator teres or a control ("Scam IMS treatment" to the acupuncture point Li11). The two insertion points are approximately 1cm apart in the lower arm.</brief_summary>
