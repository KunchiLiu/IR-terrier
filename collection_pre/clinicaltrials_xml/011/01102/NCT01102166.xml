	<brief_summary>Background: Devices used to facilitate mucus mobilization have been target of several controversies and mainly a few scientific studies that endorse the use of those equipments. According to the principle of acapella® device, it should be used concomitant with nebulization aiming to optimize its performance in bronchial hygiene. Aims: To assess the effect of acapella® device application in the radioaerosol regional pulmonary deposition through pulmonary scintigraphy in normal subjects. Materials and method: 10 health individuals, males and mean age of 24,4 ± 2,2 years participated in this study during the three phases of this research: 1st phase were done with nebulization through acapella® device, attached in the final branch according to manufacturer recommendation; in 2nd phase a ¨T¨tube connector were adapted, being nebulizer attached to the mouthpiece and in 3rd phase nebulization were performance through the mouthpiece as routinely used in aerosoltherapy.</brief_summary>
