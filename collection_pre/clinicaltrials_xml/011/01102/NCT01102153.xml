	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac death remains one of the major leading causes of death. Therapeutic hypothermia is a validated standard procedure to avoid or minimize cognitive deficits after cardiac arrest. To assess the efficiency of different cooling methods and further improve these methods, the investigators collected blood samples to measure the neuron specific enolase (NSE) in patients treated with invasive cooling as compared to patients treated with non-invasive cooling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) as Outcome Parameter of Cooling Therapy After Survived Sudden Cardiac Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation after resuscitation due to sudden cardiac death were randomized to either non-invasive or invasive cooling for at least 24 hours. NSE was collected at designated time points and compared between patients treated with invasive cooling and those treated with non-invasive cooling. Neurological outcome was assessed between groups at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge.</detailed_description>
