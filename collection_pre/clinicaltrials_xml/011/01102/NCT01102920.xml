	<brief_summary>The primary aim is to study whether a tailored behavioural medicine intervention addressing physical activity and eating habits have additional effects to continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) in patients with moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) combined with obesity. Direct everyday life consequences (see below) of OSAS are studied, as well as cognitive functions and ventilatory parameters. Long-term benefits will be examined in terms of quality of life and everyday life activity. Another aim is to study mechanisms of treatment effects, if any. The specific goals are: 1. To study changes in OSAS ventilatory parameters following a tailored behavioural medicine intervention addressing physical activity and eating habits (including CPAP) compared to regular CPAP-treatment 2. To study immediate and long-term effects on daytime sleepiness, attention and concentration, everyday life activity, quality of life following a tailored behavioural medicine intervention addressing physical activity and eating habits (including CPAP) compared to regular CPAP-treatment 3. To study associations of changes in metabolic parameters and systemic inflammation and physical activity level and adherence to CPAP-regimen respectively. 4. To identify mediators, moderators, and predictors of treatment effects, if any.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Life-style Changes in Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSAS is characterised by loud snoring, upper airway obstruction, and occasional apnea during sleep. OSAS may affect at least 4% of the men and 2% of the women in middle-age. In Sweden, prevalence figures of 200 000 have been reported. The mechanisms behind OSAS is not fully explained but functionally impaired upper airways muscles, causing a reduction in tonic and phasic contraction during sleep, are proposed one key explanation. The reduced contractions cause partial or complete occlusion of airflow, which in turn cause oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. Patients commonly report everyday life consequences including loud snoring, sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, reduced alertness and concentration, and involvement in motor vehicle accidents. Between 7% and 70% of patients suffer from depression and anxiety (figures vary extensively because of methodological differences in existing studies). Due to cardiovascular consequences, OSAS is also linked to hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Approximately 75% of patients with severe OSAS carry overweight. First line measures recommended for OSAS are conservative including lifestyle modifications, CPAP, and oral appliances. Current state-of-science concludes that CPAP is best possible evidence-based treatment. Despite the use of life style modification recommendations in terms of physical activity and weight loss in accepted guidelines of OSAS, randomised clinical trials supporting these recommendations are rare. Hence, the value of health behaviour modifications has yet to be established. Research within this area is therefore of major interest and urgency, which has motivated the present study design.</detailed_description>
