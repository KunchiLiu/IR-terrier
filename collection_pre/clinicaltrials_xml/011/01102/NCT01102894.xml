	<brief_summary>Research suggests dietary fiber may decrease transit time through the gastrointestinal tract. Research studies traditionally use radio-opaque markers to determine gastric emptying, colonic transit, and whole gut transit time. The SmartPill is a single use pill that can be used to determine gastric emptying, colonic transit, and whole gut transit time without requiring X-rays or fecal collections. Previous studies have found radio-opaque markers and the SmartPill detect the similar transit times. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if the SmartPill can detect a change in transit time using a significant dose of dietary fiber.</brief_summary>
