	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the effects of VATS lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The aims of this study are: 1. To evaluate the early clinical benefits of VATS lobectomy when compared with the axillary thoracotomy. 2. To evaluate the late effects of VATS lobectomy on survival and quality of life when compared with axillary thoracotomy. 3. To establish the normative pattern of VATS lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. 4. To explore the indication of VATS lobectomy for the lung cancer.</brief_summary>
