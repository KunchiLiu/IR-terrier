	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to conduct focus groups in order to adapt the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) so that it may successfully target women diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) who are at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes in the post-partum period. As this research seeks to gather formative data for a future intervention, the focus groups will: 1) provide information to maximize participation in the future intervention and 2) inform the location, content and format of the intervention. We will be conducting focus groups and informant interviews to determine the DPP modifications necessary for adapting to the post-partum lifestyles of women with a recent history of GDM. Subjects will attend a 1 hour focus group or phone interview where they will be encouraged to respond to the facilitators' questions and to each other's comments on topics such as: gestational diabetes, healthy eating, exercise, and other type 2 diabetes prevention related activities. Working with a variety of health care providers, including endocrinologists, obstetricians and nurse-practitioners, we will identify and enroll up to 60 women total who are either current GDM patients at BWH or have a recent history of GDM who have delivered at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the last 5 years.</brief_summary>
