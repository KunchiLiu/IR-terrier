	<brief_summary>Purpose: The main objective of this study is to determine endomicroscopic features of Crohn´s disease. Background: Crohn´s disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestines that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from anus to mouth, causing a wide variety of symptoms. Diagnosis is based on several histologic features including transmural pattern of inflammation, crypt abscesses and granulomas. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is rapidly emerging as a valuable tool for gastrointestinal endoscopic imaging, enabling the endoscopist to obtain an "optical biopsy" of the gastrointestinal mucosa during the endoscopic procedure. Scope: In patients with Crohn´s disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods: Patients underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of Crohn´s disease. During the endoscopic procedure CLE will be performed. Procedure: The patient underwent colonoscopy. During the procedure the patient will receive intravenous fluorescein or topical mucosal staining with acriflavin or cresyl violet, followed by in-vivo CLE of the tissue. Confocal images are digitally saved and analyzed afterwards.</detailed_description>
