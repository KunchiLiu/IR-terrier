	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a new live attenuated vaccine against whooping-cough. It is a phase1, single centre, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled study on a genetically modified B. pertussis strain given as a single intranasal dose to healthy adult male volunteers. Effective vaccines are needed to protect young infants (from 0 to 6 months, today the most vulnerable age group), preferably after a single administration very early in life. The successful outcome of this project would constitute an important milestone towards nasal vaccination of infants, possibly at birth with a novel, single-dose pertussis vaccine. Our ultimate aim is to protect infants in the most vulnerable age group, before the regular vaccination schedule using already available vaccines is applied. The ultimate aim is thus not to replace current vaccination schedules with available vaccines, but to add a first nasal vaccination to protect very early in life.</brief_summary>

Receipt of immunoglobulin, blood derived products, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant drugs within 90 days prior to day 0. Use of corticosteroids in the respiratory tract(e.g. nasal steroids, inhaled steroids) whitin 30 days prior to day 0. Use of herbal medications or dietary supplements within 7 days prior to day 0 at the discretion of the investigator. Unwillingness to refrain from herbal medications or dietary supplements within 30 days after day 0 at the discretion of the investigator. Receipt of a vaccine within the last 30 days prior to day 0 or planned vaccination within the next 30 days after day 0. Evolving encephalopathy not attributable to another identifiable cause within 7 days of administration of a previous dose of any vaccine. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccine. Current participation in any other clinical trial or participation (and during the whole study) in any clinical trial in the previous 3 months prior to day 0. Inability to adhere to the protocol, including plans to move from the area. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency (first degree). Infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C. Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.
