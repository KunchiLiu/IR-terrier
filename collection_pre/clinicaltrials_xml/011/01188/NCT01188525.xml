	<brief_summary>The study aims to descibe the pharmacokinetics of 10 substrates of enzymes involved in drug metabolism and their metabolites, after administration singly and simultaenously at predefined doses in 10 health volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study to Characterize Individual Metabolic Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to test the administration of combination of substrates and thereby to characterise simultaneously the main enzymes and transporters involved in drug metabolism. The doses of substrates administered will first assessed in terms of safety and their appropriateness for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. Ten volunteers will be used, this number having been defined in view of the aims of this proof-of-concept pilot study,ie,safety and determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. The number was not the result of statistical calculation.</detailed_description>
