	<brief_summary>Dextromethorphan has been reported affording neuroprotection on dopaminergic neurons and having protective effect against inflammation-related neuron damage. These anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of dextromethorphan would suggest potential clinical benefits of dextromethorphan add-on therapy to valproate for bipolar disorder patients. This hypothesis was based on the findings that the mood stabilizers have been reported to be neuroprotective through the release of neurotrophic factors such as GDNF from astroglia. Thus, the combination treatment of mood stabilizers and dextromethorphan might improve the therapeutic efficacy for bipolar disorder patients.</brief_summary>

Women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception as per investigator judgment or not willing to comply with contraception for duration of study. 2. Females who are pregnant or nursing. 3. Patient has received dextromethorphan, or other selective cyclo oxygenase 2 (Cox2) inhibitors, or other antiinflammatory medication within 1 week prior to first dose of doubleblind medication. 4. AxisI DSMIV diagnosis other than bipolar I or II disorder. 5. Current evidence of an uncontrolled and/or clinically significant medical condition (e.g., cardiac, hepatic and renal failure), which in the judgments of the investigator, would compromise patient safety or preclude study participation. 6. History of intolerance to valproate or dextromethorphan or other Cox2 inhibitors. 7. History of sensitivity reaction (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, severe rhinitis, anaphylactic shock) precipitated by dextromethorphan. 8. Patient has received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 4 weeks prior to first dose of doubleblind medication. 9. Diagnosis of or treatment for esophageal, gastric, pyloric channel, or duodenal ulceration or related complications (bleeding and/or perforation) within 30 days prior to receiving first dose of doubleblind medication. 10. Inclusion in another bipolar disorder study or study for another indication with psychotropic's within the last 30 days prior to start of study. 11. Increase in total SGOT, SGPT, BUN and creatinine by more than 3X ULN (upper limit of normal). 12. History of idiopathic or druginduced agranulocytosis. 13. Substancerelated disorders within 6 months prior to study start, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, or other major psychiatric disorders as defined by DSMIV criteria.</criteria>
