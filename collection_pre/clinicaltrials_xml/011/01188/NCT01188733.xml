	<brief_summary>Octreotide is used to control variceal bleeding. However, octreotide has to be given through the vein and is effective for less than two hours. In this study the investigators determined whether a long-acting preparation of octreotide (Sandostatin LAR)given as an intra-muscular injection every month could decrease portal pressure, and thus be used to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
