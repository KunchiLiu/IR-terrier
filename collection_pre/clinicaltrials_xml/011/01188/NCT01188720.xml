	<brief_summary>Preliminary findings from a trial in the investigators laboratory suggest that acute exercise may ameliorate deficits in sexual arousal associated with use of antidepressants. The goal of this project is to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of an exercise-based intervention for these side effects in a community-based sample. The investigators hypothesize that general exercise will help improve sexual functioning in women taking antidepressants, and that exercise immediately before sexual activity - that is, acute exercise - will have an additional beneficial effect above and beyond that of general exercise.</brief_summary>
