	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: 1. To determine whether a 4 week reduction in dietary fructose intake improves hepatic steatosis in overweight children who have a baseline high fructose consumption and hepatic steatosis. 2. To determine if a 4 week reduction of dietary fructose improves fasting plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids, very low-density lipoprotein, insulin and glucose as well as post-prandial levels in response to a high fructose meal. 3. To determine if a 4 week reduction of dietary fructose improves markers of oxidative stress. Study Design: A blinded randomized study comparing glucose beverages to isocaloric fructose beverages administered over 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
