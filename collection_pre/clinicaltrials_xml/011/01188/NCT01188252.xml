	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 1 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors, refractory to any standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or subjects must have actively refused any treatment which would be regarded standard, and / or if in the judgment of the investigator, experimental treatment is clinically and ethically acceptable At least 1 tumor lesion measurable by computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST 1.1 Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug History of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA Class II, unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), any episodes of angina or history of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted), previous venous or arterial thrombotic events, pulmonary embolism Moderate or severe hepatic impairment, i.e. ChildPugh class B or C(3) History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B or C Active clinically serious infections of CTCAE &gt; Grade 2 (CTCAE v4.02) Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt; 3 months from definitive therapy, has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study within 4 weeks prior to study entry, and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time of study entry. Subjects must not be on acute steroid therapy or taper off steroid therapy (chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for 4 weeks prior to study entry and following screening CT / MRI scan). Subjects with neurological symptoms should undergo a CT / MRI scan of the brain to exclude new or progressive brain metastases. Spinal cord metastasis is acceptable Seizure disorder requiring therapy (such as steroids or antiepileptics) History of organ allograft Evidence or history of bleeding disorder, i.e. any hemorrhage / bleeding event of CTCAE &gt; Grade 2 within 4 weeks prior to prior to the first dose of study drug</criteria>
