	<brief_title>Treatment With Second Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (2G TKI) Post Imatinib Failure Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historic cohort prolonged by a 12-month follow-up period. Prospective: look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following subject enrollment: one year of follow up of patients with CP-CML alive at the time of the study. Retrospective: look back using observations collected predominantly prior to subject selection and enrollment : historical data of patients with CP-CML initiated with a 2G TKIs post-imatinib failure (resistance or intolerance) between 1-Jan-2005 and 30-June-2009. The inclusion of a historical cohort will allow a rapid enrollment of a large number of patients of this rare pathology, while the prospective follow up of this cohort would allow long term data to be obtained, including the assessment of the impact on survival and appreciate the patient's quality of life (QoL), compliance and satisfaction.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with Additional Chromosomal Anomalies (ACA) are accepted to be in CP. Patients enrolled in openlabel clinical trials or other observational trials are also allowed (unless explicitly prohibited by the trial). This trial does not prohibit participation in other observational trials. Patients diagnosed with CPCML. (ACA) are allowed Age &gt;18 years old Prior treatment with imatinib monotherapy as first line treatment, to which the patient is deemed resistant or intolerant.Patients treated by INF and/or AraC prior (but not concomitant) to imatinib are eligible. Initiated with a 2G TKIs postimatinib failure (resistance or intolerance) between 1Jan2005 and 30Jun2009. Patients in (or with history of) accelerated or blastic phase CML Patients treated by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Any other CML treatment except for INF and/or AraC,and a short period of Hydroxyurea or Anagrelide prior to imatinib. Patients treated with 2G TKI for reasons other than imatinib failure. Patients with no historical data (e.g. possibility of Sokal Score calculation) available. Patients participating in clinical or observational trials which explicitly prohibit enrollment in non interventional studies.</criteria>
