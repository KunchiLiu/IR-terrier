	<detailed_description>The study will focus on the number of patients moving to persistent Atrial Fibrillation as a function of cumulative %Vp (&lt; or &gt;40%), in a general dual-chamber pacemaker population through a 2 year follow-up (n=2188). The same endpoint will be analyzed in sub populations (Sinus Node Disease and AVB) at 4 years follow up (n=4290).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient implanted (primoimplant, replacement, upgrade) with dual chamber pacemaker from less than two months or implanted at inclusion. Contraindicated for cardiac pacing, according to the ESC and ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines Permanent or persistent atrial tachyarrhythmia</criteria>
