	<brief_summary>The present trial will establish a prospective sequential Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-SCT) treatment combining both salvage chemotherapy and Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) for primary treatment failure Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), to which future innovative strategies can be compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine/Ara-C Treatment Combined With Reduced-intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Primary Treatment Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: To improve the 2 year overall survival in patients with primary treatment failure * Secondary Endpoints: - Feasibility of early transplantation within a multicenter trial - Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years from transplantation - Leukemia Response rate at day +30, +90 and 6 months - Cumulative incidence of relapse, death from leukemia, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) - Incidence and severity of acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host disease - Feasibility and safety of early discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy</detailed_description>
