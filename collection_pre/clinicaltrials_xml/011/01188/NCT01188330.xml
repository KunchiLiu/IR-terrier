	<brief_summary>Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 65. A poor outcome in this population has been well established, with very short overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS).There are numerous bad prognostic factors related to the disease itself or to the patient's medical condition. This study will evaluate the impact of a Comprehensive Geriatric assessment (CGA) performed at diagnosis with planned interventions according to disabilities and monthly follow-up by a nurse practitioner during 6 months on functional status of older cancer patients treated for Acute myeloid leukaemia. Functional status will be assessed with the Lawson Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale at diagnosis and 6 months after randomisation.</brief_summary>
