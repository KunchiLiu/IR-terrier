	<brief_summary>The goal of this cohort study is to evaluate the safety and potential impact of an active strategy that allows paramedics to assess very low-risk trauma patients with the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) and transport them to the Emergency Department without immobilization. The specific objectives of the study are to determine safety, determine the clinical impact and evaluate performance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>consecutive alert, stable adults evaluated by the paramedics with potential cspine injury after sustaining acute blunt trauma. Patient eligibility will be determined at the time of paramedic arrival at the scene based on the following criteria: "Potential cspine injury after sustaining acute blunt trauma" will include patients with either: neck pain with any mechanism of injury (subjective complaint by the patient of any pain in the posterior aspect of the neck), no neck pain but some visible injury above the clavicles, and/or neither neck pain nor visible injury, but significant mechanism of injury as determined by the paramedic at the scene. "Alert" is defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 (converses, fully oriented, and follows commands). "Stable" refers to normal vital signs(systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater and respiratory rate between 10 and 24 breaths per minute). "Acute" refers to injury within the past 4 hours. Patients under the age of 16 years, Patients with penetrating trauma from stabbing or gunshot wound, Patients with acute paralysis (paraplegia, quadriplegia), Patients with known vertebral disease (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal stenosis, or previous cervical spine surgery), or Patients referred from another hospital and transported between facilities.</criteria>
