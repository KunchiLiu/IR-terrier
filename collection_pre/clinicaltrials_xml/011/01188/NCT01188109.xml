	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if the investigators can use a specific marker in the pancreatic tumor itself to determine which patients will benefit from receiving combination chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin after undergoing resection of a pancreatic cancer. The investigators will also investigate if there is any benefit to receiving both chemotherapy drugs as opposed to only gemcitabine after undergoing complete resection of the tumor.</brief_summary>
