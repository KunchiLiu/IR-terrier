	<brief_summary>The objective of the first part of the study is to determine a safe dose of TRU-016 that can be used in combination with bendamustine in patients with relapsed CLL. The objectives of the second part of the study are to compare the safety and efficacy of TRU-016 in combination with bendamustine to bendamustine alone in patients with relapsed CLL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of TRU-016 Plus Bendamustine vs. Bendamustine in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of two parts. The initial dose escalation stage was a Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and tolerability of two doses of TRU-016 administered in combination with bendamustine to patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the randomized Phase 2 stage of the study, the efficacy and safety of the selected dose of 20 mg/kg TRU-016 combined with bendamustine was compared to bendamustine alone. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TRU-016 and the development of antibodies to TRU-016 were evaluated in both phases of the study.</detailed_description>
