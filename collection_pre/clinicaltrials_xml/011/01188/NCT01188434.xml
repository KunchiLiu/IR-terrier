	<brief_summary>This Research Plan proposes Stage 1 Research integrating evidence based practices to address the needs of mothers referred to child welfare for substance abuse. Mothers with a history of methamphetamine abuse and child neglect will be recruited. Using an intensive community based treatment, mothers will receive substance abuse treatment combined with parenting skills training and psychosocial support for basic needs (e.g., housing, employment). This project will include a feasibility study (n = 5), followed by a small randomized pilot (n = 24) to examine the efficacy of the Integrated Treatment for Substance Abuse and Neglect compared to treatment as usual, with a population of substance abusing neglectful mothers referred through the Department of Child Welfare.</brief_summary>
