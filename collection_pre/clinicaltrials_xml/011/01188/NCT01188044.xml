	<brief_summary>One way to assess impacts of nutrition supplements to health is to measure physical activity. Physical activity can be measured with small devices called "accelerometers". Before they can be used, the devices need to be validated in the population in question. Objectives of this study are to test accelerometers in field conditions and validate their use in 16-18 months old Malawian toddlers. This study does not have a pre-set hypothesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validating Accelerometers to Study Physical Activity of Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accelerometers have not been validated in children under 2 years of age. In this study 50 toddlers from Lungwena will be recruited. The participants will wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ -accelerometer fitted on their waist with an elastic belt for 7 days. During the measuring, they will have two videotaped one-hour activity observations while wearing and additional accelerometer device fitted on their ankle. The output from the two devices will be compared to observed activity classified with CPAF-method.</detailed_description>
