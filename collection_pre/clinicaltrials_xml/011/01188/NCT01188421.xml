	<brief_summary>This is a study of tramadol as an agent for short-term opioid withdrawal treatment. A randomized, double blind clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tramadol to clonidine and buprenorphine in the short-term treatment of opioid withdrawal will be conducted. Opioid dependent participants will be treated on a residential unit. The primary outcome measure is opioid withdrawal symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion/ Participants in this study will be males and females between the ages of 18 and 60 years. Applicants must be opioid dependent based upon the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV (SCID); in addition, they must have an opioid positive urine during the screening process (or have evidence of opioid withdrawal). They must be healthy, with no significant medical illnesses (e.g., insulin dependent diabetes), and without significant psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia) besides their drug dependence. Females will have a pregnancy test prior to study enrollment, and if found to be pregnant will be excluded and referred to a substance abuse program for pregnant women (the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy) on the campus. Volunteers will also be excluded if they have preadmission hypotension (due to the use of clonidine in the study). Applicants with a history of seizures (including substancerelated seizures, such as alcohol withdrawal related) will be excluded. Alcohol and/or sedative dependence will be specific exclusionary criteria (given the small risk of seizures associated with tramadol use). Allergies to any of the study medications will be grounds for exclusion.</criteria>
