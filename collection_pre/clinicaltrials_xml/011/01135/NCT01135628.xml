	<brief_summary>Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious complication of cirrhosis which relays under the burden of diseases with therapeutical difficulties for its given morbidity and mortality and the high recurrence it poses. Its treatment remains a challenge for most of the cases. Even more, minimal hepatic encephalopathy is an entity that has an additional morbidity for it being a subclinical entity. As so, the investigators propose an auxiliary treatment for the management of such patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy, using a specific diet consisting on hyperproteic and fibre-rich foods along with two independent interventions, whether a probiotic, lactobacillus reuteri, or a drug, nitozoxanide, so to diminish the rate of progression to any clinical stage of hepatic encephalopathy and to revert minimal hepatic encephalopathy itself to none hepatic encephalopathy.</brief_summary>
