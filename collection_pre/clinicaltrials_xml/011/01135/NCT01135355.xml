	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to determine whether a clinically relevant laboratory measurement (of seven specific immunologic biochemicals in the blood) can identify which bone marrow transplant recipients are likely to progress to respiratory failure. Our ultimate goal is to devise a comprehensive and inclusive laboratory test that is effective at determining who is likely to go on to respiratory failure, in order to facilitate early medical intervention.</brief_summary>
