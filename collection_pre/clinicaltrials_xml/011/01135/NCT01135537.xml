	<brief_summary>This study will describe the pharmacokinetic disposition of biologically active rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) after a consistent dose of 7.5 mg/kg/course given as part of the conditioning regimen in children undergoing hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Thymoglobulin in Paediatric Haematopoietic Stem-cell Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a therapeutic option for patients with malignancies as well as metabolic and genetic diseases. Conditioning regimens given prior to donor cell infusion aim to ablate the recipient bone-marrow, to allow engraftment of the stem-cells infused, and to prevent acute versus host disease (aGVHD). Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is one of the immunosuppressive drugs given as a preparative regimen for HSCT. Subjects will be given an ATG infusion daily for 3 days prior to HSCT and serum levels will be collected, as per schedule, with the last sample taken +100 days post-HSCT.</detailed_description>
