	<brief_summary>The adrenal glands are one of the most common organs involved in metastatic disease. Metastases are the second most common type of adrenal mass, second only to adenomas. It is a frequent finding during autopsy with a reported rate as high as 27% in patients with known primary malignancy. Although several studies have found an increased survival in patients who undergo resection of solitary adrenal metastases the indications for adrenalectomy in cases of metastatic adrenal tumor remain controversial. Collinson et al reported an increased survival in patients with melanoma. Median survival was 16 months for patients who underwent adrenalectomy compared to 5 months for patients with documented adrenal metastases treated non surgically. The aim of this study is to compare retrospectively in case and control study, performing adrenalectomy, open or laparoscopic, versus supportive treatment for patients with solitary adrenal gland metastases. The investigators will review charts of patients between January 1994 and November 2009 who had adrenal gland metastases. The variables the inevstigators will compare are mortality, morbidity, primary tumour sites, histological cell type, age, tumour size, presence of synchronous metastases, mean time from diagnosis of primary tumor to treatment of adrenal metastases, indication for adrenalectomy, partial versus total adrenalectomy, suspected versus confirmed metastatic disease.</brief_summary>
