	<brief_summary>Primary objective was to evaluate the effects of dronedarone on Atrial Fibrillation (AF) burden (i.e. percent time in AF) as measured on electrogram (EGM) in subjects with a permanent pacemaker. Secondary objectives were to evaluate: - the effects of dronedarone on AF pattern characteristics i.e. ventricular rate during AF; - the effects of dronedarone on subject-perceived AF burden and symptom severity as reported by subjects using the Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS); - the incidence of electrical cardioversion (or overdrive pacing) during treatment; - the safety of dronedarone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The maximum duration of the study period for a participant was 18 weeks (approximatively 4.5 months) including up to 4 weeks screening, 12-week Treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up of 2 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Paroxysmal AF or atrial flutter (AFL) documented by evidence of AF/AFL and sinus rhythm within the prior 6 months; AF burden ≥1% on pacemaker EGM interrogation at screening, with at least one episode of AF within the previous 28 days; Programmable dual chamber pacemaker with lead placement no less than 3 months before screening, a minimum capability of storing 3 months or more of EGM data, and an expected remaining battery life of 1 year or more. Exclusion criteria: AF burden &lt;1% on pacemaker EGM interrogation at screening; None of the following cardiovascular risk factors: Age ≥70 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular accident or systemic embolism, left atrium diameter ≥50 mm by Mmode or 2D echocardiography, or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤0.40 by Mmode or 2D echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or nuclear cardiac imaging; Permanent AF; Evidence of persistent AF (continuous AF activity lasting longer than 7 days); Electrical cardioversion (or overdrive pacing) within 4 weeks prior to screening; Cardiac ablation procedure within 3 months prior to screening; Evidence of uncorrected atrial undersensing or oversensing documented in routine pacemaker evaluation at screening; Pacemaker programming requirements for the study not clinically feasible, contraindicated, or could have posed risk; Ongoing potentially dangerous symptoms when in AF/AFL such as angina pectoris, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or syncope; New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure or NYHA Class II or III heart failure with a recent decompensation requiring hospitalization or referral to a specialized heart failure clinic within 4 weeks prior to screening; Evidence of clinical instability including hypotension, unstable angina and hemodynamically significant obstructive valvular disease, hemodynamically significant obstructive cardiomyopathy, a cardiac operation, or revascularization procedure within 4 weeks prior to screening; Noncardiovascular illness or disorder that could have precluded participation or severely limit survival including cancer with metastasis and organ transplantation requiring immune suppression; Planned noncardiac or cardiac surgery or procedures including surgery for valvular heart disease, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac transplantation or electrical cardioversion for AF/AFL; Need for concomitant medication that were prohibited in this trial: Antiarrhythmics, drugs or products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP3A inducers; Chronic use of amiodarone within the 4 weeks prior to screening; Use of Class I or Class III antiarrhythmics (other than amiodarone) within 5half lives prior to screening; Use of St John's wort, grapefruit juice, or drugs that prolong the QT interval and might have increased the risk of torsade de pointes; Inability or unwillingness to comply with oral anticoagulation therapy, if indicated; Bazett corrected QT interval interval ≥500 msec at screening (if in sinus rhythm); Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100mmHg) at screening; Uncorrected hypokalemia (serum potassium &lt;3.5 mEq/L) Severe hepatic impairment (ie, ChildPugh Class C), abnormal liver function test defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin &gt;2 X upper limit of normal (ULN), or renal impairment defined as serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL at screening; Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (documented history of HbA1c &gt;10% at the most recent assessment prior to screening); Pregnant woman or woman of childbearing potential not on adequate birth control; Breastfeeding woman; Previous (within 2 months prior to screening) or current participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug (under development) or investigational device.
