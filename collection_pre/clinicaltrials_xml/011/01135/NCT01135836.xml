	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery is becoming a major procedure, owing to smaller incisions, shorter hospitalizations, and less post-operative pain as compared with traditional laparotomies. However, there is marked interindividual variability of post-operative shoulder-tip pain following laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of shoulder pain varies from 35% to 80% and ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, it has been reported to last more than 72 hours after surgery. The hypothesis of post-operative shoulder-tip pain is that carbon dioxide induced phrenic nerve irritation causes referred pain to C4. Therefore, the investigators should try to reduce carbon dioxide retention in the pelvic cavity.</brief_summary>
