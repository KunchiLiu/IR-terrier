	<brief_title>The Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan in Patients With Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, Candesartan controlled, parallel group comparison clinical study to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of Fimasartan in patients with mild to moderate hypertension Approximately 288 patients will be enrolled in 10 centers in South Korea. This study has planned 5 visits during 14 weeks (placebo run-in period 2 weeks, treatment period 12 weeks). All of the subjects who agreed to participate in this study and gave the written informed consent voluntary are assessed the exclusion and inclusion criteria and receive the investigational product(placebo) at screening visit. During more than 14 days of placebo run-in period, subjects have to stop the previous anti-hypertension drug. After 2 weeks, subjects are assessed the final eligibility and randomized into one of 3 groups(Fimasartan 60mg, Fimasartan 120mg, Candesartan 8mg) at baseline visit. Subjects take physical and laboratory tests and receive the investigational products per 4weeks during treatment period (12weeks).</detailed_description>
