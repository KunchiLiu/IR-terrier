	<brief_title>Study of MIGRA-ZEN RELIEF PLUS In the Treatment of Chronic Migraine Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this 90-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy of an all-natural herbal dietary supplement product, (Investigational Product, or IP), with respect to alleviating and/or stopping migraine headache pain compared to a placebo when used prophylactically every day, and to evaluate the safety/risk of its use by observing the absence/presence of adverse event (AE/SAE) reports and the normalcy of blood work, urinalysis, and liver enzyme tests. The primary end-point is the time-course and depth of the frequency reduction of migraine attacks. The secondary end-points will be the absence/presence of detectable adverse liver function and urinalysis test results as well as the dearth/abundance of AE/SAE reports that may indicate patient safety/risk when using the IP.</detailed_description>
