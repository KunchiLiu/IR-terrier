	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD PMCF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts or images (obsessions), which increase anxiety, commonly accompanied by repetitive or ritualistic actions (compulsions), which decrease anxiety. The most frequent symptoms are contamination concerns with consequent washing or concerns about harm to self or others with consequent checking. Although many OCD patients benefit from pharmacotherapy or CBT, between 7% and 10% of OCD patients fail to benefit from these standard treatments and may be considered treatment-resistant with a chronic deteriorating course. The most severely afflicted and disabled of these patients may be indicated for neurosurgical treatments, often considered as a therapy of last resort. Neurosurgical procedures currently used in the treatment of severe, treatment-resistant OCD include anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy (which is a combination of the first two procedures) and anterior capsulotomy. The commonality between the different neurosurgical procedures is the irreversible lesioning of bilateral neuroanatomical structures and/or interconnecting pathways that are believed to be involved in the control of affect and limbic function. An alternative neurosurgical treatment option to the standard lesioning procedures is Reclaim® Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Therapy for OCD, which received CE mark in July 2009.</detailed_description>
