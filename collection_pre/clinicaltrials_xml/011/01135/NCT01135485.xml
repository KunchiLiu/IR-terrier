	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether children and adolescents 8-18 years of age with HLHS and related lesions who have undergone stage I palliation during infancy using an allograft patch demonstrate continued evidence of HLA antibody formation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Panel Reactive Antibody in Children Following Stage I Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be of a prospective cross-sectional design, consisting of three groups. The first two groups (study groups) will consist of (1) subjects with HLHS and other related lesions who have undergone stage I palliation using an allograft patch during infancy and (2) subjects with "single ventricle" lesions who have undergone stage II palliation using allograft without antecedent stage I palliation. The third group (control group) will consist of subjects who have undergone corrective or palliative surgery for CHD during infancy in which an allograft patch was not used, and in which there have been no further exposures to allograft. We have chosen to study both (1) subjects who have undergone stage I and II palliation and (2)subjects who have undergone stage II palliation only in an attempt to distinguish between sensitization that may occur from allograft exposure during stage I palliation and that which may occur during stage II palliation.</detailed_description>
