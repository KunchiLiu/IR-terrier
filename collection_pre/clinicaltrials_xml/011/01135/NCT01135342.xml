	<brief_title>Adding Sleep Intervention to Traditional Diet and Exercise Approach to Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major purpose of this study is to examine the effect of sleep quality and quantity on weight loss. The outcomes being studied are weight loss and improved sleep. The subjects being studied are those with body mass index 28-40kg/m2 who report sleeping less than 6.5 hours per day for 4 day per week or more for the past 6 months or longer and would likely benefit the most from the sleep intervention should it prove to be effective. We hope to learn if improved sleep habits among overweight adults with insomnia will help them to adhere to a diet and exercise program and increase their success with weight loss. Given the current world-wide obesity epidemic and the established difficulties many people have with weight control, any approaches that can be demonstrated to contribute to successful weight loss have direct public health significance.</detailed_description>
