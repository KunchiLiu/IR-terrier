	<brief_summary>Arm 1: Primary Objective: • To determine the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending, supratherapeutic doses of HPN-100. Arm 2: Primary Objective: • To assess the effects of steady-state levels of HPN-100 metabolites (4 phenylbutyric acid [PBA], phenylacetic acid [PAA], and phenylacetylglutamine [PAGN]) on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in healthy male and female subjects with the primary endpoint being the time-matched change from baseline in the QT interval corrected for heart rate (HR) based on an individual correction method (QTcI).</brief_summary>
