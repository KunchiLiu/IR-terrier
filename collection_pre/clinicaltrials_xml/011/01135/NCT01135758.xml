	<brief_summary>Targeting the glutamatergic system to treat depression is a new and promising strategy based on studies at the molecular, synaptic, and neuronal level but also on results of studies conducted in animal models and first clinical studies involving depressed patients.Ketamine has been proposed as a novel approach to induce rapid antidepressant response. In this pilot project the investigators aim to introduce this novel and promising approach into clinical practice. Besides the assessment of clinical efficacy, the investigators will put a special emphasis on the assessment of ketamine-associated effects on brain function using fMRI and cognitive testing.</brief_summary>
