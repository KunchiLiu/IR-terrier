	<brief_title>Impact of KUVAN速 on Gastric Relaxation in Women With Diabetic Gastroparesis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are invited to participate in a research study of Kuvan速 (sapropterin dihydrochloride). We hope to learn whether treatment with Kuvan速 is safe and effective in improving the ability of the stomach to relax after eating and improving the symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis. Women are selected as a possible participant in this study because they have diabetes and moderate to severe gastroparesis (meaning stomach empties slowly).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients with moderate to severe symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis will be studied (GCSI &gt;21).

In order to qualify for inclusion in the trial, patients must satisfy the following inclusion criteria: 1. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus &gt; 5 years requiring medical therapy 2. Female gender 3. Ages 1865 years 4. Documentation of delayed gastric emptying on gastric emptying scintigraphy (within 2 years of enrollment) 5. Symptoms of gastroparesis for at least 6 months with Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score &gt; 21 indicating moderate to severe symptoms 6. Recent negative upper endoscopy or upper GI series within 2 years of enrollment (no evidence of mechanical obstruction or peptic ulcer disease) Exclusion Criteria Patients who satisfy any of the following exclusion criteria will be ineligible for enrollment in the study: 1. Diabetes diagnosed &lt; 5 years prior to the study 2. Male gender 3. Normal gastric emptying 4. Gastroparesis from postsurgical etiologies 5. Another active disorder, which could explain symptoms in the opinion of the investigator 6. Pregnancy 7. History of significant cardiac arrhythmias and/or prolonged QTc 8. Daily use of narcotic analgesics for abdominal pain 9. Contraindications to gastric emptying breath test: patients with a known allergy to egg, wheat, or algae. 10. Underlying seizure disorder 11. Known history of cardiac ischemia 12. Recent clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding 13. Patients taking Levodopa 14. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would impede compliance or hinder the completion of the study 15. Failure to give informed consent 16. Surgery for placement of a gastric stimulator within the past 6 months (patients &gt; 6 months postop with persistent symptoms and delayed gastric emptying are eligible). 17. A normal upper endoscopy not performed within 2 year of study entry. 18. Patients taking phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil 19. Patients with renal impairment (i.e. Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) 20. Patients with hepatic dysfunction (i.e. ALT and AST values &gt; 2.5x ULN and T. bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN) 21. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, such as HbA1c &gt; 10 mg/dl at screening/baseline will be excluded.</criteria>
