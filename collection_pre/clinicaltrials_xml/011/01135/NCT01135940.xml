	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, Phase II (hypothesis generating) randomized pilot study investigating the efficacy of using Dermabond as a method of final wound closure as compared to the standard staple method in children with Neuromuscular Scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Dermabond Versus Standard Staple for Wound Closure in Children With Neuromuscular Scoliosis Undergoing Spinal Deformity Correction Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To explore whether there is a difference in the incidence of wound infection in the Dermabond group vs. the skin staple group as measured by microbiological culture four days post-operatively. Wound infection is defined as prolonged sterile discharge (&gt;4 days), positive wound cultures, or cellulitis four or more days post-operatively. 2. To explore whether there is a difference in the cosmetic result of the wound closure as measured by the Hollander wound evaluation scale. Our hypothesis is that the Dermabond group will have a better cosmetic result. Secondary outcome 3. To explore whether there is a difference in the time for final wound closure. Our hypothesis is that the Dermabond group will have a shorter time for final wound closure. Secondary outcome 4. To explore whether there is a difference in mean caregiver/parental satisfaction scores as measured by a visual analog scale. Our hypothesis is that parental satisfaction will be higher in the Dermabond group. Secondary outcome</detailed_description>
