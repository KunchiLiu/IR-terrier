	<brief_title>Effects of Oral Midazolam in Comparison Promethazine With Nitrous Oxide for Uncooperative Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of oral midazolam in pediatric dentistry is controversial. Usefulness of midazolam alone is limited to short-duration procedures, and we are needed to identify safe oral conscious regiments which permit longer duration procedures in dental treatments especially in Pediatric dentistry. Promethazine is a long-acting (4-12 hr) anti-histaminic, H1 antagonist drug which acts as a central nervous system depressant and showing itself to be a weak anxiolytic drug. The hypothesis to be tested is whether promethazine would improve the patients behavior during dental procedures without affecting vital signs, thus enabling longer periods of moderate or conscious sedation.</detailed_description>
