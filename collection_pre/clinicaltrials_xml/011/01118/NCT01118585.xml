	<brief_title>Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF) Registry Study for Treatment of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: Typical and atypical GERD symptom elimination (scores ≤ 2 to each question) or clinically significant improvement (≥ 50% reduction in total scores) at 6-month follow-up compared to baseline. Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints: GERD symptom elimination or clinically significant improvement at 12-month follow-up, 24-month follow-up and 36-month follow-up; complete discontinuation of PPIs; normalization of esophageal acid exposure; significant reduction in reflux episodes; healing of reflux esophagitis; reduction of hiatal hernia; safety supported by low incidence of serious adverse events.</detailed_description>
