	<brief_summary>Distal radius fractures (DRF) are the most common type of fracture in the human body, and a large proportion of DRFs result in complications. Previously proposed preventive strategies have questionable efficacy and may impose additional risks on the patient. Because many complications secondary to distal radius fractures are associated with excessive swelling, a prophylactic means for edema reduction could dramatically reduce morbidity among this population. A compression glove is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological way to reduce edema. Previous studies have confirmed its utility in edema reduction after hand trauma and among patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, but none have sufficiently investigated the application to patients with distal radius fractures, a population in which this intervention could have a large impact. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate use of a compression glove during recovery among patients who have sustained an unstable distal radius fracture. The investigators hypothesize that patients who wear a compression glove after a distal radius fracture: - Will experience less edema - Will demonstrate greater functionality - Will recover more quickly - Will have lower incidence rates of carpal tunnel syndrome - Will have lower incidence rates of complex regional pain syndrome</brief_summary>
