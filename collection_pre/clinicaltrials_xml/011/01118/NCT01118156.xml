	<detailed_description>In recent years, suicide prevention has received increased focus within the VA. This is in part related to concerns regarding the mental health and associated suicide risk of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom military personnel, and a recent study highlighting the increased risk of death by suicide for members of the veteran population. Suicide prevention initiatives could be greatly enhanced if a clinically feasible uniform language regarding suicidality and self-injury was readily available and adopted throughout the VA system. With this goal in mind, the Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS) and Clinical Tool were developed based upon the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nomenclature and VA VISN-19 MIRECC's work in this area. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new standardized language for categorizing suicidal and self-injury related thoughts and behaviors can be readily adopted for use by mental health clinicians. Efforts also include developing a measure that can be used to help clinicians identify appropriate terms (e.g., behaviors) for specific patients.</detailed_description>
