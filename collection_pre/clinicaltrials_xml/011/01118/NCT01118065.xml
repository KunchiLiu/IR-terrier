	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the efficacy of everolimus in patients with progressive or recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Secondary - To determine maximum percentage of tumor reduction in these patients. - To describe activity time to event endpoints. - To assess toxicity. - To determine evolution of serum thyroglobulin. - To perform explorative pharmacogenomic, pharmacokinetic, and translational studies. (exploratory) - To investigate efficacy of everolimus in patients with progressive or recurrent, unresectable or metastatic disease of undifferentiated (anaplastic) or medullary thyroid cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
