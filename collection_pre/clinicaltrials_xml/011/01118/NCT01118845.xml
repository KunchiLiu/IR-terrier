	<brief_title>Study of SyB L-0501 in Combination With Rituximab to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective is to determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate on the basis of Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, of SyB L-0501 at 120 mg/m^2/day on day2 and 3 in combination with rituximab at 375 mg/m^2 on day 1 of each 21-day cycle in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
