	<detailed_description>PURPOSE: To investigate whether genotypic differences can be identified between MS patients who develop liver injury compared to those who do not develop injury in response to beta-interferon therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elevated liver enzyme tests (ALT &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal) in response to beta-interferon therapy in MS patients is associated with genetic polymorphisms. METHOD OF RECRUITMENT: Patients will be identified through a clinic database and chart reviews. An introductory letter will be mailed to potential participants, inviting them to volunteer. A follow-up phone call will be made to determine interest and consent into study. PROCEDURES: Saliva will be collected for genetic analyses and a questionnaire will be administered</detailed_description>
