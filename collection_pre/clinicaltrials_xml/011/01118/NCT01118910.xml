	<brief_title>Open-Label Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Vusion Ointment for the Treatment of Intertrigo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intertrigo is an inflammatory condition of skin folds, induced or aggravated by heat, moisture, maceration, friction, or lack of air circulation. It is typically chronic with insidious onset of itching, burning, and stinging within the affected skin folds. Intertrigo frequently worsened or colonized by infection, which most commonly is candidal but also may be bacterial, fungal, or viral. The etiology of diaper dermatitis shows significant overlap with that of intertrigo. Vusion ointment, a highly effective treatment for diaper dermatitis, has been used by physicians for the treatment of intertrigo; however, there is a paucity of data in the literature regarding the use of Vusion ointment in this indication. This study is the first to formally investigate the efficacy and safety of Vusion ointment for the treatment of intertrigo.</detailed_description>
