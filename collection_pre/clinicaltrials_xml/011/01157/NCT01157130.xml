	<brief_summary>The proposed study compares the outcomes of a physical activity intervention begun at diagnosis, continuing through active cancer treatment and into six months of survivorship compared to the outcomes of a control group receiving limited information on activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Patients: A Breast Cancer Rehabilitation and Exercise Laboratory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients (with stage 0 to stage III breast cancer)receiving chemotherapy, radiation or both chemotherapy and radiation will be included in the study.Randomization will be stratified by disease stage at diagnosis, treatment modalities planned, and hormonal status. Each patient will have a weekly goal of 2000 calories burned and 18 MET-hours of exercise which can be achieved in 4 to 7 hours of physical activity per week. Resistance training, using weight machines and aerobic training using treadmills, elliptical trainers and stationary bicycles, will be utilized in the intervention group. The control group will receive basic information on physical activity but not be instructed. Any physical activity in this group will be self-reported. Change in C-reactive protein will be the primary endpoint. Changes in other laboratory values, DEXA measurements, and quality of life measurements will be secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>
