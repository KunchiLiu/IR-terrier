	<brief_summary>Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a uremic toxin that accelerates the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). AST-120 (KremezinÂ®; Kureha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) removes indole, which is the precursor of IS, in the intestine, and reduces the accumulation of IS. This drug has been shown to retard the deterioration of renal function in CKD patients through reducing the levels of IS. IS was reported to promote aortic calcification and stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). IS also inhibits endothelial proliferation and wound repair. With this background, the investigators will performed the study whether AST-120 improve the endothelial dysfunction in CKD patients.</brief_summary>
