	<brief_summary>The methacetin breath test (MBT) is a non-invasive liver function test which measures the ability of the liver to metabolize a tracer dose of a compound to carbon dioxide, which is exhaled. The study hypothesis is that measurement of the MBT will allow earlier detection of a decline in liver function in patients with cirrhosis who are awaiting liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
