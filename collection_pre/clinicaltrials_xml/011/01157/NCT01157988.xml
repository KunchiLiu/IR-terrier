	<brief_title>90Y-ibritumomab Tiuxetan Consolidation After 6th R-CHOP Chemotherapy in Patients With Bulky Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with limited-stage, bulky diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are known to have a poor prognosis as like to those with advanced disease. However, there are very limited studies to compare the clinical outcome of therapy after chemotherapy only with combined modality using radiation. Defining local failure at bulky sites as one component of relapse, radioimmuotherapy appears to reduce the failure rates at previous bulky sites. We assessed the clinical efficacy and toxicity of 6th R-CHOP chemotherapy and followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) consolidation in patients with limited-stage, bulky DLBCL.</detailed_description>
