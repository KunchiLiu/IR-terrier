	<brief_summary>Constraint-Induced Movement therapy, also known as CI therapy, is an approach to physical rehabilitation derived from basic behavioral and neuroscience research. It has been shown to be efficacious for rehabilitating use of the more-affected arm in individuals more than one year after stroke with mild to moderate motor impairment. The first component of the therapy is intensive training in use of the more-affected arm on functional tasks for 3 hours daily for 10 consecutive weekdays. The second is wearing a protective safety mitt on the less-affected hand for all waking hours of the approximately 2-week treatment period that it is safe to do so. The purpose of the mitt is to discourage use of the less-affected arm. The third is a group of behavioral techniques designed to transfer gains from the treatment setting to the real world, which takes a therapist, on average, 30 minutes to implement on each treatment day. The purpose of this project is to develop and test a method for automating the delivery of this efficacious treatment in a way that the therapy can be provided in stroke patients' homes. After developing an automated CI therapy workstation that has tele-health capabilities, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether CI therapy delivered in the home using this workstation with remote supervision by a therapist via an Internet-based audiovisual link provides outcomes that are just as good as CI therapy delivered by a "live" therapist.</brief_summary>
