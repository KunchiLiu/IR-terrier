	<brief_summary>Patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction have a equally high risk for mortality and re-hospitalization as those with reduced ejection fraction. Effective management strategies are critically needed to be established for this type of heart failure. These patients have more hypertensive and ischemic etiology than those with reduced ejection fraction. The investigators hypothesis is that Ca channel blocker nifedipine can improve the heart failure clinical composite response endpoint compared with the conventional treatment in patients with heart failure with hypertension and/or coronary artery disease and preserved ejection fraction (&gt;=50%) by echocardiography. This study is multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, and blinded-endpoint design.</brief_summary>
