	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Once-Daily Dosing of FoamOtic Cipro Compared to Twice-Daily Dosing of Ciloxan Ear Drops in Patients With Acute External Otitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute otitis externa (AOE) is defined as a diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna and/or the tympanic membrane. AOE is one of the most common infections encountered by otolaryngologists, pediatricians and family physicians. Diagnosis of AOE requires rapid onset (generally within 48 hours) of symptoms and signs of ear canal inflammation which includes: A) otalgia (often severe), itching or fullness, sometimes accompanied by reduced hearing or jaw pain; B) tenderness of the tragus and/or pinna; and C) diffuse ear canal edema with or without erythema, sometimes accompanied by ear discharge.</detailed_description>
