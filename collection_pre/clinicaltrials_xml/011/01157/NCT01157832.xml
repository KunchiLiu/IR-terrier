	<brief_summary>Title: The acute effect of water pipe smoking on exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pulmonary function tests in healthy volunteers Objectives: To evaluate the acute effect of one cession of water pipe smoking on airway inflammation as assessed by exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in healthy volunteers. Design: Prospective study evaluating these parameters before and after 30 minutes of water pipe smoking . The changes in inflammatory parameters pre and post smoking will be evaluated blindly. Sample size: 100 participants Participant selection: Adults subjects who regularly smoke water pipe . Intervention: Each subject will undergo evaluation including a respiratory questionnaire , pulmonary function tests , exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and carboxy- hemoglobin levels . All measurements will be evaluated before and after one cession of 30 minutes water pipe smoking Primary outcome parameter: Change in carboxy- hemoglobin Secondary outcome parameter:Change in peripheral eosinophils count, pulmonary function tests, change in FeNO, and in inflammatory parameters in EBC before and after water pipe smoking</brief_summary>
