	<brief_summary>Ankle sprain is the most occurring sport related injury. In addition, 40% of the people who sustain such an injury display residual symptoms under the general denominator functional ankle instability (FAI). In literature, there is already given a lot of attention to extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors of FAI. Furthermore, there is a major focus on the possible interventions which may be able to reduce the chance of developing chronic instability. At this moment there is a lack of unequivocality. In this study the investigators address the question of what is the effect of a balance training programme on the movement strategy. Therefore kinematics, kinetics, plantar pressure measurements and muscle activity are taken in consideration The purpose of this study is a better insight in the effect of treatment on the residual symptoms related to FAI.</brief_summary>
