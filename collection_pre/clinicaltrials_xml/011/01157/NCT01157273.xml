	<brief_summary>Objective: To assess whether the anxiety caused by a task considered anxiogenic, Simulated Public Speaking (SPS) test, would change the responses of healthy individuals regarding physiological and vocal parameters. Method: The sample comprised 30 participants of both genders, 19-42 years old, with no history of psychiatric disorders. The score in the STAI-Trait enabled investigators to assign participants to two groups: LOW ANXIETY (LA) and HIGH ANXIETY (HA). The investigators evaluated physiological parameters (heart rate, skin conductance, temperature in the extremities, electromyogram of the frontal muscle and salivary cortisol) and vocal parameters (vocal self-evaluation, quality of life in voice and vocal symptoms and signs) BEFORE, DURING and AFTER the SPS.</brief_summary>
