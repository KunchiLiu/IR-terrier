	<brief_summary>Short course palliative radiotherapy (5x5Gy)to the pelvis in patients with symptomatic rectal tumours and with unresectable metastases may prevent palliative surgery with a good palliative outcome.The consolidating chemotherapy of XELOX may increase the efficacy of irradiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Radiochemotherapy Against Palliative Surgery in Stage IV Rectal Cancer With Unresectable Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with symptomatic rectal cancer and unresectable metastases receive 25 Gy in 5 fractions of 5 Gy over 5 days to the pelvis and XELOX consolidating chemotherapy after one week. Investigators arbitrarily assumed that palliative radiotherapy to the pelvis can replace the immediate surgery if at least 30% of patients would avoid delayed surgery until the end of their lives, or for at least 18 months in the case of long-term survival.</detailed_description>
