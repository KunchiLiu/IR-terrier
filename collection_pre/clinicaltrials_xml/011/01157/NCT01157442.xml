	<brief_summary>Optimal development of sustainable health systems must use locally relevant infrastructure. Mobile phone technology, driven primarily by local market forces rather than foreign assistance, is spreading rapidly through African communities to improve people's personal and business communications. Here, the investigators propose using a structured mobile phone communications system for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). The system is designed to improve antenatal linkage to care, provide reminders to take PMTCT medications, and improve post-natal support and follow-up, even when mothers deliver at home. In addition to benefits in PMTCT related outcomes, this model allows evaluation of the intervention in a public health setting with the ultimate goal of advancing regional health systems development. The overall goal of of the study is to assess if mobile phones and SMS text messages can be used to help improve prevention of maternal to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV services by strengthening health systems. Specific objectives are: 1. To determine if mobile phone SMS text messages can demonstrate an improvement in compliance with a known intervention ( use of nevirapine) for PMTCT, demonstrated by: 1a) improved antenatal care attendance (greater than 4 visits) 1b) increased usage of nevirapine in labour (from 60% to at least 70%) 1c) earlier identification and treatment of HIV positive infants 1d) increased postpartum care for HIV positive mothers 1e) acceptability of cell phone SMS text messages transmission of information among HIV positive women 2. To demonstrate that mobile phone technology can be used as an effective tool to strengthen PMTCT health information systems at the facility level by: 2a) determining factors that constrain or promote the use of cell phone technology to strengthen PMTCT health information systems from the perspective of patients, health care providers and policy makers 2b) determining how cell phones can be used as a tool to generate equity statistics for PMTCT programs and formulate equity orientated PMTCT policies 2c) determine if early involvement of policy makers in the study improves knowledge translation</brief_summary>
