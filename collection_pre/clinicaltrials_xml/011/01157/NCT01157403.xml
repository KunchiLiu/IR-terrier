	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β cells; as a result, patients with T1DM are dependent on exogenous insulin to control their blood glucose continuously. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells has been shown in many animal studies their potential cure for T1DM,which could not only address the need for β-cell replacement but also control of the autoimmune response to cells which express insulin. Therefore it is need to study the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of newly diagnosed patients with T1DM.</brief_summary>
