	<brief_summary>In recent years Ferrari et al. proposed a new classification of manipulation in children with spastic hemiplegia which describes five different classes by analyzing and integrating the kinematic patterns of the hand and its functional use. The investigators believe that this classification provides the clinician with clinically meaningful information, by identifying the useful strategies spontaneously adopted by the children during manipulation tasks. The aim of this study is to determine the criterion validity of the new classification of the pattern of manipulation in children with spastic hemiplegia by correlating hand manipulation classes with both the scores of the Assisting Hand Assessment and the scores of the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function.</brief_summary>
