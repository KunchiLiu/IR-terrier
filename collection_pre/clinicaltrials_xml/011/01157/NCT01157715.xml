	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-masked, Multicenter, Controlled Study of Intravitreal KH902 in Patients With Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over the age of 65 in the United States and other western countries. A quantity of documents indicate that neovascularization promoted by VEGF is main cause of visual acuity decline. Patients are starving for a new drug which can notably improve VA with less administration frequency and lower treatment cost. The new drug Recombinant Human VEGF Receptor-Fc Fusion Protein (KH902) is a gene fusion protein. The pre-clinical researches and phase I study show that KH902 is effective and safe in inhibiting the growth, migration, pullulation of vascular endothelial cells and neovascularization induced by VEGF. This study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of multiple injections of KH902 at variable dosing regimen in patients with CNV due to neovascular AMD. Based on the characteristics of KH902 and results from KH902 Phase I study as well as reference to clinical trials of similar drugs, it is determined that KH902 is administrated at 0.5mg/eye/time and 2.0mg/eye/time.</detailed_description>
