	<brief_title>15 Month Study for Adults Who Have Been Diagnosed With Schizophrenia and Incarcerated</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate with oral antipsychotic treatment in delaying time to a protocol-defined treatment failure over 15 months, in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who have been incarcerated. Protocol-defined treatment failure is defined as arrest, psychiatric hospitalization, increase in psychiatric services to prevent imminent hospitalization, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to inadequate efficacy, treatment supplementation with another antipsychotic due to inadequate efficacy, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to safety or tolerability or completed suicide. Protocol was amended on March 15, 2011 to reflect changes in the inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as the study objectives. Patients will receive either paliperidone palmitate 78, 117, 156, or 234 mg monthly by injection for fifteen months OR oral aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone at doses selected by the study doctor.</detailed_description>
