	<brief_title>Hyperuricemia on Hypertension and Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated consumption of high fructose corn syrup has lead to an increase of 30% of fructose intake since the last 20 years. Important data supporting this fact can be reflected on incidence and prevalence of Metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia. A peculiar effect of fructose intake demonstrated in animal models is the development of elevated uric acid levels; also some studies have found a clear association between hyperuricemia as an important risk factor for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and metabolic syndrome. Taking into account the existing evidence, our clinical research team presents this protocol as a way to evaluate the effect of uric acid treatment and its relation with Fructose consumption, metabolic syndrome parameters, hyperuricemia and risk of hypertension. Confirming evidence with clinical basis may be the initial strategy to create primary prevention programs to control this health problems affecting Mexican Population.</detailed_description>
