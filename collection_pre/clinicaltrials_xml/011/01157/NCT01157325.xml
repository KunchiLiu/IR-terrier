	<brief_summary>Currently, it is certain that neuraxial analgesia in early stage of labor and delivery dose not increase the risk of Cesarean section. However, given ethical reasons, whether such a medical procedure could increase the Cesarean rate compared with those who did not received neuraxial analgesia or not is yet to be known. It is difficult to perform such a study in occidental countries because they have a higher rate of labor analgesia. On the contrary, the rate of labor analgesia in China is up to date only 1%, so it can be done easily. The investigators hypothesized that no neuraxial analgesia itself were a risk factor to Cesarean section. Therefore, the investigators design this study to compared the effect of neuraxial analgesia on the rate of Cesarean delivery with those who did not received neuraxial analgesia.</brief_summary>
