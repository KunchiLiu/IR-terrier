	<brief_summary>Tocotrienol Rich Fraction (TRF) in combination with Tamoxifen will improve breast cancer specific survival and recurrence free survival, in women with early breast cancer and estrogen receptor positive tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Clinical Trial With Tocotrienol on Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conducted a, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial of TRF plus tamoxifen versus placebo plus tamoxifen in women with primary breast cancer for five years. Both the TRF and placebo drugs were prepared and supplied by Hovid Sdn Bhd, Malaysia. Hovid Sdn. Bhd. absolutely did not have any influence in the trial designing, patient recruitment, data collection, analysis and reporting. The placebo drug which contained soy oil without tocotrienols had similar appearance and taste as the TRF drug. A total of 240 women breast cancer patients were assigned to two groups by minimization method that balanced treatment groups. The intervention group was given TRF plus tamoxifen, (n = 120) while control group was given placebo plus tamoxifen, (n = 120). The primary end point was breast cancer specific survival, defined as the time from minimization to death due to breast cancer. The secondary end points included disease free survival, biochemical parameters, liver function and plasma levels of vitamin E.</detailed_description>
