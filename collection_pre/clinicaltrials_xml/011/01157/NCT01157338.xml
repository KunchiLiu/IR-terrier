	<brief_summary>Retinal emboli is a common phenomenon in cardiac catheterization. In this study the investigators evaluate the incidence of retinal emboli post diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization over 300 patients. The incidence was 6.3% and had no clinical sequel on visual acuity and visual field.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Significance of Retinal Emboli During Diagnostic and Therapeutic Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and Purpose Cardiac catheterization may cause retinal embolization, a risk factor for cerebrovascular emboli and stroke. We describe the incidence of clinically silent and apparent retinal emboli following diagnostic and interventional coronary catheterization and associated risk factors. Methods Three hundred selected patients attending a tertiary referral center for diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization were studied. Direct retinal examination and examination of the visual field and acuity were done before and after catheterization by a retinal specialist.</detailed_description>
