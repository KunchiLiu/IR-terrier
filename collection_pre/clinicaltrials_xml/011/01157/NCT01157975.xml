	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) and with a BMI greater than 25Kg/m2 are refractory to medical treatment. Also, HCV replication seems to be affected when modeling insulin resistance in replicon cell culture systems. PPARg -agonist (Pioglitazone) is effective in controlling liver inflammation in obese subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and also improving insulin sensitivity. Therefore, we hypothesize that improving insulin resistance and /or inflammation may affect HCV replication and viral kinetics. Independently of PPARg pathways, Prednisone may increase HCV viral kinetics. .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, two arm clinical trial. The investigators performing the primary and secondary endpoints are blinded to subject identifiers and arm identifiers. Subject's screening for HCV Genotype 4 started in Agouza Hospital in July 2010 and ended in February, 2011. No recruitment has occurred for HCV Genotype 1.</detailed_description>
