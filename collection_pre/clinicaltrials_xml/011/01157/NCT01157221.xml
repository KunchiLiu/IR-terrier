	<brief_summary>Background: Few studies have examined the predictors of the clinical course of subjects with frozen shoulder syndrome or explained the persistence of symptoms after appropriate therapy. Altered shoulder kinematics may predispose subjects to subacromial impingement, rotator cuff tendonitis, altered shoulder joint forces, and possible degenerative changes. Subsequently, a more difficult and chronic course of frozen shoulder syndrome may develop. Objective: The purposes of this study are: (1) to develop a prediction method for determining altered shoulder kinematics and associated muscular activities which are associated with the chronicity of frozen shoulder dysfunction, and (2) to validate this prediction method and analyze the impact of the method on clinical behavior. Design: For the first year, a prospective study will be conducted to develop a prediction method that will identify impaired shoulder kinematics associated with the degree of symptom-related functional disability in patients with frozen shoulder syndrome. For the second and third years, validation of the proposed prediction method will determine whether altered shoulder kinematics and associated muscular activities subject to intervention meet the prediction criteria and demonstrate improvement in their follow-up, which will be shown to improve decision making in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
