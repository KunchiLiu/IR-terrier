	<brief_summary>Hypotension after spinal anesthesia for Cesarean section occurs in up to 90% usually under five minutes after local anesthetics administration. These changes are poorly depicted by oscillometric measurements. The investigators hypothesized, that a continuous noninvasive device detects more hypotensive periods with lower blood pressures.</brief_summary>
