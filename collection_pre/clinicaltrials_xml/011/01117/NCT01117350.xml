	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To demonstrate the superiority of insulin glargine over liraglutide in terms of percentage of patients reaching a Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt; 7% at the end of the comparative period (24 weeks) in Type 2 diabetic patients failing lifestyle management and oral agents Secondary objectives of the comparative period (24 weeks): &gt;To assess the effect of insulin glargine in comparison with liraglutide on: - HbA1c level - Percentage of patients whose HbA1c has decreased but remains &gt;= 7% at the end of the comparative period - Percentage of patients whose HbA1c has increased at the end of the comparative period - Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) - 7-point Plasma Glucose (PG) profiles - Hypoglycemia occurrence - Body weight - Adverse events Objectives of the extension period (24 weeks): &gt;To assess the effect of insulin glargine in patients not adequately controlled with liraglutide on: - HbA1c level - FPG - 7-point PG profiles - Hypoglycemia occurrence - Body weight - Adverse events</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Maximum estimated study duration per patient: either 27 weeks (patients randomized to insulin glargine arm) or 51 weeks (patients randomized to liraglutide arm) broken down as follow: - A 2-week of screening period, - A 24-week comparative period, - A 24-week extension period (only for patients treated with liraglutide, not adequately controlled at the end of the comparative period), - A 1-week follow-up period</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria (comparative period): Patients With Type 2 Diabetes diagnosed for at least 1 year, Treated with lifestyle interventions and metformin at the maximum tolerated dosage (with a minimum daily dosage of 1g), either alone or in combination with an oral insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea, glinide or DiPeptidyl Peptidase IV inhibitor), for more than 3 months, 7.5% &lt; HbA1c &lt;= 12%, Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m2 inclusively, Ability and willingness to perform PG (Plasma Glucose) self monitoring using the sponsorprovided glucose meter and to complete the patient diary, Willingness and ability to comply with the study protocol, Signed informed consent obtained prior to any study procedure.

Night shift worker, Presence of any condition (medical, psychological, social or geographical), current or anticipated that would compromise the patients safety or limit the patient successful participation in the study, Participation in a clinical trial (drug or device) within 3 months prior to study entry, Refusal or inability to give informed consent to participate in the study, Patient is the Investigator or any subInvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol. Additional exclusion criteria for the extension period: Treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs other than metformin and patient's usual sulfonylurea if any, or with insulin during the comparative period (except in case of an emergency, for a period of time less than 7 days), Treatment with corticosteroids with potential systemic action within the last 3 months of the comparative period.
