	<brief_summary>Conventional pain efficacy measures such as Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) are often unable to detect treatment efficacy in small-scale clinical trials. Combining conventional pain efficacy measures with quantitative sensory testing (QST) may provide more sensitive and informative outcome measures in clinical trials.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Neuropathic pain of peripheral origin demonstrating spontaneous ongoing pain and dynamic mechanical allodynia to brush stimuli. A present pain intensity score of 4 or more (out of 10) for spontaneous ongoing pain and brushevoked allodynia at the skin area at screen. Stable analgesic medication (excluding pregabalin) for a minimum of 1 month prior to the start of study. Patients who have undergone neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy. Patients who have trigeminal neuralgia, central pain (due to cerebrovascular lesions, multiple sclerosis and traumatic spinal cord injuries), complex regional pain syndrome (Type I and II), and phantom limb pain. Patients who have previously been treated with pregabalin.</criteria>
