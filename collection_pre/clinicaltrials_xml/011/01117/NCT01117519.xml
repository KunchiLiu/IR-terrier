	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of a compound of balanced infusion solutions including 50% crystalloid and 50% colloid has a positive impact on acid-base balance in elective hip replacement surgery. The application of the study medication will be carried out through a goal-directed intraoperative therapy by transoesophageal doppler.</brief_summary>
