	<criteria>Symptomatic drugrefractory AF (with history of failure of ≥2 class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs) in patients referred for catheter ablation of AF PAF with ≥1 monthly episodes or PersAF in patients who had already undergone ≥3 electrical cardioversions. PAF was defined as episodes lasting less than 7 days with spontaneous termination. PersAF was defined as lasting more than 7 days before being terminated pharmacologically or by electrical cardioversion. Officebased systolic blood pressure of ≥160 mm Hg, despite treatment with ≥3 antihypertensive drugs (including 1 diuretic) A glomerular filtration rate ≥45 mL/min/1⋅73 m2, with modification of diet using a renal disease formula Previous atrial fibrillation ablation Type 1 of diabetes mellitus Structural heart disease Secondary cause of atrial hypertension Severe renal artery stenosis or renal arteries abnormalities Previous operations on renal arteries Pregnancy Previous heart, kidney, liver, or lung transplantation Unwillingness of participant</criteria>
