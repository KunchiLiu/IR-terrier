	<brief_summary>Simulation is used to teach undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare professionals, however it is not known how best to use this resource. Using qualitative methods, this study aims to investigate how medical students learn during simulation scenarios and will compare students who are paired with peers with those who are solo during their scenarios. Video and audio data from simulations will be collected and analysed with anxiety and empathy questionnaire data and semi-structured interviews.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Factors Affecting Medical Student Learning in Simulation Scenarios</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical students attending a simulation day will either perform their simulation paired with another student from the group or solo. Video data from the scenario and audio data from the feedback session will be retained. One week later students will perform a second scenario and the feedback following this will be retained. Students will also have a semi-structured interview and complete anxiety and empathy questionnaires.</detailed_description>
