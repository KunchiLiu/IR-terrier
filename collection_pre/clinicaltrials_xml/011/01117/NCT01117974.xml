	<brief_summary>Liposuction, one of the most common cosmetic procedures performed in the United States, is a surgical technique used to reduce localized areas of excess subcutaneous fat. The neck is a common area of treatment, where liposuction reduces fat volume and neck size. We hypothesize that suctioned removal of fat of the neck will reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.</brief_summary>
