	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies intensity-modulated external beam radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated External Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate that patients can safely receive IMRT teletherapy using the proposed IMRT fractionation schedule without experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess treatment efficacy through the surrogate measures of PSA nadir and biochemical failure-free survival. OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease may also receive concurrent and adjuvant or long-term androgen deprivation therapy for up to 36 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until year 5.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with biopsyproven adenocarcinoma of the prostate are eligible for protocol enrollment when the following criteria are met; patients must have low, intermediate or highrisk adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria A diagnostic CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be obtained to rule out regional disease (maximum of 60 days prior to registration) for highrisk patients only A bone scan showing no evidence of metastatic disease is also required for patients whose prostatespecific antigen (PSA) is greater than 20 ng/ml, Gleason's sum is greater than 7, or Tstage is greater than T2b Alkaline phosphatase within 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) is required for all patients beginning hormone therapy AST within 1.5 x ULN is required for all patients beginning hormone therapy Bilirubin within 1.5 x ULN is required for all patients beginning hormone therapy Karnofsky Performance score &gt;= 80 Prior to registration, patients having received no more than three months treatment with antiandrogen, luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, or a combination of the two remain eligible for protocol treatment; the qualifying PSA for these patients will be the value recorded prior to the initiation of the hormone therapy Patients with history of inflammatory bowel disease, or who require steroid or cytotoxic therapy for collagen vascular disease Patients with a history of cancer other than skin cancer within five years of the initiation of protocol treatment Patients with a history of pelvic irradiation for any reason</criteria>
