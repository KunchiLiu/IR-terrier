	<brief_summary>The goal is to determine if standard therapy including joint mobilizations of the ankle performed 3 times per week for 2 weeks will increase self-reported function and decrease pain in patients with mild lateral ankle sprains.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Talocrural Joint Mobilizations in the Treatment of Subacute Lateral Ankle Sprains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this protocol is to assess the effects of grade IV anterior to posterior joint mobilization on self-reported function, dorsiflexion range of motion and talar glide on subjects suffering from lateral ankle sprain in the past 2-10 days and exhibit 5 degree dorsiflexion deficit in range of motion or a restriction in posterior glide of the talus.</detailed_description>
