	<brief_summary>This was an observational, prospective, multicentric study conducted in a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes and prescribed with Glucophage XR therapy from hospitals or clinics in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore. Glucophage XR is being used in the Asia Pacific region for the treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes. This study was designed to provide information on the day to-day experience of using Glucophage XR in the management of subjects with type 2 diabetes and its use in routine clinical practice in Asia Pacific region.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glucophage (metformin) is the standard first line therapy for subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes has recommended metformin therapy in concurrent with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. It has been well accepted that subjects' compliance with therapy tends to decrease as the dosage frequency increases and hence the regimens should be simplified as far as possible to support good compliance with therapy. The use of an extended release formulation of metformin (Glucophage XR) supports the simplification of treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes by allowing a once daily administration of metformin. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: - To assess the tolerability of Glucophage XR therapy when used in routine clinical practice in subjects with type 2 diabetes Secondary objective: - To assess the effectiveness of Glucophage XR therapy on the maintenance of glycaemic control The study does not involve any active involvement of the subjects and does not require any change from the standard medical management of the subjects. Each subject will be followed upon starting Glucophage XR therapy and until at least 12 weeks of treatment or discontinuation of treatment, whichever being earlier.</detailed_description>
