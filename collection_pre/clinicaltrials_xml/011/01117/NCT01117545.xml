	<brief_summary>EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) has been shown to significantly reduce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression in a variety of clinical trials. This study examines the effect of a six session EFT protocol on the symptoms of veterans with clinical scores on the PTSD Checklist-Military (PCL-M). Subjects in the experimental group receive EFT coaching supplemental to, and supportive of, the "usual care" treatment provided by their primary care provider. Subjects in the wait list control group receive usual care for a month, with pre and posttests, after which they also receive the EFT coaching protocol. Subjects are followed at three month intervals to determine if gains are maintained, and whether the symptom reductions are similar to those observed in other trials of EFT.</brief_summary>
