	<brief_summary>This trial is designed as a multi-centre, open label, dose-escalation, phase I trial and consists of five parts. Part A investigates the safety and PK of escalating weekly dosing of Sym004 in patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors. Part B and C validates the safety, PK and efficacy of weekly dosing of Sym004 at the MTD in a homogenous patient population with advanced mCRC and wild-type KRAS. If MTD equals 12 mg/kg, then part C will explore the 9 mg/kg level. Part B will be initiated when a safe dose has been established in Part A. Part D and E is to validate the safety, PK and efficacy when administered every 2 weeks at doses of 12 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg, respectively. Part F is to validate safety, PK and efficacy when administered with a single loading dose 9 mg/kg followed by weekly doses of 6 mg/kg.</brief_summary>

Diarrhea CTCAE &gt;1 4. Skin rash CTCAE &gt;1 5. Abnormal organ or bone marrow function. 6. Use of immunosuppressive agents for the past 4 weeks prior to trial start, including systemic corticosteroids used at doses above 20mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent. 7. History of other malignancy within 5 years prior to trial start, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix (not in Part A). 8. Active severe infection, any other concurrent disease or medical conditions that are deemed to interfere with the conduct of the trial as judged by the investigator. 9. Known HIV positive 10. Known active hepatitis B or C 11. Patients with known uncontrolled allergic conditions or allergy to the study drug and/or their components. 12. Clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction within six months from Visit 1, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring therapy, with the exception of extra systoles or minor conduction abnormalities and controlled and well treated chronic atrial fibrillation. 13. Significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition evaluated by the investigator to interfere with effect of the trial drug.</criteria>
