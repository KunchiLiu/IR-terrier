	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to develop tools to help people who are paralyzed. These tools are called brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs would allow a person to use brain signals to operate technology. Specifically this project's goal is to design a BCI to operate a switch.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensorimotor Rhythm Brain-Computer Interface Switch to Operate Assistive Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators want to make a BCI that can be used to operate commercially available technologies for communication, environmental control or computer access. The BCI would replace a switch to let people operate these technologies without moving. However, investigators need people to test the BCI so they can determine how effective it is in replacing a switch.</detailed_description>
