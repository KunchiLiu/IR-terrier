	<brief_summary>Background: Antiretroviral therapy has changed the natural history of the HIV infection in developed countries becoming a chronic disease. This clinical scenario would need a new approach to control patients, simplifying the follow-up visits and the accessibility to the healthcare professionals. A new home care model using a telemedicine system (Virtual Hospital) was developed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Telemedicine Approach for Chronic HIV/AIDS Patient Home Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stable HIV-infected patients with access to a computer and broadband were randomized to: arm I, patients monitored by Virtual Hospital the first year and arm II patients monitored in the hospital the first year (standard of care). After 1 year of follow up, patients were crossed into the other arm. A "Virtual Hospital" was developed to integrate the control of patient in a multidisciplinary telecare team, allowing the patient to be remotely followed-up by the healthcare professionals through Internet. Virtual Hospital had four main services: Virtual Consultations, Telepharmacy, Virtual Library and Virtual Community. A technical and a clinical evaluation of Virtual Hospital were made.</detailed_description>
