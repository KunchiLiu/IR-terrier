	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to determine if sitagliptin treatment is not inferior to that of glimepiride as measured by the change in baseline hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) after 30 weeks of treatment, and if sitagliptin treatment results in a lower incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to that of glimepiride. The study will also evaluate if sitagliptin treatment, compared to glimepiride results in improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and plasma lipid levels after 30 weeks of treatment. Participants will be randomized to either sitagliptin or glimepiride treatment after eligibility for study participation is determined during screening and washout study phases. Participants and study staff will not know to which treatment group they have been randomized (double-blind design). The duration of study participation will be up to 40 weeks (with 9 clinic visits). This will include a screening phase (Visit 1 to Visit 2) of 2 weeks maximum; a 6-week (Visits 2 to 3) oral antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) wash-out phase (for those who have been taking a AHA prior to the study); a placebo run-in phase (Visits 3 to 4), followed by up to 30 weeks of treatment with study medication.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dose of sitagliptin will be 100 mg once daily (QD) or 50 mg QD based on the participant's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The starting dose of glimepiride (1 mg QD) may be up-titrated as needed to optimize glycemic control over the first 18 weeks to a maximum dose of 6 mg/day, after which the dose will not be increased for the rest of the study (down-titration to avoid or control hypoglycemia is allowed).</detailed_description>
