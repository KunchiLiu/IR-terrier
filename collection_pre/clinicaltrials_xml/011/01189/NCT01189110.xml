	<brief_summary>Thirty three percent of our veterans currently smoke. Encouraging smoking cessation continues to be a top priority for the Veteran's Administration as smoking is the single most important preventable risk factor for mortality and morbidity. This study attempts to determine whether auriculotherapy may be used as an effective alternative to usual pharmacological interventions currently offered. Identifying an efficacious alternative method to nicotine patch or bupropion would be highly beneficial to veterans who want to quit smoking. This clinical trial took place at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, in conjunction with the smoking cessation clinic. One hundred twenty five veterans, male and female, age 19 or older, who smoked a minimum of 10 cigarettes per day, were evaluated for enrollment and randomized to two groups- true auriculotherapy and sham auriculotherapy in this 6 week trial.</brief_summary>
