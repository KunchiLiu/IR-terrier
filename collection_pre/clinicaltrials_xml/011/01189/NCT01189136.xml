	<brief_title>Treatment for Acute Postoperative Voiding Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If patients fail a voiding trial (the test done to see if a foley catheter is ready to be removed after surgery), they may be offered participation in this trial. Patients are randomized to receive active treatment or a sham treatment. A small, accupuncture-type needle is inserted through the skin just above the ankle. A small, battery-powered generator will be attached to the needle. The generator will give a low-voltabe stimulation which is adjusted for comfort level and applied for 30 minutes. After treatemnt, the voiding trial will be repeated.</detailed_description>
