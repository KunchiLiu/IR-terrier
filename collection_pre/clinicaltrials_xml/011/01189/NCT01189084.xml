	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study is to determine whether the vaccine (UB 311), targeting the N-terminal amino acids (1-14) of the amyloid beta peptide, has long-term immunogenicity and efficacy in individuals diagnosed with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who previously received UB 311-treatment. Amyloid beta was selected as the target antigen based on supporting evidence of the hypothesis that places the accumulation of amyloid beta at the initiating step of AD.</brief_summary>
