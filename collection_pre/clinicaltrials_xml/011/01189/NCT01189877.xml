	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if the cells in rectal cancer are oxygen-starved, or hypoxic. We know that as cancers grow bigger, parts of them are cut off from the oxygen supply and they become hypoxic, basically, lacking oxygen. Research has shown that cells that are oxygen-starved respond differently to treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation when compared to cells that are oxygen rich.</brief_summary>
