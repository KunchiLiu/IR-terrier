	<criteria>Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Subjects with documented clinical diagnosis of diabetic macular edema (DME) with proliferative or non proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Subjects, who according to the clinical assessment of the investigator, may benefit from antiVEGF therapy including those subjects who were participating in the A5751013 study and who, in the investigator's opinion, may benefit from continued pegaptanib sodium therapy. Eyes with prior scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation within 4 months prior to baseline or anticipated scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation within the next 6 months. Presence of any abnormality that is likely to confound assessment of visual acuity improvement in eyes in which macular edema resolves, or improves, such as nonperfusion for &gt;1 disc area involving the foveal avascular zone (FAZ involving 2 or more quadrants centered around the foveal avascular zone), epiretinal membrane associated with signs of contraction and/or significant opacification (i.e. striae within 1 disc diameter of the foveal center), or presence of chorioretinal atrophy involving the center of the macula. Vitreomacular traction determined clinically and/or by optical coherence tomography (OCT), which, in the investigator's opinion, contributes to the macular edema (or causes associated foveal detachment), and would preclude improvement with pegaptanib sodium. Any other cause of macular edema such as vitreous extension, or entrapment to anterior segment wound, or any retinal vein occlusion involving the macula.</criteria>
