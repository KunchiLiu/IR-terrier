	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal Ranibizumab in comparison with macular laser photocoagulation as treatments for macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion. Characteristics of this study is as below 1. Multicenter, randomized clinical trial. (intravitreal Ranibizumab 0.5mg injection vs. macular laser photocoagulation) 2. After 48 weeks follow up, functional change(visual acuity)and anatomical change (central retinal thickness) would be evaluated</brief_summary>
