	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that while the extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants (&lt;1000 g) may need NIMV for the treatment of RDS, larger infants or the smaller ones post extubation may enjoy the comfort benefits associated with HFNC while getting coparable respiratory support to NIMV.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Gestational age between 24 to 34 and 6/7 weeks assessed by the obstetrical team from dating of last menstural period or ultrasound and weight &gt;1000 g for the initial treatment of RDS or &lt;35 weeks post extubation or for apnea of prematurity 2. Infants with RDS who will need NRS as initial therapy or after extubation and for apnea of prematurity, 3. written informed consent. 1. Significant morbidity apart from RDS including: cardiac disease (not including patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]), congenital malformation, or if they had cardiovascular or respiratory instability because of sepsis, anemia or severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), 2.
