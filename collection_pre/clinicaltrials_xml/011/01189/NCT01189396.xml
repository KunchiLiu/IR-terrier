	<brief_summary>The main objective is to evaluate the bronchodilatory efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of A006, in comparison with those of an active control, Proventil®-HFA MDI, and a placebo control DPI, in escalating and cumulative-doses up to 1,440 mcg, eight (8) times of the proposed clinical dose.</brief_summary>
