	<brief_summary>Sleep deprivation can acutely reverse depressive symptoms in patients with major depression. Although underlying mechanisms of the antidepressant action in sleep deprivation are unclear, many of these observations can be explained by abnormal slow wave homeostasis. This study will test the prediction that selectively reducing slow waves during sleep (slow wave deprivation; SWD), without disrupting total sleep time, will yield an antidepressant effect.</brief_summary>
