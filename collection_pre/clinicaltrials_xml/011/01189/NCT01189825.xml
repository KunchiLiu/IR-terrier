	<brief_summary>The major aim of the this study is to replicate findings of previous research that examined the effects of acute exercise on sexual arousal in women in a novel population, namely, women taking antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) class. In previous studies it has been found that acute, moderate-intensity exercise facilitated physiological sexual arousal responses in healthy, sexually functional women. However, it is known that antidepressants may induce sexual dysfunction, and thus in the present study, the investigators are examining whether acute exercise may facilitate sexual responses in women with taking antidepressants, including women with antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.</brief_summary>
