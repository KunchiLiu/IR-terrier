	<brief_summary>This is a study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two laxatives for treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult outpatients with cancer treated at the BC Cancer Agency Pain and Symptom Management/Palliative Care clinics. Each participating patient will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Versus Sennosides Study in Opioid-Induced Constipation in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One group will be started on a bowel protocol of escalating doses of sennosides, plus a dummy polyethylene glycol (lactose), and the other will receive dummy sennosides capsules (lactose)plus polyethylene glycol, with the same dosing protocol. After three weeks the patients will switch to the alternate active product and dummy preparation. The total duration for the study will be 6 weeks for each patient.</detailed_description>
