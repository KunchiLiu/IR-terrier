	<brief_title>Use of Omegaven Fish Oil Emulsion for Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease in Infants and Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsions, Omegaven™ is comprised solely of fish oils containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids. Animal studies have shown that IV fat emulsions such as fish oil that are high in eicosapentaenic and docosahexaenoic acids reduce impairment of bile flow as seen in cholestasis caused by conventional fat emulsions. It is thought that by administering Omegaven™ in place of conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsions, cholestasis may be prevented or reversed, and patients will be able to be maintained on adequate PN for growth until they are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally. Ongoing studies are addressing safety and efficacy of Omegaven™ in the pediatric population. In this trial, infants and children with parenteral nutrition associated liver disease will receive Omegaven™ as compassionate use to potentially prevent progression of disease. Safety and efficacy are monitored.</detailed_description>
