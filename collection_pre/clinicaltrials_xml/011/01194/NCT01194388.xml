	<brief_summary>The current observational evaluation is designed to evaluate the performance of the Axium™ MicroFx™ Detachable Coil System for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in the real life practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axium Coil in Completing Endovascular Aneurysm Surgery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 25 patients from from US centers are anticipated to be enrolled for this evaluation. Published literature on coils with electrolytic, thermal or hydraulic detachment will serve as the basis for control comparisons to the Axium™ MicroFx™ Detachable Coil System for patients undergoing embolization of intracranial aneurysm. Comparison will be based on criteria evaluating the safety of the procedure, the reliability of detachment, the occlusion stability and the packing density impact.</detailed_description>
