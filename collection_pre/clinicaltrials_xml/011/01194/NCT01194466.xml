	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to examine the effect of a single dose of TENS on mucositis pain and function secondary to head and neck radiation therapies. Oral mucositis is an extremely debilitating, unpreventable condition (inflammation, ulcers, bleeding in the mouth, nose, and throat) that causes significant pain, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. Head and neck cancers pose specific challenges to effective pain management and past studies suggest the use of effective non-pharmacologic strategies such as TENS may be particularly beneficial for avoiding sources of acute and chronic pain, thereby improving quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of TENS will decrease pain and improve function and quality of life in head and neck cancer patients. This project is particularly innovative because it is the first known study to examine the efficacy of TENS, an established safe, inexpensive and easy-to-use non-pharmacologic pain management intervention, for treating acute oral mucositis pain. The investigators research translates bench (animal model) science to human subjects using an interdisciplinary approach to pain management. Establishing whether TENS is effective for reducing mucositis pain is a critical first step toward establishing an effective, non-pharmacologic pain relief intervention for mucositis.</brief_summary>
