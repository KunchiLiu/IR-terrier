	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine whether low tidal volume during intraoperative one-lung ventilation could decrease the incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury compared to "normal" tidal volume.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Lung-protective Intervention in Patients Undergoing Esophageal Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large tidal volume are known risk factor of acute lung injury.Mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume has been shown to attenuate lung injuries in critically ill patients.Esophagectomy surgery need a relatively long time of one-lung ventilation. A normal tidal volume of two-lung ventilation should be a large one when exerted to one lung. We hypothesized that low tidal volume ventilation during one-lung ventilation could decrease incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury and mortality.</detailed_description>
