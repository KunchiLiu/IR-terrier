	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Zoledronic acid may prevent bone loss and help prevent or lessen musculoskeletal symptoms in women receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well zoledronic acid works in preventing musculoskeletal symptoms in post-menopausal women with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer receiving letrozole.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid in Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Musculoskeletal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Percentage of women experiencing aromatase inhibitor associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. II. Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, from baseline, among those receiving bisphosphonate, as compared to historical controls. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Change in pain scores on visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, from baseline, compared to historical controls. II. Change in amount and/or frequency of oral analgesic use at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from baseline among those receiving bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. III. Number of patients who discontinue or change aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. IV. Change in menopausal symptoms (NSABP-revised), hot flash frequency (HFRDIS),sleep quality (PSQI), depression score (CESD) and overall quality of life (EuroQOL) in patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from baseline, among those receiving bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. V. Changes in plasma estrogen concentrations at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from baseline, among those receiving bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. VI. Change in bone mineral density (DEXA scan) at 12 months from baseline, among those receiving bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. VII. Change in bone turn over markers (serum-C telopeptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptide) at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from baseline, among those receiving bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. VIII. Change in inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from baseline, among those receiving bisphosphonate therapy, as compared to historical controls. OUTLINE: Patients receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) at months 1 and 6. Beginning 14 days after first zoledronic acid infusion, patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
