	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare Humalog (Insulin lispro)-recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) or Novolog (Insulin aspart)-rHuPH20 to Humalog (Insulin lispro) for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in basal-bolus therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy Study of Subcutaneously Injected Prandial Insulins Compared to Insulin Lispro Alone in Participants With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Criteria for randomization into the study included 1) fasting blood glucose and predinner glucose values in the range of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) approximately 60% of the time for 7 days prior to randomization 2) 90 minute or 2-hour postprandial blood glucose &lt;220 mg/dL approximately 70% of the time for 7 days prior to randomization and 3) successfully completed 3 days of 10-point glucose monitoring and have at least 4 self-monitored blood glucose values on all non-10-point monitoring days. Participants that did not meet 1 or more of these criteria during a 4- to 6-week Titration Period were not randomized.</detailed_description>
