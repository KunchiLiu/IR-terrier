	<brief_summary>This randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in participants with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Eligible participants will be randomized 2 : 1 to receive either ocrelizumab or placebo. The blinded treatment period will be at least 120 weeks, followed by an Open Label Extension (OLE) treatment for participants in both groups who in the opinion of the investigator could benefit from further or newly initiated ocrelizumab treatment. Unless terminated early, all participants will continue their treatment with open-label ocrelizumab until the last participant who entered the OLE phase reaches 4 years of open-label ocrelizumab treatment.</brief_summary>
