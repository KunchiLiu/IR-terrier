	<brief_title>A Study to Identify Differences in Gene Expression in Patients With Bicuspid and Tricuspid Valve Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cause of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and its associated co morbidities is unknown. There is, however, evidence supporting a genetic cause for the BAV, Pedigree analysis of familial clustering initially directed investigators to a genetic cause of BAV. Subsequent studies on BAV patients using linkage analysis have demonstrated high heritability. Early identification of those patients with BAV disease who are at risk for ascending aneurysm formation and its complications may allow early intervention to prevent rupture, dissection and emergent cardiac surgery in at risk patients. Conversely, identification of those patients with BAVs not at risk for aortic aneurysm formation would delineate which patients do not need close follow up of aortic size or prophylactic ascending aortic replacement at time of aortic valve replacement.</detailed_description>
