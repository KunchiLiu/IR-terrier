	<brief_summary>Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration of the brain in the form of neurofibrillary tangles and plaques containing the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Recent animal studies have shown that extended wakefulness is associated with increased production of these Abeta proteins and that sleep leads to a marked fall in their production. Aim: The investigators aim to distinguish a similar effect of sleep disturbance on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta levels in humans, which may point out sleep disturbance as an important factor in AD development. Methods: a study in 26 healthy male volunteers, measuring CSF Abeta levels during a sleep deprivation night and before and after a control night with unrestricted sleep. Expected results: The investigators expect sleep deprivation to lead to an increase in CSF Abeta levels, as compared to the levels in the control night.</brief_summary>
