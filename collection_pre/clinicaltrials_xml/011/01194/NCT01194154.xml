	<brief_summary>This randomized, single-blind, proof-of-concept study will investigate the protective effects of early treatment with Mircera in participants with chronic kidney disease on renal disease progression. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 30 microgram (mcg) Mircera as subcutaneous injection once monthly or matching placebo. Depending on change of hemoglobin values, the dose of Mircera can be adjusted to 50 mcg or 75 mcg once monthly. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 months.</brief_summary>
