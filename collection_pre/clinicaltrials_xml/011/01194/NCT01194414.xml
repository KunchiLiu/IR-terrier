	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study compares the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (sc) versus intravenous (iv) administration of tocilizumab in participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Participants were randomized to receive either tocilizumab 162 mg sc weekly plus iv placebo every 4 weeks, or tocilizumab 8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks plus sc placebo weekly during the double-blind period from baseline to Week 24. The double-blind period was followed by a 72-week open-label treatment with some switching of sc and iv administration. No placebo was administered in the open-label phase. Participants continued on their stable dose of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) throughout the study. Anticipated time on study treatment was 2 years.</brief_summary>
