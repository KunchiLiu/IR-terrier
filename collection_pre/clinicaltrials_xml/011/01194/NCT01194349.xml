	<brief_summary>Thrombocytosis, mostly reactive in nature, is common in pediatric hospitalized patients with infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. Pneumoniae) is the most common pathogen. In this study, the investigators investigated the associations of clinical profiles and thrombocytosis and evaluated platelet counts, leukocyte counts and CRP levels as predictors of hospitalization days in patients with S. pneumoniae infection.</brief_summary>
