	<brief_summary>The goal of this multicenter study is to develop a standardized scoring system for inhalation injury that can be used both to quantify and predict injury severity inhalation injury in adults over 18 years of age. A model will be developed based on clinical, radiographic, bronchoscopic, and biochemical parameters that will predict the severity of inhalation injury with greater than 80% predictive accuracy</brief_summary>
