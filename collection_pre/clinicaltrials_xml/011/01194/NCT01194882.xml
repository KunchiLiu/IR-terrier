	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml versus Insuplant 400 IU/ml with respect to the pump refill accuracy during a 4 refill cycle period (i.e. the comparative phase); To assess efficacy measured by hemoglobin glycosylated (HBA1c) change in Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml group versus Insuplant 400 IU/ml group after a 4 refill cycle period (i.e. the comparative phase). Secondary Objective: To assess efficacy, safety, refill accuracy evolution and device interventions during the open-label treatment period with Insuman To evaluate daily insulin doses To assess Anti-Insulin Antibodies (ADAs or AIA) levels during all study phases</brief_summary>
