	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine how well intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered over 5 days works in reducing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms in children and adolescents. Treatment will consist of exposure and response prevention with an added focus on teaching parents to be exposure coaches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wait-list Study of One-Week Intensive Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do not receive CBT initially due, in part, to the lack of trained providers and geographic barriers (e.g., distance to such providers). Rather, the majority of youth with OCD receive psychiatric medication alone or together with unproven forms of psychotherapy. While some serotonergic medications have demonstrated utility in pediatric OCD, side effects can be common, response rates are modest at best, and symptom remission is rare. Storch et al. have shown that CBT can be delivered effectively in an intensive format over a 3-week time-span; however, even this shortened treatment approach involves considerable time and financial expenditure for those who do not have local access to CBT, including three week's time off from work and the cost of local room and board. Given this, more efficient ways of providing CBT need to be identified and tested to increase the number of people with access to this form of treatment. With this in mind, the proposed feasibility study examines the use of videophone technology to evaluate a 5-day cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD administered at multiple sites. A total of 30 youth will receive 10 60-75-minute sessions of CBT over 5 days (two sessions a day). Cognitive-behavioral therapy will be based on a demonstrated effective treatment protocol, and adapted for administration over a one-week time-span. We will utilize a month-long waitlist control to estimate treatment efficacy. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by trained clinicians at relevant time-points (i.e., baseline, post-waitlist, post-treatment, follow-up) to assess symptom severity and impairment. Should supporting data be found, CBT delivered in a 5-day format would have the potential to help many more families who would otherwise remain untreated or inadequately treated.</detailed_description>
