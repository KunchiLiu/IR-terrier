	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to compare Humalog (insulin lispro)-recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) or Novolog (insulin aspart)-rHuPH20 to insulin lispro for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in basal-bolus therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy Study of Subcutaneously Injected Prandial Insulins Compared to Insulin Lispro Alone in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Criteria for randomization into the study included 1) fasting blood glucose and pre-dinner glucose values in the range of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) approximately 60% of the time for 7 days prior to randomization; 2) 90 minute or 2-hour postprandial blood glucose &lt;220 mg/dL approximately 70% of the time for 7 days prior to randomization; and 3) successfully completing 3 days of 10-point glucose monitoring and have at least 4 self-monitored blood glucose values on all non-10-point monitoring days. Participants that did not meet 1 or more of these criteria during a 4- to 6-week Titration Period were not randomized.</detailed_description>
