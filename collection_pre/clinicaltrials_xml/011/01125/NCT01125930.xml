	<brief_summary>Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea is a type of rosacea that causes a red face often with frequent flushing, topical sensitivity and prominent blood vessels. We think that long term damage to skin from the sun (photodamage) may play a role in causing this type of rosacea. Tretinoin is a topical medication that is known to improve photodamage. We want to find out if Atralin (tretinoin 0.05%) Gel used for up to 46 weeks will improve erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR).</brief_summary>
