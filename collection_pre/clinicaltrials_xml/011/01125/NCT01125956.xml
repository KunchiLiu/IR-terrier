	<brief_summary>The specific aims of this study are to test whether in a cohort of low-income minority veterans with poor diabetes mellitus (DM) control: 1. Peer counseling is an effective means of reducing HbA1c (a measure of glucose control). 2. Financial incentives are an effective means of reducing HbA1c. This is a randomized controlled pilot study. There will be 3 arms: 1) a control group of poorly controlled diabetics getting usual care; 2) peer counseling with no incentives; and 3) financial incentives without peers. Ultimately, contingent on the success of this intervention, the researchers plan to apply for funding for a large scale intervention employing both peer counseling and incentives to improve DM control in low income and minority patients who are at high risk for premature morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
