	<brief_summary>The overall median survival of nonresectable malignant hilar obstruction in most series has been less than 6 months. Most patients with malignant hilar obstruction present with advanced disease, making palliative endoscopic drainage the principal therapeutic option. However, the optimal endoscopic management strategy is contentious. Almost all of the published data comparing plastic and metallic stents relate to distal tumors (those of the pancreas, common bile duct and ampulla). Stent patency, complication rates, and cost-effectiveness have favored metallic stents when compared with plastic stents in patients with distal malignant obstruction expected to live at least 3 to 6 months. There are few comparative study as to whether self-expanding metallic or plastic stent, especially DLS (double layer plastic stent) are preferable in the technical success, stent patency, and cost-effectiveness for palliating malignant hilar obstruction. The study was designed to compare the the technical success, stent patency, and cost-effectiveness of self-expandable metal stent and DLS in patients with malignant hilar obstruction.</brief_summary>
