	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to culture primary human brain tumor cells with the specific aims of: 1. Develop primary cultures from human brain tumor surgical specimens 2. Determine the genetic and molecular fingerprints of brain tumors that may have prognostic significance 3. Delineate the mechanisms underlying oncogenesis of brain tumors. 4. Perform in vitro assays with brain tumor derived primary cultures to assess the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents.</brief_summary>
