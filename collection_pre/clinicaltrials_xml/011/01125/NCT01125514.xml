	<criteria>Systolic or diastolic heart failure, diagnosed with either NYHA functional class II to III at least 3 months prior to screening and on stable medication for at least 12 weeks. Patients must have met either of the criteria at screening: Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 20% but lower than 40% OR Patients with a documented LVEF greater than 40% and with a history of NTproBNP&gt; 400pg/mL (or BNP &gt; 100pg/mL) within 12 months of screening. Treatment with Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), aldosterone receptor antagonists and diuretics (other than furosemide) within 3 weeks of first dose and during the study. Beta blockers were permitted provided the dose was stable for at least 3 weeks before the first dose and remains so throughout the study. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP). If a subject is currently treated with furosemide, the dose must be stable for at least 3 weeks before the first dose and the dose must not exceed 60 mg daily Stable heart failure requiring treatment with both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB or Current acute decompensated heart failure. Mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and/or mean sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100mmHg and/or secondary forms of hypertension. Persistent sitting systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg. History of angioedema. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
