	<brief_summary>This study compared the removal of dental biofilm between soft and medium toothbrushes. The patients refrained from performing mechanical or chemical plaque control for 96 hours to allow dental biofilm accumulation on the tooth surfaces. After the period of dental biofilm formation, the quadrants were randomized and the participants brushed different quadrants with soft and medium toothbrushes, with or without dentifrice. The plaque indices were analyzed by a blinded examiner before and after toothbrushing. The 2Tone was used for plaque disclosure and analysis was performed by the Quigley-Hein index modified by Turesky et al. (1970).</brief_summary>
