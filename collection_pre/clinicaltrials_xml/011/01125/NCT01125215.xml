	<brief_title>Capsaicin Nanoparticle in Patient With Painful Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Painful diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of neuropathic pain. 0.075% topical capsaicin has been used to treat the pain. Because of high concentration, conventional capsaicin topical preparation causing burning sensation and required several time of applications per day. The nanoparticle of capsaicin topical preparation was developed with expectation of remaining efficacy, minimizing burning sensation and improving convenience of use.</detailed_description>
