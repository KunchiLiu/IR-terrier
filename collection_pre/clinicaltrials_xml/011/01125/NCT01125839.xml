	<brief_summary>Vertebral osteomyelitis is a uncommon disease that can lead to neurologic deficits if not diagnosed in time. The etiologies of vertebral osteomyelitis include pyogenic bacteria, M. tuberculosis, Brucella species, and fungus. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical features and microbiological/radiological characteristics of patients with vertebral osteomyelitis, and investigate the useful tips for the differential diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Besides description of characteristics of patients with vertebral osteomyelitis, we also will investigate the usefulness of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of biopsy specimen. MRI findings during the antibiotic treatment will be monitored and compared for the differential diagnosis of meningitis.</detailed_description>
