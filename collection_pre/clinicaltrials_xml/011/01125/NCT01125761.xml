	<brief_summary>Considering the pathogenesis of several allergic skin diseases to be investigated in this study as well as the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of the association of dexamethasone and clemastine fumarate, it is believed that the components of topical medication may act synergistically in the reduction of signs and symptoms of the diseases in question. Therefore it is expected that the association promotes results significantly superior to dexamethasone alone.</brief_summary>
