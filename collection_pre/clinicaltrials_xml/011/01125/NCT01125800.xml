	<brief_summary>Phase I dose-escalation study to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LDE225 given orally on a daily dosing schedule in children with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma, or other tumors potentially dependent on Hedgehog signaling pathway. Phase II study is to assess preliminary efficacy in both adult and pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory MB.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase I Patients aged ≥12 months and &lt;18 years, Phase II Patients ≥12 months Phase I Histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, high grade glioma, or osteosarcoma, that has progressed despite treatment with standard therapies, or for which no standard treatments are available (patients with brainstem gliomas are excluded). Phase II Histologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or relapsed medulloblastoma with at least one measurable lesion. Performance Status: Karnofsky ≥60% for patients &gt;10 yrs, Lansky ≥50 for patients less than or equal to 10 yrs Protocoldefined renal , liver and bone marrow function Negative pregnancy test before starting study treatment. If of child bearing potential must use 'highly effective' methods of contraception. All patients must consent to provide a tumor sample Systemic anticancer treatment within 2 weeks prior to first dose (6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin and monoclonal antibodies). Focal radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to first dose, or full spinal radiotherapy within 3 months of first dose. Unresolved toxicity greater than CTCAE grade 1 from previous anticancer therapy or radiotherapy (excluding neurotoxicity, alopecia, ototoxicity, lymphopenia or other specifications in the eligibility criteria for this study), or incomplete recovery from previous surgery, unless agreed by Novartis and the Principal Investigator (PI) and documented. Major surgery, serious illness or traumatic injury within 2 weeks of starting study therapy. Patients anticipated to require major surgery within the first 2 cycles of treatment. Patients requiring a nasogastric tube for drug administration (Gtubes are permitted) Impaired cardiac function Pregnant or breastfeeding females Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
