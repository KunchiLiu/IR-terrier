	<brief_summary>Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common disorder. Despite optimal endoscopic and medical treatment, there is a high risk of rebleeding and high mortality. In this study the investigators examine whether combined endoscopic haemostasis and angiographic embolization resolves in a better outcome than the traditional use of endoscopic haemostasis alone. The study is a randomised controlled trail.</brief_summary>
