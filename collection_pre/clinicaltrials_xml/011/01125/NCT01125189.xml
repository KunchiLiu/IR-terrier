	<criteria>Patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 or 4 HCV RNA viral load of ≥100,000 IU/mL No previous exposure to interferon, pegIFNα, or RBV Results of a liver biopsy demonstrating absence of cirrhosis obtained ≤24 months prior to randomization. Compensated cirrhotics with Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection are eligible, but will be capped at 10% of the randomized study population (biopsy can be from any time period prior to randomization) Findings on ultrasound, computed tomography scan, or magnetic resonance imaging 12 months prior to randomization that do not demonstrate evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma Body mass index of 18 to 35 kg/m^2 Positive for hepatitis B or HIV1/HIV2 antibody at screening Evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HCV Evidence of decompensated cirrhosis based on radiologic criteria or biopsy</criteria>
