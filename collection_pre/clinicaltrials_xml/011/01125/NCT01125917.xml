For subjects entering the extension, 4 electrocardiograms (ECGs) are required at entry if none were collected prior to randomization while on BTDS 20. NOTE: Subjects with any 1 QT data corrected for heart rate using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) interval â‰¥ 500 milliseconds (msec) would be discontinued from the extension phase Subjects requiring longacting opioid analgesics [once or twicedaily dosing with a every (q) 24 hours (h) or q12h drug] or transdermal fentanyl during the extension phase should be discontinued from the study.</criteria>
