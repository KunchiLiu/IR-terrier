	<brief_title>Study of Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Their Combination to Treat Restless Legs Syndrome in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RLS is a common problem in hemodialysis patients; 20 to 40% of hemodialysis patients suffer from RLS. Hemodialysis patients have a high oxidative stress status. Oxidative stress has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RLS. Vitamin C and vitamin E are potent antioxidant agents that have already been shown to be effective in the treatment of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in hemodialysis patients. PLMD is closely associated with RLS in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin C, vitamin E and their combination in the treatment of RLS in hemodialysis patients.</detailed_description>
