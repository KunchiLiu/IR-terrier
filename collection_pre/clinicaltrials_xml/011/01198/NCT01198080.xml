	<brief_summary>Avascular necrosis is a disease where there is cellular death (necrosis) of bone components due to interruption of the blood supply. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses. If avascular necrosis involves the bones of a joint, it often leads to destruction of the joint articular surfaces. Avascular necrosis is especially common in the hip joint. A variety of methods are now used to treat avascular necrosis the most common being the total hip replacement, or THR.A new, more promising treatment is hip resurfacing or metal on metal (MOM) resurfacing.Another treatment is utilization of bone marrow derived stem cells.these stem cells can provide angiogenic factors and osteogenic cytokine to improve angiogenesis and bone formation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate the Effect of Bone Marrow Derived Cd133+ Cells in Patient With Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vascular necrosis of femoral head is a debilitating disease resulting from interruption of blood supply to the bone. This pathologic process results in the death of marrow and osteocytes and, in its final stage, femoral head collapse. The most widespread treatment in the early stage of this disease is core decompression. This surgical procedure involves drilling into the femoral neck through the necrotic area, which reduces pressure within the bone and allows more blood vessels to form. This study is designed to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of CD133+ enriched bone marrow infusion adjacent with core decompression in patients with a vascular necrosis of femoral head . Patients will undergo core decompression followed by CD133+cell infusion into the cored area. Clinical assessment includes a MRI, Harries Hip Score,SF36, Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), and the WOMAC osteoarthritis Index.</detailed_description>
