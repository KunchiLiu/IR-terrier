Subject has a Current Pain Intensity during point and flex with the ankle unwrapped rated prior to study entry as ≥ 5 but ≤ 8 on an NPRS (11 point; range 0 to 10; anchors to be "none" and "severe"). 6.

Subject has used nonpharmacologic treatments for the injury within 2 hours prior to the baseline visit (e.g. ice or acupuncture) that may interfere with pain assessments. Subjects on any therapeutic exercise regimen should continue based on the investigator's discretion. Use of iontophoresis is prohibited. 5. Subject has used oral pharmacologic treatments (NSAIDs or analgesic medications) for the injury less than three halflives before the baseline assessments; ibuprofen is permitted prior to baseline as long as it is not within six hours of the baseline assessment aspirin (81325 mg daily) taken prophylactically for cardiovascular reasons is permitted. 6. Subject has used any form of opioid within 24 hours of study entry or used opioids for five or more consecutive days within the 30 days preceding the screening visit. 7. Subject has received systemic corticosteroids in the 30 days preceding the screening visit (e.g., intraarticular, peritendinous, oral, or parenteral administration); topical corticosteroid use is acceptable unless applied to the target joint; and inhaled steroids are acceptable (e.g. Flonase®). 8.

Subject has any pain or medical problem that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with pain measurement of the target joint. 14. Subject has active skin lesions or disease at the intended site of application of the study medication. Skin lesions include open wounds, rash, papules and vesicles; abrasions, lacerations or any break in skin at the intended site of patch application. 15.
