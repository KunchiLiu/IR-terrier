	<brief_summary>This research study is studying racial and genetic biomarkers of response in tissue samples from patients with endometrial cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. DNA analysis of tumor tissue may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Racial and Genetic Biomarkers of Response in Tissue Samples From Patients With Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify racial categorization as the proportion of genetic background of African-American or European-American women with endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC). II. To evaluate the association of racial genetic admixture with clinicopathologic variables and outcomes. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the concordance between racial genetic admixture and self-designated race categorization. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by race (African-American vs European-American) and disease stage (I vs II vs III vs IV). DNA from archived frozen normal tissue samples is genotyped for the ancestry informative markers. Clinicopathological and demographic characteristics associated with each sample are also collected.</detailed_description>
