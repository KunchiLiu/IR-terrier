	<brief_title>Screen of DM by OGTT in Subjects Receiving CAG or MDCT for CAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It had been reported that high prevalence of IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and unknown DM (diabetes mellitus) in patients with CAD (coronary artery disease). This study aimed to determine the glucose regulation status of patients who were suspected to have CAD in central Taiwan. In general, patient who were admitted for CAG (coronary angiography) or MDCT without known DM were eligible. After informed consent, OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) was performed to determine the glucose regulation status. Patients who were diagnosed as new DM would be asked to follow up after 6-12 months with diet control. Treatment with oral anti-diabetic drug may be needed if HbA1c target was not reached.</detailed_description>
