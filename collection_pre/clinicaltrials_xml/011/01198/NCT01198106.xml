	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND:flight simulator have become an important component in pilot training. However, they are known to be associated with motion sickness like symptoms defined as Simulator Sickness (SS). Prevention countermeasures against motion sickness have been studied extensively focusing on cholinergic blockers and antihistamines. Most comparataive studies emphasized the effectiveness of scopolamine over outher agents. Evidence, though, on prophylaxis against SS is sparse. OBJECTIVE: to assess the effectiveness of oral scopolamine versus oral cinnarizine or placebo for SS prevention in helicopter pilots. DESIGN: a prospective, placebo controlled double-blind. SETTING: Israel Air Forse (IAF) Helicopter Aircaft vWeapon System Trainer. PARTICIPANTS: IAF experienced helicopter pilots. INTERVENTION: 0.6 mg oral scopolamine or 50 mg oral cinnarizine or placebo 1 hour before beginning of a 3 sortie simulator training</brief_summary>
