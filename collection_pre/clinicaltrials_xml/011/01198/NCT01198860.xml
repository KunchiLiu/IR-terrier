	<brief_summary>Phyllanthus Urinaria - Adenosma Glutinosum - Eclipta Prostrata - Ascorbic Acid combination plus Tenofovir in treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis B. Method the combination of drugs derived from natural and artificial medicaments. Has stronger effect on immune system, effective good against HBV replication. This is a substantial new insight into the pathogenesis of disease, with a clear path toward clinical application, or which would lead to a substantial advance and perfect in management or public health policy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent studies have proved Phyllanthus Urinaria - Adenosmatis Glutinosum - Eclipta Prostrata - Ascorbic Acid combination plus Tenofovir in treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis B. Method the combination of drugs derived from natural and artificial medicaments. To made a clean jobs for HBV - DNA in the patient's body - hope this is a new step of medicine, will no longer exist phrase "chronic HBV infection " Methods of safety, therapeutic effect on expected cost savings should easily apply to everyone everywhere in the world. According to the investigation and must be called , Chronic HBV infection is an important worldwide cause of morbidity, mortality and source of potential new infections. There are an estimated 350 million carriers of HBV in the world. In China, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10-15% of the population are chronically infected. In North America and Northern Europe, infection and carrier rates are much lower, usually below 1%. Intermediate carrier rates of 1-5% are found in Southern Europe (e.g., Italy, Greece and Spain), parts of South and Central America, the Middle East and Japan. Persistent infection develops in over 90% of perinatally infected children and in 3-10% of people who become infected after the age of 6 years. Worldwide, it has been estimated that more than one million people die annually due to HBV-related end stage diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B is to reduce a patient's risks for progressive liver disease through prolonged suppression and eradication of HBV infection and to arrest or ameliorate HBV-related liver damage.</detailed_description>
