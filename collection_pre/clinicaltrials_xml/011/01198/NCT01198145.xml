	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sulfasalazine may relieve diarrhea in patients with cancer who are undergoing pelvic radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying sulfasalazine to see how well it works in preventing acute diarrhea in patients with cancer who are undergoing pelvic radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sulfasalazine in Preventing Acute Diarrhea in Patients With Cancer Who Are Undergoing Pelvic Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether sulfasalazine is effective in reducing the acute treatment-related diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy as measured by NCI CTC v4.0 in patients receiving pelvic external-beam radiotherapy as adjuvant or primary treatment for malignancy. Secondary - To determine whether sulfasalazine can reduce chronic treatment-related bowel dysfunction following completion of therapy. - To determine whether sulfasalazine causes any toxicity in this situation. Tertiary - To bank blood products for future studies, as part of ongoing research for NCCTG studies (Mayo Clinic Rochester only). (Translational) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to history of anterior resection of the rectum (yes vs no); total planned cumulative dosing, including boost fields of external-beam radiotherapy (4500-5350 cGy vs &gt; 5350 cGy); and concurrent radiosensitizing fluorouracil, capecitabine, or oxaliplatin (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral sulfasalazine twice daily during radiotherapy* and for 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily during radiotherapy* and for 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. NOTE: *Patients must start study treatment by the third radiotherapy fraction. Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then weekly during radiotherapy. All patients complete quality of life and bowel function questionnaires at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and at 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. After completion of radiotherapy, patients are followed up at 6 weeks and at 12 and 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of cancer that supports the use of radiotherapy to the pelvis No current or prior metastases beyond pelvic regional lymph nodes Planning to receive a course of continuous definitive or adjuvant externalbeam radiotherapy to a minimum dose of 4500 cGy with or without fluorouracil, capecitabine, or oxaliplatin Planned course of pelvic radiotherapy must fall within the following parameters: Pelvis must be encompassed by the planned radiotherapy fields Superior border may not lie superior to the L45 interspace and may not be inferior to the most inferior aspect of the sacroiliac joints Portions of the rectum may have special blocking, depending upon disease site Total planned dose to the central axis midplane (for APPA parallel opposed fields) or isocenter (for 3 or 4field techniques) for the pelvic field must lie between 45005300 cGy (inclusive)* Subsequent to completion of treatment to the pelvic field, a boost to primary tumor or tumor bed may be planned Planned treatment is to be given 45 times per week on a onetreatmentperday basis Daily dose (specified at central axis midplane or at isocenter for multifield techniques) must lie between 170210 cGy (inclusive) per day* NOTE: *For institutions that do not use midplane or isocenter as the point for specification of dose, it will be necessary to determine the dose according to the methods specified above in order to determine patient eligibility. No perineal irradiation planned (e.g., anal cancer patients, patients who have had an abdominalperineal resection) No brachytherapy planned before the completion of all externalbeam radiotherapy No planned splitcourse radiotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 02 Life expectancy ≥ 6 months Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL Leukocytes ≥ 3,500/mm^3 ANC ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AST ≤ 1.5 times ULN Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Willing to provide blood specimens as required by the study (Mayo Clinic Rochester patients only) Able to complete questionnaires alone or with assistance No history of inflammatory bowel disease No history of gastrointestinal or genitourinary obstruction or porphyria No history of G6PD deficiency No history of irritable bowel syndrome No history of blood dyscrasia No history of severe allergies or asthma No history of hepatic or renal disease No diarrhea ≥ grade 3, rectal bleeding, abdominal cramping, or incontinence of stool within the past week No medical condition that may interfere with the ability to receive study treatment No known allergy to sulfasalazine, sulfa medications, salicylates, or any known component of drug formulation PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics No prior pelvic radiotherapy No prior abdominalperineal resection, Hartmann procedure, or other surgical procedure leaving the patient without a functioning rectum No planned use of leucovorin or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents concurrent with radiotherapy (except for fluorouracil, capecitabine, or oxaliplatin) No other concurrent sulfasalazine No concurrent digoxin</criteria>
