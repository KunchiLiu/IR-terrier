	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose cholecalciferol works in treating patients receiving combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Cholecalciferol during treatment may delay the development of colorectal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving cholecalciferol together with combination chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the relative rate of metastatic colorectal cancer patients who achieve 25-D3 levels &gt;= 40 ng/ml at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks, and 32 weeks from starting FOLFOX (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation (cholecalciferol). II. To estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS) of metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the response rate (RR) and the median overall survival (OS) of metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation. II. To describe the safety of this combination by capturing all treatment-related toxicity as per National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4 guidelines. OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol orally (PO) once daily. Patients also receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, oxaliplatin* IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours once a week. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Treatment with oxaliplatin is discontinued after course 8. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and then 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
