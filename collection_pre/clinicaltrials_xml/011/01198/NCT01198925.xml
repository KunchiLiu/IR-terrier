	<brief_summary>Piperacillin-tazobactam is an acylureido-penicillin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination and is frequently used in the empirical treatment of hospital-acquired infections because of its antipseudomonal activity. Similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, piperacillin-tazobactam exhibits time-dependent killing and the T &gt; MIC appears to be the best outcome predictor. Because a majority of infections are treated empirically, it is necessary to achieve a T &gt; MIC equal to 50% of the dosing interval (50% T &gt; MIC) against the most likely pathogens, including those with only moderate susceptibility The aim of this study is to compare the same dose of piperacillin/tazobactam administered by an extended infusion versus a continuous infusion. A pharmacokinetic study will be performed in patients treated by extended (loading dose 4 G/30 min followed by 4 X 4 G /3h) and continuous infusion (loading dose 4 G/30 min followed by 16G /24h). A population pharmacokinetic analysis with Monte Carlo simulations will be used to determine 95% probability of target attainment (PTA95) versus MIC</brief_summary>
