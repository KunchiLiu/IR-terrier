	<brief_summary>This is a CCTG sponsored trial in collaboration with UCSD-AVRC investigators to get more information about the methods that are used on the internet to provide information on how to reduce the risk of giving or getting infections that are often or usually passed from one person to another during sexual or intimate contact (sexually transmitted infection (STI)). STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. The purpose of this study is to develop methods that will allow someone who is living with HIV an easy way that they can get information and learn of ways on their own that can decrease their chances of getting sexually transmitted infections and ways that they can reduce the chance that they may transmit HIV to others.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection, as documented by any licensed screening antibody test, such as ELISA, and confirmed by a second antibody test, such as Western blot, or detectable plasma HIV1 RNA at any time prior to study entry. If an ELISA or Western Blot are not available, HIV infection may be documented by two HIV RNA values &gt; 2000 copies/mL, drawn at least 24 hours apart. The HIV RNA assays should have been run at a CLIA approved laboratory or equivalent. 18 years of age or older. Male. At least one of the following: An HIV negative or unknown status sexual partner in the past three months. A sexually transmitted disease in the past 1 year (other than HIV).
