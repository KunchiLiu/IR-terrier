	<brief_summary>The urgent need for new effective therapy for T-cell lymphoma patients and promising results observed so far in trials with RAD001(everolimus, mTOR inhibitor) strongly warrants the investigation of RAD001 combined with CHOP as a first-line treatment in peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients. Thus, we designed a phase I/II study with the combination of RAD001 with CHOP chemotherapy for newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients. Phase I 1. Primary objective : To define the maximum tolerable dose 2. Secondary objective - To evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 - Pharmacogenomic profiling Phase II 1. Primary objective : To evaluate the overall response rate 2. Secondary objective - To estimate the time to progression - To estimate overall survival - Pharmacogenomic profiling</brief_summary>
