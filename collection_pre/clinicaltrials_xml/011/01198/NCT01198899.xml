	<criteria>All patients over 18 years undergoing a routine echocardiography in the participating hospitals Both genders will be considered. Patients can be included if on 2D echocardiography the maximal septal wall thickness &gt; 13 mm and/or the posterior wall thickness &gt; 13 mm. The limit for inclusion is kept relatively low to detect early forms of Fabry cardiomyopathy.</criteria>
