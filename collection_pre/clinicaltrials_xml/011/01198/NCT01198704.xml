	<brief_summary>Results of liver transplantation, the best theoretical treatment for HCC, are limited by tumor recurrence. In order to limit this risk Milan criteria was proposed in 1996. However, these criteria are to restrictive and approximately 40% of patients denied by Milan criteria may be cured by liver transplantation. The purpose of this study was thus to prospectively evaluate factors predicting tumor recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC and then to reassessed criteria for liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Factors Predicting Tumor Recurrence After Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators studied the predictive value of imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, PET scan, of serological markers and molecular markers assessed before liver transplantation at listing. The investigators also evaluated the predictive value of tumor growing during the waiting time (imaging and serological). Finally, the investigators compared pre-LT data and explanted liver analysis to evaluate accuracy of liver biopsy and of imaging.</detailed_description>
