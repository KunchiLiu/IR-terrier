	<brief_summary>A correlation between deep anesthesia (defined as time with Bispectral Index (BIS) lower than 45) and death within 1 yr after surgery has previously been reported. In order to confirm or refute these findings, the investigators have designed a study which compares two methods of administration for total intravenous anesthesia (propofol and remifentanil): - manual administration: the anesthesiologists are instructed to maintain the BIS value between 40 and 60. - closed loop administration: an algorithm is used to maintain the BIS value between 40 and 60. Based on previous studies, the amount of time that BIS is maintained above 40 is greater when anesthetics agents are administered using closed loop compared with manual administration.</brief_summary>
