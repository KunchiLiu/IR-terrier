	<brief_summary>The study is prospectively initiated to: (1) evaluate the alterations in platelet function to aspirin therapy and the prevalence of aspirin resistance in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis, and (2) compare the incidence of vascular events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, stroke, vascular access thrombosis, or revascularization procedure) and the safety profile among placebo-treated, aspirin-resistant and aspirin-sensitive patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patients with endstage renal disease who are undergoing longterm hemodialysis. Patients will be excluded if there is evidence of a recent history of acute uremia, previous adverse reaction to a aspirin or history of aspirin hypersensitivity (eg, aspirininduced asthma or angioedema), concurrent treatment with other antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel or ticlopidine), steroidal drugs, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, high immediate risk for bleeding (eg, active peptic ulceration, recent injury, or hemophilia), or lifethreatening condition other than endstage renal disease or vascular disease (eg, nonskin cancer).</criteria>
