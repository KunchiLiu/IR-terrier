	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer is generally susceptible to immunotherapeutic measures. The investigators will characterize 40 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer regarding the existence and frequency of tumorspecific T-cells and regulatory T cells. The found data will be correlated to clinical data such as the cancer-specific survival and the response to chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that those patients with a high number of Tregs and no tumor-specific T-cells have a worse prognosis.</brief_summary>
