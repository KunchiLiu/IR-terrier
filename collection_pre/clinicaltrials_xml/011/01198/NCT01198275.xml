	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of n-3 PUFAs in addition to amiodarone and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on the maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical conversion in patients with persistent Atrial fibrillation (AF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) in the Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and represents an increasing burden on the healthcare system. Treatment of AF remains controversial. In patients on antiarrhythmic therapy, the one-year relapse rates of AF after cardioversion ranges from 44% to 77% at one year and amiodarone appears to the be the most effective in maintaining sinus rhythm.Over the last few years, a growing amount of evidences has supported the protective effects of n-3 PUFAs in preventing ventricular arrhythmias and reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, in the last years, the interest for their possible beneficial role in AF prevention has been increasing.We hypothesized that the administration of n-3 PUFAs could reduce the AF recurrence rate more than amiodarone plus RAAS inhibitors in patients with persistent AF. Therefore the present study aims to evaluate the role of n-3 PUFAs in the prophylaxis of AF recurrences after DCCV in addition to amiodarone and RAS blockers therapy in patients with persistent AF.</detailed_description>
