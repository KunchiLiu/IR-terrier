	<brief_summary>We hope to find safer, noninvasive methods for measuring tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia, meaning a lack of oxygen, has been associated strongly with a wide range of human cancers. Hypoxia occurs when tumor growth exceeds the ability of blood vessels to supply the tumor with oxygenated blood. It is currently understood that hypoxic tumors are more aggressive. Current methods for measuring hypoxia include invasive procedures such as tissue biopsy, or insertion of an electrode into the tumor. EF5-PET may be a non-invasive way to make this measurement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging and Biomarkers of Hypoxia in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish PET imaging with the tracer FMISO as an accurate and reliable method for measuring the oxygen content of a tumor and to establish the measurement of secreted markers in blood as an accurate and reliable method for measuring the oxygen content of a tumor.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>3.1.1 Eligible Diseases Any solid tumor malignancies of any stage meeting all of the following criteria: Minimum tumor dimension is at least 1 cm (to ensure it is above the detection threshold of PET imaging). Examples include but are not limited to: locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck to be treated by either initial surgery or primary chemoradiotherapy; inoperable nonsmall cell lung cancer or pancreatic carcinoma to be treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, which may be biopsied again at the time of percutaneous needle delivery of implanted fiducial markers. 3.1.2 Allowable type and amount of prior therapy: Patients with newly diagnosed malignancies should not have initiated treatment for their disease before participating in this study. Patients with recurrent or second malignancies may have had prior therapy as appropriate for their disease, but should have completed all prior treatment at least 30 days before participation in this study and should not have initiated new treatment for the current problem. 3.1.4 Patients must be greater than or equal to eighteen years of age. 3.1.5 ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Status will not be employed, but patients will need to be sufficiently healthy to tolerate all study procedures. 3.1.6 Requirements for organ and marrow function are not applicable to this study, but function will need to be sufficient to undergo planned therapy. 3.1.7 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
