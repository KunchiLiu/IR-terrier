	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - Investigate the possible role of the CYP2C19 genotype in Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation after administration of a standard dose regimen of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg/day for 4 days) in healthy male and female subjects Secondary Objectives: - Assess the pharmacodynamic activity of a higher dose regimen of clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose followed by 150 mg/day for 4 days) - Compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of clopidogrel active metabolite between the selected groups of genotyped subjects and the 2 dose regimen</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Study of 2 Different Dose Regimen of Clopidogrel in CYP2C19 Genotyped Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration per subject is 10-12 weeks broken down as follows: - Screening: 2 to 40 days before the first dosing - Period 1: 7 days including 5 days treatment - Washout: At least 14 days after the last dosing - Period 2: 7 days including 5 days treatment - End of study: 7 to 10 days after the last dosing</detailed_description>
