	<criteria>Macular edema persisting for more than 3 months period despite conventional medication. Central retinal vein occlusion is confirmed by slitlamp biomicroscopy and fluorescein angiography (FLAG). Patients randomized into ranibizumabtreated group do not receive macular laser treatment. Macular edema is defined by OCT: the thickness of central foveal area calculated by macular map analysis is above 280 μm and/or retinal thickness is above 330 μm at any region of the macula calculated by retinal thickness analysis. Baseline visual acuity is less than 64 ETDRS letters (or 0.4 decimal equivalent). Diabetes mellitus Additional vitreoretinal diseases History of pars plana vitrectomy Previous macular grid laser treatment Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonid treatment Complicated cataract surgery Advanced glaucomatous damage of optic nerve head Cataract (except mild, defined as grade 1 nuclear sclerosis and/or grade 1 posterior subcapsular cataract) Agerelated macular degeneration Pregnancy and lactation Women in childbearing potential who are not using double safe contraception</criteria>
