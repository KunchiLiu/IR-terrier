	<brief_title>The Intravascular Cooling in the Treatment of Stroke 2/3 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A stroke is usually caused by a blockage in one of the arteries that carries blood to the brain. Research has shown that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)—a naturally occurring protein that opens blocked arteries by dissolving blood clots — activates the body's ability to dissolve recently formed blood clots and reduces or prevents the brain damage caused by a stroke. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of tPA for people having a stroke when taken within 3 hours of stroke onset. Researchers believe that a lower body temperature (hypothermia) may be beneficial while a stroke is happening because hypothermia may prevent further brain injury, or may make the stroke less damaging. Patients will receive a standard stroke evaluation, which includes blood tests, a computed tomography (CT) scan, complete physical and neurological examinations, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) to determine eligibility for the study. There are two study groups - tPA alone or tPA with cooling (hypothermia). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study groups. Length of participation (including observation after the patient leaves the hospital) is 90 days. This study is part of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS), which allows researchers to enhance and initiate translational research that ultimately will benefit stroke patients by treating more patients in less than 2 hours, and finding ways to treat additional patients later.</detailed_description>

Able to begin endovascular phase of hypothermia within 2 hours of tPA completion 6. Written Informed Consent, signed and dated by the patient (or patient's authorized representative) 1. Etiology other than ischemic stroke 2. Item 1a on NIHSS &gt; 1 at the time of randomization 3. Clinical symptoms consistent with brainstem or cerebellar stroke 4. Classic lacunar syndrome with imaging confirmation of small deep ischemia, but randomization will not be delayed for neuroimaging other than initial scan to exclude hemorrhage 5. Known contraindications to hypothermia, such as known hematologic dyscrasias that affect thrombosis (cryoglobulinemia, Sickle cell disease, serum cold agglutinins), or vasospastic disorders such as Raynaud's or thromboangiitis obliterans 6. Known comorbid conditions that are likely to complicate therapy in the opinion of the investigator, e.g., i. Heart failure (NYHA class III and IV)* ii. Uncompensated arrhythmia iii. Severe Liver disease iv. History of pelvic or abdominal mass likely to compress inferior vena cava v. IVC filters vi. HIV positive vii. Clinically active hypo or hyperthyroidism viii. Renal insufficiency likely to impair meperidine clearance ix. Chronic ethanol abuse x. History of HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia) 7. Pregnancy (All women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, urine or blood, prior to therapy.) 8. Medical conditions likely to interfere with patient assessment. 9. Known allergy to meperidine or buspirone 10. Currently taking or used within previous 14 days MAOI class of medication. 11. Life expectancy &lt; 6 months 12. Not likely to be available for longterm followup 13. Use, or planned use, of intraarterial thrombolysis, mechanical clot removal, or other experimental or approved acute therapy for this stroke event 14. Chest radiograph or clinical presentation suggestive of pneumonia or clinically significant pulmonary edema at baseline. 15. Temperature upon admission greater than or equal to 38°C</criteria>
