	<brief_summary>To compare radiographic data collection from patients undergoing instrumented PLF with CopiOs(R) BVF or instrumented PLF with autologous bone and to assess overall clinical outcomes. Patients will serve as self controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CopiOs Posterolateral Fusion Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, counter-balanced study involving 85 subjects at up to 8 investigative centers. Each subject will be an appropriate candidate for an instrumented PLF and will meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects will undergo an instrumented, pedicle screw PLF procedure. Autograft or other interbody devices identified by the surgeon to be in the best interest of the patient may be used. Enrolled patients will receive CopiOs BVF sponge soaked with bone marrow aspirate on one side and autologous bone on the other side. All patients will receive both CopiOs BVF and autologous bone. Patients will serve as self-controls in this counter-balanced study. Data will be collected pre-operatively, operatively and post-operatively at six and twelve months. The study objectives include: Radiographic success of CopiOs is non-inferior to autograft with clear evidence of bridging bone. Radiographic analysis will be used to show that CopiOs works as well as autograft when comparing the rate of fusion at 6 and 12 months. The CT scan (12 month) will show that CopiOs works as well as autograft when comparing the fusion mass between the transverse processes. Additionally, clinical success will be determined by an improvement of 15 percentage points using the Oswestry Disability Index and maintenance or improvement in the motor and sensory components of the neurological assessment from preoperative to postoperative. Since patients serve as self-controls there will be no clinical success comparisons between the groups. Rather, clinical success will be measured on overall improvement based on patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
