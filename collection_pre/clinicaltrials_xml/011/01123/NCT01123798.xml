	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to define the reliability and accuracy of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in the detection of intra-compartmental tissue perfusion in injured and noninjured extremities over time. The investigators hypothesize that this technology, combined with vital signs, intracompartmental pressures and clinical examinations, will be useful in diagnosing acute compartment syndrome (ACS), monitoring patients at risk for ACS, and evaluating the adequacy of fasciotomy in patients treated for ACS.</brief_summary>
