	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: 1. To determine whether an educational intervention designed based on studies in the area is effective in increasing acceptance of surgery and presentation to the hospital, when adjusting for a number of potential determinants of service uptake; 2. To assess short-term impact of the educational intervention on knowledge about cataract and attitudes toward locally-available surgical services.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Guangdong Uptake of Surgery Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>China is home to the 18% of the world's blind people, an estimated 6.6 million. In China, cataract is the leading cause of blindness. In Guangdong, current counseling measures for patients diagnosed with cataract are minimal and often lack adequate descriptions of what cataract is, what causes cataract, and benefits/risks of surgery. A counseling session for cataract patients and family members, conducted by a trained nurse during outreach screening, may increase subsequent attendance at pre-operative examination, acceptance of cataract surgery, and attendance at follow-up examinations. An integral part of this counseling is a short movie consisting of testimony from a former cataract patient who underwent surgery ("pseudophakic motivator"). The use of pseudophakic motivators have been shown to be effective in increasing surgical uptake. In addition, a previously validated "Barriers Questionnaire" will be used to assess predictors of of hospital attendance, surgery acceptance, and follow-up attendance in the categories of cost, transportation, knowledge, and concerns about quality.</detailed_description>
