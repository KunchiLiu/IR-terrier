	<brief_summary>Post-stroke shoulder pain is a major rehabilitation problem affecting moderate to severely impaired stroke survivors. Surface electrical stimulation (ES) of muscles surrounding the hemiparetic shoulder has been demonstrated to be beneficial, but despite the evidence for therapeutic benefit, the clinical implementation of surface ES for poststroke shoulder pain has been difficult. In order to address the limitations of surface ES, the investigative team pioneered the development of percutaneous intramuscular (IM) ES for the treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain. However, prior to acceptance by the clinical community, additional gaps in the scientific and clinical knowledge need to be addressed. This study begins to do so. The primary objective is to estimate the relative pain reduction associated with IM ES vs. "usual care." We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit a larger effect size with respect to pain reduction compared to "usual care". A secondary objective is to estimate the effect on health related QOL of IM ES vs. "usual care." Demonstration of improvement in QOL will validate the clinical relevance of the intervention. We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit greater improvement in health related QOL compared to "usual care".</brief_summary>
