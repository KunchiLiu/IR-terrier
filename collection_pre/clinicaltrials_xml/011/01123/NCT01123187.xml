	<brief_title>Islet Cell Transplantation in Patients With Type I Diabetes With Previous Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The beneficial effects of glycemic control on both survival and function of transplanted kidneys in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus have been recognized. The purpose of this study is to reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency, by islet cell transplantation, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who have a stable kidney allograft. The study primary efficacy endpoint is graft survival defined as insulin independence and HbA1c &lt; 6.5% at 1 year post first transplant. Secondary outcomes are graft function and metabolic control The immunosuppression protocol for the kidney graft was converted to sirolimus+tacrolimus regimen 6 months before islet transplantation to exclude negative effects on kidney graft function.</detailed_description>
