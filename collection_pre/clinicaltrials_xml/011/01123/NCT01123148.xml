	<brief_summary>The investigators want to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) that will eventually allow people who are completely paralyzed to independently control the tilt feature on their power wheelchairs. This study will allow healthy volunteers to test the feasibility and accuracy of controlling a BCI using only their brain signals while seated in a tilting wheelchair.</brief_summary>
