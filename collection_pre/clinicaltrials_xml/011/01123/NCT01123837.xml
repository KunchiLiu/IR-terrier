	<brief_summary>"The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to see if giving dextrose fluid in the veins (IV) decreases the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in female urologic, gynecologic and breast outpatient surgery patients and at what blood surgery level. The reason for this study is that IV dextrose has been shown to decrease the incidence of PONV and the use of medications to treat PONV, while leading to sooner discharge after surgery. This can decrease overall healthcare cost and improving patient satisfaction."</brief_summary>
