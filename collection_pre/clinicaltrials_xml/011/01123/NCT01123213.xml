	<brief_summary>Pessaries are mechanical support devices worn vaginally to treat the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, such as vaginal pressure or a vaginal bulge. Pessaries are one of the options along with surgery and expectant management for pelvic organ prolapse. As the aging population grows, more patients will need treatment for pelvic organ prolapse. Various studies have been conducted previously to identify patient parameters predictive of successful pessary fitting and continued use. Our study is a retrospective chart review to identify patient characteristics predictive of successful pessary fitting and use, specifically focusing on the parameters of POPQ, pelvic organ prolapse quantification exam, and the ratio of the genital hiatus, which is the length of the vaginal opening, and total vaginal length.</brief_summary>
