	<brief_summary>Islet transplants for those with type 1 diabetes have enabled many to initially eliminate insulin, however, only a fraction of the transplanted cells typically survive and the functioning of these decrease over time. As a result, most patients will eventually require some insulin. Currently, the cause of this poor survival and decrease in function is not understood; although previous research has demonstrated that even a slightly elevated level of blood glucose can impair islet function. This study will determine if strict blood glucose control at the time of islet transplantation, when the cells are the most fragile, will improve the survival and functioning of transplanted islet cells three months after transplantation.</brief_summary>
