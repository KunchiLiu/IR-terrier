	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving erlotinib hydrochloride may help doctors learn more about the effects of erlotinib hydrochloride on cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers predicting response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with erlotinib hydrochloride.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Predicting Response in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Erlotinib Hydrochloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate whether serum NGAL, MMP-9, NGAL/MMP-9 complex, and soluble E-cadherin can be utilized as biomarkers to predict response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride. OUTLINE: Serum samples are analyzed for NGAL, MMP-9, NGAL/MMP-9, and soluble E-cadherin by ELISA and Luminex assays.</detailed_description>
