	<brief_summary>DEFEND-2 is a Phase 3 confirmatory study for the Phase 3 DEFEND-1 study. The study objective is to find out if an 8-day series of otelixizumab infusions leads to greater improvement in insulin secretion as compared with placebo. Insulin secretion will be assessed using mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide. Subjects will be assigned to receive either otelixizumab or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 (2/3 otelixizumab, 1/3 placebo). These study agents will be administered as an addition to insulin, diet, and other standard of care treatments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following visits are required: - Screening Visits: 2 to 3 appointments will be conducted to determine eligibility. At 2 of these visits participants will drink a liquid meal and have blood tests done over the post-meal period. Participants will also be required to wear a continuous glucose monitor for a short period of time. - Dosing Visits: 8 outpatient visits on consecutive days, each lasting about 2-4 hours. - Follow-up Visits: weekly for the first month, then every 2 weeks for 3 months, followed by monthly visits through 1 year. There will be 3 visits in the second year. - The total duration of the study is 2 years. - Glucose test strips and glucose monitors will be provided to participants for the duration of the study. Frequent glycemic monitoring will occur through lab testing and blood glucose self-monitoring to help facilitate tight glycemic control in all subjects. Subjects will be asked to intermittently record their insulin doses using a telephone or web based system and continuous glucose monitoring will be performed every 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ages 1217 Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, consistent with ADA criteria No more than 90 days between diagnosis and administration of study compounds Requires insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus, or has required insulin at some time between diagnosis and administration of study compounds. In Canada, has to be using insulin at the time of dosing. Stimulated Cpeptide level greater than 0.20 nmol/L and less than or equal to 3.50 nmol/L Positive for one or more of the autoantibodies typically associated with T1DM: antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti‑GAD); antibody to protein tyrosine phosphataselike protein (anti‑IA‑2); zinc transporter autoantibodies (ZNT8); insulin autoantibodies (IAA). A subject who is positive for insulin autoantibodies (IAA) and negative for the other autoantibodies will only be eligible if the subject has used insulin for less than 7 days total. •Other, significant medical conditions based on the study doctor's evaluation</criteria>
