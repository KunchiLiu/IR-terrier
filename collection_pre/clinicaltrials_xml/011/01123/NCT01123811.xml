	<brief_summary>Based on the current promising results with irinotecan and cetuximab in patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer, and the excellent results of Irinotecan and 5-FU in gastric cancer , the present clinical study to evaluate the overall response rate, the time to progression and the overall survival of the combined treatment of cetuximab and irinotecan and 5-FU in patients with esophagogastric cancer is urgently needed.</brief_summary>
