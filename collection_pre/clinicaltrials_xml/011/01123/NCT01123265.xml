	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether DC-STAMP, a protein on the surface of osteoclast precursors (OCPs), can be used as a biologic marker in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). With this marker the investigators hope to learn more about how OCPs develop as well as find out if DC-STAMP predicts PsA severity and how well treatment works in PsA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder, is characterized by joint damage observed in over half of the patients with early disease. While anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents have greatly improved signs and symptoms and lessened joint damage, the fact that only a fraction of patients achieve complete remission underscores the tremendous unmet need for this population. To date, a biomarker that can stratify patients by severity and can serve as a leading indicator of treatment response has not been identified. Our laboratory demonstrated that circulating osteoclast precursors (OCP) are elevated in PsA patients. OCP decline rapidly following anti-TNF therapy and levels are higher in subjects with erosive arthritis compared to those with no x-ray changes. The OCP are derived from CD14+ monocytes and the assay entails culture techniques that are costly, expensive and labor intensive. We developed an antibody (1A2) to Dendritic Cell Specific Transmembrane Protein (DC-STAMP), a potential marker of the OCP population, for analysis by flow cytometry. We found that: 1) the level of monocyte DC-STAMP expression correlated with in vitro osteoclast formation; 2) DC-STAMP expression is significantly elevated in PBMC from PsA subjects compared to controls; 3) TNF dramatically upregulated the expression of DC-STAMP in vitro; 4) DC-STAMP surface expression declined following anti-TNF therapy; 5) subsets of CD3+ cells also express DC-STAMP on the cell membrane. Based on these preliminary data, three hypotheses are proposed: 1. DC-STAMP+ CD3+ T cells belong to the Th17 subset which facilitates OC generation; 2. DC-STAMP is a marker of disease severity in PsA; 3. DC-STAMP is a biomarker of treatment response in PsA. We propose three Specific Aims to test these hypotheses. Aim 1 To examine whether DC-STAMP+CD3+ cells belong to the Th17 cell subset, PBMC will be stained with Th17-specific antibodies in PsA subjects with elevated DC-STAMP expression. We will also examine the role of T cells in osteoclastogenesis directly by co-culture experiments and we will use monocyte cultures without added lymphocytes as controls. The expression of DC-STAMP on circulating dendritic cells will be examined ex vivo with 11-color flow cytometry. Aim 2 To determine if increased DC-STAMP expression is associated with more severe features of PsA, DC-STAMP expression in 40 PsA subjects will be determined and correlated with clinical variables of arthritis and skin disease, CRP and x-ray damage. Aim 3 To examine if DC-STAMP is a response marker to anti-TNF treatment, we will recruit 20 PsA patients in Aim 2 with elevated DC-STAMP expression and divide them into 2 groups. Ten subjects will receive methotrexate, and ten will receive anti-TNF therapy. The correlation between DC-STAMP variables (percentage of 1A2+ divided by 1A2 - cells X 100) and the variables detailed in Aim 2 will be analyzed in these 2 treatment groups at 2 different time points.</detailed_description>
