	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term clinical impact of routine follow-up coronary angiography after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary endpoint is a composite of death/myocardial infarction/stroke/emergency hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome/hospitalization for congestive heart failure at 3-year after percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Routine Follow-up Coronary Angiography After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine follow-up coronary angiography after percutaneous coronary intervention has been performed to detect restenosis in a lot of PCI centers in Japan. On the other hand, previous studies reported that routine follow-up coronary angiography might lead to unnecessary reinterventions in asymptomatic patients. In this situation, the effect of routine follow-up coronary angiography on long-term clinical outcomes remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term clinical impact of routine follow-up coronary angiography after PCI compared with clinical follow-up alone. The primary endpoint of this study is a composite of death/myocardial infarction/stroke/emergency hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome/hospitalization for congestive heart failure at three-year after percutaneous coronary intervention. The design of this study is almost all-comer design enrolling patients received PCI without any exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
