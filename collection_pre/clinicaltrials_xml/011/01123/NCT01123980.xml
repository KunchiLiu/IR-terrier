	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the blood sugar lowering effect of biphasic insulin aspart 30 once daily compared to insulin glargine once daily both in combination with metformin and glimepiride in Chinese and Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes who have never received insulin before. The trial is conducted as a phase 4 trial in China and phase 3 in Japan.</brief_summary>
