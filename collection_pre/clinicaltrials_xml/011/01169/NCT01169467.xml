	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of using dexmedetomidine (Precedex) in addition to the current standard-of-care for sedation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Using Precedex and Other Sedatives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primarily, this study seeks to explore whether there is a difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) variability, incidence of intracranial hypertension, intracranial pressure (ICP) variability, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity index (PRx) in two groups of subjects. Patients must be submitted to the ICU and be endotracheally intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with continuous IV sedation for less than 24 hours after recruitment into the study.</detailed_description>
