	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare patient-led titration (intervention group) versus physician-led titration (usual standard of care) in optimizing the clinical use of insulin glargine in an Asian population of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Secondary Objectives: To determine the difference in glycemic control, safety, quality of life and treatment satisfaction between patient-led titration and usual care.</brief_summary>
