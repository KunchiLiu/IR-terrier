	<brief_summary>Nitrate provides the body with an alternative source of Nitric Oxide which plays a large role in promoting blood flow and reducing blood pressure. Nitrate supplementation with vegetable/fruit juice has recently been shown to reduce blood pressure and reduce energy expenditure during low intensity exercise. Such findings combined with the previously known biological effects of nitric oxide would suggest that nitrate supplementation would also impact on blood flow. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation via vegetable/fruit juice drink on cerebral (brain) blood flow (using Near Infrared Spectroscopy).</brief_summary>
