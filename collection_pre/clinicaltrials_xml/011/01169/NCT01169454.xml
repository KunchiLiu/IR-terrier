	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore two currently accepted methods of intracranial pressure (ICP) management through cerebral spinal fluid (CRF) drainage for patients diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This is a randomized observational study of two physician-prescribed approaches to managing ICP monitoring and CSF drainage for SAH patients. The study will enroll only those patients who have ICP monitoring. Because this is an observational study, there are no physical risks to the patient, the only risk is loss of confidentiality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who require intracranial pressure (ICP) management through cerebral spinal fluid (CRF) drainage will be eligible for this study. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two currently accepted methods of ICP management. The first is ICP monitoring with intermittent CSF drainage and the second is through continuous CSF drainage at set pressure thresholds.</detailed_description>
