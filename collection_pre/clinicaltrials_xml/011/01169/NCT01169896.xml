	<brief_summary>Observational study is evaluating Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)/Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) thérapies as a function of ventricular pacing</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Ventricular Pacing in Unselected ICD/CRT-D Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol consists in a non-interventional multi-centre, prospective study. The observational study will also answer the question of the impact of ventricular pacing on the outcome of patients implanted with ICD &amp; CRT-D devices and how the ICD &amp; CRT-D devices are used in clinical practice through two years follow-up.</detailed_description>
