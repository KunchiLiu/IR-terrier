	<brief_summary>The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial in 25,874 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (OmacorÂ® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these illnesses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial of vitamin D (in the form of vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Existing data from laboratory studies, epidemiologic research, small primary prevention trials, and/or large secondary prevention trials strongly suggest that these nutritional agents may reduce risk for cancer or cardiovascular disease, but large primary prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations are lacking. Eligible participants were assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to one of four groups: (1) daily vitamin D3 and omega-3; (2) daily vitamin D3 and omega-3 placebo; (3) daily vitamin D placebo and omega-3; or (4) daily vitamin D placebo and omega-3 placebo. Participants had an equal chance of being assigned to any of these four groups and a 3 out of 4 chance of getting at least one active agent. Participants in all groups take two pills each day -- one softgel that contains either vitamin D3 or vitamin D placebo and one capsule that contains either omega-3 or omega-3 placebo. Participants receive their study pills in convenient calendar packages via U.S. mail. Participants also fill out a short (15-20 minute) questionnaire each year. The questionnaire asks about health; lifestyle habits such as physical exercise, diet, and smoking; use of medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness, and new medical diagnoses. Occasionally, participants may receive a phone call from study staff to collect information or to clarify responses on the questionnaire. At baseline, 16,956 VITAL participants provided an optional blood sample. Approximately 6,000 of these participants will provide a follow-up blood sample during years 1-4 of the trial. At baseline and year 2 of the trial, a subcohort of 1,054 VITAL participants living within driving distance of Boston, Massachusetts received detailed in-clinic health assessments at the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) of Brigham and Women's Hospital. During CTSC visits, participants have a clinical exam, including measurement of height, weight, other anthropometrics, blood pressure, and physical performance. They also provide fasting blood and urine samples, and undergo 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing, lung function testing (spirometry), electrocardiograms, bone mineral density testing, 2D-echocardiography, and assessments of thinking and mood.</detailed_description>
