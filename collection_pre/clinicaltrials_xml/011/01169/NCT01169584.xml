	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) in pediatric patients with advanced/metastatic, unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy and/or the patient does not tolerate standard therapies. Tumors are likely to include neuroblastoma, lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Benign tumors are excluded. These tumor types were selected because evidence of biological activity was observed in cancer cells lines and ex vivo infected primary human tissue samples, specifically pediatric cancer types such as sarcomas and neuroblastomas.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age between 2 and 21 years Histologicallyconfirmed, advanced/metastatic nonCNS solid tumor that is relapsed and/or refractory to standard therapy (progressive disease despite therapy) and/or the patient does not tolerate standard therapy. NonCNS solid tumors are eligible and are likely to include such histologies as neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Cancer is not surgically resectable for cure At least one measurable tumor mass by CT/MRI (i.e. lesion that can accurately be measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 1 cm) and that can be injected by direct visualization/palpitation or by imagingguidance (CT or ultrasound) Expected survival for approximately 8 weeks or longer Lansky Score ≥ 50 Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 × ULN AST, ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN (if liver tumor(s) present: AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.8 x ULN INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN Hematologic parameters: Patients can be transfused to meet these entry criteria. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL For bone marrow negative patients: ANC ≥ 750 cells/ mm3 and platelet count ≥ 75,000 plts/mm3 For bone marrow positive patients: ANC ≥ 750 cells/ mm3. Platelet count recovery is not a requirement, but platelets should be transfused to ≥ 75,000 plts/ mm3 prior to treatment. CD4 count ≥ 200/mm3. Patients who demonstrate intact delayedtype hypersensitivity (DTH) via skin immune response to common antigens (e.g. candida, mumps) are also eligible. For patients who are sexually active, able and willing to abstain from sexual activity for 3 weeks following treatment with JX594. Thereafter, able and willing to use accepted birth control methods through 3 months after last treatment with JX594. [Acceptable birth control methods include contraceptive pills, condom, IUD, diaphragm or sponge + spermicide, or other methods with &gt;97% effectiveness] Able and willing to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Research Ethics Board (REB)approved written consent form (patient and/ or parents/guardians). Able and willing to comply with study procedures and followup examinations, including compliance with the "Infection Control Guidelines for Patients" contained within the written consent form (patient and/ or parents/guardians). Pregnant or nursing infant Injected tumor(s) in location that would potentially result in significant clinical adverse effects if posttreatment tumor swelling were to occur or if deemed unsafe by investigator (e.g. tumors impinging on the upper airway or affecting biliary tract drainage, adherent to and/or invading a major vascular structure, CNS, etc.) Brain metastases, unless surgically resected and/or irradiated. (Brain metastases cannot be considered as a site for injection). Patients with lymphomas Use of high dose systemic corticosteroids or other immune suppressive medication within 3 weeks of first treatment (e.g. cortisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, interferon, cisplatin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, etc.). * Note: patients taking lowdose corticosteroids for the treatment of nausea and/or taking maintenance corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency are permitted to enroll. Known infection with HIV or known underlying genetic immunodeficiency disease Treatment of the injected tumor(s) with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, or an investigational drug within 3 weeks prior to first treatment Clinically significant active infection or uncontrolled medical condition considered high risk for investigational new drug treatment (e.g. pulmonary, neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary) History of exfoliative skin condition (e.g. severe eczema, ectopic dermatitis, or similar skin disorder) requiring systemic therapy Clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulating ascites, pericardial and/or pleural effusions (e.g. requiring drainage for symptom control) Severe or unstable cardiac disease which may include, but is not limited to, any of the following within 6 months prior to screening: myocardial infarct, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmias diagnosed and requiring medication, or any clinicallysignificant change in cardiac status Current, active, progressing CNS malignancy, including carcinomatosis meningitis (definitively surgically resected or irradiated metastases allowed) Pulse oximetry O2 saturation &lt;90% at rest Use of antiviral, antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication (for example, heparin, warfarin, aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, dipyridamole) [Patients who discontinue such medications within 7 days prior to first treatment may be eligible for this study. Any required, chronic medications indicated for other medical issues should not be discontinued in order to meet eligibility criteria for this trial without consultation with both the patient and the treating physician.] Note: Low Dose Heparin to maintain patency of venous catheters is permitted. Patients with benign tumors Inability or unwillingness to give informed consent (patient or parent/guardian) or comply with the procedures required in this protocol Vaccination with a live virus (i.e. measles, mumps, rubella, etc) &lt; 30 days prior to first treatment Patients with household contacts who meet any of these criteria will be excluded unless alternate living arrangements can be made during the patient's active dosing period and for three weeks following the last dose of study medication: Women who are pregnant or nursing an infant Children &lt; 1 years old People with skin disease (eczema, atopic dermatitis and related diseases) Immunocompromised hosts (severe deficiencies in cellmediated immunity, including AIDS, organ transplant recipients, hematologic malignancies)</criteria>
