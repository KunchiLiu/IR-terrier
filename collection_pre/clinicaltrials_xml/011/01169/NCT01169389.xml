	<brief_title>Analgesic Control Following Knee Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is increasing evidence of the toxic effects of intraarticular administration of local anaesthetic. Hyaluronic acid supplementation given at the time of knee arthroscopy has not been fully evaluated as a possible alternative. We have studied the efficacy of a hyaluronic acid (HA) supplement (Durolane®) and a local anaesthetic (Bupivacaine) at providing early and short-term post-operative analgesic control following knee arthroscopy.Patients will be randomised to receive either 10mls of 0.5% Bupivacaine or 10mls of Durolane® into the joint immediately after completion of surgery. WOMAC and Tegner-Lysholm scores were obtained at baseline then at 1, 2, and 6-weeks post surgery. VAS pain scores were obtained at baseline; 1 and 24-hours; and 1, 2 and 6 weeks following surgery.</detailed_description>
