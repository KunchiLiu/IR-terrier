	<brief_summary>Ranibizumab, an effective antineovascular drug, will be studied for safety and efficacy in pterygium, a neovascular disorder of the ocular surface.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Sub-tenon Ranibizumab for Recurrent Pterygia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ptergyia are chronic fibrovascular lesions of the ocular surface. This study is designed to look for a signal of efficacy when the lesions are in a phase of active vascular growth. This phase is most often caught in a newly recurring pterygia post-operatively. Patients identified with actively growing lesions, will be offered local injections directly beneath the lesions. They will be examined for any adverse side effects and regression of the lesion.</detailed_description>
