	<brief_summary>Recent advances in technology have resulted in the development of scanners that can n image the heart arteries within 10 to 20 minutes but without the need for admission to hospital or insertion of catheters. This means that coronary heart disease may be more readily identified (or ruled out) and allow better diagnosis and treatment of patients with symptoms suggesting coronary heart disease. Here, we propose to assess the latest and most powerful scanners to see if it can accurately diagnose the extent of coronary artery disease and facilitate the planning of heart surgery.</brief_summary>
