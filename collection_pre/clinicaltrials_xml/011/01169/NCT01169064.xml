	<brief_summary>A common concern in any surgical procedure is the occurrence of infection. Silver-containing treatments are popular and used in wound treatment; however, there is presently little evidence of the effectiveness of silver-containing treatment for the prevention of obstetrical wound infection. We plan to investigate the rate of infection in women experiencing cesarean sections at VUMC by comparing the infection rate based on a randomized choice of silver-containing wound dressings to soft cloth adhesive wound dressings.</brief_summary>
