	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying 18F-fluoromisonidazole and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT scans to see how well they work in assessing oxygen in tumor tissue of patients with soft tissue sarcoma undergoing chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Using diagnostic procedures, such as 18F-fluoromisonidazole and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan and CT scan, to find oxygen in tumor cells may help in planning cancer treatment. It may also help doctors predict how well a patient will respond to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-Fluoromisonidazole and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT Scans in Assessing Oxygen in Tumor Tissue of Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Undergoing Chemotherapy With or Without Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the potential of 18F-fluoromisonidazole ([18F] FMISO) as a non-invasive indicator of tissue hypoxia to provide tumor-imaging data that correlates with tissue markers of hypoxia in patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test [18F] FMISO tumor uptake as an independent predictor of patient outcome and if it provides additional predictive power over fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan. II. Test [18F] FMISO tumor uptake as a predictor of response in the subgroup of patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. III. Test the reproducibility of [18F] FMISO uptake in tumors by imaging the same patients on sequential days in a test-retest protocol. IV. Determine the relationship between hypoxia-related biomarkers (HIF1-a and VEGF), proliferation biomarkers (microvascular density, p53, and Ki-67), and regional [18F] FMISO uptake in tumor. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 [18F] FDG and 18F-fluoromisonidazole ([18F] FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (without or without radiotherapy) and after completion of 4 courses of neoadjuvant therapy. NOTE: Some patients may undergo repeat [18F] FMISO PET/CT scan within 48 hours after the first [18F] FMISO scan to evaluate the variability (test-retest) of this imaging measurement. Blood samples are collected after completion of [18F] FMISO and [18F] FDG PET/CT scans for laboratory biomarker studies by IHC assays. Tumor samples from biopsy or surgery are also collected for biomarker studies. After completion of study procedures, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>
