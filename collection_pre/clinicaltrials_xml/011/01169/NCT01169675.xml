	<brief_summary>This Phase I study will investigate the safety of BIBW 2992 in combination with standard dose pemetrexed (500mg/m2) given on a 21 day cycle in patients with advanced solid cancers. BIBW 2992 will be given on two different dose schedules; dosing on days 1-21 and dosing on days 1 to 6 of a 21 day cycle. The use of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), including BIBW 2992 have demonstrated efficacy in solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, pemetrexed has demonstrated efficacy and has been approved as single agent chemotherapy in second-line NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma. The data obtained from this trial shall allow for a conclusion as to whether BIBW 2992 may be safely administered in advanced cancer patients in combination therapy with pemetrexed.</brief_summary>
