	<detailed_description>The treatment of choice for distal radius fractures is anatomic reduction with stable fixation. This is commonly achieved via open reduction and internal fixation with angle-stable designed locking plates using either a volar or dorsal approach. Frequent complications of tendinitis are associated with the latter approach. Palmar application of angle-stable plates reduces this problem of extensor tendon irritation; however a high incidence of fracture collapse has been documented. Currently, there are no existing locking plates that provide sufficient stability particularly for complex fractures. Insufficient fragment fixation can result in loss of reduction due to interfragmentary movement and lead to mal- or nonunion. The Variable Angle LCP Two-Column Volar DR plate (VA LCP DR) is a novel development of the LCP Distal Radius Plate System, which is designed to treat a wide variety of distal radius fracture patterns. Because of its design (ie, low plate and screw profile, polished surface, rounded edges, various locking options), not only can the potential for tendon adhesions and soft tissue irritation be minimized, the plate can address fragments individually for each fracture type. Thus, the versatility of VA LCP facilitates the reduction and stabilization of even the most complex fractures, including those in osteoporotic bone. This prospective case-series will evaluate the performance of the new VA LCP DR plate in the treatment of complex articular fractures of the distal radius. The primary objective of this study involves the documentation of postoperative loss of reduction; functional outcomes, quality of life and rate of complications associated with fracture fixation will also be assessed as part of the secondary study aims.</detailed_description>
