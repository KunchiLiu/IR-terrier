	<brief_summary>This study will determine the capacity of more frequent dosing of QAV680 to suppress allergic inflammation. The study will investigate the paradigm of multiple receptor antagonism in allergic disease by combining QAV680 with a second generation H1 histamine receptor antagonist to assess possible additive or synergistic anti-allergic effects of the two compound classes.</brief_summary>
