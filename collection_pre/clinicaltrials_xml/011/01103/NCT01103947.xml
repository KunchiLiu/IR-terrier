	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficiency of the EcoAnesthesia mask and its advantages over the standard facemask used in our practice. The satisfaction by the anesthesia provider and its ease of use may change the standard practice in airway management. In addition to these additional effects on patient safety, the facemask is affordable and may reduce the environmental burden of anesthesia waste.</brief_summary>
