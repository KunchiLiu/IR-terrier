	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving tremelimumab together with CD 40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870, 893 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving tremelimumab together with CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893 in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety, dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated doses of tremelimumab (administered intravenously every 12 weeks) and CP- 870,893 (administered intravenously every 3 weeks). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I To seek preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of tremelimumab and CP-870,893, including objective response rate at MTD. II. To determine the immune pharmacodynamic changes associated with the administration of the combination of tremelimumab and CP-870,893. OUTLINE: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 and CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893 IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 22, 43, and 64. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
