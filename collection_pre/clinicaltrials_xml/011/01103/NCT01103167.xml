	<brief_summary>Control of volume status is a pivotal issue in haemodialysis therapy. Objective and practical management for maintaining normovolemia is needed. The investigators hypothesized that intervention of volume status with the body composition monitor (BCM) may improved hemodynamic parameters and biomarkers in hemodialysis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Composition Monitor in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will assess BCM in enrolled hemodialysis patients by 4 weeks for 16 weeks During the former 8-week intervention period, The investigators will adjust patients' volume status according to the results of BCM. During the latter 8-week observational period, The investigators will evaluate the changes of patients' hemodynamic parameters and biomarkers.</detailed_description>
