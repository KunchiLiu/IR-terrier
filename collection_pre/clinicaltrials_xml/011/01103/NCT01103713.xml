	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted in asymptomatic pregnant women with P. falciparum parasitemia. The subjects will be given 3 day dosing regiment of the fixed-dose combination of Azithromycin and Chloroquine. Parasitological clearance rate with polymerase chain reaction data will be evaluated on Day 28 as primary endpoint.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Primigravidae and secundigravidae pregnant women at &gt;=14 and &lt;=30 weeks of gestational age (confirmed by ultrasound examination). Evidence of asymptomatic parasitemia with Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection (confirmed by microscopy) with parasite counts in the range of 80 100,000/uL on thick blood smears. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject (or a legally acceptable representative if a subject is &lt;18 years of age) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and that all questions by the subject have been sufficiently answered. Assent will be obtained from subjects &lt;18 years of age. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Age &lt;16 years old or &gt;35 years old. Multiple gestations (more than one fetus) as per the ultrasound results at screening. Clinical symptoms of malaria. Hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL (measured at baseline). Any condition requiring hospitalization or evidence of severe concomitant infection at time of presentation. Use of antimalarial drugs in previous 4 weeks. History of convulsions, hypertension, diabetes or any other chronic illness that may adversely affect fetal growth and viability. Known allergy to the study drugs (AZ, CQ, and SP) or to any macrolides or sulphonamides. Requirement to use medication during the study that might interfere with the evaluation of the study drug of AZ or CQ or is contra indicated during pregnancy per package inserts. Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. Evidence of current obstetric complications that may adversely impact the pregnancy and/or fetal outcomes, including presence of congenital anomalies, placenta previa or abruption. Known severe sickle cell (SS) disease or sickle hemoglobin C (SC) anemia. Known family history of prolonged QT syndrome, serious ventricular arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death.</criteria>
