	<criteria>Subjects meeting all of the following conditions will be included in the study: 1. Ambulatory subjects, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive 2. For female subjects, the following conditions must be met: 1. postmenopausal status for at least 1 year, or 2. statuspost surgical sterilization, or 3. if of childbearing potential, utilization of adequate birth control and willingness to undergo urine betahcg testing prior to drug treatment and on every study day. 3. A seated or supine systolic blood pressure greater than 130/85 on three separate measurements at least 15 minutes apart 4. Metabolic Syndrome as defined by the presence of &gt; 3 of the following: 1. Hypertension as characterized by having Systolic Blood Pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg and Diastolic Blood Pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg. 2. Impaired Glucose Tolerance (Fasting Plasma Glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL) 3. Increased triglyceride level &gt; 150mg/dL 4. Decreased levels of HighDensity Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 1. For males, less than 30 mg/dL 2. For females, less than 40 mg/dL 5. Waist circumference 1. For males, greater than 40 inches. 2. For females, greater than 35 inches. Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study: 1. Diabetes type 1 or type 2, a fasting glucose of greater than 110 mg/dL or the use of antidiabetic medication 2. Use of hormone replacement therapy 3. Statin therapy 4. Pregnancy 5. Breastfeeding 6. Cardiovascular disease such as prior myocardial infarction, presence of angina pectoris, significant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure [Left Ventricular (LV) hypertrophy acceptable], deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, second or third degree heart block, mitral valve stenosis, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7. Treatment with anticoagulants 8. History of serious neurologic disease such as cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, seizure, or transient ischemic attack 9. History or presence of immunological or hematological disorders 10. Diagnosis of asthma requiring use of inhaled beta agonist &gt;1 time per week 11. Clinically significant gastrointestinal impairment that could interfere with drug absorption 12. Impaired hepatic function [aspartate amino transaminase (AST) and/or alanine amino transaminase (ALT) &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal range] 13. Impaired renal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;60ml/min] as determined by the fourvariable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, where serum creatinine (Scr) is expressed in mg/dl and age in years: eGFR (ml/min/1.73m2)=175 • Scr1.154 • age0.203 • (1.212 if black) • (0.742 if female) 14. Hematocrit &lt;35% 15. Any underlying or acute disease requiring regular medication which could possibly pose a threat to the subject or make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult, such as arthritis treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 16. Treatment with chronic systemic glucocorticoid therapy (more than 7 consecutive days in 1 month) 17. Treatment with lithium salts 18. History of alcohol or drug abuse 19. Treatment with any investigational drug in the 1 month preceding the study 20. Mental conditions rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study 21. Inability to comply with the protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study 22. Screening plasma potassium &lt;3.2 mmol/L or use of chronic potassium supplements for the treatment of hypokalemia</criteria>
