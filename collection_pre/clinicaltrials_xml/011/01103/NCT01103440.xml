	<brief_title>Aspirin Resistance and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first US based randomized double blinded prospective study using triple antiplatelet therapy and double dose plavix maintenance dose in aspirin resistant patients undergoing elective PCI through femoral access. The primary outcome of this study is an elevation of cardiac enzymes within 24 hours after the PCI with a secondary outcome of a composite of major adverse cardiac events of death, MI, stent thrombosis and urgent revascularization and bleeding up to 30 days.</detailed_description>
