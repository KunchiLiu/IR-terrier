	<brief_summary>This study will look at the treatment effect of DiaPep277 on preservation of beta-cell function, as defined by meal-stimulated secretion of insulin. DiaPep277 is a peptide that changes the way the immune system behaves, stopping its attack on the beta-cells. Adults (&gt;20 years) with newly diagnosed (&lt;6 months) type 1 diabetes will be treated with 10 injections of DiaPep277 or Placebo over a 2-year treatment and follow-up period.</brief_summary>
