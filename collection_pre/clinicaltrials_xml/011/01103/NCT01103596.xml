	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in patients in at least the second PI line, the virological failures under Kaletra® and their consequences on protease and reverse transcriptase genotypes: - Characterisation of the changes in the resistance genotype in protease and reverse transcriptase, - Description of the nature and frequency of selected mutations under Kaletra®, - Description of the predictive factors for mutations and of the impact they could have on other PIs used as maintenance treatment (analysis based on available algorithms). EOLE is a prospective, multicentre observation study offered to French virology laboratories and involving clinical teams . It is a transversal study with retrospective data collection for patients meeting the study criteria (virological failure under Kaletra® after at least first line PI treatment). The study comprises two enrolment periods, separated by an interval of one year, over a period ranging from 2007 to 2011. During this period, virological failures under Kaletra® are identified. For each period, the virologists collect data only from the moment when virological failure under Kaletra® is identified. The first wave of data collection is now completed and occurred from December 5, 2007 to July 03, 2009. It is not planned to collect follow-up data in connection with alternative treatment with other antiretrovirals after failure under Kaletra®.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient aged under 18 years, Pretreated by at least one protease inhibitor (PI) line, In therapeutic failure of the antiretroviral (ARV) maintenance treatment containing Kaletra®. Therapeutic failure is defined by a viral load&gt; 50 copies/ml after at least three months' treatment with an ARV combination containing Kaletra®, always provided that genotyping is possible . Patients having received less than three months of Kaletra®, Patients for whom the genotype information before starting Kaletra® and at the time of the failure of Kaletra® was not available, Patients receiving another protease inhibitor (PI) concomitantly with Kaletra®.</criteria>
