	<criteria>Pregnant women (all gravidae) with ≥14 and ≤26 weeks of gestational age (by ultrasound). Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent/assent document. Assent will be obtained from subjects &lt;18 years of age. Subjects who are willing to and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

History of convulsions, hypertension, diabetes or any other chronic illness that may adversely affect fetal growth and viability. Inability to tolerate oral treatment in tablet form. Known allergy to the study drugs (azithromycin, chloroquine, and sulfadoxinepyrimethamine) or to any macrolides or sulphonamides. Requirement to use medication during the study that might interfere with the evaluation of the study drug eg, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole use in subjects positive for HIV infection. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation. Evidence of current obstetric complications that may adversely impact the pregnancy and/or fetal outcomes, including presence of congenital anomalies, placenta previa or abruption.
