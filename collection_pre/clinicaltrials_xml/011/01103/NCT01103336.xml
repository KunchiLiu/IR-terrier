	<brief_summary>Renal hypoxia plays an important role in the development of contrast-induced nephropathy. The purpose of the PRINCIPLE study is to investigate the effect of pretreatment with intravenous nicorandil on the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography.</brief_summary>
