	<brief_summary>Stress is a primary reason why in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients drop out of treatment, and it may have a detrimental impact on pregnancy rates, yet there is minimal published research on the efficacy of structured skills-based psychological interventions with assisted reproductive technology (ART) patients. The objective of this study is to determine if women who are randomized to a mind/body (MB) program prior to starting their first IVF cycle will have higher pregnancy rates than controls (C). This is a randomized, controlled prospective study conducted at a private academically-affiliated infertility clinic and includes 143 women ages 40 and below scheduled to undergo their first IVF cycle. Subjects are randomized via computer generated random numbers table to a 10 session mind/body program or a control group and followed for two IVF cycles. The primary outcome measure is clinical pregnancy rate.</brief_summary>
