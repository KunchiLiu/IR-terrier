	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of the Combined Ablation Procedure to Treat Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the epicardial / endocardial combined procedure for the treatment of drug refractory symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients, using the nContact Numeris速-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax速 epicardially and the Biosense Webster NaviStar速 ThermoCool速 Diagnostic/Ablation deflectable Tip Catheter in conjunction with the Carto Navigation System endocardially.</detailed_description>
