	<brief_summary>Varicose vein disease is a common health problem, which causes much discomfort to patients. Nowadays treatment modalities for greater saphenous veins include surgery and duplex guided foam sclerotherapy. These are two equally accepted and applied treatments for the same patient population. Choice of treatment often depends on the referral preference of the General Practitioner. Until now data are missing which treatment is more cost effective. The current proposal aims at comparing the effects, costs and patient preferences between duplex guided foam sclerotherapy and surgery in the treatment of greater varicose veins.</brief_summary>
