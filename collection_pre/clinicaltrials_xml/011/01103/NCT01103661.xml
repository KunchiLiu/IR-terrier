	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of The Combined Ablation Procedure To Treat Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the epicardial / endocardial combined procedure using the nContact Numeris®-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® epicardially and the St. Jude Medical Therapy™ Cool Path™ Ablation Catheter endocardially to treat longstanding persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients.</detailed_description>
