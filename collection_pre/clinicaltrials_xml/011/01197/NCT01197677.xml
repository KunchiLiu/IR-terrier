	<brief_summary>1. The main aim of the first specific protocol initiated by the European CMR registry, suspected CAD, is to demonstrate that patients presenting for work up of suspected coronary artery disease, which have a completely normal CMR scan will have a low risk for cardiovascular events. 2. The main aim of the second specific protocol initiated by the European CMR registry, HCM-SCD, will be to evaluate CMR for risk stratification in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM). 3. This registry is sought to collect data on the general use of CMR in the European clinical practice, its safety and its therapeutic implications in a high number of cases to 1) substantiate the clinical yield of CMR and 2) to define additional clinical questions worth to be investigated in detail as additional specific protocols in the future.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>European clinical practice: Consecutive patients with accomplished CMR. SuspectedCAD: Consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease undergoing a combined CMR protocol including evaluation of LV function, assessment of myocardial ische¬mia by adenosine stress perfusion or highdose dobutamine CMR and detection of myocardial infarction using contrastenhanced CMR. HCMSCD: Consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy undergoing a combined CMR protocol including LV function, rest perfusion, and detection of myocardial scarring by contrastenhanced CMR. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based on the demonstration of a hypertrophied, nondilated left ventricle (wall thickness of at least 15 mm in adults or the equivalent relative to bodysurface area in children) in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease capable of producing a similar degree of hypertrophy. In adult relatives of the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyo¬pathy, a wall thickness of 13 mm or more will be considered a criterion for diagnosis. European clinical practice: None SuspectedCAD: Missing informed consent. Patients with known CAD by invasive coronary angiography or previous MI. HCMSCD: Missing informed consent. Patients with known CAD by invasive coronary angiography or previous MI. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy of other causes (e.g. hypertension, valvular heart disease)</criteria>
