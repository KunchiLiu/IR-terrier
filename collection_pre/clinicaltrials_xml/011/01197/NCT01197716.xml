	<brief_title>German Chest Pain Unit (CPU)-Register</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of a Chest Pain Unit (CPU) is to clarify unclear chest pain quickly and specifically. Present data from Germany, the USA and England prove that the organisation models of a CPU lead beside a drastic reduction of mortality also to a cost reduction as well as a shortening of the average inpatient hospital stays. Therefore it seems reasonable to assign a minimum standard to CPUs. Although there are internationally already standards for CPUs up to complete certification programmes, it is an explicit wish of the German society for cardiology (DGK) to create an own standard which considers on the national circumstances. The aim of the CPU register is the internal and external validation of the care quality of CPU including Benchmark reports and risk-adjusted comparisons.</detailed_description>
