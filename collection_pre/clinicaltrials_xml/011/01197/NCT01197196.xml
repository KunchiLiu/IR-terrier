	<brief_summary>This study involves a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of behavioral weight loss as a treatment for migraine in obese females aged 18 to 50 years. The primary aim is to examine whether participants assigned to a behavioral weight loss treatment condition report greater pre- to post-treatment reductions in migraine headache frequency than participants assigned to a migraine education condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Weight Loss as a Treatment for Migraine in Obese Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine is a highly prevalent, debilitating and costly disorder. Eighteen percent of women and 6% of men are affected by migraine; a neurovascular disorder characterized by severe recurrent headache pain episodes involving nausea, photophobia, phonophobia and aversion to physical activity. There is increasing evidence that obesity exacerbates migraine. Obesity is associated with more frequent headaches in episodic migraineurs, and is a risk factor for progression to chronic migraine. Several plausible mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the migraine-obesity link including common pro-inflammatory processes, psychological conditions that are comorbid to both disorders (e.g., depression), and similar behavioral risk factors (e.g., low physical activity and high fat intake). No research to date has examined the impact of standard behavioral weight loss programs on migraine in obese adults. Behavioral weight loss programs focused on improving diet and physical activity consistently produce weight losses of 8-10 kg at 6 months which reduces the risk of diabetes and improves cardiovascular disease risk factors. Weight loss may also improve each of the physiological, psychological, and behavioral pathways that purportedly link migraine and obesity. Thus, behavioral weight loss programs may serve as an innovative approach to treating migraine headaches. This study involves a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of behavioral weight loss as a treatment for migraine. One hundred and forty obese females who meet research criteria for migraine, as confirmed by a study neurologist and completion of an electronic headache diary will be assigned to 16 weekly group sessions of either: (1) Behavioral weight loss (BWL) treatment (n=70) or (2) Healthy Living for Migraine Relief (HLMR) education (n=70). BWL will provide a combination of empirically validated diet and exercise prescriptions and behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring, goal-setting and stimulus control. HLMR will provide education on migraine and pharmacological and behavioral (e.g., stress management) treatments. Both groups will use smartphones to record their headaches for 4 weeks at a time during pre-treatment, post-treatment, and the end of a 16-week weight maintenance period. Weight and other potential physiological (inflammation), psychological (depression), and behavioral (diet and physical activity) mediators of the treatment effect will be assessed at the end of treatment for tests of prospective effects on migraine days at post-treatment. The primary hypothesis is that BWL participants will report greater pre- to post-treatment reductions in number of migraine days than HLMR participants.</detailed_description>
