	<brief_summary>The goal of this register is the documentation of the success as well as of the complications regarding interventional therapy of cardiac arrhythmia by catheter ablation. This is the necessary basis for quality management and development of possible improvements of catheter ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>German Ablation Quality-Register</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The interventional therapy of heartbeat disturbances by means of catheter ablation makes the curative treatment possible of numerous tachycardiac arrhythmics. By this crucial improvement of the supply of patients and its quality of life a genuine healing of a multiplicity of heartbeat disturbances became possible. Especially within the range of the ablation treatment there are relatively few con-trolled studies, which would give a broad collection of the results of the catheter ablation in the different indication areas. Aim of the registry: Documentation of indication, hospital course and complications during long term follow-up of patients with catheter ablation Design: Prospective, multicenter registry; FU-duration 12 months. Duration: Phase I: 2 years Inclusion criteria: Catheter ablation (intention to treat) Exclusion criteria: Missing declaration of consent</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The ablation register will include all consecutive patients with a performed or attempted electrophysiological ablation Missing signed informed consent</criteria>
