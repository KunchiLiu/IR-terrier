	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that delayed graft function and ITBS events may be related to small blood clots (microthrombi) that collect in the kidneys and liver after cardiac death. Treatment of the DCD organs with a thrombolytic agent prior to implantation may reduce post-transplant morbidity and mortality, and may ultimately result in a greater number of transplantable livers and kidneys.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Donated After Cardiac Death (DCD) Utilization With Thrombolytic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The waiting list for kidney and liver transplantation continues to increase in the United States, and therefore the need grows for additional donor organs. Utilization of organs donated after cardiac death (DCD) could be one way to increase organ availability, however there are risks associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including delayed graft function and in livers specifically, ischemic-type biliary strictures (ITBS). We hypothesize that delayed graft function and ITBS events may be related to small blood clots (microthrombi) that collect in the kidneys and liver after cardiac death. Treatment of the DCD organs with a thrombolytic agent prior to implantation may reduce post-transplant morbidity and mortality, and may ultimately result in a greater number of transplantable livers and kidneys.</detailed_description>
