	<brief_title>Acupuncture to Reduce Labour Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture is used in obstetric care in spite of insufficient evidence of its potential to reduce labour pain. The findings so far are contradictory, which may reflect methodological limitations. The present study will take issues into account, such as sufficiently large sample to allow detection of possible differences between study groups; optimal timing of the intervention; controlling for intensity of the treatment; qualified training of persons giving the treatment; biological markers of pain and stress; possible effects on mother and infant; women's experiences such as overall birth experience and memory of pain.</detailed_description>
