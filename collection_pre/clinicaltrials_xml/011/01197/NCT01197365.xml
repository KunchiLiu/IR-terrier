	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of an Infant Formula Supplemented With Galacto-oligosaccharides, Beta-palmitate and Acidified Milk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infant formulae are the only alternatives to breast milk for infants when, for whatever reason, human milk becomes unavailable. New-generation infant formulae contain functional ingredients able to mimic some benefits of human milk. The study formula is supplemented with galacto-oligosaccharides, which favor intestinal positive microflora growth, beta-palmitate, enhancing fat and calcium absorption and softer stool formation, and acidified milk which contributes to immune system maturation. The aim of this study is to verify the safety of the study formula in healthy term infants and to deepen the efficacy of the functional ingredient blend in term of prebiotic effect, gastrointestinal tolerance and immune response improvement.</detailed_description>
