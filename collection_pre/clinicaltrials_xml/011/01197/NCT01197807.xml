	<brief_summary>Until recently, bulb or catheter oronasopharyngeal suctioning (ONPS) of all the infants, including vigorous infants in the delivery room, has been featured as a standard of newborn care. The 5th edition of the Newborn Resuscitation Program (NRP) has minimized the recommendation for routine suctioning of infants following delivery, provided they are not depressed or in need of immediate resuscitation. However, this new alternative recommendation was based on a small randomized trial and other lower level evidence rather than evidence from larger trials. The NRP Textbook cautions against vigorous suctioning because of the resultant apnea or bradycardia. Furthermore, suctioning may delay other more important steps of resuscitation. Thus, it is necessary to compare the alternative recommended practice, i.e. simple wiping of the mouth, to determine if it has equivalent efficacy and a favorable side effect profile compared to suctioning.</brief_summary>
