	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate a technology that will allow clinicians to prescribe behavioral treatment that should optimize tissue healing for both acute and chronic phonotrauma. In this study, we propose to (1): establish a non-invasive methodology for estimating overall mechanical dose during phonation, and component metrics of phonatory mechanical dose (e.g., distance dose, energy dissipation dose and time dose) from high speed imaging data and aeromechanical modeling, for a range of vocal fold configurations (Experiment 1); (2): identify mathematical relations between treatment dose parameters, inflammatory state of the tissue and time-varying biological consequences in the tissue, up to 2 wk following acute phonotrauma (Experiment 2); (3): develop a hybrid physical-biological model of vocal fold inflammation and treatment to identify treatment modalities that should optimize post-traumatic wound healing at 2 wk, for a range of acute phonotraumatic conditions (Experiment 3â€”no human subject involved), and (4): provide a preliminary test of the hybrid treatment models' ability to predict idealized treatment outcome in human subjects, and calibrate the model as needed iteratively to achieve a match between predicted and obtained outcomes (Experiment 4).</brief_summary>
