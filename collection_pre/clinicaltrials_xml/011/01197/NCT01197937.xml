	<brief_summary>The goal of this observational study is to assess the efficacy of Realize My Success (RMS),a website that allows patients and providers to maintain contact via the website. We will compare RMS users on a number of different variables with the goal of identifying which variables are associated with optimal outcomes (larger weight losses) at one year (and potentially beyond). The study has two primary objectives. The first is to assess changes in body weight at postoperative year 1 in frequent v. infrequent RMS users. We predict that frequent users will achieve significantly greater reductions in weight at 6 and 12 months (and beyond) than infrequent users. The second objective is to assess changes in body weight at postoperative year 1 in persons who use different features of the RMS site. We hypothesize that persons who, on a regular basis, record their food intake, track their physical activity and make specific behavioral goals will experience significantly greater reductions in weight beginning 6 months after surgery as compared to those who do not use these features of the RMS site.</brief_summary>
