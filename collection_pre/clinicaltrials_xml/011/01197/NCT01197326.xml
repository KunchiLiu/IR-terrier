	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess if, compared with standard paper-based systems, an automated Early Warning System (EWS) resident in a spot check patient monitor, can help to identify patients in the acute care settings but outside of the intensive care unit, who may be experiencing physiological instability and who are in need of rapid clinical intervention by a Rapid Response Team (RRT)/ Medical Emergency Team (MET). The development of such an automated system by offers a unique opportunity to assess its user-friendliness, labour-saving effect, feasibility and clinical utility. Accordingly, we plan to conduct a research program aimed at assessing this new approach toward patient monitoring. This study will use the hospital's Standard of Care protocol for the monitoring of vital signs (including timing and vital signs collected) and a commercially available automatic spot check monitor to collect data. No investigational procedures or devices are associated with this protocol.</detailed_description>
