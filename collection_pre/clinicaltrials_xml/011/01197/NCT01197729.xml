	<brief_summary>OPTAMI documents the characteristics of consecutive patients with acute STEMI and NSTEMI in hospital everyday-life in Germany, their acute and adjuvant medication treatment, events until discharge (e.g. mortality, stroke, re-MI), and their medication for secondary prevention at discharge. In the follow up-period of one year, information is collected concerning events as mortality, stroke, re-MI, coronary interventions (PCI, CABG) and re-hospitalisation. The implementation of guideline-adjusted therapy in hospital everyday-life is reviewed. The usefulness of the European standard for data acquisition in cardiology (CARDS = Cardiology Audit and Registration Standards) is evaluated.</brief_summary>
