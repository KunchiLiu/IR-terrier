	<brief_title>Intravenous Magnesium for Sickle Cell Vasoocclusive Crisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well known that children with sickle cell disease are at risk for acute pain crises. The usual treatment for these pain crises, intravenous fluids and pain medicines such as morphine, has changed little over the past three decades. In a pilot study, the addition of intravenous magnesium to standard therapy decreased length of stay; however, this study was not randomized, not blinded, not placebo-controlled, and not adequately powered to assess safety. We will conduct a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of about 208 children, ages 4-21 years. Patients will be randomized to receive intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo every 8 hours for a total of 6 doses, or until discharge. Patients will return for a routine clinic visit up to 3 months after discharge for a baseline assessment. Patients will also complete health-related quality of life measures at 4 timepoints throughout the study.</detailed_description>
