	<brief_title>Atopy Patch Test in Normal Population : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial diagnostic work up of suspected food allergy includes patient's history, skin prick test (SPT), measurement of food specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) with serological assays, and more recently the atopy patch test. A positive SPT seems to reflect early reactions to food challenges, whereas the atopy patch test has a high diagnostic efficacy for late phase clinical reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate atopy patch test reaction in non-atopic population.</detailed_description>
