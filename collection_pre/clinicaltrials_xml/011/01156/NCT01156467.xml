	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out, whether it is possible to improve the ventilatory care of premature infants by using Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). The study hypothesis is that by using NAVA-technology and/or by monitoring Edi-signal (the electrical signal of diaphragm), it is possible to accomplish ventilatory care to premature infants more individually.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) in Ventilatory Care of Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asynchrony means that the timing of support given by the ventilator is different from patients own breathing pattern. Asynchrony during ventilatory care may increase the risk for complications especially in premature infants with immature lungs. In this study investigators will compare currently used ventilation methods to a new neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). The aim is to find out, whether by using this new method it is possible to decrease the complications associated to ventilatory care and to shorten the need for mechanical ventilation.</detailed_description>
