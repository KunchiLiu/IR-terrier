	<brief_summary>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a newly endoscopic device that enables microscopic view of the digestive tract. The purpose of this study is to determine if confocal laser endomicroscopy can improve detection of digestive disease include inflammation, dysplasia, and early cancer, and if confocal laser endomicroscopy has competitive advantage, compared with other device such as Narrow Band Imaging and Autofluoresecence Imaging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advances in endoscopy have led to imagining of the details of digestive mucosa. Novel techniques such as Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) assisted magnification endoscopy, Auto Fluorescence Imaging (AFI) or confocal laser endomicroscopy could, however, improve the endoscopic detection.In this research we describe the combined use of these three techniques in patients with digestive disease.</detailed_description>
