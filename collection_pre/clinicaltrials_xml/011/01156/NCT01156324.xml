	<brief_title>The Impact of an Online Stress Management Program on In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship between stress and infertility has remained a subject of controversy for many years. Recent research indicates that stress has a strong negative impact on pregnancy rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). In addition, stress is the most common reason given by women who voluntarily terminate treatment. In a recent study, women who participated in a group mind/body treatment program had higher pregnancy rates than control subjects. The impact of an online stress management program has never been studied in the infertile population. An online intervention would be far more accessible for many infertility patients.</detailed_description>
