	<brief_summary>In this study the gender specificity of the effects of furosemide in female and male volunteers will be investigated. The healthy volunteers receive 1. furosemide and 2. aminohippurate sodium "PAH" as single dose. The main objective is gender-specific comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of furosemide in relation to the effect of furosemide (urinary excretion). Secondary objectives are the gender-specific comparison of renal and systemic PAH clearance with the clearance of furosemide and the influence of various genetic polymorphisms on the variability of furosemide pharmacokinetics.</brief_summary>
