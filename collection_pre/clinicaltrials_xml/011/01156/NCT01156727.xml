	<brief_summary>This project added an evaluation/research component to an existing peer outreach program, implemented for over 1100 soldiers in the Michigan Army National Guard. The study aims were to: 1) evaluate the implementation of the B2B program to inform ongoing program modifications and facilitate future dissemination efforts, 2) assess whether the B2B program increases mental health and substance use treatment initiation and treatment retention among returning National Guard soldiers, and 3) explore whether the B2B program improves mental health symptoms, deceases hazardous alcohol use, and improves soldier well-being.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study aims were to: 1) evaluate the implementation of the B2B program to inform ongoing program modifications and facilitate future dissemination efforts, 2) assess whether the B2B program increases mental health and substance use treatment initiation and treatment retention among returning National Guard soldiers, and 3) explore whether the B2B program improves mental health symptoms, deceases hazardous alcohol use, and improves soldier well-being. The study had three components which addressed each of the three specific aims. The first component assessed B2B implementation using an embedded mixed methods design. This evaluation included real-time assessment and adaptation of the program, as well as retrospective evaluation of implementation process, sustainability, and potential for spread. The second component addressed the impact of B2B on treatment initiation and retention. Preliminary analyses were completed using regression analyses. Pending additional data from the DoD, an interrupted time series design to assess Michigan National Guard soldiers' VA and non-VA services use in multiple time periods before and after the date of B2B implementation will be conducted.. The third study component assessed the impact of B2B on MI ARNG soldiers' outcomes using longitudinal survey data and adjusting for baseline mental health status using data from the Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA).</detailed_description>
