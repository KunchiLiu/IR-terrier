	<brief_summary>This study will assess the impact of a national, community-based after-school program promoting physical activity (America SCORES) on obesity, fitness and important cardiovascular risk factors among minority children. The investigators central hypothesis is that established community-based programs, such as America SCORES, can reduce obesity and cardiovascular risk among participants. The 1-year study followed 158 children from 6 public schools, 3 of which were randomized to have SCORES and 3 to "usual care" after-school program. Primary outcomes are change in body mass index (BMI), physical activity (measured by accelerometer), and fitness (aerobic capacity assessed with the 20-meter shuttle test). Cardiovascular outcomes include blood pressure, body composition (assessed using bioelectrical impedance) and waist circumference. The investigators will also measure academic outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline measures were collected in September 2009; midpoint measures were collected in January 2010; and final measures were collected in May 2010. Repeated measures analyses will compare trajectories for BMI, physical activity, and fitness between students in the SCORES and the usual care arms.</detailed_description>
