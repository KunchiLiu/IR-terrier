	<brief_title>Efficacy of Thrombosuction in Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention of Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred strategy for immediate revascularization in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A meta-analysis of trials comparing primary PCI to fibrinolytic therapy showed a mortality benefit to the invasive approach. However, although TIMI III flow is achieved in the culprit epicardial vessel in the majority of patients, lack of tissue-level reperfusion is observed in approximately 30% of patients as manifested by persistence of chest pain and ST-segment elevation. Many strategies have tried to overcome this problem, from mechanical thrombectomy and distal protection devices to myocardial preserving agents. The purpose of present study is to investigate the efficacy of the thrombus aspiration using Export Aspiration Catheter (Medtronic Corporation, California, USA) during primary PCI in acute myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
