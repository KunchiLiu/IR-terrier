	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the microbiological effects of two different treatments: a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (IM BPG) vs. a 10-day daily dose of amoxicillin for the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis in children in low resource settings. This study was a prospective multi-center randomized active control treatment trial. The trial is a non-inferiority equivalence trial, to determine if amoxicillin treatment is at least as effective as the currently given IM BPG treatment.</brief_summary>
