	<brief_summary>Based on pilot patient observations, and experience from the prior study KTS-1-2008, the investigators anticipate that chronic fatigue syndrome patients may benefit from B-cell depletion therapy using Rituximab induction with maintenance treatment. The hypothesis is that at least a subset of CFS patients have an activated immune system involving B-lymphocytes, and that prolonged B-cell depletion may alleviate symptoms.</brief_summary>
