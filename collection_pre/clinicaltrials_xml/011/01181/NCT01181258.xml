	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators investigate a cell therapy strategy that could harness allogeneic effectors that can potentially mediate anti-lymphoma effect. The investigators have designed a novel lymphodepleting conditioning regimen followed by infusion of donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) for patients with refractory lymphoid malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Penostatin, Rituximab and Ontak and Allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Refractory Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center phase II trial designated to expand donor NK cells and induce remissions in patients with refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using chemotherapy followed by haploidentical NK cells and IL2. Primary Objective is to evaluate the objective response rate (PR+CR) at 2 months post haploidentical NK cell infusion in patients with refractory Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Secondary Objective is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, rituximab, and methylprednisone as determined by incidence of serious adverse events; 2) evaluate in vivo expansion of allogeneic donor NK cells at day 14; 3) determine time to progression Exploratory Objective is to 1) correlate clinical response with frequencies of peripheral blood T reg cells after chemotherapy; 2) correlate clinical response with donor KIR-B-content score determined by genotype; 3) monitor phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural killer cells and regulatory T cells in vivo; 4) correlate clinical response with donor FcR polymorphism. - Pre-NK cell infusion chemotherapeutic regimen consist of 1) Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV weekly x 4, start day -7; 2) Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IV day -6 through day -2; 3) Cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg IV day -5; 4) Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg day -2 through day +9. - NK cell infusion using IL2 activated donor NK cells 1.5 to 8 x 107 cells/kg IV day 0 - IL2 SC 9 million IU every other day x 6 doses over 2 weeks begin 1 to 24 hours after NK cell infusion. If weight &lt; 45 kilograms, give IL-2 at 5 million units/m2 on same schedule Accrual Goal: Up to 17 patients will be enrolled</detailed_description>

Voluntary written consent Pregnant or lactating. The agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into breast milk. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to enrollment to rule out pregnancy. Women of childbearing age must use appropriate contraceptive method. Active central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma/leukemia Patients with prior CNS involvement are eligible provided that it has been treated and is in remission. Active serious infection (pulmonary infiltrates or lesions are allowed only after the appropriate diagnostic testing is negative for infection or appropriate therapy was initiated for probable infection) Pleural effusion large enough to be detectable on chest xray (CXR) Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or known HIV positive serology Active concurrent malignancy (except skin cancer) EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder Positive HBsAg. If HBcAb is positive, Hepatitis B DNA by PCR will be evaluated. Positive anti HBcAb with an undetectable viral load does not exclude the patient. Any investigational therapy in the past 30 days Patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible in the absence of graft versus host disease and are off immunosuppression for at least 30 days Known allergy to any of the study agents</criteria>
