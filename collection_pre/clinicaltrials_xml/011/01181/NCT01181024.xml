In Part A, cohorts of healthy volunteers will be randomized to receive single ascending doses of RO5303253 or placebo. In Part 2, healthy volunteers will receive a single dose of RO5303253 or placebo in a cross-over design (with a washout period of at least 7 days) to assess food effects on pharmacokinetics. In Part 3, patients with chronic hepatitis C will be randomized ro receive either RO5303253 or placebo for 5 days.</brief_summary>
