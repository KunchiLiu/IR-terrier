	<brief_summary>Physicians counsel women participants who are candidates for hormonal contraception about available combined hormonal contraceptive methods (the combined pill, the contraceptive vaginal ring [i.e., the etonogestrel + ethinylestradiol vaginal ring] and the contraceptive transdermal patch). Effects of this counseling on women's contraceptive use decisions are to be evaluated by 1) recording which method is chosen after information is provided about all three available combined hormonal methods, 2) comparing the final chosen contraceptive method used by a participant after counseling with the method originally intended to be used by that participant before the counseling, and 3) evaluating the criteria used by women participants to choose their contraceptive method after the counseling, including evaluation of social and demographic predictors of contraceptive choice. The differences among participants in the number of contacts made by the participants to physician offices for purposes of obtaining information regarding the use of their final chosen hormonal contraceptive (e.g., requests for clarification, questions, expressing doubt or reservations for using the method, or requests for other help/advisement by the physician) will also be evaluated over four months following the physician counseling.</brief_summary>
