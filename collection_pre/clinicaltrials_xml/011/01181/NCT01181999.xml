	<brief_summary>Rituximab (R) plus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) combination is considered as the new gold standard for the first-line treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study is aimed to evaluate the overall response rate and the safety of four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and followed by rituximab augmentation (weekly four times infusion) in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with aged more than 70 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Augmentation Following R-CHOP Induction Chemotherapy in Extremely Elderly Patients With Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy for the induction treatment [Dose intensity of CHOP chemotherapy is modulated according to Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] If patients with CCI &lt;1 - Rituximab: 375 mg/m2, day 1 every 3 weeks. - Conventional dose of CHOP chemotherapy repeat every 3 weeks. If patients with CCI ≥1 - Rituximab: 375 mg/m2, day 1 every 3 weeks. - 75% of conventional CHOP repeat every 3 weeks. 2. Rituximab augmentation - Rituximab: 375 mg/m2, every week x 4 times. - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 tablet per day during augmentation</detailed_description>
