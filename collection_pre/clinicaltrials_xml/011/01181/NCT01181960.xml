	<brief_title>Research and Evaluation of Antipsychotic Treatment in Community Behavioral Health Organizations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study of usual care of patients undergoing treatment for schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder at CBHOs. Up to 50 CBHOs will be selected as sites for this study. Treating clinicians at these sites will notify the designated research coordinators for this study when they are initiating a patient on a new antipsychotic medication (including risperidone long acting injectable or paliperidone palmitate) or if they are treating a patient with risperidone long acting injectable or paliperidone palmitate. New initiation will include patients not previously on any antipsychotic medication as well as those switched from one antipsychotic to another. Switches may include but are not limited to switches among different types of oral antipsychotics, from an oral antipsychotic to Long Acting Therapy (LAT), or from LAT to an oral antipsychotic. Site research staff will screen potential participants identified by the clinicians and enroll those meeting study criteria who consent to study participation. Sites will maintain a screening log of all potential participants. The target enrollment for this study is up to 2,450 participants. Enrollment by cohort will be monitored and sites will be notified to stop enrollment if target enrollment for a particular cohort has been reached. Eligible participants who consent to the study will be recruited into one of two samples: participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis (target n=2,250) and participants with a bipolar I disorder diagnosis (target n=200). There will be four cohorts: risperidone long acting injectable new starts (target n=475); risperidone long acting injectable continuous users (target n=75); paliperidone palmitate new starts or continuous users (target n=1,200); and other antipsychotic new starts (target n=700). During the entire study follow-up period participants will receive their medication per usual care in their treatment setting and no study drug will be provided. Enrolled participants will be followed prospectively over a 12-month study period, with interviews at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Sites will also abstract medical history and healthcare utilization information from the chart of each enrolled participant. There will be three chart abstractions (baseline, 6 Months, 12 Months). The baseline abstraction will cover services rendered in the 6 months prior to antipsychotic initiation or switch, or from their first visit to the CBHO if the individual did not receive services for as long as 6 months prior to initiation or switch. The 6M and 12M abstractions will each cover services rendered in the prior 6 months. When all three abstractions are complete, the data will cover the period from 6 months before baseline to 12 months after baseline. If a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) associated with a J&amp;J medicinal product occurs the investigator will record it in the source document as well as fax the SAE form to J&amp;J internal safety group within 24 hours.
