	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, randomized, Phase II-study to evaluate the efficacy of a standard-TPF induction chemotherapy (IC) and an alternative TPF induction chemotherapy followed by radio-antibody-therapy, in patients with unresectable LA-SCC of the HN region (oro-hypopharynx carcinoma, cancer of the oral cavity). The primary objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of an experimental 'fractionated' TPF regimen compared to a current standard TPF regimen. Composite endpoint of compliance and feasibility in terms of - response (RECIST1.1) and - hematological acute toxicity (CTCAE v.4.02) - on time application of RAT following an experimental or standard TPF IC. Secondary endpoints are - Treatment intensity achieved - Toxicity (according to CTCAE v.4.02) - Response rates after completion of induction chemotherapy and after completion of entire protocol treatment (RECIST1.1) - Survival (progression-free, metastasis-free, recurrence-free, overall) 1 year after randomisation - Quality of life according to EORTC QoL C30 &amp; HN35 The study will be conducted at 5-6 investigational sites in Germany recruiting 90 patients in total. Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of histologically confirmed SSC of the HN. Patients will receive one of 2 different regimens of TPF IC followed by cetuximab together with radiotherapy (RAT) or a standard radiochemotherapy(RCT) regimen.</brief_summary>
