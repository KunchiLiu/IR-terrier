	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, observational study in adult participants undergoing different types of elective surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia. During the first study period, there will be a cross-sectional evaluation of neuromuscular blockade level upon participant arrival at Post Anesthesia Care Units (PACUs). During the second study period, hospital discharge data from the participants will be collected. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of incomplete postoperative neuromuscular recovery from anesthesia at PACUs in Portuguese hospitals. This is a cross-sectional and retrospective study.</brief_summary>
