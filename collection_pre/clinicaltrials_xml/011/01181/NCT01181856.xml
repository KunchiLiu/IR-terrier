	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study that will compare the safety and immunogenicity of candidate tuberculosis (TB) vaccine MVA85A administered by the intramuscular route and the intradermal route in healthy adult individuals who have been previously vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Tuberculosis Vaccine, MVA85A, Administered by the Intramuscular Route and the Intradermal Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We postulate that the intramuscular route is not inferior to the intradermal route of administration of MVA85A in BCG vaccinated adults when evaluated for safety and immunogenicity. If MVA85A can be given safely by intramuscular route and it is at least equally immunogenic and efficacious in a prime-boost strategy, then it would probably be the preferred route in subsequent phase II and III trials. There are several reasons for this: - Reduced pain associated with injection. - Reduced local reaction at the injection site. - More straightforward procedure; less technically demanding; less time consuming. - Easier production and storage of vaccine. - Larger volume of vaccine can be given. Trials of MVA85A to date have established 1 x 10^8 pfu as the optimal dose for intradermal injection in adults. We therefore intend to administer this same dose intramuscularly in order to directly compare the two routes for both safety and immunogenicity. These results will guide future trials in which the intramuscular route, if safe, could be further evaluated at either higher or lower dose depending on immunogenicity at 1 x 10^8 pfu dosage.</detailed_description>

Clinically significant history of skin disorder, allergy, immunodeficiency (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), cancer (except basal cell carcinoma [BCC] or carcinoma in situ [CIS]), cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal disease, endocrine disorder, neurological illness, psychiatric disorder, drug or alcohol abuse 5. History of serious psychiatric condition 6. Concurrent oral or systemic steroid medication or the use of other immunosuppressive agents 7. History of anaphylaxis to vaccination or any allergy likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine 8. Any clinically significant abnormality of screening blood or urine tests 9. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV antibodies 10. Female currently lactating, confirmed pregnancy or intention to become pregnant during study period 11. Use of an investigational medicinal product or nonregistered drug, live vaccine, or medical device other than the study vaccine for 30 days prior to dosing with the study vaccine, or planned use during the study period 12. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the planned trial vaccination date 13. Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk or may influence the result of the study or may affect the volunteer's ability to participate in the study</criteria>
