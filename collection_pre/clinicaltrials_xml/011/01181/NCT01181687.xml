	<brief_title>Psychometric Testing of the Norwegian Version of the Comfort Behavioral Scale</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Structured pain assessment is the foundation for the management of pain. Several different pain measurement tools exists, among them the Comfort behavioral scale (van Dijk, 2005), developed from the original Comfort scale (Ambuel, 1992). The psychometric properties of the Comfort scale have been tested in several studies, but so far no Norwegian version of the scale has been developed and tested. Neither has the scale been tested in spontaneously breathing children undergoing minor surgery. The aim of this study is to establish incipient psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the scale among children aged 0-3 years admitted for elective minor surgery.</detailed_description>
