	<brief_title>Can Psychotherapy Reduce Sickness Absence?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickness absence due to psychiatric problems is considered a growing problem in Norway. Little research is done to examine if psychotherapy can reduce sickness absence. Since 2007 there is a government sponsored program in Norway (Raskere tilbake) aimed at reducing sickness absence. This study examines if psychotherapy within this program, delivered at an out-patient clinic, actually reduces sickness absence. Levels of absenteeism is measured before, after and 6 months after treatment. This is a quasi-experimental study, where the treatment-group will be compared with a statistical group in the general population, that is socio-demographical similar and has similar history of sickness absence but haven't been to treatment. Changes in levels of symptoms and quality of life will also be measured. The participants will be asked to describe their working environment, and this will be related to outcome-measures.</detailed_description>
