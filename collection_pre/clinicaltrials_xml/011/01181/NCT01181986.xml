	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate whether exenatide, a type 2 diabetes medication, will improve the function of the innermost part of the arterial wall called the endothelium after a fat-enriched meal and to determine how this occurs. The results of this study will help to determine and understand a novel action of this group of diabetes medications based on the action of naturally occuring gut substances called incretins. This may have a significant impact on cardiovascular health in patients with early and longstanding diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Exenatide Action on Vessel Function in Type 2 Diabetes and Prediabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two independent, double-blinded, crossover substudies will be conducted to test the effect of exenatide on daylong post-meal and fasting endothelial function. We will measure endothelial function measured by peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT2000, Itamar Inc.). Patients with recent onset (&lt;3 years) or established (&gt;5 years, Substudy 1 only) diabetes and impaired sugar tolerance (Substudy 2 only) will be studied. The plan is to complete studies in 75 patients (40 in Substudy 1 and 35 in Substudy 2). In Substudy 1 patients will get twice a day a skin injection of exenatide (Byetta) or identically looking placebo for 10 days, separated by 14-day period. On the next day after each treatemnt period (day 11), they get just one injection and eat a fat-enriched breakfast. A fatty lunch of similar caloric content will be given 4 hours following the breakfast. Endothelial function will be measured just prior to the injection and every 2 hours for total 8 hours. In Substudy 2, patients on 3 different days will get infusion of exenatide withg or without a blocking drug exendin-9, and a control test with placebo without exendin-9. Endothelial function will be measured before the infusion and 2 hours later during the final 15 minutes of the infusion cocktails. Patients will not eat any meal during the test visits.</detailed_description>
