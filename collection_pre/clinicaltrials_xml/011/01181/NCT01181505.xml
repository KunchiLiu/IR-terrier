	<brief_summary>This study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine, substrate of CYP2D6 in healthy subject in relation to the presence of HNF-4A G60D variant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STUDY The Effect of HNF-4A G60D Variant on the In VIVO CYP2D6 Activity By Tolterodine Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a single oral administration of 2 mg tolterodine in 31 healthy subjects (6 with the heterozygous mutation of HNF-4A G60D vs 25 subjects with wild type of that whose CYP2D6 genotype and gender were matched with variant group), blood were collected for 24hrs. Assay of tolterodine and the metabolite, 5-hyroxymethyl tolterodine was conducted using LC/MS/MS.</detailed_description>
