	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine the incidence and severity of respiratory depression in elective cesarean section patients who have received a spinal or epidural narcotic called duramorph for management of postoperative pain. A monitoring device called a capnograph as well as a device called a pulse oximeter is placed on the patient once in the recovery room after delivery. The capnograph monitors the carbon dioxide level that the patient breathes out as well as their respiratory rate. The pulse oximeter is a device that is taped on the patient's finger and measures their oxygen saturation level. The monitoring is maintained for 18-24 hours after surgery.</brief_summary>
