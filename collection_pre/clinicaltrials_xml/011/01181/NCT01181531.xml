	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treatment with cinacalcet to manage plasma parathyroid levels as to compared traditional vitamin D therapy, whether given orally or intravenously, among hemodialysis subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism when the doses are adjusted appropriately to maintain serum calcium and phosphorous levels with currently recommended ranges.</brief_summary>
