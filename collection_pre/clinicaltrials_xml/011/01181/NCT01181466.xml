	<brief_title>AeriSealÂ® System for Lung Volume Reduction in Patients With Advanced Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema is a progressive, debilitating disease characterized by destruction of lung tissue as a result of inflammation caused by exposure to noxious inhaled agents for extended periods. The most common cause of this condition is cigarette smoking, although genetic, occupational, and environmental causes account for up to 10% of cases. Despite aggressive public health initiatives aimed at discouraging the use of cigarettes, smoking-related lung diseases remain a significant cause of disability and death worldwide. Due to the number of current and new smokers, emphysema is expected to remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for years to come. The AeriSeal System is a novel device system being developed for the treatment of advanced emphysema. The AeriSeal System is administered bronchoscopically, and designed to provide the physiological benefits of lung volume reduction without the risks and cost of major surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of advanced emphysema as defined by FEV1/FVC&lt;70% predicted, FEV1 of &lt;50% predicted, TLC &gt; 100% predicted, and RV &gt; 135% predicted. Patients must have persistent symptoms despite medical therapy and either not be candidates for Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS) or have elected not to undergo LVRS. Patients must be &gt; 40 years of age, have symptoms despite medical therapy, and have none of the prespecified comorbid conditions that could influence study outcomes or their ability to tolerate bronchoscopy.</criteria>
