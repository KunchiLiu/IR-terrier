	<brief_summary>Purpose: To compare the change in nasal cell HO-1 expression induced by two different preparations of sulforaphane (SFN)-containing nutritional supplements Participants: Healthy nonsmoking young adults, age 18-35 Procedures (methods): This pilot study will use a randomized crossover design. Subjects will be randomized to receive either the equivalent of 4 ounces/day of fresh broccoli sprouts (FBS) in food and tea, or the equivalent amount as broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH), for 3 consecutive days. Nasal lavage and blood samples will be obtained before, during and after this 3-day period. After at least a 2-week washout interval, the protocol will be repeated with the alternate supplement. The primary analysis will test the hypothesis that broccoli sprouts in food will increase HO-1 expression to a similar degree as the equivalent amount of sprouts in BSH</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of 2 Different Broccoli Sprout Containing Supplements on Nasal Cells in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Broccoli sprouts are a concentrated source of the potent phase 2 enzyme (antioxidant) potentiator, sulforaphane (SFN) in the form of its natural precursor, sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGSâ„¢). SFN is an isothiocyanate which has generated interest recently as a chemopreventive agent in cancer research, and as an antioxidant in inflammation research. Recently published data show that 3 days intake of broccoli sprouts in homogenate form is followed by significant upregulation of several phase 2 enzymes in nasal cells. Our group's research at the UNC Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology (CEMALB) focuses on the effects of oxidant pollutants on inflammatory and host defense responses to viral infections. One of the aims of our grant is to measure the effects of pre-treatment with SFN supplements, on nasal responses to live attenuated influenza virus vaccines. In preparation for this larger study, we here propose a pilot study comparing the effects of the published BSH supplement, vs. supplementation with foods containing fresh broccoli sprouts, on relevant nasal endpoints and serum SFN levels.</detailed_description>
