	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of NPC-01 to Treat Dysmenorrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to confirm the effectiveness and safety profile of NPC-01 in comparison with placebo in the treatment of dysmenorrhea (primary and secondary dysmenorrhea). Additionally we also investigate the differences of effectiveness of NPC-01 in comparison with IKH-01 in the treatment of secondary dysmenorrhea as a reference, because IKH-01 is already marketed at them. To achieve these, closed testing procedure is used in this study. After confirming statistical differences between NPC-01 and Placebo in the total dysmenorrhea, stratified analysis is carried out for primary dysmenorrhea (NPC-01, Placebo), and secondary dysmenorrhea (NPC-01, IKH-01 and Placebo).</detailed_description>
