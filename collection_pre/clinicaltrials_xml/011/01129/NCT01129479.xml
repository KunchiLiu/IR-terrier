	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment after stroke is common and has a major effect on morbidity and quality of life. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have demonstrated benefit in vascular dementia, but efficacy in treating more circumscribed cognitive deficits following stroke, such as aphasia, has not been systematically investigated. This study evaluated the efficacy of Galantamine (Reminyl) in subjects with chronic, stable non-fluent aphasia secondary to stroke. Subjects enrolled in a double-blind placebo- controlled cross-over study that employed a comprehensive battery of language tests and measures of general cognitive and behavioral status that will be used to control for factors that may influence language functioning. The primary study outcome was a within-subject comparison of changes in language function and behavioral scores between placebo and active-treatment phases (12 weeks each). Our hypothesis was that by increasing acetylcholine levels, and facilitating activity of other neurotransmitters affecting attentional systems, Galantamine would produce gains in both language and behavioral scores in patients suffering chronic effects in cognitive systems due to injury following stroke.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of aphasia with relatively spared comprehension. Onset 6 months or greater prior to enrollment. Native English speaker Righthanded. Adults (18 years of age or older). Patients receiving ongoing individual speech therapy. (Most patients are no longer eligible for individualized speech therapy after 6 months from stroke onset, thus this should not eliminate many patients). Extremely mild or extremely severe aphasia. (Boston Naming Test Score &lt;3 or &gt;45 items named from 60 items). Global dementia (and any other patient with reduced decisional capacity requiring a legally authorized representative for consent). Presence of major cognitive deficit other than aphasia caused by stroke related disease. Contraindications to cholinomimetic agents: History of active peptic ulcer disease within 1 year, Severe asthma, unstable angina, bradyarrhythmia with resting pulse less than 50, sick sinus syndrome, or seizures. Major psychiatric disorders that affect cognition including: psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse. Major medical conditions that alter cognition (e.g., heart failure, dialysis dependent renal failure, hepatic failure, active cancer). Impairments that affect metabolism of the medication including: Severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance equal to or greater than 9), and moderate or severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh score &gt;7) Patients using medications that have major effects on brain neurotransmitter systems or cognition within 2 months of enrollment. Exclusionary medications are: medications with significant anticholinergic activity (tricyclic antidepressants, diphenhydramine), antiParkinsonian medications (including Sinemet, amantadine, bromocriptine, pergolide, selegiline), and narcotic analgesics (&gt; 2 doses per week).</criteria>
