	<brief_summary>The purpose of this small, short pilot study is to determine the feasibility (e.g., recruitment, dose acceptance, retention) of a future longer trial comparing the effects of different types of milk (raw milk, cow's milk, nondairy-milk) on lactose maldigestion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Raw Versus Other Milk Sources on Lactose Digestion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal is to determine if raw milk consumption intake will benefit humans with lactose maldigestion, a common human response to the intake of dairy products during adult years. An increasing number of people are consuming raw unpasteurized milk. Enhanced nutritional qualities, taste, and health benefits have all been advocated as reasons for increased interest in raw milk consumption. However, science-based data to substantiate these claims are limited or anecdotal. Raw milk may differ in its ability to improve lactose maldigestion related symptoms from other milk types. Adult lactose maldigestion affects the majority of the world adult population. It appears that consumption of lactose containing foods by those who cannot digest lactose is a relatively common cause of irritable bowel syndrome.</detailed_description>
