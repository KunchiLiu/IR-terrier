	<brief_summary>Fiberoptic Intubation is the preferred technique to difficult airway. However, when performed by untrained anesthesiologists, bronchoscopic intubation has a high rate of failure. We want to know if the Transillumination-guided Fiberoptic Intubation technique can improves the success rate and time for tracheal intubation performed by inexperienced anesthesiologists; whether this technique improves the success rate and for normal intubations when performed by inexperienced anesthesiologists as well is unknown. Therefore, the authors compared the success rate and time of Fiberoptic Intubation versus the Transillumination-guided Fiberoptic Intubation performed by anesthesiologists inexperienced in Fiberoptic Intubation.</brief_summary>
