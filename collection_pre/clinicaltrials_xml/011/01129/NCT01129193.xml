	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: AR-42 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of AR-42 in treating patients with advanced or relapsed multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AR-42 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Relapsed Multiple Myeloma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the safety by estimating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and describe the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of AR-42 administered orally three times weekly (Mon, Wed, and Fri preferred) each week for 3 weeks during each 28-day period to adults with advanced or recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphoma, or multiple myeloma (MM). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AR-42 in this patient population. II. To analyze patient samples for descriptive information regarding AR-42 pharmacodynamic changes in this patient population. III. To obtain pilot data regarding efficacy at the MTD as measured by partial and complete responses in each disease subgroup during protocol expansion in stage III. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral AR-42 three times weekly on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.</detailed_description>
