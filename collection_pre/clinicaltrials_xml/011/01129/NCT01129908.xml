	<brief_summary>The celiac disease (CD) is a disease with an immune and genetic component that is activated by the presence of gluten, and damages the intestine mucosa and causes malabsorption of food. In the oral environment the investigators see enamel defects and recurrent ulcers. Celiac patients have to keep a restrict gluten-free diet, in order to prevent the clinical symptoms of the disease (such as diarrhea, stomach ache and weight loss). It has been assumed that the patients have less cariogenic diet, and that caries prevalence is not as high as in normal population. In celiac patients the investigators find enamel defects that are characterized with pits and deep fissures and sometimes the complete loss of enamel. These defects are classified by the grading of the CD related DED's (dental enamel defects) according to Aine. These defects are symmetrical defects in the permanent dentition, in teeth that develops at the same time. The cause is thought to be hypocalcaemia or genetic. These defects were found in 42.2% of celiac patients in appose to only 5.4% in healthy population. Recurrent ulcers were found in 41% in the oral cavity of celiac patients, compare to 27% in healthy population. After changing the diet to a gluten-free diet, an improvement is seen in the presence of these ulcers.</brief_summary>
