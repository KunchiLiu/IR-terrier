	<brief_title>Low-Level Laser Therapy in Chronic Autoimmune Thyroiditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT) is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-replete areas. An autoimmune dysfunction causes humoral and cellular responses that lead progressively to thyroiditis. There is no effective therapy available that can change the natural history of CAT, which presents a high incidence of hypothyroidism and requires continuous treatment with levothyroxine (LT4). Laser light can be valuable since the local and systemic actions of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) have been shown to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. There is also evidence suggesting that LLLT can facilitate regeneration of various tissues and, in animal thyroids, can lead to improvement in microcirculation and increases in serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels. Since the LLLT is a non-invasive, cost-effective and painless procedure, the objective of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of LLLT in patients with hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, based on patients' thyroid function, their concentration of thyroid autoantibodies, and the parameters of their ultrasonography study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients previously diagnosed with hypothyroidism induced by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT). The presence of hypothyroidism, laboratory measurements and ultrasonography criteria were applied to diagnose CAT. Significantly elevated concentrations of thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and/or thyroglobulin (TgAb) autoantibodies Ultrasonography results consistent with CAT Patients undergoing LT4 treatment Normal (or almost normal) levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), free T4 and thyrotropin (TSH) Use of immunosuppressants, immunostimulants, or other drugs that could interfere with the production, metabolism and transport of thyroid hormones CAT with normal thyroid function CAT with subclinical hypothyroidism Thyroid nodules Hypothyroidism stemming from postpartum thyroiditis (up to 18 months after gestation) History of Graves' disease Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) detectable Prior treatment with radioiodine Tracheal stenosis Pregnancy History of ionizing irradiation and/or neoplasia in the cervical area Previous surgical intervention in the thyroid Thyroid hypoplasia Ectopic thyroid Serious illness (cancer, ischemic coronary artery disease, stroke, kidney or liver failure, etc.)</criteria>
