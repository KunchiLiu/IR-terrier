	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate risk factors associated with depression and how such factors might be transmitted cross-generationally. We are conducting an integrative assessment of emotion regulation and stress reactivity in a group of mothers with and without a history of depression and their daughters. We use a range of methodologies to evaluate these processes, including self-report measures, information-processing performance, HPA-axis functioning and reactivity, and neural responses to emotional stimuli following exposure to stressful experiences.</detailed_description>
