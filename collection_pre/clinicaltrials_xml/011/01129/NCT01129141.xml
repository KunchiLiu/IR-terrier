	<brief_summary>This study continues the investigators' efforts to develop tinnitus management protocols for Veterans. More specifically, this study developed and evaluated an adaptation of Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM) for use as a telephone-based program for Veterans and military personnel who have experienced TBI. This adaptation, called Tele-PTM, is a telephone-based program and has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans with and without TBI for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on individual VA hospitals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telephone Tinnitus Education for Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is strongly associated with tinnitus. Tinnitus management for Veterans and military members with TBI has become a critical concern. The investigators' research has focused on developing effective, evidence-based methods of tinnitus management for Veterans. These efforts led to the development of Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM). The investigators completed a pilot study to adapt PTM to meet the unique tinnitus management needs of Veterans and military members with TBI using a novel home-based telehealth program called Tele-PTM. Preliminary data analyses indicated that Tele-PTM is effective. The present study modified the PTM program in accordance with pilot study findings and evaluated Tele-PTM using a randomized clinical trial design. The 4-year study was based at the VA National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR). Tele-PTM was implemented and evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Qualified candidates were randomized to receive either Tele-PTM or Wait-List Control (WLC). All subjects completed questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline. The WLC group received Tele-PTM after completing the 6-month questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Tele-PTM involves a series of seven telephone appointments, conducted at approximately 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after enrollment is finalized. Telephone education was provided by the Study Psychologist at weeks 1, 3, and 5, and month 6; and by the Study Audiologist at weeks 2 and 4, and month 3. Tele-PTM has the potential of providing needed tinnitus services to Veterans and active military personnel across the country for a relatively small cost and with minimal impact on individual VA hospitals.</detailed_description>
