	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, 26-week study of supervised exercise assessing three doses of exercise in sedentary individuals 65 years of age and over with age-related cognitive changes. A total of 100 subjects (n=25 in each of four groups) will be randomized to a non-aerobic control group, 75 minutes, 150 minutes, or 225 minutes a week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise spread over 3 to 5 days a week for 26 weeks. These exercise doses represent 50%, 100%, or 150% of the recommended exercise dose. Participants will be directly supervised during all exercise sessions for the first two months after which direct supervision will occur during at least one session a week. This is intended to provide increased flexibility while also maintaining direct contact with the participant to enhance adherence. Aerobic fitness, physical function, and cognition will be assessed at baseline and 26 weeks to examine the dose-response relationships.</brief_summary>
