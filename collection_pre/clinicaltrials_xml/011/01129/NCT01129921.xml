	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, randomized, prospective, double-blind, clinical study to assess the clinical application and outcomes with mild® devices versus sham in patients with symptomatic moderate to severe central canal spinal stenosis. Sham patients were eligible to choose to cross-over and have the actual decompression procedure after week 6 exam.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Constriction, Pathologic</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Symptomatic and lumbar spine stenosis (LSS) primarily caused by dorsal element hypertrophy. Prior failure of conservative therapy and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Score of &gt;20%. Radiologic evidence of LSS, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (typically &gt; 2.5mm)confirmed by pre op MRI and/or CT. Central canal cross sectional area clearly reduced per MRI/CT report. If present, anterior listhesis ≤ 5.0mm (preferred) and stable. Able to walk at least 10 feet unaided before being limited by pain. Available to complete 26 weeks of followup. A signed Informed consent Form is obtained from the subject. Adults at least 18 years of age. Prior surgery at intended treatment level. History of recent spinal fractures with concurrent pain symptoms as determined by the Investigator. Disabling back or leg pain from causes other than LSS (e.g. acute compression fracture, metabolic neuropathy, or vascular claudication symptoms, etc.). Disk protrusion or osteophyte formation severe enough to confound study outcome. Facet hypertrophy severe enough to confound study outcome. Bleeding disorders and/or current use of anticoagulants. Use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) within five days of treatment. Epidural steroid administration within prior 3 weeks(of procedure or sham) Inability of the subject to lie prone for any reason with anesthesia support (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, etc.). Metabolic wound healing pathologies deemed by Investigator to compromise study outcome. Dementia and/or inability to give informed consent. Pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. On Workman's Compensation or considering litigation associated with back pain.</criteria>
