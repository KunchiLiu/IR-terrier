	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to conduct a community-based randomized clinical trial to compare the caries prevention efficacy of fluoride varnish applied every six months vs. fluoride varnish applied every six months and fluoride releasing glass ionomer sealants applied annually to the eligible occlusal surfaces of primary molars in 3-6-year-old children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glass Ionomer Sealant and Fluoride Varnish Study to Prevent Early Childhood Caries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-based, stratified (by location) randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the relative efficacy of topically applied fluoride varnish (FV) applications alone vs FV with fluoride-releasing glass ionomer (GI) sealants on occlusal surfaces of primary molars in reducing the caries incidence and increment in 3-6 year old children. A parallel groups design RCT stratified by study site (one dental and one non-dental location) will be conducted among 596 initially 2.5- to 3-year-old children. Those eligible will be randomized to one of 2 groups (FV or GIS+FV) and followed for 36 months. The RCT will take place at two sites serving primarily underserved, minority and low-income populations in Southern California: 1) the dental facility of the San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) located near the U.S.-Mexican Border serves mainly Latino immigrants, and 2) the Comprehensive Health Center - Ocean View (CHC-OV), in a non-dental setting in close proximity to its dental clinic, which serves Latinos and African Americans. Both sites are part of a consortium of community clinics (SYHC Inc) and are located 15 miles apart from each other. Annual study dental examinations will be performed by trained, calibrated, study dentists to determine caries (precavitated and cavitated) incidence and increment. Children identified as needing dental care will be referred for appropriate treatment.</detailed_description>
