	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of CVD 1902 Oral Attenuated Vaccine to Prevent S. Paratyphi A Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enteric fever is a life-threatening illness caused by several types of a bacterium known as Salmonella, including Salmonella Paratyphi A. In the United States about 400 cases occur each year, and 75% of these are acquired while traveling internationally. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21.5 million persons each year.Besides being a first step towards a possible oral paratyphoid A vaccine for the prevention of enteric fever, this Phase 1 trial will shed light on the suitability of the guaBA,clpX strategy for attenuating non-typhoidal Salmonella, also an emerging pathogens of public health importance. This randomized, double-blinded, Phase I study in healthy is designed to investigate the safety, clinical tolerability, and immunogenicity in a dose escalating fashion of a live, oral, attenuated S. Paratyphi A at four dose levels (10^6, 10^7, 10^8, and 10^9 CFU). We hypothesize that S. Paratyphi A strains harboring mutations in guaBA and clpX will be well tolerated in the full dose range tested and that a single inoculation at the highest dose will elicit vigorous humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans.</detailed_description>
