	<brief_summary>The study aims to confirm the acceptability of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for use as nutritional supplements for pregnant and lactating women (PLW) or infants and young children (IYC) and micronutrient powder (MNP) for use as nutritional supplements for infants and young children in Bangladesh.We hypothesized that at least 75 percent of the test dose of LNS and MNP offered to PLW and IYC will be consumed by them.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in three steps. Step 1 will be a test-feeding to compare the acceptability of each "version" of the LNS-child (LNS-child with cardamom flavor, LNS-child with no added flavor),LNS-PLW (LNS-PLW with cumin flavor, and LNS-PLW with no added flavor) and MNP to the others in terms of taste, smell and texture, as well as amount of the test-dose consumed. In Step 2, participants in the Phase 1 trial will receive a 2-week supply of one of the LNS products or MNP, which they will consume daily in their homes for 14 days under real-life conditions. In Step 3, focus group discussions will be held with participants to discuss different aspects of infant and child feeding and discuss best ways for the LNS or MNP product to be used in the context of Bangladesh.</detailed_description>
