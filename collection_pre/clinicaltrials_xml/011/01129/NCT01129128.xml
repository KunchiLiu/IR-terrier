	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine if either of two, commercially available, Echinacea purpurea products stimulate the immune system. For the study, 60 healthy adults will be randomized to receive one of the two Echinacea purpurea products or placebo for 10 days. Blood will be drawn to assess immune markers just before beginning the study medication, during the 10 day course of medication and after completing the course of medication. It is postulated that adults receiving either of the Echinacea products will have evidence of immune stimulation and those receiving placebo will not.</brief_summary>
