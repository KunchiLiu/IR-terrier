	<brief_title>Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Markers of Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major purpose of this study is to examine the effect of two sources of dietary omega-3 fatty acids, each given at two doses, on potential health benefits related to cardiovascular disease prevention. The two sources of dietary omega-3 fatty acids will be fish oil, and flax seed oil. Each will be given at a lower dose that could realistically be achieved from food sources alone, and at a higher dose that could not realistically be achieved from food alone and would require supplementation. The outcomes being studied are markers of inflammation. The subjects being studied are those with elevated risk factors for diabetes and heart disease that meet the criteria for the "metabolic syndrome". These are the people who are currently not diabetic, and who have not been diagnosed yet with heart disease, who are at risk of developing these diseases and who would likely benefit the most from the omega-3 therapy should it prove to be effective.</detailed_description>
