	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy using tomotherapy is delivered in 5 Gy daily fractions for a total of 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/m2/d)and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/d) is delivered concurrently on day 1-5 during radiotherapy. Total mesorectal excision is performed within 6±2 weeks.
