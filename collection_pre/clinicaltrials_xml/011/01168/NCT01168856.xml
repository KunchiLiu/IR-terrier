	<brief_summary>This observational long-term follow-up study will assess the persistence of direct acting antiviral (DAA) resistant mutations and the durability of sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C who have participated in a Roche DAA treatment protocol. Up to 5 scheduled monitoring visits for blood sampling during an observational period of up to 36 months.</brief_summary>
