	<brief_summary>Computer Program for Evaluation of the Symmetry between the Primary Sulci of the Two Fetal Brain Hemispheres Using 3-dimensional Ultrasound Planes This retrospective study is based on the computerized analysis of the orthogonal fetal brain planes. The images are obtained from the digital archive of the fetal sonographic examinations done in Bnai Zion Medical Center. In addition, midsagittal measurements of fetal head will be obtained from this archive of 3-dimensional images. Study measurements will provide the quantitative parameters of normal fetal brain sulcation. Normal fetal head growth in midsagittal plane will be studied also.</brief_summary>
