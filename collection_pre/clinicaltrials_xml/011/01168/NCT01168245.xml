	<brief_title>TMS Stimulation and Cognitive Training in Alzheimer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current available pharmaceutical treatment for Alzheimer Disease (AD) is only partially and temporary effective. Therefore, new approaches are needed. rTMS is a non-invasive technique which generates a small electric current that induces a modulation in cortical excitability. In addition, cognitive training was suggested to improve cognitive functions in Alzheimer patients. In this study we intend to treat mild to moderate AD patients with rTMS interlaced with cognitive training (rTMS- COG). Patients with probable AD will be treated with rTMS-COG daily for 6 weeks followed by maintenance sessions for additional 3 months.</detailed_description>
