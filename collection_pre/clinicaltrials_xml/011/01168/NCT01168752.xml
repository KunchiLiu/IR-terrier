	<brief_title>Study of Debio 0932 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase I, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in patients with advanced and/or refractory malignancies (solid tumours or lymphoma), to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of Debio 0932 administered orally every-other-day (schedule A) or every day (schedule B) and to assess its safety profile, pharmakokinetic, antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Increments used in dose escalation will be determined according to the maximum grade of treatment-related adverse events observed during the first 30-day treatment period of each schedule in the previous in the preceding dose level Once reaching the recommended dose (RD) for each schedule, up to 40 additional patients will be enrolled and treated at the RD of the retained schedule, as part of an expansion phase.</detailed_description>
