	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, cross-over single-dose study to test the absolute bioavailability of oral crizotinib formulation to IV formulation in healthy adult volunteers. Fourteen (14) subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 evaluable subjects who complete the study. Each subject will receive two treatments (A and B) with a washout period of at least 14 days between each treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female of nonchildbearing potential subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m^2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs) Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy). A positive urine drug screen. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21 drinks/week for males within 6 months of screening. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 halflives preceding the first dose of study medication. 12lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening. Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential, including those with tubal ligation. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study. A positive serology for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Subjects who are currently smoking.</criteria>
