	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a near-infrared transmission measurement in blood samples collected from healthy volunteers. We propose that NIR spectroscopic blood glucose measurements in healthy patients are as accurate as handheld glucometers and a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI). We will also evaluate in vitro blood samples spiked with pharmacological interferents to test if the spectroscopic glucose measurement is affected by common medications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Luminous Medical is developing an automated glucose measurement system that addresses the rapidly growing clinical demand for tight glycemic control in the intensive care unit (ICU), operating room (OR), and intermediate care units. The system automatically measures glucose and other analytes by spectroscopically analyzing blood as it passes through a disposable Sensor Set. Our unique optical measurement does not chemically interact with blood, is insensitive to sensor fouling, and, unlike a biosensor, does not require frequent recalibration.</detailed_description>
