	<brief_summary>Spirometry is a recommended component of asthma diagnosis and treatment in the primary care setting, yet few providers report its routine use for children with asthma. Misclassification of asthma severity occurs when assessment is based on symptoms alone. This misclassification can lead to inadequate treatment, increased morbidity, and increased healthcare utilization/cost. The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of a distance learning quality improvement program called Spirometry 360 developed by the interactive Medical Training Resources (iMTR) group at the University of Washington Child Health Institute. The Spirometry 360 program aims to improve care for children with asthma by enhancing provider knowledge and self-efficacy related to the use and interpretation of office-based spirometry.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Spirometry 360 program includes: 1. "Spirometry Fundamentalsâ„¢: A basic guide to lung function testing," a computer-based training program that teaches primary care providers how to coach patients to produce high-quality spirometry tests and accurately interpret spirometric data; 2. Spirometry Learning Lab: Case-based teaching of spirometry in practice guides test administrators and interpreters through clinical examples in an interactive virtual classroom setting. These sessions are led by expert clinical faculty and are archived for future reference and review; 3. Spirometry Feedback: Tailored analysis of providers' spirometry testing sessions offers monthly individualized feedback reports by clinical experts on spirometry tests performed in the clinic. This is a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the Spirometry 360 program. The Spirometry 360 program will be provided to 25 primary care pediatric practices from two practice-based research networks. A separate group of 25 matched control practices recruited from these same networks will receive standard training from the equipment vendor during the study and the Spirometry 360 training program at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
