	<brief_summary>The overall goals of this study are to (1) expand knowledge about interactions of levetiracetam with alcohol by assessing the effects of levetiracetam compared to placebo in moderate and heavy social alcohol users and (2) to test the AccuswayTM platform as a tool to measure postural control (which has been used as a marker of intoxication) and the effects of levetiracetam on postural control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Levetiracetam (Keppra) on Alcohol Consumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a 42-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in light to moderate and heavy alcohol users who are social drinkers. The specific aims are to: 1. Determine if levetiracetam alters daily alcohol consumption by comparing the mean drinks consumed per day during levetiracetam administration compared with the mean drinks per day consumed during placebo administration. 2. Obtain blood that will be banked for future genetic analysis of polymorphisms in genes that may predict the level of response to alcohol or effects of levetiracetam on alcohol consumption. 3. Test whether the AccuswayTM platform can detect changes in body sway in light to moderate or heavy social drinkers and in subjects taking levetiracetam versus placebo.</detailed_description>

Current or past dependence on, or addiction to any psychoactive drug (except nicotine or caffeine) including alcohol, as determined by the study physician's assessment. 6. Current or prior enrollment in an alcohol or other drug treatment program, or current legal problems relating to alcohol or other drug use, including awaiting trial or supervision by a parole or probation officer. 7. Binge drinking more than three times per week (binge defined as &gt;5 standard drinks in one session). 8. Alcohol consumption &gt;21 drinks/week for women and &gt;25 drinks/week for men. 9. Currently trying to quit alcohol and/or recreational drug use. 10. Positive for lifetime abnormal opioid use or prescription drug abuse. 11. Clinically significant medical or psychiatric illness (including anxiety or panic disorders) as determined by screening blood tests, medical history, and physical exam performed or reviewed by the study physician. 12. Bilirubin more than 2 times the normal upper limit. 13. AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or alkaline phosphatase more than 2 times the normal upper limit. 14. Body Mass Index &gt;30 or &lt;18 15. Pregnancy or a woman of child bearing potential not currently using an adequate means of contraception. 16. Currently taking any medication other than overthecounter nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, acetaminophen, inhaled asthma therapy, contraceptives, nicotine patches, and overthecounter nonsedating antihistamines.NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or any other OTC (including herbal) medication (unless cleared by study physician). 17.
