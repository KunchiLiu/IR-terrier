	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well ixabepilone works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent uterine cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells of by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rate of patients with persistent or recurrent carcinosarcoma of the uterus treated with ixabepilone. II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the expression of class III beta-tubulin in carcinosarcoma of the uterus. II. To explore the association between class III beta-tubulin expression with response, progression-free survival, and overall survival in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor tissue samples from prior surgery may be collected for class III beta-tubulin analysis by IHC. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
