	<brief_summary>Sodium loading during hemodialysis treatment is common and may contribute to increased interdialytic weight gain and hypertension. Excessive use of isotonic saline (containing 0.9% sodium chloride) is one of the factors that may cause sodium loading. During each hemodialysis session, approximately 400 mL of isotonic saline fluid, representing 1.4 grams of sodium, is used to prime and rinse the extracorporeal circuit, and is often administered to the patient. Switching to a non sodium-containing priming and rinsing fluid could allow for removal of the equivalent amount of sodium. Switching to a non sodium-containing solution for the priming and rinsing of the extracorporeal circuit can contribute to increased sodium removal during the dialysis treatment and allow for reduced interdialytic weight gain, reduced thirst, and improved blood pressure control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 12 week study consists of 3 phases: Phase 1 (4 weeks): Observation only. Standard priming/rinsing procedure with isotonic saline Phase 2 (4 weeks): Intervention. Switch to a 5% dextrose solution for priming/rinsing procedure Phase 3 (4 weeks): Switch back to standard priming/rinsing procedure with isotonic saline During the study, blood pressures will be measured in a standardized manner at 2 week intervals, a thirst questionnaire will be completed at the end of each phase, and interdialytic weight gain, in-center pre/post-HD blood pressure and intradialytic symptoms will be recorded, apart for routinely measured parameters.</detailed_description>
