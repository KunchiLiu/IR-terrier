	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Oral CEM-101 Compared to Oral Levofloxacin in Treatment of Patients With Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma with symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, chills, rigors, chest pain, and/or dyspnea. The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, including the macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, has resulted in a need for new and effective antibiotics that have activity again CABP pathogens. CEM-101 is the first fluoroketolide with excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against resistant S. pneumoniae and other key typical and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of community acquired bacterial pneumonia (e.g. cough with purulent sputum or change in character of sputum consistent with bacterial infection, dyspnea or tachypnea, chest pain due to pneumonia, fever, presence of rales and/or signs of consolidation). 2. No prior systemic antibacterial therapy, unless failed other therapy. 3. Chest Xray shows new lobar or multilobar infiltrate(s) consistent with acute bacterial pneumonia. 4. PORT Risk Class II, III, or IV &lt;=105 5. Ability to take oral medication. 1. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease FEV1 &lt;30%. 2. Hospitalization within 90 days or residence in a longtermcare facility within 30 days prior to the onset of symptoms 3. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the previous 3 months. 4. Significant hepatic, hematological, renal abnormalities. 5. Any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude an evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy and followup could be completed (e.g. life expectancy &lt;30 days).</criteria>
