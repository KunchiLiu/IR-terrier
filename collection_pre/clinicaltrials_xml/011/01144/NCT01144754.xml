	<criteria>Previously untreated patients with DLBCL of the breast. Patients must have CD20 positive tumors. Stage IE or IIE. Must have at least one objective measurable or evaluable disease. Baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration to the study. Patients must not have historical or radiographic evidence of CNS metastasis including previously treated, resected or asymptomatic brain lesions or leptomeningeal involvement. Patients must have an ECOG performance status 02. Patients must have adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory studies (within 2 weeks prior to registration): Creatinine Clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min Total bilirubin &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl and AST &lt;= 2 x upper limit of normal. If documented hepatic involvement with lymphoma, total bilirubin can be &lt;= 3 x *ULN, and AST &lt;= 5 x ULN. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1500/mm3 and platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm3. If documented bone marrow involvement with lymphoma, absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 500/mm^3 and platelet count &gt;= 50,000/mm^3. Patients must be age &gt;= 18 years. Women must not be pregnant or breast feeding due to potential harmful effects to the fetus/baby. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception.
