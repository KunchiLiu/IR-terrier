	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to determine whether interventional treatment (i.e. epidural steroids), conservative therapy, or the combination, is superior for cervical radiculopathy. One hundred and sixty eight patients with radicular neck pain will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either cervical epidural steroid injections (CESI), non-interventional management with physical therapy and medications, or a combination of the two. The first follow-up visit will be at 1-month. In patients who obtain some benefit but continue to report significant pain, either a 2nd CESI can be done, the patient's medications can be adjusted, or both in the combination group. Those patients who fail to obtain any benefit will exit the study to receive another treatment or alternative care. The second follow-up visit will be at 3-months. Similar to the 1-month follow-up, the doctor may elect to change nothing in patients who are satisfied, adjust medications, schedule the patient for another CESI, or do both in the combination group. Patients who fail to obtain any benefit can exit the study to receive alternative treatment. The final follow-up visit will be at 6 months.</brief_summary>
