	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that adalimumab induces mucosal healing in the small bowel and that mucosal healing correlates with disease activity. 30 Patients with isolated active small bowel Crohn's disease which are candidates to receive anti-TNF treatment will be included in the study. All patients will undergo patency capsule examination and capsule endoscopy afterwards. Small bowel endoscopic disease severity will be assessed by the capsule endoscopy Crohn's disease activity index (CECDAI). The patients will receive Adalimumab (Humira)injections (160mg,80mg and 40mg every 2 weeks ) for 12 weeks. on week 14 a second capsule endoscopy will be performed and CECDAI calculated again. The patients clinical condition, CDAI,IBDQ and laboratory results including CRP, CBC and fecal calprotectin will be assessed on weeks o, 7 and 14 and results will be compared with the endoscopic score.</brief_summary>
