	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether left atrial appendage flow velocity, as determined using trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE), predicts the outcome after catheter ablation of persistent Atrial fibrillation( pAF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Value of Left Atrial Appendage Flow for Prediction of Successful Catheter Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 PAF patients underwent 3D mapping and ablation. A stepwise approach including circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, continuous complex-fractionated electrogram (CFE) ablation and linear ablation was performed by the same operator. The procedural end point was termination of persistent AF by catheter ablation, either by conversion directly to sinus rhythm or to atrial tachycardia. Left atrial appendage (LAA) peak flow velocities were measured with transesophageal echography and averaged within each RR interval of 10 consecutive cardiac cycles.</detailed_description>
