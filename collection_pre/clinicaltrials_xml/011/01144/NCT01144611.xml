	<brief_summary>This multi-centre prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (bIAP) in reducing the pro-inflammatory post-surgical responses and thereby preserving organ functions in patients undergoing invasive cardiac surgery: combined aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female patients of any race in the ages of &gt;18 years. Patients scheduled for combined aortic valve replacement and CABG surgery. Patients who have given written informed consent prior to participation in the trial and who undertake to comply with the protocol. Patients who are unwilling or unable to be fully evaluated for followup. Patients who have base AP levels at &gt; 125 IU/L, or levels &lt; 30 IU/L (ammediol, DEA (diethanolamine) units) Patients who show preoperative infections or who are suspected of endocarditis or systemic infection. Patients who refuse to accept medicallyindicated blood products. Patients who have evidence of significant hepatic disease, including history of clinical signs or laboratory values of total bilirubin &gt; 34.2 Âµmol/L (&gt; 2.0 mg/dL), ALT (&gt;120) or AST (&gt;135) corresponding to &gt; 3X upper limit of normal. Patients who received investigational drugs in the 30 days prior to study drug administration, or are currently participating in a study during which the administration of investigational drugs within one month is anticipated. Patients who require preoperative ventilatory support. Patients who have renal insufficiency (history of creatinine &gt;177mol/L or &gt;2.0 mg/dL) or chronic renal failure requiring dialysis. Patients who are planned to receive leukocytedepletion filtration as part of the bypass circuitry. Patients with severe neurological deficits. Patients who have a recent history of drug or alcohol abuse. Patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Patients with a history of cancer who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 3 months. Patients receiving only adjuvant hormonal therapy are not excluded. Patients who are scheduled to receive "stress doses" of glucocorticoids (i.e., doses &gt;2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent) prior to, during or following surgery. Patients who are vegetarians or veganists or those patients that may be expected not to be tolerant for bovine proteins. Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study. A welldocumented screening log should be present in the clinic.</criteria>
