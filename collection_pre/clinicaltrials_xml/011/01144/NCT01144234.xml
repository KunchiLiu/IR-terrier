	<brief_summary>HIV /AIDS is a major public health problem in Uganda. The prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV/ AIDS (PMTCT) was launched in Uganda in November 2001 and in Mbale Hospital in May 2002. Currently, PMTCT services have been integrated into mainstream antenatal care services throughout the country. Though engaging men as partners is a critical component in the PMTCT programme, their involvement has been low. Measures to increase male partner involvement in the PMTCT programmes have not been explored in Uganda. Objectives: To determine the effect of a written invitation letter to the spouses of women, attending their first antenatal visit on: (a) couple attendance at subsequent antenatal clinic visits; and (b) couple acceptance of HIV testing. Study site: The study will be carried out at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in eastern Uganda Study design: A randomised clinical trial among 1060 (530 intervention and 530 control) new antenatal attendees. The intervention will be a written invitation letter to their spouses. Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the proportion of pregnant women who come with their partners for ANC at the subsequent antenatal visit. Utility: The results of this study will be utilised in re-orienting the ANC services to encourage male participation and hopefully improve the uptake of the PMTCT services at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital.</brief_summary>
