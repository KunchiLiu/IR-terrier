	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to better understand the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of MPDs. We will collect peripheral blood samples from MPD patients and utilize multiparameter phospho-specific flow cytometry to investigate dysregulated signaling in blood cells from these patients. This will provide deeper insights into the pathogenesis of MPDs and may lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</brief_summary>
