	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label study will assess the efficacy and safety of MabThera (rituximab) added to standard chemotherapy in participants with untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. Participants will receive MabThera (372 mg/m^2 intravenously) on Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle in addition to standard chemotherapy for 6 cycles. In participants experiencing complete or partial response, MabThera will be continued as consolidation therapy for 2 more cycles.</brief_summary>
