	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate a therapy delivery system for stroke patients that provide accessible, affordable stroke care. User-friendly home therapy robots and a telerehabilitation system are combined to monitor and provide therapy that is accessible for patients in rural and underserved locations. The robotic-based home therapy intervention will produce significantly greater improvement in upper extremity motor function than Usual and Customary Care enhanced with a (non-robotic) home therapy upper extremity rehabilitation program at the end of 8 weeks of home therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this proposal is to evaluate a combined clinic/home robotic-based stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system in rural and underserved locations that provides accessible, effective and affordable care for stroke survivors with residual limb impairment. The study is a prospective, single-blind, multi-site Randomized Controlled Trial. A total of 96 patients within 6 months post-stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: robotic based home therapy or a self administered (non-robotic) home therapy program.</detailed_description>
