	<brief_title>Leukocyte Dysfunction in Diabetic Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leucocytes from poorly controlled diabetes exhibit aberrant chemotaxis, increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, leukotriene production, lysosomal enzyme release, proinflammatory cytokine expression and production of reactive oxygen species. Aberrant glucose concentration in diabetics affects functions of peripheral blood system as well as the immune system leading to impaired host defense. Impaired wound healing is a serious complication associated with diabetes. We hypothesized that impairment in leukocyte function results in dysfunctional inflammatory response in diabetic wounds. The proposed studies focus on characterizing mechanisms that will improve our understanding of the dysfunctional inflammatory response resulting in non-healing chronic wounds in diabetics.</detailed_description>
