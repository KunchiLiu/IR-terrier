	<detailed_description>Drug dependence is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. In China, among more than 100, 0000 registered drug addicts mostly are heroin dependence. Drug dependence post great risks to physical condition, their family and society, and can lead to infectious disease transmission. Though almost 500 MMT clinics which can offer MMT service to heroin addicts have been set up, there are still some problems, for example, poor compliance, high rate of dropping out and relapse which affect the service delivery to them. The guideline developed by WHO focused on psychotherapy to opiate addicts with MMT. So delivery of a set of comprehensive, integrated psychotherapy to opiate addicts is very critical in such methadone clinics.</detailed_description>
