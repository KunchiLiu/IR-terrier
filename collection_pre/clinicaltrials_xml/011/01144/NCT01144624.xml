	<brief_summary>The two co-primary objectives of this study are to assess in Japanese patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock: 1) the safety and tolerability of two different doses of intravenous AZD9773 and 2) the PK of AZD9773. The secondary objective is to make a preliminary assessment of the pharmacodynamics of two different doses of intravenous AZD9773 in Japanese patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock.</brief_summary>
