	<brief_summary>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning(RIPC) and remote ischemic postconditioning(RIPoC) seems to have a protective effect during ischemic period. Using cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) during open heart surgery reduces pulmonary blood flow and may cause ischemic damage to lung tissue. The investigators anticipate that RIPC and RIPoC may reduce lung injury after CPB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning and Postconditioning on Lung Injury During Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) can cause lung function deterioration through various mechanisms. Lung parenchymal tissue ischemia resulted by pulmonary atelectasis and decreased bronchial circulation during CPB is one of the reasons. There were few studies reported that RIPC and RIPoCcan benefit lung function of children or infant after CPB, but studies about adults are still lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate effect of RIPC and RIPoC on the lung function after CPB. Methods: Patients will randomly allocated either in study group or control group. Study group will receive RIPC and RIPoC maneuver before and after CPB. Control group will have same automated cuff around their arm but it will not activated. Care givers will be blinded whether the automated cuff is on or not. We will compare pulmonary parameters (PaO2/FiO2, dynamic and static compliances, Intrapulmonary shunts, etc.) between study group and control group, and check levels of plasma cytokines(IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha) till 24hr after the operation.</detailed_description>
