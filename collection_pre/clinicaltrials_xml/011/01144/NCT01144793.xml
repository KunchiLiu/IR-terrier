	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure, in pilot/observational study, panels of circulating proteins in real time at the onset of neutropenic fever/infection in patients with acute or chronic leukemias undergoing chemotherapy or other biologic treatment. And to generate preliminary trend results in panels of circulating proteins longitudinally during the period of neutropenia and to correlate those values to clinical/laboratory data and patient outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To identify potential biomarkers for the prediction of NF, we performed serial measurements of nine biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), protein C, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1] using a multiplex ELISA array platform every 6-8 hours in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt;= 18 Preadmission (ATU, ITA) or inpatient status absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;= 1500/mm^3 Patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia who: are admitted with newly diagnosed disease and have not yet received induction chemotherapy are admitted with neutropenic fever after receiving postremission chemotherapy or are admitted for postremission chemotherapy Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or a chronic lymphoid leukemia/disorder who have received chemotherapy or other diseasespecific treatment in the last 30 days where the ANC of &lt;=1500/mm3 is considered by the treating physician to be at least possibly treatmentrelated An intravenous line or catheter (Hickman, port, portacath, or peripherally inserted central venous catheter [PICC] line) must be in place at the time of protocol participation/study start, but will not be inserted solely for the purposes of the study. Whenever possible, patients will be consented and blood monitoring will be initiated before the first dose of antibiotic, but if not possible, at no time will standard of care measures will be delayed or interrupted for the purposes of study enrollment. Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study and give written informed consent. There are no exclusion criteria. Anyone who does not meet inclusion criteria will be excluded.</criteria>
