	<brief_summary>This is an evaluative, monocentric study in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and left bundle branch block who received an ICD-CRT. It is an early investigation on the safety and effects of a single administration of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells after implantation of an ICD-CRT device as an adjunct to CRT and usual drug treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>chronic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;35 %) in chronic ischemic heart disease and asynchronic contraction with indication for a biventricular stimulation (CRT, chronic resynchronization therapy), who do not have an improvement of &gt;15% of LVEF 3 months after CRTdevice implantation wall motion dysfunction of any territory left bundle branch block Patients were on individual optimal treatment for chronic ischemic heart disease with one or a combination of the following drug types: diuretics, ÃŸblockers, ACEinhibitors, AT1 blockers and/or lipid lowering agents for at least 30 days before CRT Implantation patients with left ventricular dysfunction due to other reasons than ischemic cardiomyopathy, e.g. hypertension, dilatative cardiomyopathy with relevant valvular disease; Aneurysma of the anterior myocardial wall or myocardial wall thickness of &lt; 5 mm, with overt heart failure, other than ischemic cardiomyopathy, with history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA), with history of thromboembolic event (e.g. phlebothrombosis, pulmonary embolism), bleeding disorders and known disease of the coagulation system; with extensive deviations of baseline laboratory values and significant findings at physical examination which in the opinion of the investigator may worsen under treatment; with severe systemic disease (e.g. known or suspected anaphylaxia, intolerance against Xray or contrast agent and, premalignant and malignant disease) atrial fibrillation with average heart rate &gt;70 bpm pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who have not had a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours before treatment; with any disease or condition that seriously compromises the function of other body systems than the heart and/or might interfere with conduct of the study and interpretation of the results; patients with a chronic or acute HIV, HBV, HCVinfection; improvement of more than 15% of LVEF 3 months after CRTdevice implantation patients who have a ICD Implantation for secondary prophylactic indication. These patients show a history of resuscitation, VT or syncope. patients who are currently participating in another investigational drug or device study</criteria>
