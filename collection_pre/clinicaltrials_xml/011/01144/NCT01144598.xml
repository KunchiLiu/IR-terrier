	<detailed_description>This post marketing observational study will be conducted in cross-sectional, non-interventional, multi-center format in Turkey. As this is a post marketing observational study, Abbott is not involved in the product supply since the drug is being used according to the approved marketing label and is to be prescribed by the physician under usual and customary practice of physician prescription.
