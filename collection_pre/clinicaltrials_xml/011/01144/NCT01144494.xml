	<brief_title>Aqueous Humor Dynamics and Brimonidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center, investigator-masked, crossover study is designed to investigate the circadian rhythms of aqueous humor dynamics in human subjects with ocular hypertension (OHT) before and after intervention with a commonly used ocular hypotensive medication, brimonidine. Thirty volunteers with ocular hypertension (intraocular pressure greater than 20mmHg) will be enrolled. The subjects will undergo a baseline phase and medication phase using brimonidine. At both phases, they will attend a daytime and a nighttime study visit in which fluorophotometry will be used to calculate aqueous flow (production), trabecular outflow facility, and uveoscleral outflow. At the completion of the study, subjects will return to their previous ophthalmic clinic.</detailed_description>

History of severe, unstable, or uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic or renal disease. History of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Less than one month (prior to baseline) stable dosing regimen of any nonglaucoma medication that would affect IOP. Gonioscopy angle &lt; 2. Inability to be dosed with treatment medication Inability to discontinue contact lens wear. Therapy with any investigational agent within 30 days of screening. Use of any additional topical or systemic adjunctive ocular hypotensive medications during the study. History of open angle glaucoma (either primary open angle glaucoma or other cause of open angle glaucoma) or narrow angle glaucoma.</criteria>
