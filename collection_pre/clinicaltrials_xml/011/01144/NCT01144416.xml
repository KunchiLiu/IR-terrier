	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that a single injection of SCH 900962/MK-8962 is non-inferior to daily injections of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (recFSH) during the first week of ovarian stimulation in terms of the number of vital pregnancies (ie, presence of at least one fetus with heart activity as assessed by ultrasound at least 35 days after embryo transfer) in women aged 35 to 42 years undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</brief_summary>

More than 20 basal antral follicles &lt;11 mm (both ovaries combined) in the early follicular phase. Less than 2 ovaries or any other ovarian abnormality. Unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinx. Intrauterine fibroids ≥5 cm or any clinically relevant pathology, which could impair embryo implantation or pregnancy continuation. More than three unsuccessful COS cycles for IVF/ICSI since the last established ongoing pregnancy (if applicable). A history of non or low ovarian response to FSH/human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) treatment. A history of recurrent miscarriage. FSH &gt;15.0 IU/L or luteinizing hormone (LH) &gt;12.0 IU/L during the early follicular phase. Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B.

Smoking or recently stopped smoking (ie, within the last 3 months prior to signing informed consent). A recent history or presence of alcohol or drug abuse. The participant or the sperm donor has known gene defects, genetic abnormalities, or abnormal karyotyping, relevant for the current indication or for the health of the offspring.
