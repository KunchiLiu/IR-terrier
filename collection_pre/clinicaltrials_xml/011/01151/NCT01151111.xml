	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease patients may have pronounced ON-OFF motor fluctuations. These motor fluctuations are currently treated with medication and surgery, which are limited by their efficacy and side effects. Our study aims to determine whether relaxation guided imagery can alleviate the OFF state of PD patients and therefore can be used as an adjunct to conventional medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relaxation Guided Imagery for Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson's disease patients with pronounced ON-OFF motor fluctuations without dementia will participate in this study aimed to examine a possible beneficial effect of relaxation guided imagery on motor fluctuations. The study will include a baseline period two sessions of relaxation and a follow-up period. The relaxation sessions will be conducted individually. In one session patients will hear relaxing music and in the second they will undergo relaxation guided imagery. After each relaxation session patients will receive a CD with either relaxing music or RGI to listen to at home. They will be asked to fill out a diary at baseline and after each session. Before and after each relaxation session patients will be examined according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the examination will be videotaped. All patients will continue to receive the usual care from their medical providers. The main measure is change in UPDRS and secondary measure is change in daily OFF time.</detailed_description>
