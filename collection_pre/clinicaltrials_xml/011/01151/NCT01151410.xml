	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a randomized, double-blind fashion, the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of aliskiren compared to the active comparator enalapril in children, 6 - 17 years old with hypertension (msSBP ≥ 95th percentile for age, gender and height, at baseline in study CSPP100A2365). Patients will be randomized to receive either aliskiren or enalapril. Weight-group based doses of aliskiren or enalapril will be administered once daily and children will receive study medication in a double-blind manner. This study is being conducted to support monotherapy registration of aliskiren for the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients 6-17 years of age (age at baseline in Study CSPP100A2365).</brief_summary>
