	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing elbow arthroscopy surgery will receive standard anesthesia and analgesia (infraclavicular nerve block combined with general anesthesia for surgery; continuous infusion via infraclavicular catheter to day 3 post op). Patients in the experimental group will be discharged home after one day, with infraclavicular catheter in place; patients in the comparator group will stay in hospital for 3 or 4 days, per standard practice. The study will compare range of motion as the primary endpoint, in a non-inferiority design, to see if early discharge is feasible while providing similar recovery.</brief_summary>
