	<brief_summary>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD or lung reperfusion edema) complicates 10 to 20% of lung transplantations and leads to severe early and late postoperative complications. Its pathophysiology remains unclear but may involve graft ischemia-reperfusion, increased vascular permeability, pneumocyte dysfunction and finally alveolar flooding that impair gas exchange and blood oxygenation.Its substrate, namely extravascular lung water (EVLW), can now be clinically measured with minimally invasive Intensive Care Unit monitors (PiCCO2Â®, Pulsion Medical Systems) that also provides a physical estimate of pulmonary vascular permeability (PVPI). Similarly, biochemical correlates of vascular permeability (ICAM-1) and pneumocyte dysfunction (RAGE) can now be measured in plasma samples. Our study aims at quantifying physical and biochemical markers of PGD and assess their diagnosis and prognosis values.</brief_summary>
