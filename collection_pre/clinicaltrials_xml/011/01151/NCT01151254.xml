	<brief_summary>All patients undergoing cardiac surgery require intraoperative anesthesia and short-term postoperative sedation with anesthetic agents after the procedure when patient is in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical data obtained so far are concentrating on intraoperative use volatile agents (preconditioning) resulting in better postoperative cardiac function and less release of biochemical markers of myocardial damage. There are no studies investigating whether postoperative use of volatile agents (post conditioning) in cardiac surgical population is improving outcomes. The aim of the present study is to compare total intravenous anesthesia and postoperative sedation versus total volatile anesthesia and postoperative sedation in cardiac surgical population.</brief_summary>
