	<brief_title>A Clinical Evaluation of the ProNOVA XR Polymer Free Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter registry of approximately 50 patients undergoing PCI with the ProNOVA Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System according to its Instructions for Use. The purpose of this registry is the evaluation of the performance, safety and efficacy of ProNOVA XR DES in real-world patients. Following initial stent implantation, all patients will have clinical follow up at 30 days, at 6 and 12 months. Additionally all patients will have a angiographic F/U at 6 months to assess the late luminal loss by QCA measurements and the neointimal volume including stent apposition by intravascular ultrasound.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Patient must be at least 18 years of age. Patient is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving the ProNOVA XR DES and she or her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study related procedure, as approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site. Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible change in the electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia) Patient must agree to undergo all required followup examinations. Patients of childbearing potential must have had a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before treatment, and must not be nursing at the time of treatment. Angiographic Target lesions must be de novo lesions (no prior stent implant, no prior brachytherapy) Target vessel reference diameter must be between 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm by visual estimate Target lesion â‰¤ 28 mm in length by visual estimate Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the clinical investigation plan, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year) Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, either heparin or bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, cobalt, chromium, nickel, or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated Participation in another device or drug study or has completed the followup phase of another study within the last 30 days Patients judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon.</criteria>
