	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Healthy males or females, as assessed by a medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. 2. Aged at least 18 years on the day of screening and no greater than 50 years on the day of the first vaccination. 3. Willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol and available for followup for the planned duration of the study. 4. In the opinion of the principal investigator or designee, the volunteer has understood the information provided. Written informed consent must be given before any studyrelated procedures are performed. 5. Willing to undergo HIV1 testing, HIV1 counselling and receive HIV1 test results. 6. If heterosexually active female; using an effective method of contraception (e.g. hormonal contraception, diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), condoms, anatomical sterility in self or partner) from 14 days prior to the first vaccination until at least 6 weeks after the last vaccination; all female volunteers must be willing to undergo urine pregnancy tests at time points specified in the protocol. 7. If heterosexually active male; willing to use an effective method of contraception (condoms; anatomical sterility in self or partner) from the day of the first vaccination until 6 weeks after the last vaccination. 8. Willing to forgo donations of blood during the study. 1. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that is considered progressive or, in the opinion of the principal investigator or designee, would make the volunteer unsuitable for the study. 2. Any of the following abnormal laboratory parameters listed below: Haematology Haemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dl Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≤ 1000 /mm3 (≤ 1 x 109 /l) Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) ≤ 600 /mm3 (≤ 1 x 109 /l) Platelets ≤100,000 /mm3, ≥ 550,000 /mm3 (≤ 90 /l, ≥ 550 /l) Biochemistry Creatinine &gt; 1.3 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2.5 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x ULN Urinalysis Abnormal dipstick confirmed by microscopy 3. Reported highrisk behaviour for HIV infection. Highrisk behaviour for HIV1 infection is defined as follows. Within the previous 6 months the volunteer has: Had unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a known HIVinfected person or a casual partner (i.e., no continuing, established relationship) Engaged in sex work for money or drugs Used injection drugs Acquired one of the following sexually transmitted disease (STD); Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. 4. Confirmed HIV1 or HIV2 infection. 5. If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy within 6 weeks after last vaccination; or lactating. 6. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within the previous 60 days (live attenuated flu vaccine within 14 days) or planned receipt within 60 days after vaccination with Investigational Product or receipt of other vaccine within the previous 14 days or planned receipt within14 days after vaccination with Investigational Product. 7. Receipt of blood transfusion or blood products within the previous 6 months. 8. Participation in another clinical trial of an Investigational Product currently, within the previous 3 months or expected participation during this study. 9. Receipt of any investigational HIV vaccine within the last 6 years. 10. History of severe or very severe local or systemic reactogenicity events, or history of severe or very severe allergic reactions. 11. Confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (surface antigen, HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV antibodies) or active syphilis. 12. Smallpox vaccination within the previous 3 years (smallpox vaccination prior to 3 years should be documented but is not an exclusion criterion). 13. Major psychiatric illness including any history of schizophrenia or severe psychosis, bipolar disorder requiring therapy, suicidal attempt or ideation in the previous 3 years.</criteria>
