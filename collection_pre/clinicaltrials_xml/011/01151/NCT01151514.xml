	<brief_summary>Few studies analyzed the referral time to nephrologists and its impact on the patient outcome in a large cohort. The investigators described the incidence and determined the outcome with respect to renal function recovery, renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement and in-hospital mortality of Hospital Acquired Acute Kidney Injury (HA-AKI) without nephrology referral (nrHA-AKI) and late referred HA-AKI patients to nephrologists (lrHA-AKI) compared with early referral patients (erHA-AKI). The patients included were admitted to the tertiary care academic center of Lausanne (Switzerland) between 2004 and 2008, in the medical and surgical services and in the intensive care unit (ICU).</brief_summary>
