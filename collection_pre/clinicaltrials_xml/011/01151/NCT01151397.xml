	<brief_summary>Standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is (Peg/RBV) combination therapy obtaining sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80% of naïve patients with genotype 2,3. Studies rarely address the issues of improving host factors. The current study examines 1. Does 3 months therapy with Vitamin D+ Peg + Ribavirin could improve viral response and shorten treatment duration (from 24 weeks to 12 weeks) 2. whether Vitamin D levels predicts negative treatment outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is (Peg/RBV) combination therapy obtaining sustained virologic response (SVR) in 80% of naïve patients with genotype 2, 3. Studies rarely address the issues of improving host factors. The current study examines whether adding vitamin D, a potent immunomodulator, for 3 months therapy could improve viral response. The working hypothesis is that 3 months therapy with Vitamin D + Peg + Ribavirin significantly improves RVR, EVR, and SVR.</detailed_description>
