	<criteria>1. Age 18 or older 2. Post OLT patients with symptoms of biliary obstruction secondary to anastomotic biliary stricture as assessed by: Clinical signs and symptoms including jaundice, abdominal pain, pruritis, and cholangitis Abnormal liver function tests (serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase levels) Abnormal imaging on ultrasound, CT scan, or MRCP suggestive of a biliary stricture 3. Willingness and ability to comply with the study procedures and provide written informed consent to participate in the study. 1. RouxenY choledochojejunostomy 2. Suspected nonanastomotic biliary strictures based on imaging(i.e. multiple strictures, strictures that are longer than 8cm in length, strictures located in the intrahepatic ducts and/or in the donor duct proximal to the site of anastomosis) 3. Living donor transplants 4. Transplants performed within 30 days (fresh transplants) 5. Perforation of any duct within the biliary tree 6. Patients with known sensitivity to any components of the stent or delivery system 7. Patients with malignancy involving the biliary tree (including hepatocellular carcinoma) 8. Patients with poor Karnofsky score 9. Life expectancy of less than one year 10. Inability to pass a guidewire through the strictured area 11. Previous biliary metal or multiple plastic stent placement 12. Druginduced or cholestatic hepatitis from an infective cause 13. Redundant bile duct that may be treated by temporary placement of stent or conversion to a RouxEnY hepaticojejunostomy 14. Choledocholithiasis/biliary "cast" syndrome</criteria>
