	<brief_summary>There are no evidence (research) based guidelines for treatment of early, closed puncture wounds of the feet in diabetics. Surgeons usually see only the limb- and life-threatening consequences of puncture wounds of the feet in diabetics, and are therefore tempted to advocate more aggressive, preemptive, invasive primary treatment for all such wounds, assuming, from this blinkered perspective that all such wounds progress to serious infection. This study is designed to determine the natural history of puncture wounds of the feet in diabetics, specifically, whether all become infected or whether some do heal without any surgical intervention. It requires administration of a questionnaire to 188 known diabetics attending 11 selected outpatient health care centers in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.</brief_summary>
