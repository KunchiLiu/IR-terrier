	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the lower airways inflammatory response to infection/pulmonary exacerbation among children known to have Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) with children known to have Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as measured by the presence of inflammatory mediators in expectorated/induced sputum.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammatory and Microbiologic Markers in Sputum: Comparing Cystic Fibrosis With Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inflammatory response to infection and pulmonary exacerbation in CF is well documented, as is the response to intravenous antibiotic treatment. On the other hand, the inflammatory response to infection and treatment in PCD has not been well characterized. Given differences in disease progression, we hypothesize that children with CF respond to infection with a more exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory response than those with PCD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as defined by two or more clinical features of CF and a documented sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test or a genotype showing two well characterized diseasecausing mutations or a diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) as follows: definite PCD (compatible phenotype, diagnostic abnormality of ciliary ultrastructure and/or two diseasecausing gene mutations) or "probable" PCD (compatible phenotype, ciliary biopsy not diagnostic but low nasal NO (&lt;100nl/min) with negative investigation screen for both CF and immunodeficiency Informed consent and verbal assent (as appropriate) provided by the subject's parent or legal guardian and the subject 618 years of age at enrolment and able to perform reproducible spirometry Clinically stable at enrolment (FEV &gt; 30%, oxyhaemoglobin sats &gt; 93%) Ability to comply with study visits and study procedures Respiratory culture positive for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aspergillus fumigatus, Burkholderia cepacia complex, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa within past year. Use of intravenous antibiotics or oral quinolones within previous 14 days Use of inhaled antibiotics within the previous 28 days Pneumothorax or haemoptysis</criteria>
