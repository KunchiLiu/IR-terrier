	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether a 6-month multilevel physical activity intervention can significantly increase physical activity levels in sedentary adults, 65 and older, living in Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs). Sedentary residents (N=320)in 16 CCRCs will receive the multilevel MIPARC intervention or a control health education program for 6 months. A group randomized control design will be employed with site as the unit of randomization. The intervention is delivered through group sessions, phone calls, printed materials, tailored signage and mapping and targeted peer led advocacy efforts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multilevel Intervention for Physical Activity in Retirement Communities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective monitoring of physical activity suggests that fewer than 3% of adults over age 60 meet current physical activity guidelines. Ecological models posit that behavioral interventions are most effective when they operate on multiple levels. The MIPARC study intervenes on four levels: individual (pedometer-based self monitoring, educational materials and monthly counseling calls), interpersonal (monthly group sessions and peer mentoring), environment (walking signage prompts, tailored walking maps, step counts)and policies (review of on-site activity opportunities and walkability, recommendations for change and peer led advocacy)to increase the activity levels of residents. The study promotes walking as the primary means to increase light to moderate PA, with a secondary focus on strength and flexibility and decreased sedentary behavior. As most Continuing Care Retirement Communities have management structures that provide the opportunity to improve the social and built environments for physical activity and walking, this study also aims to train participants on how to advocate for improvements in the environment that would improve walkability.</detailed_description>
