Participants of the non-interventional group will follow the habitual routine care at the service. Participants will be selected among nulliparous low risk pregnant women aged between 16 and 40 years old after the 20th week of gestation. Data analysis: will be performing by intention to treat. For the continues variables the t-Student or Wilcoxon test will be performing; for the categorical variables the tests xÂ² or Fisher, and the risk estimate will be estimated using a Relative Risk with 95% CI.
