	<brief_summary>This is a Quasi-experimental research design. The subjects are limited in intensive care unit within north medical center hospital. All subjects depend on ventilator and receive weaning plans. Experimental group is weaning with the support of negative pressure ventilator .The investigators collect basic personal variables in the questionnaire, APACHE â…¡ scale, Dyspnea scale and arterial blood gas analysis and ventilator weaning index. Compare experimental group and control group data. Data will be Statistical analyzed by: descriptive statistics (such as: mean, standard deviation, median, frequency, percentage) and inferential statistics (such as: Independent T-test, Pair T-test, Mann-Whitney U test), P-value &lt;0.05 will consider to be statistically significant.</brief_summary>
