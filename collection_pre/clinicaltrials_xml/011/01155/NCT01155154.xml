	<brief_title>Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Simple Hand Lacerations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Simple hand lacerations, defined as hand lacerations that do not involve special structures such as bones, tendons, vessels, or nerves, are common in the emergency departments. The exact rate of infection in such wounds is unclear. It is also not clear whether prescribing prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of infection in simple hand lacerations. The objective of this randomized double blind controlled study is to: 1. Identify the rate of infection in simple hand lacerations, 2. Identify factors or wound characteristics that increase the risk of infection, and 3. Assess whether prescribing prophylactic antibiotics decreases the risk of infections in such wounds compared to placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years of age) presenting to the ED with simple hand lacerations. Anatomically, lacerations distal to the radial carpal ligament will be considered "hand" lacerations. "Simple" or "uncomplicated" laceration refers to one that does not involve any special tissue (bone, tendon, blood vessel, or nerve). Immunocompromised patients (cancer, chemotherapy, transplant, HIV/AIDs) Current or recent (within two weeks) use of any antibiotics Allergy to clindamycin or cephalexin Bites (e.g. dog, cat, or human) Lacerations resulted from crush injury Lacerations involving bone, tendon, blood vessel, or nerve Lacerations inflicted more than 12 hours prior to ED visit Pregnant or breastfeeding women</criteria>
