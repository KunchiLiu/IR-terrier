	<detailed_description>This study was non-interventional, open-labeled, all-cases, central registration method, post marketing observational study in which Humira was prescribed for patients with psoriasis vulgaris and/or psoriatic arthritis in routine medical practice. When investigators prescribed Humira to an eligible patient who provided informed consent, they filled out a registration form and send it to the registration center via postal mail. At the end of the 24-week observation period, an investigator filled out a case report form for each patient to describe the findings during the study period, and provided the completed form to medical representatives. Even if Humira treatment was for any reason discontinued, the investigators followed each such participant for 24 weeks after the first administration of Humira, and filled out a case report form for the participant at the end of the 24-week period. Some participants entered this study from study NCT00647400 (M04-702), a Phase III extension study of Humira (adalimumab) in Japan.</detailed_description>
