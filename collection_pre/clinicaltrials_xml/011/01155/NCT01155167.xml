	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to facilitate radial artery access for cardiac catheterization. The investigators hypothesize that topical nitroglycerin and lidocaine will reduce radial artery spasm. Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization via the radial artery will be randomized to topical nitroglycerin + lidocaine versus placebo.</brief_summary>
