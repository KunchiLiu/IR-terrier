	<brief_summary>Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now an important public health issue. While 0.1% of the population is on dialysis, approximately 4.5% of subjects have renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2). These patients have a high mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with low quality of life and survival, despite high expenditure on their treatment. Hypertension (SAH) is both a cause and a complication of CKD. In addition, CKD and hypertension are risk factors for CVD. The nephropathy that are not on dialysis are less studied than those on dialysis. Strategies are needed to maintain renal function in these patients and mitigate the risk factors for CVD. A sedentary lifestyle can be an important determinant of morbidity of mortality. This study aims to determine the effect of exercise in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. Methodology: A randomized clinical trial in hypertensive patients with CRF. After recruitment of participants and completed baseline surveys, those eligible for inclusion and consented to participate in the study will be randomly assigned. We use the technique of randomization in blocks of fixed size of six persons. Variables to be collected: demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, anthropometric, blood pressure, laboratory tests (anemia, the lipid profile, blood glucose, inflammatory markers and number of peripheral endothelial progenitor cells) and quality of life. These patients will be re-interviewed in the middle period of the study (10 weeks) at the end of the intervention (20 weeks) and 10 weeks after the end of the intervention. The intervention group will participate in two weekly sessions of exercise. Therefore, facing the epidemic of CKD, this study intends to fill the data gaps about the impact of physical activity in patients with CKD on dialysis.</brief_summary>
