	<brief_summary>Sanfilippo syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III, is a rare lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by loss in activity of 1 of 4 enzymes necessary for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS) in lysosomes. The central nervous system (CNS) is the most severely affected organ system in patients with MPS IIIA. In these patients abnormal behaviors include, but are not limited to, aggression and excess motor activity/hyperactivity that contribute to disturbances in sleep.Overall, individuals with MPS IIIA have a marked developmental delay and significantly reduced lifespan of 15 years of age on average. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of rhHNS via ascending doses administered via an a surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD) intrathecal (IT) route once monthly for 6 months in patients with MPS IIIA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sanfilippo syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III, is a rare lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by loss in activity of 1 of 4 enzymes necessary for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS) in lysosomes. MPS IIIA results from deficiency of the enzyme heparan N-sulfatase (sulfamidase). In the absence of this enzyme, intermediates of the HS degradation process accumulate in the lysosomes of neurons and glial cells, with lesser accumulation outside the brain. MPS IIIA symptoms arise on average at 7 months of age, with the average age of diagnosis at 4.5 years for the majority of patients. Patients present a wide spectrum and severity of clinical symptoms. The central nervous system (CNS) is the most severely affected organ system in patients with MPS IIIA, evidenced by deficits in language development, motor skills, and intellectual development. In addition, there are abnormal behaviors including but not limited to aggression and excess motor activity/hyperactivity that contribute to disturbances in sleep.Overall, individuals with MPS IIIA have a marked developmental delay and significantly reduced lifespan of 15 years of age on average. No effective, disease-modifying therapies are currently approved as treatments for this devastating and disabling disease. Shire Human Genetic Therapies (Shire HGT) is developing a sulfamidase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)rhHNS for patients with MPS IIIA. rhHNS is being administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD), because when administered intravenously (IV) it does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). This study is a multicenter, multiple-dose, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of up to 3 dose levels (10mg,45mg and 90mg monthly for 6 months) of rhHNS administered via an IDDD in patients with Sanfilippo syndrome Type A ages greater than or equal to 3 years of age. Patients who have completed all study requirements in this study will be invited to participate in an open-label extension study that will be designed to evaluate long term safety and clinical outcomes of intrathecal administration of rhHNS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study: A documented deficiency in sulfamidase enzyme activity of greater than or equal to 10% of the lower limit of the normal range AND either a normal enzyme activity level of at least 1 other sulfatase or 2 documented mutations â€¢At least 3 years of age and have a developmental age above 1 year Patients must be medically stable, in the opinion of the Investigator, to accommodate the protocol requirements, including travel, assessments, and IDDD surgery, without placing an undue burden on the patient/patient's family. The patient's parent(s) or legal guardian must have voluntarily signed an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committeeapproved informed consent form. Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: Significant nonMPS IIIA related central nervous system (CNS) impairment or behavioral disturbances that would confound the scientific integrity or interpretation of study assessments MPS IIIA behavioralrelated issues, as determined by the Investigator, that would preclude performance of study neurocognitive and developmental testing procedures. Patient is pregnant, breast feeding, or is a female patient of childbearing potential who will not or cannot comply with the use of an acceptable method of birth control The patient is blind and/or deaf. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought to have an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to airway compromise or other conditions. The patient or the patient's family has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, or other anesthesiarelated concerns. Complications resulting from prior lumbar punctures. CNS shunt Skeletomuscular/spinal abnormalities or other contraindications for the surgical implantation of the IDDD. History of poorly controlled seizure disorder. Patient is currently receiving psychotropic or other medications The patient cannot sustain absence from aspirin, nonsteroidal medications, or medications that affect blood clotting within 1 week prior to a relevant studyrelated procedure or has ingested such medications within 1 week before any procedures in which any change in clotting activity would be deleterious. The patient has received treatment with any investigational drug or a device intended as a treatment for MPS IIIA within the 30 days prior to, or during the study, or is currently enrolled in another study that involves an investigational drug or device (screening through safety followup contact). The patient has received a hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The patient's parent(s), or patient's legal guardian(s) is/are unable to provide consent or the patient cannot provide assent</criteria>
