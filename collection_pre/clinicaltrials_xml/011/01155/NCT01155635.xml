	<detailed_description>Beta-blocker therapy is recommended after ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the current guidelines although its efficacy in those patients who have undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been adequately evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether beta-blocker, carvedilol improves 6-year clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction after primary PCI. The design of this study is multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial enrolling 1300 patients without any exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
