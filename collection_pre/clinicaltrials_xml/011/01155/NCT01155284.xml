	<brief_summary>Sanford Research/USD proposes to study the combination therapy of oral administration of sitagliptin and lansoprazole versus placebo for the preservation of pancreatic beta cells still present in patients with recent-onset diabetes and possibly regenerating their beta cells, while safely down-regulating the autoimmune response directed against the beta cells.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, based on American Diabetes Association criteria, recently diagnosed (within the 6 months before Screening) and confirmed by the presence of at least 1 diabetes related autoantibody (either glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD], insulinomaassociated protein [IA 2], or insulin, the latter measured within 10 days after starting insulin therapy). Male or female aged between 11 and 45 years, inclusive. Able to swallow study capsules. Willing to comply with "intensive diabetes management" as directed by the investigator, with the goal of maintaining blood glucose as close to American Diabetes Association recommendations as possible. Willing to comply with the schedule of study visits and protocol requirements. Use of a GLP 1R agonist or DPP 4 inhibitor within 1 month before enrollment. Use of a PPI within 1 month before enrollment. Use of an oral hypoglycemic agent within 1 month before enrollment or use of thiazolidinediones within 3 months before enrollment (although thiazolidinediones may be used &lt;7days before enrollment). Females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of enrollment. Subjects with any of the following conditions: Renal insufficiency, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 50 mL/min at Screening, calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to sitagliptin or lansoprazole, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema. Severe hepatic insufficiency. History of pancreatitis or gallbladder disease Any significant medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor would interfere with study participation.</criteria>
