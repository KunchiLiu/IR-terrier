	<brief_summary>Asthma is a chronic disease that affects nearly 13% of adults in the U.S., causing substantial impairment that is reflected in the tens of millions of missed days of work, and doctors' and emergency room visits it leads to annually. Those who have asthma are twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety, which are associated with more frequent and severe asthma symptoms, especially in those under chronic stress. The project proposed here seeks to understand the role of the brain in these associations and to evaluate the neural mechanisms through which a safe, low-cost intervention, that influences the function of body via the mind, may diminish the expression of asthma symptoms.</brief_summary>
