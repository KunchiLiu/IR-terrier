	<brief_title>Pulmozyme in Cystic Fibrosis With Sinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a prospective enrollment of patients with CF and rhinosinusitis in a double-blind crossover study with nasal nebulized DNASE versus saline. Nebulization will be accomplished with PARI SinuStar nasal aerosol system nebulizer set powered by an air compressor. This will be a pilot study with each subject serving as their own control. Each arm of the study will be 3 months and randomization to active drug versus placebo will be generated without the knowledge of subject or researchers. A health care provider not involved in the care of the subject will be responsible for medication distribution and the randomization scheme. A daily diary will collect data for analysis. Visits will be arranged every 4 weeks at which time drug will be dispensed, adherence to daily diary and compliance to medication will be assessed. At each visit the SF-12, SNOT-20, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Rhinitis Severity Scale, Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Specific Questionnaire (NRQLQ), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, and Rhinosinusitis Quality of Life Survey will be utilized for acquisition of data (17-23). In addition, a Physician Global Assessment and a self administered patient rhinosinusitis VAS score (0-100 with 100 full recovery and 0 no effect) will be completed at each visit. To obtain objective data patients will have nasal endoscopic assessment at 4 different time points and nasal polyps and sinusitis rated on a scale as defined by Lund and Kennedy in the Ann Otol Laryngol 1995;104 (suppl 167):17-21. (24) Serial sinus CT scans will be avoided to decrease irradiation risk. Subjects: A total of 12 patients will be enrolled in this pilot study, and recruitment will be through the Cystic Fibrosis Center at Penn State University, after IRB approval. All subjects must be over the age of 15 years (the age the investigators consider to be necessary to understand the consent and questionnaires required for the study), be of either gender and of any ethnicity. Subjects will be able to continue all presently used nasal and respiratory medications as long as the present therapeutic regimen has been used for one month prior to enrollment and these therapies have been used at a stable dose, method of distribution and without adverse events</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with CF, age &gt;15yo 2. Chronic sinusitis with symptoms 3. VAS score of at least 60 (0 to 100) reflecting symptoms associated with rhinosinusitis 4. CT scan demonstrating noncomplicated sinusitis (defined as rhinosinusitis without orbit perforation, osteomyelitis, perisinus cellulitis, or meningitis) 1. No evidence of sinusitis 2. VAS score for rhinosinusitis less than 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 3. Complicated sinusitis (defined as orbit perforation, osteomyelitis, perisinus cellulitis, meningitis complicating sinusitis) 4. Prior adverse events or allergy to DNASE 5. Unwilling to sign an approved IRB consent 6. Immediate indication for sinus surgery 7. Inability to adhere to therapy and understand and to complete questionnaires. 8. Being pregnant will exclude a subject from participating and the subjects will be requested to take birth control methods if actively engaging in sex. Further more, subjects will be requested to inform the investigators if they become pregnant. Pregnancy test will be performed at screening. 9. Active nursing of an infant will be an exclusion.</criteria>
