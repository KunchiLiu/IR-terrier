	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Alefacept in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, investigator initiated, pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of Alefacept in combination with Alemtuzumab induction and Myfortic with rapid steroid and calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal in de novo Kidney transplant recipients. Induction therapy involves single dose Alemtuzumab and steroids peri-operatively. Tacrolimus will be administered for the first 30 days post-transplantation. Alefacept will be administered IV for the first two doses followed by subcutaneous injections weekly until 12 weeks post-transplant followed by monthly injections for the rest of the duration of the study. The primary outcomes are safety and efficacy outcomes, including biopsy proven acute rejection episodes, infectious complications or other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes include T-helper differentiation, cytokine production and T regulatory cell generation assessed by immune monitoring assays.</detailed_description>

For recipients where a flow cytometry crossmatch is performed and is positive in either T or B cell testing, recipients are excluded only if donor specific, antiHLA antibody is detected by flow cytometry based, specific antiHLA antibody testing.
