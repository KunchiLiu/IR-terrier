	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease which requires long-term treatment. Due to the need of long-term safety data in Japanese participants and to fulfil the conditions of approval of adalimumab by the Japanese regulatory authority, this post-marketing observational study (PMOS) was conducted. The study investigated the long-term safety of adalimumab, particularly associated with the development of infections and malignant tumors. Data was collected once every 6 months up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
