	<brief_summary>Controlling the glycemic impact of foodstuffs (by reducing the glycemic load of the diet by using soluble dietary fibres) may reduce the glycemic or insulinemic response. This may in turn result in a reduced inhibition of postprandial fat oxidation rate and a lower plasma triacylglycerol concentration A higher postprandial fat oxidation may result in less lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissue thereby improving insulin sensitivity and the metabolic profile in the longer term.</brief_summary>
