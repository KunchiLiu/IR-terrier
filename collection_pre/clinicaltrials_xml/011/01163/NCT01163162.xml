	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the effects of Paricalcitol (Zemplar) on kidney functioning. The investigators hypothesize that the increase in serum creatinine observed in recent paricalcitol trials is a function of reduced creatinine secretion and not an actual reduction in kidney function. 16 patients will have kidney function measured via iothalamate clearance at baseline, after 7 days of paricalcitol treatment and after 7 days of being washed off the paricalcitol.</brief_summary>
