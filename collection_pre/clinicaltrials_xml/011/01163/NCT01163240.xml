	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect epidemiological data in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B(CHB), in particular data on the prevalence of HBeAg positive disease with associated ALT levels , active HBeAg negative disease and decompensated CHB in the pediatric population. Family history and history of HBV transmission is essential to assess the course of the disease and can be used to determine the best mode of treatment This information will be used to assist with the feasibility and design of studies for the Novartis clinical pediatric development program, as the current epidemiology of ediatric CHB is not accurately known in Western countries or the rest of the world making pediatric studies difficult to plan and conduct. This study forms part of the Novartis Pediatric Investigational Plan, a post marketing approval commitment to the EMEA Pediatric Committee.</brief_summary>
