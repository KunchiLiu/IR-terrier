	<brief_summary>Aim of the present retrospective study is to evaluate molecular factors of primary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The investigators assess first, the incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten ras sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations, SOS and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation and expression and, secondly, the investigators correlate molecular markers with clinical features and outcome in terms of response rate, progression free survival and overall survival.</brief_summary>
