	<brief_summary>This study is being done to test the safety of a single high-dose of radiation therapy before radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate). The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the radiation will have on men undergoing prostatectomy. The investigators are especially interested in men who are at risk for having cancer cells that have spread outside the prostate.</brief_summary>
