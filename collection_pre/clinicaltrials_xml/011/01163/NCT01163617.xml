	<brief_summary>This was an open-label, Phase 2 study designed to obtain user experience data (Phase A) and injection time data (Phase B) in experienced adalimumab patients injected with the Physiolis pre-filled syringe and autoinjector used to administer adalimumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Usability and Injection Time of the Physiolis Syringe and Autoinjector in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 2, open-label study consisting of 2 study phases with a total of 3 study visits, each visit occurring 2 weeks apart from each other. Phase A (User Experience) was a randomized, 2-period, cross-over phase in which single subcutaneous (SC) dose injections were administered using either the Physiolis autoinjector and current autoinjector or the Physiolis syringe and current syringe in a 1:1 ratio. Phase B (Injection Time) was a randomized, single-visit, parallel-arm phase, with injection into a test tube, and one SC injection given to participants using the Physiolis autoinjector or current autoinjector administered at 2 different temperature ranges (2° to 8°C [storage temperature] and 20° to 27°C [room temperature]). If a participant only completed Visit 1 and Visit 2, then the participant was to be replaced for Visit 3. If the participant only completed Visit 1, the participant was to be replaced for all study visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject was judged to be in good health as determined by the investigator based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, physical examination, chest xray, and a 12lead electrocardiogram performed during Screening. Subject had a negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) and chest xray (posterioranterior and lateral view) at Screening. Subject has a diagnosis of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and is treated with adalimumab in accordance with the FDAapproved Humira prescribing information. Subject must have selfadministered adalimumab subcutaneous (SC) 40 mg injections every other week (eow) without interruption for at least 3 months prior to Screening. For the Phase A portion of the study, the subject must be able and willing to self administer SC injections in the thigh or abdomen (administration by another person was not permissible). Subject has been treated with any investigational drug of chemical or biologic nature within a minimum of 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to the Visit 1, with the exception of adalimumab. Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) antiinfectives within 30 days prior to the Visit 1 or oral antiinfectives within 14 days prior to Visit 1. Prior exposure to natalizumab (Tysabri®) or efalizumab (Raptiva®). Known hypersensitivity to adalimumab or its excipients. Regular use of any SC medications, with the exception of adalimumab.</criteria>
