	<brief_summary>Approximately 10,000 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are performed annually in the US for various indications. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is the most common late noninfectious complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Prognosis of BO in the allogeneic HSCT setting is dismal and there are no therapies proven to be consistently effective. The exact incidence is not clear but may be as high as 30%2 . Risk factors include new or ongoing chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), age, antecedent obstructive airways disease and viral infections1. BO is characterized physiologically by progressive irreversible airflow obstruction and pathologically by luminal occlusion of the distal airways due to progressive scarring3. The pathogenesis is not completely understood but the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1), important for both tissue repair and fibrosis, is thought to play a pivotal role. Bortezomib, an FDA approved proteasomal inhibitor inhibits TGF-b1 signaling in vitro and protects against lung injury/fibrosis in bleomycin mouse model as well as in a mouse model for skin fibrosis. This is consistent with other data in the literature that proteasomal inhibition can prevent the development of fibrosis. Thus the investigators propose to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of bortezomib in chronic pulmonary GVHD (BO).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Female subject is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of the study. Day &gt;100 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Underlying cancer in remission Decrease in FEV1 of â‰¥12% from the pretransplant baseline (FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.8) No evidence of acute infection ANC &gt;1000 Platelets &gt;50,000 Age 1870 ECOG performance Status 02. Patient has a platelet count of less than 50,000 within 14 days before enrollment. Patient has an absolute neutrophil count of less 1000 within 14 days before enrollment. Patient has a calculated or measured creatinine clearance of &lt; 20 ml/minute within 14 days before enrollment. Patient has Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (see section 8.4), uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant. Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol. Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum bhuman chorionic gonadotropin (bhCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women. Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study.
