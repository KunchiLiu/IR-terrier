	<brief_summary>The Work and Health Initiative (WHI) trial is testing an innovative, community-based program that provides mental health and vocational services to workers 50 years or older to improve functioning and reduce productivity loss. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that relative to usual care, the WHI improves the work outcomes of depression and reduces depression-related productivity loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Mid- and Later-Life Work Limitations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>National demographic, economic and cultural trends are creating a need for hiring and retaining older workers. However, while many older people will prefer and/or need to work, chronic health problems occurring in mid-life or later can severely disrupt employment. This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Work and Health Initiative (WHI). The WHI is an innovative community-based program that provides mental health and vocational services to workers with depression to improve functioning and reduce productivity loss. This study will focus on workers 50 years of age and older. This study will test the hypothesis that relative to usual care, the WHI improves the work outcomes of depression. Study results potentially will result in a new multi-disciplinary method for addressing a serious public health and employment issue.</detailed_description>
