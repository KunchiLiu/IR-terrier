	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is being conducted to study hypophosphatasia (HPP), a bone disorder caused by gene mutations or changes. These gene mutations cause low levels of an enzyme needed to harden bone. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of two doses of the study drug called asfotase alfa as compared to a control group to see what effects it has adolescents and adults with HPP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Asfotase Alfa in Adolescents and Adults With Hypophosphatasia (HPP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asfotase alfa was formerly referred to as ENB-0040 Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.</detailed_description>
