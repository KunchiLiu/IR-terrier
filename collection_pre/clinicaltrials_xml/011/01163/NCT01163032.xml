	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Tasimelteon Compared With Placebo in Totally Blind Subjects With Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (N24HSWD) occurs when individuals, primarily those without light perception, are unable to synchronize their endogenous circadian pacemaker to the 24-hour light-dark cycle, and the timing of their circadian rhythm instead reflects the intrinsic period of their endogenous circadian pacemaker. As a result, the circadian rhythm of sleep-wake propensity in these individuals moves gradually later and later each day if there circadian period is &gt; 24 hours and earlier and earlier if &lt; 24 hours. These individuals will be able to sleep well at night when their sleep-wake propensity rhythm is approximately aligned with the 24-hour light-dark and social cycle. However, after a short time, the endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm and the 24-hour light-dark cycle will move out of synchrony with each other, and they may have difficulty falling asleep until well into the night. In addition to problems sleeping at the desired time, the subjects experience daytime sleepiness and daytime napping. This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel study. The study has two phases: the pre-randomization phase followed by either the randomization phase or the open-label extension (OLE). The pre-randomization phase comprises a screening visit where subject's initial eligibility will be evaluated, a circadian period (τ) estimation segment, and a variable-length in-phase transition segment in which subjects will wait to start treatment until their circadian phase is aligned with their target bedtime. Subjects that meet all entry criteria for the study will enter the randomization phase. During the randomization phase, subjects will be asked to take either 20 mg tasimelteon or placebo approximately 1 hour prior to their target bedtime for 26 weeks in a double-masked fashion. Subjects who have a τ greater than 24.0 and meet all entry criteria but that are ineligible for the randomization phase due to their τ estimate may be given the opportunity to participate in the OLE phase. During the OLE phase, subjects will take open-label 20mg tasimelteon for 26 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability and acceptance to provide informed consent; No perception of light by the subject's own report; Diagnosis of N24HSWD as determined by: 1. History (within the last 3 months) of trouble sleeping at night difficulty initiating sleep or staying asleep), difficulty awakening in the morning, or daytime sleepiness as determined by answering yes to at least one question in the Sleep Complaint Questionnaire and 2. Urinary aMT6s demonstrates a progressive delay of the aMT6 acrophase time. Willing and able to comply with study requirements and restrictions including a commitment to a fixed 9hour sleep opportunity during the study; Fluent in English; Have a probable diagnosis of a current sleep disorder other than N24HSWD that is the primary cause of the sleep disturbance based on clinical investigator medical judgment; Current clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, gastrointestinal or metabolic dysfunction unless currently controlled and stable; History (within the 12 months prior to screening) of psychiatric disorders including Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Axis II Disorders, delirium or any other psychiatric disorder that in the opinion of the clinical investigator would affect participation in the study or full compliance with study procedures; History of intolerance and/or hypersensitivity to melatonin or melatonin agonists; Worked night, rotating, or split (period of work, followed by break, and then return to work) shift work within 1 month of the screening visit or plan to work these shifts during the study; Unable to perform calls to the study IVR system to report questionnaire results; Exposure to any investigational drug, including placebo, within 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever was longer) of screening; Use of central nervous system prescription or OTC medications, other than melatonin, that affects the sleepwake cycle Use of melatonin or melatonin agonist</criteria>
