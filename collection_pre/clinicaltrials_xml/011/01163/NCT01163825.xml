	<brief_summary>Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain project widely to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) from their target areas for survival. Impaired NGF supply is part of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and the degeneration of these neurons correlates with the cognitive decline in these patients. The objective of encapsulated cell biodelivery (ECB) is to maintain normal levels of NGF to support cholinergic function. NsGene's NGF secreting ECB device (NsG0202) combines the potential benefits of targeted gene therapy with the safety of a retrievable implantable device. The study is an open label, single centre, 12-month, dose-escalation phase Ib study in patients with mild to moderate AD. The primary objective is safety and tolerability, while secondary outcomes measure include cognition, behaviour, neuropsychology, activities of daily living (ADL), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and electroencephalography (EEG).</brief_summary>
