	<brief_summary>Cancers that have spread to the inner lining of the chest are classified as Stage IV and bear a poor prognosis. Surgery is rarely an option, with palliative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy the only treatment options. This study intends to evaluate whether surgical removal of all visible tumor on the chest wall followed by bathing the chest cavity in heated chemotherapy solution will improve outcomes for these advanced cancers.</brief_summary>
