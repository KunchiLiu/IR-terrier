	<detailed_description>The study design was a single group (n=26) with repeated testing (3 times) pre- and post-treatment. All participants received the same treatment protocol (described in detail in Appendix A and in Minkina et al. (under review)). In order to control for improvement in language function related to passage of time, and for the effect of repeated exposure to outcome measures, individuals were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: delayed treatment or immediate treatment (Figure 2). Participants who were randomized to the delayed group received repeated testing three times before and three times after a six-week delay. During the delay phase they were permitted to participate in usual speech-language care (e.g., conversation groups and individual therapy). Standardized assessments and outcome measures (described in detail below) were administered prior to the start of treatment (for both immediate and delayed groups), at the end of the delay phase (delayed group only), immediately after treatment termination, and at three months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
