	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that acute and short term consumption of a lychee fruit extract, particularly rich in low molecular weight dietary flavanols, will improve vascular function and reduce platelet reactivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Lychee Fruit Extract to Promote Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several large-scale epidemiologic studies have indicated that chronic consumption of flavonoid-rich foods appear to be associated with decreased risk for several chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. In humans, consumption of several flavonoid-rich foods and beverages, such as berries, teas, cocoa, and grapes have been reported to improve vascular endothelial function and decrease platelet reactivity. Previous work at UC Davis by Dr. Keen and colleagues has helped define the role of flavanols in vascular function, and has used a flavanol-rich cocoa extract as the test material. In this proposed study, we seek to explore the role of a lychee fruit extract rich in flavanols, and its effects of vascular and metabolic parameters.</detailed_description>
