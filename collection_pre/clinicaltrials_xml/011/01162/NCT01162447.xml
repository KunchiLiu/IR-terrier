	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to compare the levels of bone morphogenetic protein-4 and -7 (BMP-4 and 7) in blood, follicular fluid and ovarian organ culture supernatant obtained from healthy subjects and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP-4) and 7 Levels Between Control and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female patients at ages 20-35 diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome and age-matched healthy control subjects will be enrolled in this study. Blood samples will be obtained at early follicular phase during doctor's visit from PCOS patients and control subjects.If the patient is amenorrheic at the time of visit, both random blood samples and another sample at early follicular phase after induction of withdrawal bleeding with progesterone. Follicular fluids will be retrieved during oocyte pick-up procedure in patients undergoing assisted reproduction for PCOS and control IVF patients whose infertility is not PCO related. Samples from ovaries will be collected at operation from PCOS patients and control subjects if they already undergo any gynecologic laparotomi operations. Collected samples will be cultured for 7 days and BMP-4 and -7 levels will be measured in the culture fluid of the samples using ELISA method.</detailed_description>
