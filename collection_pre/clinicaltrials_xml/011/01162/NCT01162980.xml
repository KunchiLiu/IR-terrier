	<brief_summary>ACE inhibitors have been studied extensively in the treatment of heart failure and have been shown to be beneficial in all its stages. Studies with the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in chronic heart failure have not shown equivalent results. Many patients are on an ARB for a variety of reasons. Some of these may have had cough as a symptom of heart failure and not due to medication side effect. According to guidelines, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are still first-line therapy in the treatment of heart failure. As ACEi have been extensively studied showing improvement in morbidity and mortality all patients should be on this treatment unless absolutely contraindicated.</brief_summary>
