	<brief_summary>This study is based on preclinical (animal) studies showing that infusing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the spinal fluid may contribute to improving neurologic function in animal models with spinal cord injuries. Bone marrow (BM) contains several types of stem cells that can produce functional cells. This includes cells that could help the healing process of damaged neurologic tissue. The primary objective of this study is to see if the injection of these cells, obtained from your own bone marrow, is safe. A secondary objective is to evaluate if the treatment can provide functional improvements (neuromuscular control and sensation) in the affected areas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transfer of Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase I, single-center trial to assess the safety and tolerability of an intrathecal infusion (lumbar puncture) of autologous, ex vivo expanded bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a well-defined population of spinal cord injury patients. Safety will be evaluated by neurological and non-neurological tests performed after short-term (1 to 30 days) and long-term (2 to 12 months)follow-up evaluation periods after cell infusion.</detailed_description>
