	<brief_summary>It has been proposed that the rapid gastric emptying of carbohydrate containing fluids into the intestine causes hyperglycemia followed by reactive hypoglycemia. The investigators have shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in response to a glucose load is increased in children with Post-prandial hypoglycemia (PPH). This is a proof of concept study to investigate the causative role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of PPH after fundoplication by evaluating the effects of GLP-1 receptor antagonism on metabolic variables after a mixed meal. Hypothesis: In children with post-prandial hypoglycemia after fundoplication, antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor by exendin-(9-39) will elevate nadir blood glucose levels after a meal challenge and prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PPH is a frequent complication of fundoplication in children. The mechanism responsible for the PPH is poorly understood, but involves an exaggerated insulin response to a meal and subsequent hypoglycemia. We have shown that children with PPH after Nissen fundoplication have abnormally exaggerated secretion of GLP-1, an incretin hormone with multiple glucose lowering effects including stimulation of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon secretion. In this study we seek to examine the causal role of endogenous GLP-1 in PPH after fundoplication by evaluating the effects of antagonizing the GLP-1 receptor with exendin-(9-39) on key metabolic features of PPH.</detailed_description>
