	<brief_summary>Dental implants are a valid and reliable method to replace missing teeth. The major requirement for their success is an adequate volume of bone into which they can be placed. One widely used method to augment bone at the time of placing the implant is to use a bone substitute rather than taking a block bone graft from the patient. Successful augmentation in the vertical direction has often proved difficult, however, the investigators have developed a technique to achieve this in the investigators patients using a synthetic bone substitute, Osteon (Implantium, CE0120) in an attempt to avoid patients having to undergo another unnecessary surgical procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vertical Augmentation With Osteon at Dental Implant Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective • To determine the success of dental implants in alveolar bone augmented in the vertical direction with Osteon. Secondary Objectives • To determine the long term success of dental implants in this augmented bone. Primary Endpoint • Radiographically assessed vertical height of alveolar ridge formation following Osteon augmentation.</detailed_description>
