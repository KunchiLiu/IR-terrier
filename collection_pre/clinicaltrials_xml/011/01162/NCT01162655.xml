	<brief_summary>Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for chronic insomnia, which is a prevalent and costly problem. This pilot study will compare the effectiveness of two brief (6 week) psychological interventions delivered to residents of rural Manitoba using Telehealth or an interactive Internet-based platform. It is hypothesized that a) participants in the Telehealth condition will report significantly greater improvements in sleep parameters(e.g., sleep efficiency, time awake in bed, sleep-onset latency),insomnia severity, and daytime fatigue than those in the Internet condition and that b)participants in the Telehealth condition will show better adherence to treatment and greater satisfaction with treatment than those in the Internet condition.</brief_summary>
