	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate real acupuncture, as compare to sham acupuncture, in improving persistent sleep difficulties in veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) Design: Randomized, blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial Setting: Outpatient clinic at a major VA medical center in Southeast USA Participants: Sixty veterans aged 24-55 (mean 40) with history of mTBI at least 3-month and beyond, suffering from sleep difficulties refractory to regular care and sleep education, as indicated by a global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 14.25 + 3.23 pre-intervention (baseline). They were randomized into 2 groups, real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, and stratified by Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosed by PTSD CheckList - Military Version (PCL-M). Intervention: Real or sham acupuncture with both standardized and individualized acupoints selection. All subjects were informed that the treatments, if effective, may improve symptoms such as pain, anxiety or depression other than sleep; real acupuncture may not be effective in some individuals, and sham acupuncture may as well be effective by mind-body interactions. Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure was global PSQI score change after intervention as compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measure was wrist-actigraphy sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep duration. PTSD was analyzed as a co-variant.</brief_summary>
