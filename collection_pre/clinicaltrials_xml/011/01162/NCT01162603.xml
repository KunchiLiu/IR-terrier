	<brief_summary>- Main objective is to compare the ability of Latanoprost 0.005% preservative-added ophthalmic solution versus Tafluprost 0.0015% preservative-free ophthalmic solution, both given once a day at the evening, in reducing 24-hour intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and/or ocular hypertension (OHT) at first diagnosis. First efficacy variable will be the difference between mean nocturnal IOP values after three months of treatment: nocturnal IOP is defined as the mean value between 2AM and 6AM measurements. - Secondary objectives will be the comparison between Latanoprost 0.005% and Tafluprost 0.0015% ophthalmic solution about: - Mean 24-hour IOP values after three months of treatment - IOP values at these time-points: 10AM (± 1 hour), 2PM (± 1 hour), 6PM (± 1 hour), 10PM (± 1 hour), 2AM (± 1 hour) and 6AM (± 1 hour) after three months of treatment</brief_summary>
