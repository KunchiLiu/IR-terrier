	<brief_title>Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Patients With Fecal Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before treatment patients will have a proctological exam, a proctoscopy, endosonography and anorectal manometry. Incontinence scores (Wexner, Vaizey, Hanley) and quality of life scores (FIQL, VAS) will be recorded. Treatment consists of 4 phases with decreasing frequency of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulations (pTNS). During phase 1 weekly stimulations of 30 mins are applied for 12 weeks. After 6 and 12 weeks incontinence scores are recorded. Additionally after the end of phase 1 quality of life is measured and an anorectal manometry is preformed. Phase 2 lasts for 8 weeks, with 2-3 stimulations/month Phase 3 lasts for 8 weeks, with stimulations every 3 weeks Phase 4 consists of one stimulation in one month. After phase 4 incontinence scores und quality of life are measured.</detailed_description>
