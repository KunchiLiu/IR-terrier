	<brief_summary>PTSD is a common and distressing possible outcome following exposure to a traumatic event. Recent studies show that memory processes may be central to the development of the disorder, and interrupting the consolidation of traumatic memories may prevent the disorder from developing. Specifically the use of a visual spatial task has been shown to reduce a key characteristic of PTSD, intrusions, in non-clinical populations. This study aims to administer a visual spatial task to recent trauma survivors in the Emergency Room, and compare PTSD and symptoms development in these patients as compared to a control group who did not carry out the task. The study hypothesizes that the task will result in less PTSD, lower levels of intrusions, dissociation and pain.</brief_summary>
