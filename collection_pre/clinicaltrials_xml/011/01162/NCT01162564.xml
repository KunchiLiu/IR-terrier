	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are to evaluate the ease of use of NG-TSM intra-operatively in laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair, and assessing early outcomes post-operatively following mesh implantation, including seroma formation, hematoma, wound complications, infections, early recurrences, adverse events, and subject comfort, as well as health economic data to include quality of life, subject satisfaction data, time of procedure, length of stay, re-hospitalization, and extended hospitalization.</detailed_description>
