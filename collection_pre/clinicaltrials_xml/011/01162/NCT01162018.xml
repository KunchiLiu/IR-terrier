	<brief_summary>The proposed study will recruit 60 women with breast cancer who finished undergoing treatment who complain of persistent insomnia problems that began with onset of their cancer diagnosis. The eligible women would be randomized and stratified by sleep problems to two arms: (Acupuncture Arm vs. Sham Acupuncture) with a goal of having 48 patients complete the study (we anticipate about 20% attrition rate). The study interventions will begin after patients completed their treatment. The placebo control for acupuncture will be a validated sham acupuncture control Assessments will be made with daily diaries and with weekly questionnaires. PSG data will be collected on the subsample of the population. Data will be gathered via pencil-and-paper measures before, during, immediately following, one month following the completion of treatment and six months after the conclusion of treatment.
