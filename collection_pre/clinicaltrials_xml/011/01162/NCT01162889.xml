	<brief_title>Study To Assess The Safety And Tolerability Of Increasing Single Doses Of ATR-107 (PF-05230900) In Healthy People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First in human single dose study. Study terminated 12 October 2011. The ATR-107 Development team reached a recommendation to terminate further development of ATR-107 (PF-05230900). This was based on a number of factors, including development of anti-drug antibodies in approximately 70% of subjects in the First-in-Human study in healthy volunteers (B2281001). This recommendation is not based on adverse events observed in study B2281001.</detailed_description>
