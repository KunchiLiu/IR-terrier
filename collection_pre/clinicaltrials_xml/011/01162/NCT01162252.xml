	<detailed_description>The study examines the effects of two eight-week programs (MBSR vs. LW) for disease processes in patients with psoriasis severity reporting moderate or higher perceived stress. The research will focus both on clinical measures of the disease state and overall well-being. The Aims of our proposed intervention study are the following: 1. To examine the effects of MBSR, versus the Living Well (LW) program, on (a) disease severity, immunological markers of inflammation, and keratinocyte proliferation, (b) psoriasis-related stress and perceived stress in general, and (c) anxiety and depression. 2. To examine whether treatment effects of either program are moderated by personality traits, mindfulness, and age. 3. To examine the effects of behavioral and psychological mediators on immune outcomes.</detailed_description>
