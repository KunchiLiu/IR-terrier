	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that acute consumption of Oligonol, a patented lychee fruit extract (Amino Up Chemical Co.) particularly rich in low molecular weight flavanols, will improve endothelial function, reduce platelet reactivity and increase circulating levels of flavonoids after a single intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Oligonol Supplementation to Promote Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have demonstrated from previous studies at UC Davis that a single dose of a high-flavanol supplement from cocoa can improve endothelial function, measured by increased blood flow from peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), reduce platelet reactivity, and increase circulating levels of flavonoids in the blood. The investigators seek with this proposal to determine if a similar response can be noted with a different high-flavanol supplement in normal, healthy people.</detailed_description>
