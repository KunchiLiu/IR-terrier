	<brief_title>To Evaluate Effectiveness and Safety of Containing Raltegravir in Naive HIV NON B or B Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population VIH1 not B is not unimportant in our region of the Seine St Denis, a tendency which seems to be in increase (47 % in 2006, 67 % in 2007). Most of the studies evaluating the clinical, immunologic and virologic response to the ARV according to the viral subcategories are corresponding and show comparable results for patients infected by HIV 1 of subcategory B or non B. In spite of these reassuring results, it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of a new ARV all the more a new class. It seems also necessary to observe attentively the profiles of resistance which will be selected at the carrier patient's of virus of subcategories not - B in failure of treatment. It will allow to determine if, because of the important polymorphisms of the viruses not - B, the evolution towards the resistance will be made differently.</detailed_description>
