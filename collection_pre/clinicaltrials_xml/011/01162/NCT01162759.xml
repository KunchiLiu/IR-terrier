	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to improve hypertension control at Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) by implementing a population-based multi-factorial intervention that uses home BP monitors that can download BP readings to KPCO's health records via internet, interactive voice response (IVR) technology, and multidisciplinary care team. Participants will be randomized to either the home blood pressure monitoring group receiving the multi-factorial intervention or the usual care group who will be receiving Kaiser standard of care. We will determine the proportion of patients in each group who achieve their target BP goals at 6 months, according to national clinical practice guidelines. The study hypothesis is that a higher proportion of patients with uncontrolled hypertension in the home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) group will achieve their target blood pressure compared to those in the usual care (UC) group.</brief_summary>
