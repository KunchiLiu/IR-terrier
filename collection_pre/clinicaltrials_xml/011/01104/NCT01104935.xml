	<criteria>1. Histologically diagnosed as invasive breast cancer and received curative operation for primary breast cancer. 2. Stage: 1 (tumor size [pT] &gt; 0.5 cm), 2A, 2B or 3A/ M0 3. Female between 69 and 81 years old 4. Primary region is HER 2 positive: either 3+ overexpression by IHC or positive by FISH 5. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ≥55% measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan within 4 weeks before registration. 6. PS: 01 (ECOG) 7. Sufficient organ function meeting following criteria within 4 weeks before registration: Leukocyte ≥2500 mm3 Neutrophil ≥1500 mm3 Platelet ≥100 000 mm3 Serum total bilirubin ≤2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT (GPT) or AST (GOT) ≤2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN ALP ≤2.5 x ULN 8. No previous endocrine therapy or chemotherapy for breast cancer 9. Signed written informed consent (Appendix A) 1. Active multiple primary cancer (synchronous multiple primary cancer and invasive cancer of other organs) 2. Postoperative histological axillary lymph node metastasis ≥4 3. Axillary lymph node is not histologically evaluated 4. Histologically confirmed positive margin in breast conservation surgery (evaluation of margin status is based on policy of site) 5. History of drugrelated allergy which could hinder planned treatment 6. Any history or complication of following cardiac disorders History of congestive heart failure, cardiac infarction Complication requires treatment such as: ischemic cardiac disorder, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease 7. Poorly controlled hypertension (ex. Systolic arterial pressure ≥180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg) 8. Poorly controlled diabetes 9. Continuous visit to a medial institution is considered difficult due to deterioration of activity of daily living (ADL) 10. Difficult to participate in the trial because of psychiatric disorder or psychiatric symptoms 11. Ineligible to the trial based on decision of an investigator</criteria>
