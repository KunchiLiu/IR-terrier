	<brief_summary>The investigators recently found a positive effect of omega-3 supplements on cognitive function in healthy individuals after 4 weeks (J of Psychopharmacology 2009, 23: 831-840). The investigators hypothesize that 4 weeks consumption of omega-3 supplements in previously depressed individuals will positively affect their cognitive functions. Secondly, low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Some studies have found low HRV in patients with depression. No studies have investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplements on Heart Rate Variability in individuals with a history of depression. The investigators will test the hypotheses that omega-3 supplements lead to an improvement of heart rate variability indices in healthy volunteers with a history of depression.</brief_summary>
