	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, comparator-controlled study. Participants were to be randomized (1:1) to daptomycin or comparator, stratified by degree of renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 - 50 milliliters per minute [mL/min] [moderate impairment] and &lt;30 mL/min [severe impairment]) and by type of infection (bacteremia and complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI]) to create 4 cohorts defined as follows: - Cohort 1: Bacteremia and CLcr &lt;30 mL/min - Cohort 2: Bacteremia and CLcr 30 - 50 mL/min - Cohort 3: cSSSI and CLcr &lt;30 mL/min - Cohort 4: cSSSI and CLcr 30 - 50 mL/min Participants will be treated and evaluated for safety and microbiological and clinical efficacy in accordance with their type of infection and degree of renal impairment. Peak and trough samples will be collected to assess exposure to daptomycin for participants on Day 1 and following the 5th dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent Male or female ≥18 years of age Diagnosis of cSSSI or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteremia Renal impairment of CLcr of 30 50 mL/min or CLcr &lt;30 mL/min per CockcroftGault equation using actual body weight Functioning hemodialysis access and on stable regimen for those receiving dialysis In appropriate health for the study with no acute or chronic illnesses that could adversely impact safety or ability to complete the study Specific inclusion criteria for cSSSI: Presence of a wound infection, major abscess, severe carbunculosis, infected ulcers, dialysis access site infection, or other type of infection in presence of complicating factor At least 3 of the following symptoms, signs, or laboratory values of a skin infection: elevated temperature; elevated white blood cell (WBC) count; pain; tenderness; swelling; erythema greater than 1 centimeter (cm) beyond wound edge; induration; pus formation Evidence of a Grampositive infecting pathogen as indicated by positive Gram stain or culture obtained within 96 hours prior to study drug administration Infection of sufficient severity to require parenteral antimicrobial therapy Specific inclusion criteria for S. aureus bacteremia: • Documented S. aureus bacteremia defined as at least one positive blood culture for S. aureus obtained within 96 hours prior to the first dose of study medication Pregnant or lactating females, or unwilling to practice barrier methods of birth control Received an investigational drug (including experimental biologic agents) within 30 days of study entry Unable to discontinue use of HMGCoA reductase inhibitor therapy while on study Known allergy or intolerance to daptomycin, penicillin, or vancomycin Active intravenous (IV) drug abuse Confirmed or suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, epidural abscess, intraabdominal infection, pneumonia, or infective endocarditis Required use of nonstudy systemic antibacterial agent with activity against target pathogen History of muscular disease Neurological disease except stroke &gt;6 months prior to study entry Intramuscular injection within 7 days of study drug administration Moribund clinical condition (high likelihood of death during next 3 days) Shock or hypotension (supine systolic blood pressure &lt;80 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]) Body mass index (BMI) &lt;18 or &gt;40 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m^2) [BMI = weight (kg)/height (m^2)] Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count ≤200 cells/millimeter (mm)^3 Neutropenic participants with an absolute neutrophil count ≤500 cells/mm^3 Anticipated to develop neutropenia absolute neutrophil count ≤500 due to prior or planned chemotherapy Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value &gt;3 × ULN Total bilirubin values ≥ 1.5 x ULN associated with ALT values &gt;3 x ULN Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) value &gt;2 × ULN Hemoglobin &lt;8 grams per deciliter (gm/dL) Unlikely to comply with study procedures or to return for evaluations History of rhabdomyolysis Prior enrollment into this study Infections caused by Grampositive pathogens known to be resistant to daptomycin or selected comparator agent Specific exclusion criteria for cSSSI: Minor or superficial skin infections as the primary site of infection Cellulitis or erysipelas not associated with complicating factor as primary site of infection Perirectal abscess, hidradenitis suppurativa, concomitant gangrene, myositis, multiple infected ulcers at distant sites, necrotizing fasciitis, or infected thirddegree burn wounds Infections requiring emergency surgery Infections suspected or documented to be due exclusively to gramnegative, anaerobic, or fungal organism Confirmed or suspected disorder that could interfere with the evaluations (for example, primary skin disorders) Use of a topical antibiotic at the site of the infection Use of systemic antibacterial therapy for the infection for &gt;24 hours within 48 hours prior to start of study drug unless (a) infecting Grampositive pathogen resistant to therapy or (b) therapy administered for 3 or more days with worsening or no improvement Planned surgical treatment that is considered curative of the infection Specific exclusion criteria for S. aureus bacteremia: Has intravascular foreign material at the time the positive blood culture was drawn (for example., intracardiac pacemaker wires, percutaneous or implanted venous catheters, vascular grafts) unless material removed within 4 days after first dose of study medication or approval of medical monitor (exceptions: vascular stents in place for &gt;6 months, permanent pacemaker attached via epicardial leads, or any dialysis access device unless this material is felt to be infected) Prosthetic heart valve Cardiac decompensation or valve damage or both with high likelihood of valve surgery in the 3 days after randomization Polymicrobial blood infection</criteria>
