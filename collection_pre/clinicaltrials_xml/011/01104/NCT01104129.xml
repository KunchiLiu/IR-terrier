	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if pancreatic cancer/pre-cancer can be detected in early stages through the molecular analysis of stool samples. Investigators hypothesize that analysis of stool samples using digital melt curve (DMC) analysis, can be used as a sensitive and specific method to detect the common genetic abnormalities present in pancreatic cancers and pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stool Testing for Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDC) remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. This is largely due to the fact that most patients present with advanced, unresectable disease, highlighting the critical need for a screening test for this disease. Stool testing is an approach that has not been explored for use in PDC screening. With the advent of stool-based DNA tests, it may be possible to target genetic abnormalities that have been recently characterized in PDC tumorigenesis. Aim: The aim of this study is to determine if deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alterations present in pancreatic cancer and precancerous intrapapillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) can be reliably recovered in matched stool. Methods: This is a case-control prospective study to determine the utility of a stool-based digital melt curve (DMC) assay in PDC screening. A total of 30 patients (18 with pancreatic cancer, 12 with IPMN) who will be undergoing pancreatic resection will be enrolled. Pancreatic neoplastic tissue will be isolated from their surgical specimens and the genes most commonly mutated in PDC will be sequenced from extracted DNA. In addition, hypermethylation at common promoter sites will be assessed by methylation-specific PCR. The genetic and epigenetic alterations isolated in pancreatic tissue will be utilized as the targets for stool DMC assay. Blinded technicians will process stool specimens from control patients as well as a matched control. The primary outcomes of this study will be the sensitivity and specificity of the stool DMC assay in detecting genetic mutations present in tumor or IPMN lesions.</detailed_description>
