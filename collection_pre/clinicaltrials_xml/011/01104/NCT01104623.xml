	<brief_title>ADHD - Voice Analysis, Vocal Acoustic Biomarkers in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aims to develop an objective diagnostic instrument for ADHD through an automatic voice-analysis system, which uses as input the natural speech of the participants. The underlying voice-analysis procedure was developed by J. Langner at Humboldt University of Berlin (Langner 2003). It ignores the semantic content of spoken words and extracts prosodic and sound features from the speech. Aims of the study: - deliver optimized multivariate logistic regression models of prosodic and sound properties of speech for ADHD. - observe sensitivity and specificity of the voice-analysis procedure.</detailed_description>
