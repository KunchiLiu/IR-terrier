	<brief_summary>The development of the abdominal aorta aneurysm is multifactorial. Through use of magnetic resonance imaging without contrast, this study will look closely at flow, the stresses hereby induced, as well as signs of inflammation in the vessel wall.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The etiology of the abdominal aorta aneurysm is complex and multi-factorial. Biomechanic and hemodynamic stress contributes to aneurysmal growth, and the relevance of inflammation is gaining in terms of pathological influence. The technical advances of imaging now enable one to utilize magnetic resonance in reconstructing aortal blood flow. Newer post-imaging software then enables one to perform complex data analysis, wherein shear and wall-stress can be calculated. The goal of this study is to analyze the aneurysms of twenty patients. Values will be obtained for shear and wall stress. Additionally, the utilization of short tau wave inversion recovery (STIR) sequences will be performed to evaluate the presence or absence of acute edema and inflammation of the region. It should also be noted that particular attention will be placed on the so-called "neck" of the aneurysm, where the aneurysm typically tapers into what is often regarded as normal aortic tissue. This region is important for both the placement of a surgical bypass prosthesis or a deployed stent graft.</detailed_description>
