	<brief_title>Dose Titration Investigation of the Pharmacokinetics of Testosterone Transdermal Systems in Hypogonadal Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive testosterone for 4 weeks. Based on a single morning testosterone measurement performed at the end of Week 1, the dosage can be titrated up or down to the next dose level to maintain testosterone levels in the normal range. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, a pharmacokinetic profile for total testosterone and metabolites will be obtained.</detailed_description>
