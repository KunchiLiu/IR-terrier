	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between tumor response after 3 doses of chemotherapy by induction using Docetaxel, Cisplatine and 5-Fluorouracile for advanced stage epidermoid carcinomas of the upper aero digestive tract and the presence of one or a combination of 3 genetic polymorphisms and/or 5 intra-tumoral transcriptional modifications.</brief_summary>
