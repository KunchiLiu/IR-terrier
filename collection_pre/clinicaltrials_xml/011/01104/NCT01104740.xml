	<brief_summary>Dengue is an infectious disease most prevalent in the world. This disease is endemic in the Caribbean, with an increase in seasonal rains. Several outbreaks have been observed in recent years, in 2001, 2005 and 2007, during which further particularly virulent serotypes have emerged. The clinical expression of dengue fever is variable, ranging from no symptoms to a classical form with fever, and even of severe or lethal bleeding. With the possible existence of silent forms of the disease, there are no data identifying the current level of protection of the population in Martinique / Guadeloupe.</brief_summary>
