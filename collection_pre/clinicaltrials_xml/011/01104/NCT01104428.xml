	<brief_title>Research on the Blood- Cooling - Toxin - Removing - Stasis - Dispersing Protocol Evaluation of Hench-schonlein Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Target：Optimize the TCM scheme of syndrome differentiation and treatment of HSP in line with the idea of blood- Cooling - Toxin - Removing - Stasis - Dispersing under the path of combination between disease differentiation and syndrome differentiation, and regards reducing the rate of the recurrence of HSP and kidney damage as the end point of evaluation indexes, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the scheme scientifically. Main research contents: Retrospective case investigation, analysis and research on literature, research on clinical assessment of the scheme of syndrome differentiation and treatment. Methods：With a series of compounds as the main interference factors, choosing the sample estimation of superiority design and adopting the test methods of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled to carry out the research of multicenter clinical efficacy evaluation. It summarizes the advantages and rules of syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM by means of the comparative study, which provides technical guidelines for the industry and sets an example to summarize the key common technology of clinical research, and also improves the evaluation level of TCM clinical research and efficacy.</detailed_description>
