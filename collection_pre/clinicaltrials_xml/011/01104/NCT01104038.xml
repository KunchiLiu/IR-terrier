	<brief_summary>Childhood obesity has increased in prevalence over the past several decades and is predictive of adult type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies of children and youth suggest that exercise reduces cardiometabolic risk factors. Minimal data are available, however, on the effects of "exergaming" , interactive technology- mediated approaches to increasing physical activity in children and youth. This project involves a partnership between UMass Boston/GoKids Boston and Children's Hospital Boston featuring an interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians from pediatric cardiology, nursing, prevention and behavioral sciences and exercise physiology and is designed to examine the effects of exergaming on moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA) indices of adiposity, risk factors for cardiometabolic disease and self-competence in Boston Public School children. It is hypothesized that participation in the EXCEL/exergaming intervention for 60 minutes, three times per week for 12 weeks will significantly increase MVPA (as measured by accelerometers), pre- to- post intervention and compared to an Advice only (Nutrition Education) group.Results of this pilot study will guide and inform a larger study of exergaming in children from the Boston Public Schools.</brief_summary>
