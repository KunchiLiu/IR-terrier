	<brief_summary>Nicotine patches are frequently used in smoking patients during their stay in the ICU in order to avoid tobacco's weaning symptoms which are likely to interfere with mechanical ventilation weaning. Until now the effectiveness of this treatment has not been proven. The aim of this study (NICOREA study) is to determine if a difference exists on the duration of mechanical ventilation once patients receive or not a nicotine substitute.</brief_summary>
