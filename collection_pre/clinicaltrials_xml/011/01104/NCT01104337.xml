	<brief_title>Drug Interaction Between Paracetamol and Warfarin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paracetamol is recommended as a first-line analgesic and antipyretic therapy in patients receiving short- and long-term oral anticoagulation, especially elderly patient.However,Increased INR was previously observed in patients treated with warfarin and paracetamol given at the maximum recommended dose (4g/day). To date, the mechanism of this interaction has not been determined.A recent in vitro study suggested that the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-para-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) appeared to interfere with vitamin K-dependent Î³-carboxylase (VKD-carb) and vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) activites12. The question remaining to be dealt with is whether this in vitro observation can explain the in vivo paracetamol-warfarin interaction. We aim to evaluate the effect of paracetamol at the most widely used doses 2 and 3g/day on INR in stable patients treated with warfarin in a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial and to identify the mechanism involved in this interaction in vivo.</detailed_description>
