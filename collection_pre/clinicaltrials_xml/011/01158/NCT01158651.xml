	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn if the study drug RAD001 can shrink or slow the growth of low-grade gliomas in children with NF1. Additionally, the safety of RAD001 will be studied. The study drug, RAD001, is a drug that may act directly on tumor cells by preventing tumor cell growth and development. RAD001 has been studied in participants with various types of cancer as a single agent (a drug that is used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of well known anticancer therapies. Information from these research studies suggests that RAD001 may help to shrink or slow the growth of low-grade gliomas. In this research study, the investigators are looking to see the response of RAD001 in children with low-grade gliomas and NF1 that have either not responded to treatment or have come back after treatment. We are also looking for the highest dose of RAD001 that can be given safely in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After signing this consent form, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. These tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular glioma care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. A medical history, which involves questions about your health history, any medications you are taking or plan to take, and any allergies. A physical exam, during which you will be asked about any problems that you might be having. Additionally, your clinician will check your vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure) and bodily systems (respiratory, nervous, digestive, etc). The doctor will also evaluate your performance status, which indicates how much your illness affects your activity level. Blood tests, including tests to measure any effects of your disease. Approximately 1-2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for these tests. Urine test, which will be done to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly. An assessment of your tumor using scans of the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be used to look at and evaluate the tumor. An Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of your heart A pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. A small amount of blood (about half a teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for this test. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis: All patients must have a radiographically progressive lowgrade glioma and at least two of the following diagnostic criteria for NF1, and/or a pathogenic NF1 gene mutation demonstrated in peripheral bloodderived DNA: Six or more caf√©aulait spots (greater than or equal to 0.5 cm in prepubertal subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in postpubertal subjects) Freckling in the axilla and/or inguinal region Plexiform neurofibroma Two or more Lisch nodules A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex) A firstdegree relative with NF1 An optic pathway glioma Disease Status: All patients must have radiographically progressive lowgrade glioma (including NF1 related visual pathway gliomas) after failure of a carboplatincontaining regimen. Patients with recurrent/progressive disease do not require a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Evaluable or Measurable Disease: Patients must have at least one evaluable or measurable site of disease according to criteria described in Section 9. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation. Age: Patients must be greater than 1 years and less than or equal to 21 years of age at the time of study entry. Performance Level: Karnofsky 50% for patients greater than 10 years of age and Lansky 50% for patients 10 years of age (Appendix I). Note: Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score. Prior Therapy Patients must have failed or not been able to tolerate a carboplatinbased regimen. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 4 weeks of entry onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea). Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a growth factor. Biologic (antineoplastic agent): At least 14 days since the completion of therapy with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 14 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. These patients must be discussed with the Study Chair on a casebycase basis. Investigational Drugs: Patients must not have received an investigational drug within 14 days. Steroids: Patients with endocrine deficiencies are allowed to receive physiologic or stress doses of steroids if necessary. CYP3A4 inhibitors: Patients may not be currently receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, and may not have received these medications within 1 week prior to study entry.

CYP3A4 inducers: Patients must also avoid St. John's Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4 Enzyme inducing anticonvulsants: Patients may not be taking enzymeinducing anticonvulsants, and may not have received these medications within 1 week prior to study entry, as these patients may experience different drug disposition. These medications include: Carbamazepine (Tegretol) Felbamate (Felbtol) Phenobarbitol Phenytoin (Dilantin) Primidone (Mysoline) Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) XRT: 6 months must have elapsed if the patient has received involved field XRT or gamma knife that includes all target lesions (i.e., there is no restriction if a new lesion arises outside the radiation field or a nonirradiated lesion progresses); 6 months must have elapsed if the patient has received craniospinal XRT. 6 weeks must have elapsed if patient has received radiation to areas outside optic glioma.
