	<brief_summary>This is an integrated medication/behavioral intervention program to increase energy, activity level and goal attainment in a sample of HIV+ adults whose presenting problems include both clinically significant fatigue and unmet vocational goals. Based on previous studies, the investigators found that many patients fail to achieve desired goals even though energy is restored by medication. To address this failure of goal attainment, the investigators will evaluate a behavioral intervention, originally based on Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression, and modified as Behavioral Activation Program for Energy and Productivity or BA-PEP. The intervention will be conducted with patients who experience clinically significant fatigue and who want to work or receive work-related training (paid or volunteer, part time or full time) or education once energy improves with medication (armodafinil).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Activation/Armodafinil to Treat Fatigue in HIV/AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose an integrated medication/behavioral intervention program to increase energy, activity level and goal attainment in a sample of people with HIV/AIDS whose presenting problem is clinically significant fatigue and unmet vocational goals. Based on a recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) of modafinil and ongoing RCT of armodafinil, the investigators found that many patients fail to achieve desired goals even though energy is restored by medication. To address this failure of goal attainment, the team will develop and pilot a behavioral intervention, originally based on Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression of Lejuez et al. and modified by Dr. Daughters as "Behavioral Activation Program for Energy and Productivity, or 'BA-PEP'". The intervention will be conducted with patients who experience significant fatigue, and who want to work or get work-related training or education once their energy improves with armodafinil treatment. It is intended for eventual implementation in HIV clinics and community agencies with work development programs. The intervention development includes both formative work and pilot studies. The formative work comprises in-depth patient interviews, focus groups with providers, a Project Advisory Board, and a separate Work Group. Their input will be used to modify their BA-PEP intervention to promote achievement of goals selected by each patient, once fatigue has been ameliorated with armodafinil, and to further adapt the attention control supportive counseling intervention. With this input, the investigators will conduct an exploratory study using BA-PEP with 12 patients responsive to armodafinil. After further modifications, investigators will conduct a feasibility trial with 30 armodafinil-responsive patients randomized 2:1 to BA-PEP or an attention control, supportive counseling. The main behavioral outcome is employment or taking classes (measured by Goal Attainment Scaling methodology). Secondary outcomes are reduced avoidance/increased activation (measured by the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale), and increased environmental interactions (measured by the EROS: Environmental Rewards Observation Scale). Finally, they will develop training and supervision manuals to guide implementation.</detailed_description>
