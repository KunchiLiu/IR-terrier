	<brief_title>Intrapartum Maternal Glycemic Control Using Insulin Pump Versus Insulin Drip - Cohort Observational Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrapartum maternal glycemic control in women suffering from pregestational diabetes mellitus type 1 will be evaluated and compared in the 3 study groups. Maternal and neonatal capillary blood glucose will be measured. All women suffering from diabetes mellitus and all neonates to hyperglycemic mothers are being tested for their blood glucose in our institute. Measurements' data will be collected. The primary outcome of the study is the number of neonatal hypoglycemic events (neonatal blood glucose &lt; 40mg/dL). All women participating in the study will be treated according to the standard accepted protocol for "the treatment of pregestational diabetes during labor" in our institute. The research will not include new treatments or equipment. The study is a cohort prospective and retrospective observational study in the tertiary center - Sheba medical center.</detailed_description>
