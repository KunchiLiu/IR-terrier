	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth of kidney cancer. Giving celecoxib together with recombinant interferon alpha-2b may kill more tumor cells and be an effective treatment for metastatic kidney cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving celecoxib together with recombinant interferon alfa-2b works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer who have undergone surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib and Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b in Metastatic Kidney Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the objective response rate of interferon alpha plus celecoxib in metastatic RCC patients with 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare cellular immune parameters in metastatic RCC patients with 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining to patients with &lt; 1+ tumor immunostaining. II. To evaluate the effect of celecoxib and interferon alpha therapy on cellular immune parameters in metastatic RCC patients with 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily and recombinant interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously, once daily, 5 times a week. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
