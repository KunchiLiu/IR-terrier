(For corticosteroids this means prednisone or equivalent &gt;= 0.05 mg/kg/day; topical and inhaled steroids are allowed). Periodic steroid injections, e.g., intraarticular, are not allowed within 30 days prior to first IXIARO® vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) and until Visit 3 (Day 70) History of autoimmune disease, including Type I Diabetes mellitus. Subjects with vitiligo or thyroid disease taking thyroid hormone replacement are not excluded.

If treatment for skin cancer was successfully completed more than six months ago and the malignancy is considered to be cured, the subject may be enrolled. Subjects with history of skin cancer must not be vaccinated at the previous site of the malignancy. Any other malignancy in the past 5 years. If treatment for cancer was successfully completed more than 5 years ago and the malignancy is considered to be cured, the subject may be enrolled.
