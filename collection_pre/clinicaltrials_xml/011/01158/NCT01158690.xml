	<brief_summary>The study composes of two large parts, in particular a large scale prevalence/incidence study and a single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). The prevalence/incidence study aims to determine the prevalence/incidence of physical, psychological and sexual violence in a pregnant population. The study population is recruited through the prenatal consultation of more or less 15 hospitals in Belgium. The respondents fill out a questionnaire on the spot minimum one time during pregnancy. Based on this questionnaire, the investigators aim to recruit 150 victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) to participate in the second part of the study. The RCT aims to evaluate if there is a safe and effective way to reduce IPV within the perinatal care setting. The investigators hypothesise that screening pregnant women for violence in combination with handing out a resource card, has the potential of interrupting the IPV and increase help-seeking behaviour.</brief_summary>
