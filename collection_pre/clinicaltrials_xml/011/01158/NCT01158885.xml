	<brief_summary>This study will test the ability of clofarabine + cytarabine to eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients whose bone marrows exhibit complete remission by morphology. The toxicity profile of this regimen will be evaluated in addition to toxicity experienced by patients who proceed to stem cell transplant. Overall length of remission will also be collected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine With Cytarabine for Patients With Minimal Residual Disease Positive Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies have demonstrated that even low levels of minimum residual disease (MRD) (&gt;0.01% abnormal blasts) after aggressive re-induction therapy indicate a relatively poor outcome in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, including those who proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). A similarly poor prognosis was seen in pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia patients with sub-morphologic disease prior to alloSCT. Studies to identify therapies that can eliminate persistent leukemia, have low toxicity profiles and can serve as a bridge to transplant are needed. This study will test the ability of clofarabine + cytarabine to eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients whose bone marrows exhibit complete remission by morphology. The toxicity profile of this regimen will be evaluated in addition to toxicity experienced by patients who proceed to stem cell transplant. Overall length of remission will also be collected.</detailed_description>

Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test confirmed prior to enrollment. Female patients with infants must agree not to breastfeed their infants while on this study. Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of contraception approved by the investigator during the study. Patient must agree to submission of blood and bone marrow for assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent. Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in the study. Patients with previous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within previous six months. Patients who have had prior treatment with clofarabine. Patients with CNS2 or CNS 3 disease or bulky chloromatous disease. Patients with Down Syndrome. Patients with a previous history of venoocclusive disease (VOD) or findings consistent with a diagnosis of VOD. Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled. Use of investigational agents within 30 days of planned treatment on this protocol. Patient is receiving or plans to receive concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or other anticancer therapy other than is specified in the protocol. Pregnant or lactating patients. Any significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up, or interpretation of study results. Have had a diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient has been diseasefree for at least 3 years following the completion of curative intent therapy with the following exceptions: 1. Patients with treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the diseasefree duration, are eligible for this study if definitive treatment for the condition has been completed. 2. Patients with organconfined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostatespecific antigen (PSA) values are also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical prostatectomy has been performed.</criteria>
