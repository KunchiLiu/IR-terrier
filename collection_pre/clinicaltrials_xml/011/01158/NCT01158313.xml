	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that most patients with functional oropharyngeal dysphagia could be quickly, safely and accurately recognized by using a clinical bedside method developed by the investigative team as the volume-viscosity swallow test (V-VST) that systematically evaluates the main clinical signs and symptoms of safety and efficacy of swallowing and monitors pulse oximetry to improve the detection of patients with silent aspirations.The aim of this study is to validate this test for persons suspected of having swallowing impairment, using a new thickener, with respect to the Videofluoroscopy (VFS) method (treated as the gold standard).</brief_summary>
