	<brief_title>Filter Initial &amp; Long Term Evaluation After Placement and Retrieval Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient clinical data will be used in a clinical registry. Before a patient is to undergo their initial procedure for filter placement/retrieval, we will approach them for consent to participate in the study. If patients consent, we will follow clinical data from the procedure, and do chart reviews over time to track progress of the filter and response to the procedure to place/remove the filter. Participants will only be enrolled if they will be undergoing an IVC (Inferior Vena Cava) filter placement/retrieval procedure. The procedure itself is not being performed as part of the study.</detailed_description>
