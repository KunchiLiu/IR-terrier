	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a video camera pill (PillCam) in assessing intestinal function in the small intestines of patients. It is believed that the condition of the subjects digestive system can have a large impact on their overall physical health. Therefore, the investigators would like to assess whether using the pill device helps to determine any functional problems in patients in the ICU. The investigators are studying ICU patients because any change in their condition can have a large impact on their recovery. The same device will be used in healthy subjects scheduled for elective ambulatory surgery.</brief_summary>
