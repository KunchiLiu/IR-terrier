	<brief_summary>Concomitant chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of locally advanced, non-resectable, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the optimal chemotherapy regimen is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a concomitant treatment using Endostar (Recombinant Human Endostatin), Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and radiotherapy for LA-NSCLC, and also assess its impact on patient Quality of Life (QoL) and progression-free survival (PFS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Endostar, Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung (RT0902)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with non-resectable non-small Cell Lung Cancer will receive thoracic radiation therapy 60-66 Gy over 30-33 fractions and concurrent with Endostar 7.5 mg/m2 over 3 hours d1-14, Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly over 1 hour, Carboplatin AUC = 2 mg/mL/min over 30 min weekly. Followed by Endostar 7.5 mg/m2 d1-14,Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 d1 and Carboplatin AUC = 5 mg/mL/min d1 every 3 weeks for 2 cycles as consolidation treatment.</detailed_description>
