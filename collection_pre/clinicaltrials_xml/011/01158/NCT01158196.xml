	<brief_summary>A pilot study will be conducted on 2 type of subjects, one with plastic surgery scar with a randomization of laser treated portions, and other with keloid excision scar with a complete laser treatment. The aim is to evaluate the infra-red diode laser influence on keloid recurrence and scar prevention. The keloid recurrence rate will be evaluated at each visit, and the scar prevention in plastic surgery will be evaluated comparing laser treated portion and non-treated portion.</brief_summary>
