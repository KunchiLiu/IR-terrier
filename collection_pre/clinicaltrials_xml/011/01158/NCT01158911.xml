	<brief_summary>Patients in the earlier stages of Chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk both for the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (define by the requirement for dialysis or kidney transplantation) and development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although controversial, there is literature to suggest that uric acid may play a role in the progression of kidney disease and development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study was a randomized controlled trial in patients with CKD, which examined the effects of dietary protein restriction and strict blood pressure control on progression of non-diabetic CKD. Extensive data on risk factors for progression of kidney disease and development of CVD are available, as is long term follow up. 838 of the 840 patients who were randomized have uric acid levels measured at baseline. The aims of the present study are to examine the determinants of uric acid in cross sectional analysis at baseline, to determine the association between uric acid and development of ESRD, and the association of uric acid with all-cause and CVD mortality. Level of kidney function will be a major determinant of uric acid levels independent of other risk factors. Level of uric acid will be associated with development of ESRD independent of level of kidney function and other risk factors. Uric Acid levels will be associated with both all-cause and CVD mortality independent of kidney function and other risk factors.</brief_summary>
