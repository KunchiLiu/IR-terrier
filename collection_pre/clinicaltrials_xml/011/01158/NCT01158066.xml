	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease are 8 times more prevalent in patients with NAFLD that the general population and are being considered the most common cause of death. Cardiac CT is a reliable non invasive method in demonstrating Coronary Plaques. However the association between coronary artery calcium score (CAC) and NAFLD remains controversial. AIM: the aim is to evaluate the association between CAC score ( CT) and NAFLD (CT). the working hypothesis is that Beside the traditional risk factors including age, diabetes, NAFLD is also associated with moderate to high risk of CAD.</detailed_description>
