	<brief_summary>This protocol hopes to determine whether the use of dexmedetomidine-ketamine can reduce the use of standard of care fentanyl-midazolam sedation during bronchoscopy. This may result in less respiratory depression while providing better compliance with the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative Sedation During Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients enrolled in the study will be undergoing bronchoscopy, which is typically performed with sedation. All procedural sedation carries some risk. Several features of the study may lower the risk of sedation relative to that of conventional sedation. An anesthesiologist will be present throughout the procedure. Continuous monitoring of respiration with RIP will be employed. Administration of sedation will be via a volumetric syringe pump. Benefits specific to dexmedetomidine-ketamine include the lack of respiratory depression and greater hemodynamic stability.</detailed_description>
