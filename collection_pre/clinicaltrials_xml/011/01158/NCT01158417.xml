	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory mediators and insulin resistance at the cellular and molecular level in obese non diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects in vivo. This research will investigate the hypothesis that resveratrol, when given orally to obese and type 2 diabetic subjects induces a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and the inflammatory mediators regulated by it. The hypothesis that resveratrol suppresses the high fat, high carbohydrate (HFHC) meal induced inflammatory and oxidative response, will also be investigated. This research will also investigate the hypothesis that resveratrol intake for 12 weeks improves insulin sensitivity by lowering the Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), an index of insulin resistance and, that resveratrol intake will cause an increase in incretins.</brief_summary>
