	<brief_summary>We hope to clarify how betamethasone affects glucose levels in the mother in the days after receiving the drug. This understanding will hopefully allow us to better anticipate the risk of maternal hyperglycemia and therefore establish more appropriate monitoring of maternal glucose to prevent maternal and neonatal complications of hyperglycemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Pregnant Women Undergoing Betamethasone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant patients who are undergoing inpatient betamethasone therapy as part of their clinical care will be eligible for the study. Once the clinical team and patients have agreed to pursue betamethasone therapy, the patients' treating physician or nurse will inquire if the patient is interested in participating in our study protocol. Those patients who are interested in participation will be consented by either a member of the treatment team or the study team. Prior to receiving the first betamethasone dose, a soft sensor for continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be inserted superficially under the skin. For those patients who will be receiving a scheduled course of betamethasone, the sensor may be inserted up to 24 hours prior to the betamethasone administration. The patient will be instructed on how to wear and care for the device. She will wear the CGMS for the duration of her hospitalization or for up to 7 days total, whichever time period is shorter. For those patients who are diabetic, they will receive normal finger stick blood glucose (FSBG) monitoring and insulin therapy as determined by their treating physicians. Those patients who are not diabetic will need to have 2 FSBG checks each day to correlate with the device. Abnormal values will be reported to the patients' treating physician and addressed by the treating physician. Prior to being discharged from the hospital, the patient will have the device removed. The patient will otherwise be treated routinely. We will record baseline demographic information and medical history from each of the women. We will also record information from the neonates' newborn medical records.</detailed_description>
