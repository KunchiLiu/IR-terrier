	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subject has a short life expectancy (approximately 1 year or less) as estimated by the Investigator. The subject is 70 years of age or older if cognitively normal, or 55 years of age or older if terminal because of dementia. The subject's general health is adequate to undergo the study procedures. The subject has a contraindication for PET. The subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity/allergy to [18F]flutemetamol or to any of the excipients. The subject is unable to tolerate or cooperate with study procedures.</criteria>
