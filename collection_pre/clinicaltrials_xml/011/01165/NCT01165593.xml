	<brief_title>Measurement of Left and Right Atria From CT Scans of Cardiac Rhythm Disorder Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Correct device design depends on getting good information about the shape and size of the different parts of the heart. Measurements from computed tomography images of hearts will be studied. By looking at measurements from a wide range of patients, an understanding of the differences in the size and shape of the heart chambers will be gained.</detailed_description>
