	<brief_title>Cilengitide in Combination With Irradiation in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of children and young adults with a malignant glioma in the brain stem or a recurrent malignant glioma (in whatever site) is very poor. Over the last few decades, many therapeutic trials have been performed but have failed to significantly improve survival in these patients. There is thus a need to test new drugs in these indications. There is a strong biological rationale for the use of anti-angiogenic drugs in high-grade glioma. Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany), a cyclic pentapeptide containing the sequence RGD (cyclo-[Arg-Gly-Asp-Dphe-(NmeVal)]) is a selective antagonist of integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are strongly involved in tumour angiogenesis. Positive results with Cilengitide in preclinical models of glioblastoma, its particularly attractive safety profile and its encouraging efficacy in phase I and II studies in adults and children make it a potentially effective molecule for the treatment of malignant glioma in children. Furthermore, its combination with radiotherapy to be appears synergistic, without any apparent increase in toxicity. In this study, Cilengitide will be evaluated when concurrently administered with radiotherapy as a first-line treatment and then as a maintenance monotherapy in children and young adults with malignant brain stem glioma. The main objective will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Cilengitide when administered twice weekly as a 60-minute intra-venous infusion.</detailed_description>
