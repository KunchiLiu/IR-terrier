	<brief_summary>This study will find how weight affects the dosing of a drug called dapsone. Currently, the amount of dapsone a patient receives is the same regardless of the patient's weight.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects, age &gt;18 years, of all racial and ethnic origins. NonEnglish speaking Spanish speakers will be included in the study. We are recruiting 12 normal or underweight (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2), 12 overweight or obese (BMI 2540 kg/m2), and 12 extremely obese (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2) for this study. This index is calculated using the volunteer's height and weight (Formula: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703). Half of each group will be male; the other half will be female. Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the study. The effects of dapsone on pregnancy are unknown. In addition, the metabolic changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the concentrationtime profile of dapsone, so that the pregnancy and postpartum state would be a confounding variable. Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases&gt;10 times upper limit of normal, Alkaline phosphatase&gt;5 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin&gt;5 times upper limit of normal. History of allergies to dapsone, sulfones, or sulfonamides. Dapsone, sulfones, or sulfonamides are contraindicated for any reason. Volunteers unwilling to comply with study procedures. Current suspected or documented infection of any kind. Volunteers with colon resection, gastric bypass, lap band, or any other conditions inhibiting gastric absorption of drug. Current or previous participation within 28 days of enrollment in another research study that involves the use of medication, contrast, or any other compound that may alter blood count and/or blood chemistry (liver function, kidney function or electrolyte balance), unless waved by PI. Donation of 450 milliliters (ml) (one unit) of blood or more within 8 weeks (56 days) prior to study enrollment, unless waved by PI. Current use of zidovudine, amprenavir, rifabutin, rifapentine, or saquinavir. Creatinine clearance &lt; 70 ml/minute (min) as estimated by the Cockcroftgault equation.</criteria>
