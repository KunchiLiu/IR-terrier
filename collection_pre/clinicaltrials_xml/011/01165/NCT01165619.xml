	<brief_summary>In this study, we will measure levels of reproductive hormones and metabolic markers in subjects with isolated GnRH deficiency disorders and compare them to healthy control populations. Our goals are (1) to chart the range of hormonal and metabolic biomarkers in healthy subjects and those with reproductive disorders and (2) to correlate reproductive and metabolic phenotypes with genetic changes within patients with reproductive disorders and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
