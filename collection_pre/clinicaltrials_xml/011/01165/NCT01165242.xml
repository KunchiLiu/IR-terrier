Assent will be obtained from subjects who are still legally minors in line with local rules and regulations. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Previously completed routine childhood vaccinations to the best of subject's/Legally Acceptable Representative(s)'s knowledge. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception for 2 months after vaccination. The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If ANY exclusion criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to vaccination. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone &lt;10 mg/day, or equivalent, is allowed. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.) Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within one month of the dose of vaccine, with the exception of any licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine. Previous vaccination with vaccine components within the last month. History of meningococcal disease. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. History of allergic reactions or disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of either vaccine, or by dry natural rubber latex. History of any neurologic disorders, including GuillainBarré Syndrome. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Acute disease at the time of enrollment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. Bleeding disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anticoagulant therapy. Child in care.
