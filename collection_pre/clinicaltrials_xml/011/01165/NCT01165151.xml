	<brief_summary>The present study will assess whether the size of treatment groups (groups of 10 vs. 30 participants) affects short- and long-term weight loss. It is hypothesized that participants assigned to a small group will exhibit similar short-term and long-term weight losses (i.e., weight loss at months 6 and 12) as compared to those assigned to a large group.</brief_summary>
