	<brief_summary>Child malnutrition is intimately associated to poverty and may be due to sub-optimal feeding behaviours, food insecurity at household level, or a combination of both. Acute malnutrition is a major contributor to under-5 mortality and morbidity in developing countries. While clinical guidelines for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have been available for a decade, research on the management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) has lagged behind. Nonetheless, MAM is much more incident than SAM, it increases mortality risk by itself and requires special nutritional treatment. This study is thus meant to address this major gap, by testing the relative feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three innovative strategies for treating children with MAM aged 6-24 months : a locally produced Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), a corn/soy blended flour (CSB++)provided by the World Food Program, and a specific and context-appropriate child-centred counselling. The evaluation will be carried out as a cluster-randomized trial in the Houndé district, Burkina Faso, where 18 rural health centres will be randomly allocated to RUSF or CSB or CCC for treating MAM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Moderate Malnutrition in 6-24 Months Old Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Child malnutrition is intimately associated to poverty and may be due to sub-optimal feeding behaviours, food insecurity at household level, or a combination of both. Acute malnutrition is a major contributor to under-5 mortality and morbidity in low and middle income countries. Clinical guidelines for the management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have been available for a decade and have yielded excellent results. However, the corresponding research on the management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) has lagged behind, even if MAM is much more incident than SAM, increases mortality risk on its own and requires special nutritional treatment. Currently, the main management of MAM, in Burkina Faso as in most African countries, consists of giving nutritional advice to the caretakers, but mothers of MAM children are usually given the same general dietary advice as mothers of well-nourished children. A more efficient, child-centred approach must be developed, by adapting the counselling to the needs of the family, by developing a more child-centred approach, by providing operational recommendations for MAM children, and by providing an adequate follow-up post-treatment. This study is thus meant to address this major gap, by testing the relative feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three innovative strategies for treating children with MAM: a locally produced Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), an enhanced corn/soy blended flour (CSB++)provided by the World Food Program, and a specific and context-appropriate child-centred counselling. The evaluation will be based on a cluster-randomized trial carried out in the Houndé district, Burkina Faso. Eighteen rural health centres and the population living in their catchment area will be randomly allocated to RUSF or CSB or CCC for treating MAM. Only children aged 6-24 months will be included as the risk of acute malnutrition is high and more amenable to interventions in this age range. Overall, 2088 children with MAM will participate. In each study arm, children will be home-visited once a week by assessors for anthropometry, 24-hours recall of dietary and breastfeeding intake, and morbidity signs. Feeding practices will be also assessed in each arm, and the changes between baseline and intervention periods evaluated. Compliance will be evaluated by interviewing family members.</detailed_description>
