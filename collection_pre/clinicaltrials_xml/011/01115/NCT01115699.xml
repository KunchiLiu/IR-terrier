	<brief_summary>The study will systematically investigate the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in non-remitters of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) followed by a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) trial with the capacity to identify gene variants that predict rTMS response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as Adjuvant Treatment for Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first study of its kind to systematically investigate the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in non-remitters of a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) followed by an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) trial with the capacity to identify gene variants that predict rTMS response. The study is similar in design to the STAR*D study in that it will be the third treatment stage for a study of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). rTMS is a novel intervention which was FDA approved for treatment of MDD in October 2008 and was not clinically available at the time of the STAR*D study. The primary aim of this pilot study is to provide 10 Hertz (Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) as adjuvant treatment for depression in individuals who have not had a remission of their depressive symptoms after an 8 week trial of an SSRI (citalopram or escitalopram) followed by an 8 week trial of an SNRI, duloxetine and identify gene variants associated with improvement of their depressive symptoms.</detailed_description>
