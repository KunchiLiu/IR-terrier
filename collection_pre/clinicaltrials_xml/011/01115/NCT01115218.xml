	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate whether it is possible to predict the success of trabeculectomy in patients with glaucoma through the examination of mediators of wound healing in anterior chamber fluid. The success rate of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in the literature is about 75%. This leads on the question why 25% of the patients received trabeculectomy are not sufficient treated and have not a long-term IOP reduction. Precisely this question is to be examined by the study.</brief_summary>
