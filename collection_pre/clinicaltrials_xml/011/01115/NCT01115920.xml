	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Intravenous (IV) Infusion of MTP-131 (Bendavia™) in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MTP-131 in healthy volunteers following a single intravenous infusion. The secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MTP-131. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. A total of 40 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 3:1 active to placebo ratio for a total of 5 treatment groups of 8 volunteers. As far as is logistically possible, each treatment group will have similar numbers of male and female volunteers. After the last subject for each cohort has completed the day 3 clinical assessment and no stopping rules have been met according to Safety Review Board decision, the next cohort will commence.</detailed_description>
