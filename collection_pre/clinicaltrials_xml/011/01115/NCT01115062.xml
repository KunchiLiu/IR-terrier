	<brief_title>Comparison of Synera Patch Versus LMX-4 Cream Versus Placebo Patch for Pain Reduction During Venipuncture in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the effectiveness of a patch applied for 30 minutes (Synera-lidocaine 70 mg/tetracaine 70 mg) with the effectiveness of a cream (LMX-4- 4% liposomal lidocaine) and a placebo patch applied for the same length of time in reducing pain due to needle sticks in children. One hundred fifty children and adolescents 5-17 years old admitted to emergency department or presenting to the phlebotomy lab. will be randomly placed in each group. Children will rate their level of pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) before the medication is applied, after the medication is removed and after the needle stick. Parents and research observer will fill out the Observed Behavioral Distress (OBD) score. The phlebotomist will rate how difficult it was to perform the needle sticks. Any skin reaction seen by the investigator after the cream or patch is removed will be noted and compared among the three groups. Subjects will be monitored from the time of enrollment to 5 minutes post phlebotomy.The Time Frame for which data will be presented is one (1) year.</detailed_description>
