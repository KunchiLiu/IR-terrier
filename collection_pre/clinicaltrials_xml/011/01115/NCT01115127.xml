	<brief_title>Myo-inositol and Melatonin in Pre-menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melatonin has produced a remarkable significant improvement of thyroid function, positive changes of gonadotropins towards reduced levels, and in some women a re-acquisition of normal menstrual cycle. Furthermore, an abrogation of menopause-related depression, amelioration of hot-flashes and improvement of quality and duration of sleep has been reported. Myo-inositol is involved in several aspects of human reproduction. Elevated concentrations of myo-inositol in human follicular fluids appear to play a positive function in follicular maturity and provide a marker of good quality oocytes. Nevertheless its positive role in PCOS women is a consequence of a defect in the insulin signalling pathway (inositol-containing phosphoglycan mediators) that seems to be primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance</detailed_description>
