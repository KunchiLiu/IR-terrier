	<brief_title>Supervised Walking Groups as a Model to Increase Physical Activity in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular, moderate-intensity physical activity can attenuate hyperglycemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In addition, these programmes may favourably affect several other cardiovascular risk factors in these subjects. However, it still remains unclear how this evidence can be transferred into clinical practice, considering the very large number of diabetic patients and the characteristics of this population, made up predominantly of elderly, sedentary and overweight patients. In this regard, a realistic approach to this issue requires simple and easily available intervention models. Walking is a typical mild-moderate aerobic physical activity which is easy to organize and does not require specific skills or preliminary sophisticated medical evaluations. This activity could therefore fit well with the need of involvement of large numbers of patients in different logistic situations. However, it has been reported that, due to the low walking speed typical of type 2 diabetic subjects, self-paced walking is inadequate to obtain a significant metabolic improvement in these subjects.</detailed_description>
