	<brief_summary>A more recent prospective nonrandomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical study demonstrated that metformin exerts a slight but significant deleterious effect on serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels in patients with PCOS, and supplementation with folate is useful to increase the beneficial effect of metformin on the vascular endothelium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin and Folate in Pregnant Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCOS (cases) and non-PCOS (controls) pregnant women were enrolled. Cases will be randomized in four treatment groups: metformin plus placebo (group A1), metformin plus folic acid (group A2), placebo plus folic acid (group A3), placebo alone (group A4). Controls will not received any treatment (group B). Clinical and biochemical assessment (including serum markers of implantation), Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries, and trophoblastic invasion at histological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Changes in clinical and biochemical data under treatment, pattern of Doppler velocimetry at the uterine arteries, and trophoblastic invasion were evaluated.</detailed_description>
