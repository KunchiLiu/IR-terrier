	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of bevacizumab (Avastin) as an adjunctive medication during pterygium surgery in preventing pterygium recurrence. A pterygium is a white fleshy growth on the surface of the eye, which can be removed surgically. However, after surgical removal, pterygia can recur. One way of minimizing recurrence is by applying a medication called mitomycin C to the surface of the eye during pterygium surgery. However, mitomycin is associated with certain side effects, such as thinning of the eye wall and poor wound healing. Bevacizumab has a different mechanism of action and there is some evidence that it may be useful in preventing pterygium recurrence. In this study, the safety and efficacy of adjunctive intraoperative use of bevacizumab and mitomycin C for preventing pterygium recurrence will be directly compared.</brief_summary>
