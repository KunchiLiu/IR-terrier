	<brief_summary>Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a new mouthwash in treating oral lesions due to removable prostheses. Methods: The present prospective randomized clinical trial was performed on 44 patients. The experimentation lasted for 4 weeks and 4 operators participated. The effects of the mouthwash were evaluated subjectively and objectively, with questionnaires, Visual Analogic Scales and clinical examinations. The results were statistically analyzed. The following variables were recorded: presence of mucosal lesions due to incongruous removable prostheses and lasting of pain after rinsing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the present prospective, randomized, triple-blind controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative mouthwash (emulsion) in the treatment of lesions of oral mucosae due to removable prostheses. The tested preparation contained two active molecules: a topical antiseptic (0.1% hexetidine) and a local anesthetic (0.5% chlorobutanol).</detailed_description>
