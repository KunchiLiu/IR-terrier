	<brief_title>Thiamine Supplementation in Heart Failure Patients Receiving Full Medical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is performed to consider the effect of thiamine supplementation versus placebo on symptoms and signs of patients with heart failure systolic and diastolic function of left ventricle. Heart failure patients (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%) are randomized to receive tablets of 300mg or placebo for 1 months in a double-blind fashion. All subjects will be on stable optimal medical therapy according to the present guidelines for at least 3 months before enrolment. At randomization and at study end, echocardiography by a single observer will be performed and assessment of symptoms and signs and quality of life based on self scoring system (from 1 to 7) and objective physical examinations will be done.</detailed_description>
