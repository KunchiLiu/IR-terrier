	<brief_summary>Study JGCB is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1b study of LY2584702 in combination with either erlotinib or everolimus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of LY2584702 With Erlotinib or Everolimus in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study JGCB will consist of the following parts: Part 1 - Dose Escalation to maximum tolerated dose in each arm. Arm A - LY2584702 + Erlotinib in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Arm B - LY2584702 + Everolimus in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Part 2 - Dose Confirmation of maximum tolerated dose from each arm in Part 1. Arm A - LY2584702 + Erlotinib in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Arm B - LY2584702 + Everolimus in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after treatment failure with sunitinib or sorafenib, or advanced neuroendocrine tumors.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Dose Escalation portion (Part 1): have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer that is advanced and/or metastatic disease (including NonHodgkin's Lymphoma) for which no proven effective therapy exists. Dose Confirmation portion (Part 2): have histological or cytological evidence of: 1. Arm A: advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. 2. Arm B: advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib, or advanced neuroendocrine tumors. Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) or the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. 1. Dose Escalation portion (Part 1): patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable disease. 2. Dose Confirmation portion (Part 2): patients must have measurable disease. Have adequate organ function including: 1. Hematologic: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109/L, platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8 g/dL. 2. Hepatic: bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN); alanine transaminase (ALT) and AST less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN. If the liver has tumor involvement, AST and ALT equaling less than or equal to 5 times ULN are acceptable. Patients with bone metastases may enter with alkaline phosphatase values less than or equal to 5 times ULN, as long as other hepatic parameters meet inclusion criteria. 3. Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;45 ml/mn. Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancerrelated hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy for at least 2 weeks (3 weeks for myelosuppressive agents) prior to study enrollment, and have recovered from the acute effects of therapy. At the discretion of the investigator, patients with prostate cancers progressing under LHRH agonists therapy, and patients with adrenal carcinomas using mitotan, may have that treatment continued while receiving study drug. Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study drug for a nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agent, respectively. Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. Have symptomatic CNS malignancy or metastasis. Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable and asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastasis is not required. Concomitant treatment by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers. Have an acute or chronic leukemia. Have received an autologous or allogeneic stemcell transplant within 75 days of the initial dose of study drug. In addition, recipients of an allogenic stemcell transplant must have discontinued immunosuppressive therapy at least 24 hours before study drug administration with no more than Grade 1 acute graftversushost disease. For Dose Confirmation portion (Part 2): have previously received erlotinib for Arm A or everolimus for Arm B.</criteria>
