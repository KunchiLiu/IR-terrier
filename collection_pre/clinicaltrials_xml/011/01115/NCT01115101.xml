	<brief_title>Superiority Study for Pain Treatment After Cesarean</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management after cesarean is an important topic for women. Pain during and after surgery is their greatest concern. After surgery quick mobilization is important to take care of the newborn. When using a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device mobilization is limited and women can not meet their expectations to take care of the newborn. Oral analgesia in comparison offers superior patient satisfaction. This trial was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of both treatment options and improve patients pain management and overall content after cesarean.</detailed_description>
