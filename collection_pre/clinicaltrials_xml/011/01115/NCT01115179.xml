	<brief_summary>The inflammatory properties of propofol are still under debate. Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) is involved in the inflammatory process. This study was designed to determine whether and how propofol or its solvent modulate Apo A-I and the inflammatory response after surgical stress. The investigators study hypothesis was that propofol might modify the Apo A-I blood levels, and thus, modulate the postoperative inflammatory course.</brief_summary>
