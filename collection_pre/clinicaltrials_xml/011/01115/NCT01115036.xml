	<brief_summary>In the current study, the investigators will evaluate intratumoral pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data associated with the administration of the HDACI, Panobinostat, among recurrent GBM patients. In addition, this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of this agent, as well as evidence of anti-tumor activity in the patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Panobinostat Presurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll a maximum of 24 subjects with recurrent GBM who are scheduled for planned debulking craniotomy. After screening and enrollment on the study, subjects will receive 20mg panobinostat 3 times a week for one week prior to surgery. Within 2-6 weeks of resection, subjects will resume panobinostat at 20mg panobinostat 3 times per week. The primary endpoint will be 6-month progression-free survival. Each cycle of therapy will be 28 days. All subjects will be assessed after every other cycle of therapy. Subjects will remain on study therapy for at least one year unless they develop progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study procedures or withdraw consent. Patients may continue treatment with oral panobinostat until they experience unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, disease progression, and/or at the discretion of the investigator.</detailed_description>

One of these methods of contraception must be a barrier method. WOCBP are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of the first administration of oral panobinostat; Male patients whose sexual partners are WOCBP not using a double method of contraception during the study and 3 months after the end of treatment. One of these methods must be a condom.</criteria>
