	<brief_summary>The initial hypothesis is that branched-chain aminoacids (BCAA) administration could be beneficial to patients suffering from sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), the aim of the present work is to verify this hypothesis. The literature data demonstrate that a BCAA complementation improves the physical performances, protects lean mass and increases VO2 max during training. We demonstrated earlier that this complementation can cure at less partly the hypoxemia of chronic obstructive pulmonary patients by a stimulation of respiratory centres.</brief_summary>
