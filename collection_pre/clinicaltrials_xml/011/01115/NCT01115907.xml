	<criteria>The subject is male or female 18 years old or older. The subject or subject's legal representative is willing to sign the informed consent. The subject which preoperative evaluation indicated the need for native or prosthetic aortic valve replacement. Any subject amenable to aortic valve replacement with biological prosthesis should be enrolled in the study, even in conjunction with valve repair, coronary artery bypass grafting and other procedures. The subject is located in a geographic location that will enable the subject to return to the study site for all followup examinations (i.e. geographically stable). Subject will be available to the investigator(s) for postoperative followup beyond one year. The subject has preexisting valve prosthesis in the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid position. The subject requires a double or multiple valve replacement (a valve repair is not considered an exclusion criterion). The subject has a previously implanted SOLO valve, within the clinical study, that requires replacement. The subject has active endocarditis or myocarditis. The subject is or will be participating in a concomitant research study of an investigational product. The subject is a minor, drug abuser, alcohol abuser, prison inmate, institutionalized, or is unable to give informed consent. The subject has a major or progressive noncardiac disease that, in the investigator's experience, results in a life expectancy of less than 1 year, or the implant of the device produces an unacceptable increased risk to the subject. The subject is pregnant, planning to become pregnant or lactating. The subject has a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. The subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to complete the study. The subject is undergoing renal dialysis for chronic renal failure or has been diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism. The subject has had an acute preoperative neurological deficit, myocardial infarction, or cardiac event that has not returned to baseline or stabilized â‰¥30 days prior to the planned valve implant surgery. The subject has extensive calcification of the aortic root where removal of the calcified tissue cannot be achieved. The subject has a significantly dilated aortic root that is not surgically corrected. The subject requires replacement of the aortic root / full root procedure.</criteria>
