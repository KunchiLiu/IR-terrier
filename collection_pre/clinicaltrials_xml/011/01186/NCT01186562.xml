	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test the effects of sitagliptin on the need for insulin (the hormone that lowers blood sugars) by patients who receive a pancreatectomy and islet autotransplant for chronic pancreatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin Therapy to Improve Outcomes After Islet Autotransplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the current time, about one-third of patients are insulin independent (do not need to take insulin) after autotransplant, but the other two-thirds still need some insulin. Sitagliptin works by increasing the amount of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, in the body which then increases the amount of insulin that is made by the beta cells(the insulin producing cell of the islets). GLP-1 might also help protect beta cells from dying under stressful conditions and increase the production of new beta cells. The primary goal of this study is to see if taking sitagliptin for one year after islet autotransplant increases the number of patients who achieve and maintain insulin independence. Other goals of this study are to see if sitagliptin reduces the amount of insulin injections needed or helps the islets make more insulin.</detailed_description>
