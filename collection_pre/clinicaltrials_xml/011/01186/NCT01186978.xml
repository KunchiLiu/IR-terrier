	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether a reduction in the radiation dose and field size will maintain a high rate of local control while minimizing the risk of acute and late toxicity. Hypothesis- The radiation dose and treatment volume can be safely reduced from 30 Gy to 20 Gy while maintaining high rates of local control in patients who had a negative PET scan following rituximab-containing chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
