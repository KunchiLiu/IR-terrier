	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 3 different approaches to exercise training in women with early stage breast cancer who have completed all primary treatments (except hormone therapy, if appropriate). Prior research in women with early stage breast cancer has shown that some treatments may have an adverse impact on physical fitness levels leading to feelings of fatigue and poor quality of life. Supervised exercise training has been shown to reduce some of these side-effects. However, all the exercise programs have followed essentially the same approach. This study is designed to see if a different approach to exercise training is more effective than the conventional approach currently in use.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 4580 years Female Has been diagnosed with earlystage breast cancer Postmenopausal, defined as : Age ≥ 45 with no menses for at least 2 years An interval of at least one year, but no more than five years, following the full completion of primary therapy for malignant disease. Primary therapy is defined as: Surgery plus radiation Surgery plus chemotherapy Surgery plus trastuzumab Surgery plus hormone therapy Note: For patients who receive hormone therapy following surgery, the definition of oneyear postcompletion of therapy is defined by the surgery date. Patients who are currently receiving hormone therapy are eligible for enrollment. Weight of &lt; 205 kgs ECOG status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy ≥ 6 months Performing less than 150 minutes of structured moderateintensity or strenuous intensity exercise per week. Exercise intolerance defined by a VO2peak below that predicted for sedentary age and sexmatched individuals as defined in Appendix H. Willing to be randomized to one of the study arms Able to complete an acceptable baseline CPET, in the absence of high risk ECG findings or other inappropriate response to exercise as determined by the investigator. Able to achieve an acceptable peak baseline CPET, as defined by any of the following criteria: Achieving a plateau in oxygen consumption, concurrent with an increase in power output; A respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10; Attainment of maximal predicted heart rate (HRmax) (i.e., within 10 bpm of agepredicted HRmax [HRmax = 220Age[years]); Volitional exhaustion, as measured by a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18 on the BORG scale. Any of the following absolute contraindications to cardiopulmonary exercise testing: Acute myocardial infarction within 35 days of any planned study procedures; Unstable angina; Uncontrolled arrhythmia causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise; Recurrent syncope; Active endocarditis; Acute myocarditis or pericarditis; Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis; Uncontrolled heart failure; Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction within 3 months of any planned study procedures Thrombosis of lower extremities; Suspected dissecting aneurysm; Uncontrolled asthma; Pulmonary edema; Respiratory failure; Acute noncardiopulmonary disorders that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated by exercise (i.e., infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis); Presence of any other concurrent, actively treated malignancy History of any other malignancy treated within the past 3 years (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) Presence of metastatic disease Room air desaturation at rest ≤ 85% Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate Any other condition or intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the participant a poor candidate for the trial</criteria>
