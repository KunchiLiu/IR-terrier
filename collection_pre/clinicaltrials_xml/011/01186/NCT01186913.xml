	<brief_summary>People with Primary Immune Deficiency (PID) may develop severe, life-threatening infections as a result of inherited defects in the genes that normally instruct blood-forming cells to develop and to fight infections. PID diseases include Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID), leaky SCID, Omenn syndrome (OS), and Reticular Dysgenesis (RD). PIDs may be treated by transplantation of bone marrow stem cells from a healthy person or, in some cases, by enzyme replacement or by gene therapy. Patients with SCID were among the first to receive bone marrow stem cell (also called hematopoietic cells) transplantation (HCT) more than 40 years ago, and HCT is the standard treatment today for this group of diseases. Since PID diseases are rare, there are not enough patients at any single center to determine the full range of causes, natural history, or best methods of treatment. For this research study many PID centers across North America have organized into the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) to pool their experience and study PIDs together. The overall goal of this study is the prospective evaluation of children with SCID and related disorders who are treated under a variety of protocols at participating institutions. The study aims to identify variables contributing to the best outcomes for HCT.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stratum A, Classic SCID Patients who meet the following inclusion criteria and the intention is to treat with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are eligible for enrollment into Stratum A Absence or very low number (&lt; 300 / ul) of T cells, AND no or very low (&lt;10% of lower limit of normal) T cell function (as measured by response to phytohemagglutinin OR T cells of maternal origin present, but with &lt;10% of lower limit of normal T cell function (as measured by response to PHA) Stratum B, Leaky SCID, Omenn Syndrome, Reticular Dysgenesis Patients who meet the following criteria and the intention is to treat with HCT are eligible for enrollment into Stratum B Leaky SCID: &lt;1000 / ul T cell number at &lt; age 2 years; &lt; 800 / ul T cell number at age 2 through &lt; 4 years; &lt; 600 / ul at &gt; 4 years; and maternal lymphocytes not detected, AND either one or both of the following with ruleout of MHC Class I or II nonexpression by flow cytometry (or histology): 1. ≥ 10% and ≤ 30% of lower limit of normal T cell function (as measured by response to PHA), b) Absent proliferative responses to candida and tetanus toxoid antigens (post vaccination or exposure), with expression of HLA by flow/serology Omenn Syndrome: Generalized skin rash Maternal lymphocytes not detected Absent or low (&lt; 30% lower limit of normal) T cell proliferation to antigens &gt; 80% of CD4 T cells are CD45RO+ (&lt; 2 years of age) Reticular Dysgenesis: &lt; 300 / ul T cell number None or &lt; 10% lower limit of normal PHA proliferation Sensorineural deafness Severe neutropenia (&lt; 200 / uL and unresponsive to GCSF) and deficiency of marrow granulopoiesis unless there is known adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) pathogenic mutation(s) identified Stratum C, SCID with NonHCT Treatments Patients who meet the following criteria and the intention is to treat with PEGADA or gene transfer with autologous modified cells are eligible for enrollment into Stratum C: ADA Deficient SCID with intention to treat with PEGADA ADA Deficient SCID with intention to treat with gene transfer Xlinked SCID with intention to treat with gene transfer Patients who meet any one or more of the following exclusion criteria are disqualified from enrollment in Strata A, B, or C of the study: Presence of an HIV infection (by PCR) or other cause of secondary immunodeficiency. Presence of DiGeorge syndrome Most patients with other PIDs such as nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, ZAP70 deficiency, CD40 ligand deficiency, NEMO deficiency, XLP, cartilage hair hypoplasia or ataxia telangiectasia will not meet the inclusion criteria for Stratum A, B, or C above. However, a patient with one of the above may meet the inclusion criteria for Stratum B and if so will be included. MHC Class I and MHC Class II antigen deficiency are specifically excluded. Metabolic conditions that imitate SCID or related disorders such as folate transporter deficiency, severe zinc deficiency, transcobalamin deficiency</criteria>
