	<brief_summary>Long-term venous devices (e.g.Ports, tunneled catheters,...) may become infected. Sometimes it is very difficult to treat the infection and it is necessary to remove the device. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of instilled ethanol ("ethanol lock therapy") versus instilled antibiotics ("antibiotic lock therapy") to save long-term venous device when infected, preventing their removal.</brief_summary>
