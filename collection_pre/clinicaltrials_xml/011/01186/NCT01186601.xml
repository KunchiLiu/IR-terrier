	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted as an open label, single-dose, explorative study with patients with histologically proven cancer and, preferably, tumor positive lesions in previously performed nuclear medicine imaging examinations. The investigational drug will be given as a single administration in a dose of &lt;/= 0.1 mg BAY94-9392 (300 MBq, +/- 10%). The total duration of the study for each patient will be approximately 8 days.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males/females &gt;/= 18 years Patients with a diagnosis of primary prostate cancer (biopsy proven) and scheduled for radical prostatectomy or patients with prostate tumor recurrence (Patients with advanced tumor disease and a high likelihood to display lymph node metastasis are to be preferably included.) ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 02, determined within one week prior to treatment with BAY949392 Patient had an [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT for detection, or staging, or restaging, or therapy response assessment that still showed tumor mass with high certainty for a cancer such as melanoma, or colorectal cancer, or head &amp; neck cancer for which FDGPET/CT is used in clinical routine, and the primary cancer disease is histologically confirmed. In case of recurrent disease confirmation of the primary tumor is sufficient No clinically relevant deviations in renal function as determined by Cockcroft and Gault method using serum creatinine at screening. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease other than cancer or inflammation (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY949392, unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease) which could compromise participation in the study Known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation Previous treatment with BAY949392 in this study</criteria>
