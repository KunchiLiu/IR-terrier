	<brief_title>The Correlation of COX-2 Expression in Human Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes/Macrophages (PMNL/MP) and Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>we detect COX-2mRNA, COX-2 protein expression in inflammatory cells and PGE2 concentration in patients with abdominal surgery. The differences of COX-2 expression in PMNL are compared between peripheral blood and partial incision transudate to the same individual, and at the same time, the COX-2 expression differences in PMNL and macrophages, and PGE2 concentration in partial incision transudate also compared interindividually, to show the relevance between the difference and postoperative pain. In addition, the effects of Parecoxib Sodium on COX-2 expression of the amount in PMNL and macrophages are investigated during the development of postoperative inflammatory pain. Finally, we will clear the dose-effect relations among the expression of COX-2 in inflammatory cell, systemic and local inflammatory response and postoperative pain.</detailed_description>
