Methods: 165 adult patients, aged 20 to 60 yr, Patients were randomly allocated to one of 5 groups (33 patients per group): lidocaine 0.5 mg/kg(L) ,ephedrine 30microgram/kg (E30), ephedrine 70 microgram/kg(E70), lidocaine 0.5mg/kg -ephedrine 30 microgram/kg(LE) or 2ml saline (S) intravenously. After one minute propofol 2 mg/kg into a dorsal hand vein was injected. Face pain scale and verbal rating scale, arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before induction, just before intubation, and one minute after intubation</brief_summary>
