	<brief_summary>This is randomized-controlled trial to evaluate the difference of composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or Stroke between the dual antiplatelet therapy group and the aspirin monotherapy group after 1-year of drug-eluting stents implantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration of Clopidogrel Therapy After Drug-Eluting Stent (DES-LATE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is subsequent clinical trial of previously published pooled analysis of the REAL-LATE and the ZEST-LATE Trial, in which nonsignificant higher trend for increased rate of death (all-cause and cardiac), myocardial infarction, or stroke in the dual antiplatelet therapy group compared to the aspirin monotherapy group was noted.</detailed_description>
