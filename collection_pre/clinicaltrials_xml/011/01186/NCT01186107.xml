	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of coronary stenting with the Zotarolimus-Eluting stent compared to the Sirolimus-Eluting stent in the treatment of de novo coronary stenosis in patients with diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent vs Sirolimus-Eluting Stent for Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, two arms, single blind, randomized multi-center trial of 380 patients enrolled at 24 centers in Korea. Following angiography, diabetic patients with significant diameter stenosis &gt;50% by visual estimation have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and eligible for stenting without any exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: a) Endeavor Resolute stent vs. b) Cypher select. All patients will be followed for at least 1 year. Angiographic follow-up at 9-months is routinely recommended.</detailed_description>
