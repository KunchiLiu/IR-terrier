	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to directly compare the clinical outcomes of both the celecoxib and placebo groups following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The study will have short and long term goals. Validated outcome measures will aim to quantify pain control at 2 weeks after surgery, as well as knee function at 2 year follow-up. Groups will be compared using pain control scales, and functional knee outcome scores. The first null hypothesis tested by this study is that the celecoxib group experiences equal pain control compared with the placebo group. The second null hypothesis is that no knee function difference will be found between the celecoxib and placebo groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Any patient 18 years and over undergoing primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring grafts will be considered for this study. Patients will be excluded if they have bilateral ACL injuries, require revision ACL reconstruction, require meniscus repair, have multiple ligament injuries, gross osteoarthritis, significant clinical malalignment or if they cannot attend appropriate followup. Other exclusion criteria will include use of a regional block during the surgery, a diagnosis of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal ulceration, hepatic disease, renal disease, hypertension, hypersensitivity to Celecoxib, known allergictype reactions to sulfonamides, known allergies to ASA or other NSAIDS, inflammatory bowel disease or hyperkalemia</criteria>
