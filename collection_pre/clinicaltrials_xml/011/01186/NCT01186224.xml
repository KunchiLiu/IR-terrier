	<criteria>All of the following must be satisfied: Aged 18 or over Able to give informed written consent. Diagnosis of EITHER multiple myeloma or related plasma cell dyscrasia, OR any form of lymphoma or associated lymphoproliferative disease Autologous stem cell transplantation is planned as the next course of treatment. The patient has not previously undergone a mobilisation attempt for the current transplant. Patients who have received previous autologous transplants at least 2 years previously are eligible, as long as stem cell mobilisation has not been attempted for the current transplant. No serious concomitant illness (e.g. heart disease) that might preclude completion of the study. Creatinine clearance of at least 30 mls/min. Note that a dose reduction of plerixafor is required where the creatinine clearance is between 3050 mls/min; see section 3.3/5.1/5.3. Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing age. Unable to give informed written consent Pregnancy or lactating Creatinine clearance of less than 30 mls/min. Patients with clearances lower than this may still be able to receive plerixafor at reduced dosage following discussion with the trial coordinators, but are not eligible for entry into this trial. Any previous attempt at mobilisation for the current transplant. Patients with any form of leukaemia, INCLUDING PLASMA CELL LEUKAEMIA, are not eligible.</criteria>
