	<brief_summary>This was a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of micro-focused ultrasound when used in conjunction with 1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser versus 1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser alone for treatment of striae distensae(stretch marks). Each side of thigh (or abdomen) was randomized to receive 1550nm-fractionated laser treatment every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments on one side and the contralateral side received micro-focused ultrasound treatment and 1550nm-fractionated laser alternatively every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments with site-match control area of baseline striae on each side. The primary outcome measure by two dermatologists blindly compared the two areas of striae distensae on each side from live subjects using a questionnaire and quartile rating scale on the final follow-up visit. This study was a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures.</brief_summary>
