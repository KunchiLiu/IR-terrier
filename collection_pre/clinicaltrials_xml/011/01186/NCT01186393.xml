	<brief_title>STUDY: Effects of Potatoes in a Weight Loss Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will examine the effect of including potatoes as part of a calorie restricted diet designed to induce weight loss and improve glycemic control in overweight subjects. This is a randomized, treatment-controlled, 3-arm, parallel study. The 3 arms of the study will include dietary manipulation in the free-living setting to include potatoes/potato products frequently in the diet (5-7 days / week). Two diets will be energy-restricted (~ 500 kcal deficit /d) for weight loss and the control diet will be prescribed for weight maintenance. The two energy-restricted diets will include further manipulation, such that, one dietary plan will be a high glycemic index (GI) diet and the other a low glycemic index diet.</detailed_description>
