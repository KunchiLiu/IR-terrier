	<brief_summary>This research study is being conducted to learn about how health and genetic literacy (i.e., how well a person understands health and genetic information) affects a person's ability to understand genetic risk information for Type 2 diabetes and whether that person chooses to change their lifestyle and health behaviors to reduce their risk. The investigators also want to learn if the manner in which the genetic risk information is communicated affects the level of understanding and potential behavior changes. Participants will be tested for genetic risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and will received results either via a web-based computer program, or in-person from a genetic counselor.</brief_summary>
