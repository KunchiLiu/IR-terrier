	<brief_title>An Extension to Study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 Allowing for Continuation of Azacitidine Treatment in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the conclusion of study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 (NCT00071799), eligible participants could be enrolled in an optional extension phase in order to continue treatment with azacitidine until it became commercially available; the continued treatment was for ethical and safety reasons only and not to provide additional efficacy data. During the extension phase, participants were treated based on 28-day cycles and monitored for hematologic, nonhematologic, and renal toxicities. Recommended monitoring procedures included complete blood count with differential and platelets at least once each cycle prior to dosing and as needed, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate as clinically indicated, and additional tests or more frequent monitoring at the investigator's discretion based on the patient's clinical status. The azacitidine dose could be modified for toxicities. Laboratory data were not collected during the extension phase.</detailed_description>
