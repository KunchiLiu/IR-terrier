	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Simultaneous FMC-Alemtuzumab administration followed by Alemtuzumab maintenance therapy in patients with T-PLL is feasible, safe and efficient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Immunochemotherapy in Patients With T-Prolymphocytic Leukemia (T-PLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the median survival time of patients with T-PLL is less than 12 months, the treatment of T-PLL is a special challenge. The overall response rates with conventional chemotherapy or Deoxycoformycin were low (about 30% and 40%), with the monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab response rates of 50% to 70% were achieved, but the duration of the response was short. In the previous trial (T PLL 1), the efficacy of the FMC regimen (FMC = Fludarabine, Mitoxantrone and Cyclophosphamide) was tested, a preliminary analysis of 16 patients revealed a response rate of more than 60% after FMC-polychemotherapy and 83% after the subsequent administration of Alemtuzumab. The goal of the T-PLL2-protocol is to assess if the simultaneous administration of FMC-polychemotherapy and Alemtuzumab with a subsequent Alemtuzumab maintenance therapy is capable of improving the remission rate and the disease-free survival time in patients with T-PLL.</detailed_description>
