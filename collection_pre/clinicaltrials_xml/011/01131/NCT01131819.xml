	<brief_summary>Purpose: The investigators wish to determine if a rehabilitation program for subjects with new, trans-tibial amputations that has the balance portion of the program augmented by the use of the Nintendo Wii fit â„¢ balance board improves their performance. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that subjects will benefit from the use of the device and that this will manifest as an improvement on outcome measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of an Interactive Video Game as Part of a New Amputee Rehabilitation Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will be trained by the same specialist physiotherapist. Subjects will use the Wii Fit balance platform for a period of twenty minutes or greater per day (at the discretion of the specialist physiotherapist) during their standard rehabilitation program. These balance training exercises will be in addition to those already used in the standard rehabilitation program, but will not add to the total therapy session time. Activities on the device will be chosen by the therapist based on the subjects' current abilities and their phase of training. More complicated tasks will be given as the subject progresses. The therapist will intervene and provide instruction / correction if the subject is using unsafe technique or poor technique (postures, positioning strategies that would not be condoned in the regular training program). The device is a stable, level platform 5.5 cm from the floor. Subjects stand on the device and may use gait aids if indicated. Standard practice involves intensive training of the subject by the same specialist physiotherapist but without the use of the Wii Fit platform.</detailed_description>
