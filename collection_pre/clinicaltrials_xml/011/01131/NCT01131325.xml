	<criteria>Ph+ CMLCP within 12 months of diagnosis Imatinib 400 mg qd for up to 12 months Imatinib trough plasma concentration &lt;850 ng/mL Patient that have met response milestones including: 1. CHR and at least minor CyR (Ph+ ≤65%) at 3 months from diagnosis 2. At least pCyR at 6 months from diagnosis (Ph+ ≤35%) 3. CCyR at 12 months from diagnosis Prior documented failure events including: Loss of CHR or CCyR Less than CHR (stable disease or disease progression) at 3 months after diagnosis No CyR at 6 months after diagnosis Less than PCyR at 12 months after diagnosis Prior accelerated phase or blast phase CML Previously documented T315I mutation Previous treatment with any other tyrosine kinase inhibitor except for imatinib. Patients who had any other treatment for CML (transplant) except imatinib, hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide Impaired cardiac function (refer to Section 5.2 for details) Patients receiving therapy with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or medications that prolong the QT interval and cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug. Any other malignancy that is clinically significant or requires active intervention. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of study or who have not recovered from prior surgery. Treatment with other investigational agents within 30 days of Day 1.</criteria>
