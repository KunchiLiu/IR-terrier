	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Niuliva (Hepatitis B virus immune globulin) in the prophylaxis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection in patients submitted to liver transplantation due to HBV-induced liver disease by reaching and maintaining certain hepatitis B antibody (HBsAg) levels considered as protective during the first six and twelve months post-transplantation.</brief_summary>
