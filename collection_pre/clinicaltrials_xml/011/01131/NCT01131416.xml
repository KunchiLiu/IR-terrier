	<brief_summary>Following all abdominal surgery, paralytic ileus commonly develops. Surgeons have traditionally withheld postoperative oral intake until the return of bowel function to prevent related complications. Gum chewing can stimulates bowel movement and promotes the return of bowel function through the cephalic-vagal reflex and increased intestinal enzymes secretion. The objectives of this study are to examine effects of adding gum chewing to the conventional postoperative feeding regimen on the return of bowel function, its related complications, and patients' satisfaction.</brief_summary>
