	<brief_summary>The prevalence of obesity in young adults has been increasing, and excessive body weight have been linked to numerous chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many forms of cancer, and numerous musculoskeletal problems. This study will focus of the development and evaluation of interventions that may be appropriate for young adults (age 18-35 years) to improve weight loss outcomes following a 24 month intervention. The primary aim of this study is to examine whether an enhanced weight loss intervention (EWLI) that includes technology components results in improved weight loss in young adults (18-35 years of age) compared to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (SBWP) over a period of 24 months. Eligible participants will also be assessed for body composition, body fat distribution, fitness, physical activity, dietary intake, and behavioral/psychosocial measures that may be predictive of behavior change. Assessments will occur at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Subjects will participate in a 24 month behavioral weight loss program that includes a reduction in energy intake and moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise (progressively increasing from 100 to 300 minutes per week). The technologies added to EWLI are text messaging, a wearable device that provides feedback on physical activity, and access to a website to monitor dietary behaviors.</brief_summary>
