	<brief_summary>The investigators intend to check whether the efficacy of a TBE-vaccine is substantially deteriorated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated with drugs which suppress the immune system. The investigators aim to detect a difference of at least 10 % compared to healthy individuals (historical controls) in protection when analysed with serology. If the investigators detect a difference, the investigators will continue to explore whether protection can be achieved by additional doses</brief_summary>
