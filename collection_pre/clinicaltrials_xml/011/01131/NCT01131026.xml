	<brief_summary>Today, although the triple treatment with clarithromycin accepted as the primary treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection eradication is well tolerated, the eradication has been decreased to 65 %. However, the eradication resulting from TRIOL treatment with levofloxacin is expected to be 75 % or higher. If the target results can be reached, it will be concluded that TRIOL treatment with levofloxacin will be an alternative to the triple treatment with clarithromycin as the primary treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Levofloxacin Triple Therapy for Helicobacter Pylori Eradication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary end point in this study is appointed to be "Helicobacter pylori infection eradication with TRIOL treatment" and the secondary end point as "safety". The study involves the investigation of the efficacy and safety of the triple treatment consisting of 500 mg levofloxacin, 1000 mg amoxicillin and 30 mg lansoprazole on Helicobacter pylori eradication in 60 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.</detailed_description>
