	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized as inflammatory airway with not fully reversible airflow limitation.Combination treatment with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β2 agonists (LABA)attains an improved control of symptoms and lung function, that are superior to those associated with either drug alone. However, the treatment efficacy between high and medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination of LABA is still unknown. The aim of the current study is to investigate the treatment efficacy with high and medium dose of fluticasone in combination with salmeterol in COPD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Treatment Efficacy With HD/MD Flu Plus Sal in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and the use of health care resources worldwide. It is characterized by chronic progressive symptoms, airflow obstruction, and impaired health status, which is worse in those who have frequent, acute episodes of symptom exacerbation. Treatment for COPD is focused on minimizing risk factors, improving symptoms, and preventing exacerbations. Pulmonary inflammation is the key factor in COPD. Inhaled long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) improve airflow obstruction, control of symptoms, and health status in patients with COPD over 3 to 4 months. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are currently the most popular anti-inflammatory medications for use in symptomatic patients with COPD. Previous large scaled randomized control study discovered long-term use of ICS didn't modified annual decline of lung function in COPD patients, but may reduce the frequency of exacerbations, especially when combined with an LABA. Combination treatment with ICS and LABA has been widely used for patients with COPD and attains an improved control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that of treatment with either component alone. Combined ICS/LABA will result in better treatment effects that are superior to those associated with either drug alone. However, the treatment efficacy between high and medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid in combination of LABA is still unknown. The aim of the current study is to investigate the treatment efficacy with high and medium dose of fluticasone in combination with salmeterol in COPD patients.</detailed_description>
