	<brief_summary>A single center Pilot Clinical Registry Study of the" Acute Procedural" Safety and Efficacy of Stereotaxis PowerAssert(TM)RF Coronary Total Occlusion System assisted Angioplasty in the Treatment of Refractory Coronary Total Occlusions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PowerAssert Radio-Frequency (RF) Guidewire Coronary In-Stent Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determine the safety and efficacy of the Stereotaxis PowerAssertâ„¢ 18 RF Wire System: Primary - of recanalizing (crossing) coronary total occlusions within a stent. Secondary - facilitated angioplasty at hospital discharge represented by - Event free survival - Anginal status, and - Target vessel patency - minimal luminal diameter (MLD).</detailed_description>
