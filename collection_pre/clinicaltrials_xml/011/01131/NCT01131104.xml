	<brief_summary>Study H6D-MC-LVHQ is an observational, non-interventional, multi-center, prospective, case-crossover study to evaluate the possible association between the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and the risk of acute nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in males. Subjects with newly diagnosed NAION will be asked via a structured questionnaire about their use of PDE5 inhibitors and other risk factors prior to the onset of their vision loss.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult male subjects, at least 18 years of age, who are willing to participate in the study Patients who experienced abrupt visual loss in one eye (defined as typically less than a 1day period or visual loss noted upon awakening) and presented for an initial visit within 45 days of onset of NAION symptoms to an ophthalmologist that resulted in a diagnosis of Suspected NAION by the investigator Previous history of NAION Previous history of arteritis (anywhere in the body) or clinical or diagnostic testing evidence of temporal arteritis History of glaucoma in either one or both eyes History of multiple sclerosis or diagnostic testing evidence of optic neuritis Have dementia or other reasons for memory impairment in the opinion of the investigator Have participated in other nonobservational studies within 3 months of NAION onset</criteria>
