	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at how well Ferric Carboxymaltose, an intravenous iron therapy (iron that is infused directly into your body through a vein), compares with ferrous sulphate capsules taken by mouth in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM) Versus Oral Iron for Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, 2-arm study to assess the efficacy and safety of FCM compared to oral iron in pregnant women with IDA. During the screening period (Days -10 to 0 before randomisation), subjects will be selected based on eligibility criteria. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will undergo baseline assessments at baseline (Day 0) prior to the first dose of study medication. Subjects will be randomised to receive either intravenous (IV) iron (FCM, 1,000-1,500 mg) or oral iron (ferrous sulphate, 100 mg iron twice a day; total dose 200 mg/day). The treatment period will begin with the infusion of FCM or the intake of oral iron on Day 0. All subjects will return for assessment of efficacy and safety at Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and at delivery (or whichever comes first).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant women aged ≥18, gestational week ≥20, ≤33 at baseline visit with normal antenatal screening test results. Iron deficiency anaemia defined as Hb concentration ≥8 g/dl and ≤10.4 g/dL and serum ferritin ≤20 mcg/L at screening. Demonstrated the ability to understand the requirements of the study, abide by the study restrictions, and agree to return for the required assessments. Patients (or their representative) must provide written informed consent for their participation in the study. Blood transfusion, erythropoietin treatment, parenteral iron or oral iron treatment (1 month prior to screening) or anticipated need for a blood transfusion during the study. Anaemia not caused by iron deficiency (e.g., aplastic, megaloblastic or haemolytic anaemia) or related to acute or ongoing, haemoglobinopathies, rheumatic and other chronic diseases, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, bone marrow diseases, enzyme defects and drug induced anaemia. Acute or chronic infection, clinically relevant active inflammatory disease (Creactive protein &gt;10 mg/dl or outside reference range), any acute infection at screening. Preeclampsia. Multiple pregnancy. Evidence on any significant abnormalities on anomaly ultrasound. Haemochromatosis or other iron storage disorders. Folate deficiency (Sfolate &lt;4.5 nmol/L) at screening. Vitamin B12 deficiency (Scobalamin &lt;145 pmol/L) at screening. Serious medical condition, uncontrolled systemic disease or any other medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, prohibits the patient from entering or potentially completing the study. Known chronic renal failure (defined as creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min calculated by CockcroftGault or modification of diet in renal disease formula). Severe cardiovascular diseases. Known human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. Inability to fully comprehend and/or perform study procedures in the Investigator's opinion History of endocrine disorders Ongoing significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders or dementia Recent significant bleeding/surgery (within the 3 months prior to screening). Chronic/acute hepatic disorder or elevating of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) over 2 times above the upper normal limit at screening. Participation in any other interventional study since estimated conception and throughout study participation. Known hypersensitivity to FCM or other IV iron preparations.</criteria>
