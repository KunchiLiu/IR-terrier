	<criteria>1. Provide written, informed consent prior to all trialrelated procedures 2. Male or female patients aged between 18 and 64 years, inclusive. 3. Able to produce sputum for mycobacterium culture or able to obtain sputum produced through Induction. 4. At least three sputum mycobacterium cultures positive for MTB with invitro resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin during the previous 270 days (9 months) despite treatment with first and second line antiTB drugs, including one positive culture within the previous 60 days from the time of sputum collection, prior to date of screening initiation (defined as the date the ICF is signed and screening begins). 5. Sputum mycobacterial culture positive for MTB with invitro susceptibility to at least one antiTB Medication within the previous 60 days prior to the date of screening initiation. 6. Patient judged by the investigator to have potential for clinical benefit from OPC67683 exposure. 7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (for example, two of the following precautions: tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, oral contraceptives, contraceptive implant,combined hormonal patch, combined injectable contraceptive or depotmedroxyprogesterone acetate) throughout the participation in the trial and for 22 weeks after last dose (to cover duration of ovulation). 8. Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception (double barrier) throughout the participation in the trial and for 30 weeks after last dose (to cover duration of spermatogenesis. 1. A history of allergy to any nitroimidazoles or nitroimidazole derivatives at any time. 2. Use of the medications in Section 4.1 including: use of amiodarone at any time during the previous 12 months, use of other antiarrhythmics for the previous 30 days, as well as use of certain antidepressants, Antihistamines, any macrolides, for the previous 14 days. 3. Any current serious concomitant conditions or renal impairment characterized by serum creatinine levels ≥265 μmol/L or hepatic impairment characterized by ALT and/or aspartate transferase (AST)levels 3 times the upper limit of the laboratory reference range. 4. Current clinically relevant changes in the Screening ECG such as any atrioventricular (AV) block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec (in both male and female patients), or of the QTcF interval over 450 msec in male patients and over 470 msec in female patients. 5. Current clinically relevant cardiovascular disorder such as heart failure, coronary heart disease,uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, arrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia or status after myocardial infarction. 6. For patients with HIV infection, CD4 cell count &lt; 350/mm3 or on treatment with antiretroviral medication for HIV infection. 7. Karnofsky score &lt; 50%. 8.
