	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 and cediranib maleate together in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 and cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cediranib maleate also may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gamma-Secretase Inhibitor RO4929097 and Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (equivalent to the recommended phase II dose), and safety profile of RO4929097 (gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097) in combination with cediranib (cediranib maleate) in patients with advanced malignancies. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for RO4929097 when administered alone and for RO492907 and cediranib in combination, in order to evaluate for interactive effects in PK (if any) between these two agents. II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of RO492907 when administered alone and in combination, with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need further exploration and validation in future trials. III. To assess for preliminary antitumor efficacy of this drug combination, especially in breast cancer, malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, high grade glioma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 (days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17 22-24, 29-31, and 36-38 of course 1) and cediranib maleate PO QD on days 1-21 (days 22-42 course 1 only). Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Doseescalation cohorts: Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; expansion cohort: patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed breast cancer, malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, high grade glioma, nonsmallcell lung cancer, or ovarian cancer Patients must have measurable or nonmeasurable disease; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; measurable disease is not required to participate in this trial No limitation on prior therapy; however, there must be at least a 4 week interval between initiation of study treatment and any prior radiotherapy or systemic therapy, 6 weeks if the last regimen included carmustine (BCNU) or mitomycin C; exceptions may be made however, for low dose, nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy for symptomatic palliation; please contact the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) Phase I Consortium Central Office coordinator or the Principal Investigator if any questions arise about interpretation of this criterion Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;

women of childbearing potential can either be abstinent or use two forms of contraception for the duration of study participation and for at least 12 months posttreatment; men must use condoms when sexually active with women for the duration of study participation and at least 12 months posttreatment;
