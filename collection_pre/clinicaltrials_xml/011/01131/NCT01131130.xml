Participants must be myopic and require lens correction from 0.75 D to 4.75D in each eye. Participants who have worn gas permeable (GP) contact lenses within the last 30 days or who have worn polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses within the last three months. Participants with any systemic disease affecting ocular health. Participants using any systemic or topical medications that will, in the Investigator's opinion, affect ocular physiology or lens performance. Participants with an active ocular disease or are using any ocular medication. Participants who have had any corneal surgery (eg, refractive surgery). Participants who are allergic to any component in the study care products.</criteria>
