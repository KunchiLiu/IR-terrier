	<brief_title>Intraocular Pharmacokinetics of Erythropoietin After Single Intravitreal Injection in Human</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreal injections of erythropoietin for off-label use have been shown to be beneficial in eyes with diabetic macular edema.However, the pharmacokinetic profile of erythropoietin after intravitreal injection in humans has not yet been determined clearly. The purpose of this study was to determine the intraocular pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin after a single intravitreal injection in a prospective investigation.</detailed_description>
