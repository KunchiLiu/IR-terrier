	<brief_title>ACP for Local Application in Ankle Arthrodesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is understood that an elevated concentration of platelets in the mix of the arthrodesis construct applied intra-operatively to the bony surface, has osteo-generating and enhanced wound healing properties. With that knowledge there is a clinical need and enthusiasm for the application of concentrated platelets, which release a large quantity of growth factors to encourage recovery in non healing injuries or surgical sites. This study represents an effort to more clearly define the true clinical outcomes with or without biologic enhancement, and fulfills a need for fortifying evidence concerning the efficacy of ACP in live human bone healing-- based on radiographic and CT scans.</detailed_description>
