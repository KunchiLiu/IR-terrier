	<brief_summary>In preclinical studies, 5-fluorouracil, one of the active metabolites of S-1, showed synergistic effect to sorafenib in human colon carcinoma cell lines. Therefore, sorafenib combined with S-1 might be more effective treatment for patients with advanced HCC than sorafenib monotherapy. The investigators propose to conduct a phase I study to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of S-1 in combination with fixed dose of sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC</brief_summary>
