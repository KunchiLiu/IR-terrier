	<brief_summary>Objective: the objective of this study in china is to clarify, whether the overall survival is different between previously untreated stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations receiving first-line erlotinib plus second-line docetaxel/cisplatin and those receiving first-line docetaxel/cisplatin plus second-line erlotinib .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female patients aged over 18 years Histologically proven lung adenocarcinoma clinical stage IIIB/IV ECOG performance status 02 Had no prior anticancer agent, radiation or surgical therapy for lung adenocarcinoma At least one measurable lesion (according to RECIST) Provision of written informed consent Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks History of malignant disease. Evidence of clinically active interstitial lung diseases (patients with chronic, stable, radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded) Expected life expectancy less than 2 months As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≥ 2.5 x ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases (or &gt;5 x in presence of liver metastases) Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study Pregnancy or breastfeeding women (women of child¬bearing potential). Women of childbearing potential must practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy.</criteria>
