	<brief_summary>Women found to have early stage breast cancer will have their cancer surgically removed followed by radiation treatment to the entire breast, five times per week for several weeks. The radiation treatment prevents the cancer from growing back but creates skin burns. Several studies have showed that it is nor necessary treating the whole breast. The investigators team has pioneered a new therapy realizing the permanent implantation of tiny radioactive seeds into the surgical cavity in a single one hour procedure under light anesthesia. Patients live a normal life while receiving the radiation treatment. The results of a first clinical trial on 67 patients shows that the treatment is well tolerate and efficient. The purpose of the study is to offer the treatment in several places and to increase the cohort of patient to 420 to capture rare complications if any.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Registry Study of Permanent Breast Seed Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For early stage breast cancer, accelerated partial breast irradiation is an alternative treatment option to whole breast irradiation after breast conserving surgery. Our group has previously reported results of a Phase I/II study of permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) using palladium-103 seeds as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy for well selected breast cancer patients. The procedure is realised in a single session under light sedation and local freezing. After a median FU of 54 months no patients has recurred on a cohort of 67 patients, and acute of delayed side effect compared favourably to external beam radiotherapy. Yet this study was a single centre study and the sample size did not allow evaluating appropriately the risk of serious adverse events (SAE). The current study propose evaluating SAE on a multicentre and larger cohort of 420 patients.</detailed_description>
