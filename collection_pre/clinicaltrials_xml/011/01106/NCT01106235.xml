	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocytes to kill melanoma cells. Treating lymphocytes with interleukin-21 in the laboratory may help the lymphocytes kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body. Giving therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together with cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together with cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin in treating patients with metastatic melanoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Autologous Lymphocytes, Cyclophosphamide, and Aldesleukin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and toxicity of adoptively transferred interleukin (IL)-21 modulated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) targeting a melanoma associated antigen in patients following cyclophosphamide conditioning. II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred IL-21 modulated CTL and factors contributing to immunopotentiation in patients receiving IL-21 modulated CTL following cyclophosphamide conditioning. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptively transferred IL-21 modulated CD8+ antigen-specific CTL following cyclophosphamide conditioning and post-infusion IL-2. OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2 followed by an infusion of IL-21 modulated, melanoma antigen recognized by T cell (MART)-1 specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes over 30-60 minutes on day 0. Beginning within 24 hours of T-cell infusion, patients receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 8-10 weeks.</detailed_description>
