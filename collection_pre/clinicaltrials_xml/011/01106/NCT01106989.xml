	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Heated Lidocaine/Tetracaine Patch in Patients With Pain Associated With Myofascial Trigger Points</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the usefulness of a heated lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg topical patch for the treatment of pain associated with myofascial trigger points. The study will consist of a 2-week, open-label treatment period followed by a 2 week follow-up period conducted at a single study site. Eligible patients must have a clinical diagnosis of pain (minimum 1-month duration) associated with up to 3 identifiable myofascial trigger points. A number of efficacy variables will be employed to evaluate their utility for assessing painful responses in this population.</detailed_description>
