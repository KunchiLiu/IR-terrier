	<brief_summary>XIENCE V USA is a prospective, multi-center, multi-cohort postapproval study. The objectives of this study are - To evaluate XIENCE V EECSS continued safety and effectiveness during commercial use in real world settings, and - To support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) initiative. This initiative is designed to evaluate the composite of all death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke (MACCE) and the survival of patients that are free from Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) and that have been treated with drug eluting stents (DES) and extended dual antiplatelet therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>XIENCE V® USA Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind AV-DAPT study cohort is designed to collect data to support the FDA DAPT initiative. The protocol for AV-DAPT cohort is designed according to the HCRI-DAPT (NCT00977938) study protocol, Study IDE # G080186. A total 8040 patients (5034 in initial enrollment phase and additional ~3000 patients in the second enrollment phase) enrolled in the XIENCE V USA (NCT00676520) had completed Phase I and were evaluated at 1 year. These patients were transferred to the following cohorts in Phase II and followed-up for 1-5 years: The long-term follow-up cohort of phase II (NCT01120379) consisted of 5020 patients from the first enrollment phase who were not transferred to the HCRI- DAPT study and remained in the study beyond 1 year. Patients from the additional 3000 treated with the XIENCE V EECSS who are free from events (death, MI, repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, ST, or major bleeding - "severe" or "moderate" by GUSTO classification) in the first year after the index procedure, and are compliant with DAPT will be identified as prospective patients for the AV-DAPT cohort. A total of 870 Patients who are considered as part of the AV-DAPT cohort will continue with Aspirin therapy and will be randomized at 12 months post index procedure to 18 months of either active treatment with thienopyridines or placebo. Clinical follow-up will occur at 15, 24, 30 and 33 months. These patients will be followed by Abbott Vascular. The remaining patients from the additional 3000 patients who did not participate in AV-DAPT cohort will be followed for the first year only. A study completion form will be filled out and the patients will not be followed beyond their 1 year visit. The participants enrolled in this study will be followed by Abbott Vascular but their data will not be independently analyzed; they will only be analyzed as part of the DAPT study (NCT00977938) which is sufficiently powered for the study outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are enrolled into the XIENCE V USA Study Phase I The patient agrees to participate in this study by signing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form. Alternatively, the patient's legally authorized representative agrees to the patient's participation in this study and signs the informed consent form. The inability to obtain an informed consent is an exclusion criterion. Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for randomization in the study: Patient is "12 Month Clear": "12Month Clear" patients are free from death, MI, stroke, repeat coronary revascularization, major bleeding "severe" or "moderate" by GUSTO classification, and ST 12 months after stent implantation. Staged PCI is allowed (same stent type as index); repeat PCI and periprocedural myocardial infarction occurring with the index procedure or repeat procedure within the first 6 weeks will not be considered exclusionary events for the definition of "12 Month Clear". Patient is "DAPT Compliant": During the open label portion of this study (time 012 months), a patient is considered compliant with the thienopyridine therapy for the purposes of eligibility if they take between 80% and 120% of the prescribed drug in a given period without an interruption of therapy longer than 14 days. This information will be ascertained via data collected at the patient interviews at 6 and 12 months postprocedure. Compliance at both time points is required to be considered "clear". Patient completes 1 year visit within ± 30 days window. Patients will be excluded from randomization if any of the following criteria are met: Pregnant women. Switched thienopyridine type or dose within 6 months prior to randomization. Note: Thienopyridine switching during the open label portion of this study is discouraged. PCI or cardiac surgery between 6 weeks post index procedure and randomization. Planned surgery necessitating discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy within the 21 months following randomization. Current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 3 years. Patients on warfarin or similar anticoagulant therapy.</criteria>
