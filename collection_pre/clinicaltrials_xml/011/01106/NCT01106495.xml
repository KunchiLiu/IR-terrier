	<brief_summary>Shear stress maybe the most crucial local factor affecting atherogenesis. The present study investigated the effect of exposure to increased shear stress promoted by Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) on the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and the underlying inflammation- related molecular mechanisms</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) on Subclinical Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemic subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis will be randomized into two groups: standard treatment group and standard treatment plus EECP intervention group. The results of ultrasound examination and markers of inflammations will be compared.</detailed_description>
