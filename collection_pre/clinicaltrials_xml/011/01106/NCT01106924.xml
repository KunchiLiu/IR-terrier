	<brief_summary>Probiotics administration is associated with health benefits on gut barrier integrity and immunological functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, probiotics consumption was proposed to reduce fat mass and body weight in rodents (Lee HY. et al. 2006; Hamad EM. et al. 2009) as well as abdominal fat in human (Kadooka Y, 2010). The mechanisms explaining the effects of probiotics in weight control are not well understood. The primary objective of the clinical trial is to investigate whether a consumption of a probiotic formula when compared to an intake of a placebo, is associated with a greater reduction of body weight.</brief_summary>
