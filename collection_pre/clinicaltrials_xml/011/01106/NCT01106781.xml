	<brief_summary>This is a descriptive observational study. The primary objective is to explore the EGFR gene mutation status in early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after complete resection. The patients should be histological confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung, have received complete resection and tested for EGFR mutation in regular medical practice.</brief_summary>
