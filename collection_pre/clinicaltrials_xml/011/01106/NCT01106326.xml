	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to implement directly observed therapy with preventive asthma medications through a partnership with the school nurse (with input and direction from the primary care provider) to assure that the teen receives guideline based preventive medications, and provide a motivational interviewing intervention to help the teen transition to independence with their medical treatment plan. We hypothesize that this community-based pilot intervention will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school personnel, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). We anticipate that enhancing preventive healthcare for urban teens with asthma through partnerships with schools will yield improved health, prevention of suffering, decreased absenteeism from school, and reduced healthcare costs. This new method of preventive care delivery could be sustained within the school nursing system, and could be implemented in schools nationwide. Further, it could be applied to other chronic illnesses affecting disadvantaged populations.</brief_summary>
