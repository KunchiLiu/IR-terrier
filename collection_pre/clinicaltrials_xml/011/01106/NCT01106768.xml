Finally, it has recently been described as the sleep disordered breathing was not uncommon in disorder attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, whether snoring and/or apnea. But it is now accepted that some features of facial morphology favoring pharyngeal congestion occur in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (hyperdivergent typology with increased anterior facial height and decreased posterior facial height, becoming the facial retrognathia, pharyngeal congestion, elongation and thickening of the soft palate, low position of the hyoid bone). A cephalometric analysis of craniofacial architecture and relationships with the soft tissue surrounding skeletal structures will detect if any of these specific characteristics that could promote sleep disordered breathing are found in disorder attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder prevalence with a particular.</brief_summary>
