	<brief_summary>The Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (CoBRA) trial was a milestone in the development of the present treatment paradigm for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study introduced the principle of fast remission induction by means of a combination of standard Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and a step down bridge therapy with high dose glucocorticoids in early Rheumatoid Arthritis. The purpose of the present study is to compare different combinations of traditional DMARDs and glucocorticoids, based on the original CoBRA protocol, for treatment of early Rheumatoid Arthritis. Besides the efficacy and effectiveness of these strategies, patient centered outcomes and potential implementation problems of such treatment strategies are evaluated.</brief_summary>
