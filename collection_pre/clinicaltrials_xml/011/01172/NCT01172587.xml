	<brief_summary>As they move from preadolescence to adolescence and adulthood, children need nurturing and supportive environments to realize their potential. Unfortunately, many children reside in destructive families that often result in negative short and long-term outcomes. As well-chronicled in the scientific and lay press, an all-too-common example involves parental substance abuse. Indeed, children living with a parent who abuses substances often have significant emotional, behavioral, and social problems. It has long been recognized that interventions are needed to address the clinical needs of these youth and to help prevent the development of problems that may emerge in early adulthood. To date, the majority of treatments have focused on either treating the children individually, or in the context of family therapy. Although directly involving these youth in treatment may be ideal, the majority of custodial parents who enter treatment for substance abuse are very reluctant to allow their children to engage in individual or family therapy. Thus, interventions for substance-abusing parents that do not directly involve children, but serve to improve the family environment as a whole, may have the greatest potential for reaching the most children and thereby positively influencing their overall adjustment and well-being. From this vantage, a promising approach is Behavioral Couples Therapy [BCT] for alcoholism and drug abuse, a comprehensive psychosocial intervention for substance abuse that focuses both on reducing addiction severity, improving couple adjustment, reducing interparental conflict and intimate partner violence (IPV), and improving the family environment and psychological functioning. In a series of preliminary studies, the PI found that children whose substance-abusing fathers and nonsubstance-abusing mothers participated in BCT displayed higher psychosocial adjustment at posttreatment and during an extended follow-up than youth whose substance-abusing fathers participated in individual-based treatment (IBT) or whose parents participated in a couples-based attention control treatment. These findings indicate that BCT may extend beyond the couple to their children and may provide an entry point into the family system from which to improve the adjustment of these youth. The present study is the next important step for this line of research. First, the present study is a far more developed examination of the potential effects of BCT on multiple dimensions of youth functioning, taken from multiple perspectives. Second, we do not know "how" BCT works. The positive effects of BCT on parents (reduced addition severity, improved dyadic adjustment, reduced partner violence, improved parenting, and improved parental psychological adjustment) may have positive "trickle down" effects on youth; however, we have not undertaken an empirical examination of these potential mechanisms of action. If we can understand how it works, we will be able to use that information to refine BCT to enhance the mechanisms that benefit youth. Thus, the present study will examine possible curative mechanisms. Third, we have a very limited understanding for "whom" it works. Thus, we will examine whether BCT may operate differently for children of different stages of development. If we can understand this moderating effect, we may be able to develop and refine BCT to meet the needs of families with children of different ages. To address these issues, the present study will examine how BCT is associated with changes in the emotional and behavioral adjustment, beliefs, and behaviors, including serious problem behaviors, of youth ages 5 to 18 (as rated by mothers, fathers, and the children themselves). We will also focus on potential mechanisms of action that are positively influenced by BCT.</brief_summary>

If we can understand this moderating effect, we may be able to develop and refine BCT to meet the needs of families with children of different ages. To address these issues, the present study will compare the emotional and behavioral adjustment, beliefs, and behaviors, including serious problem behaviors, of youth ages 5 to 18 (as rated by mothers, fathers, and the children themselves) whose mothers or fathers take part in BCT to an Intent-to-Treat group. We will focus on potential mechanisms of action that are positively influenced by BCT. We intend to use the information collected from the proposed investigation to refine and modify BCT to enhance its positive effects on children. This process of (a) examining multiple dimensions of functioning and (b) evaluating theoretically and empirically identified mediators and moderators to inform intervention development and refinement has been used successfully for over a decade with BCT, resulting in empirically informed BCT variants for alcoholic patients, drug-abusing patients, patients who engage in domestic violence, female substance-abusing patients, and so on. Thus, this project provides the next critical step for BCT refinement and interventions for couples entering BCT who have custodial children, the latter of whom we may only be able to help by helping their parents.</detailed_description>
