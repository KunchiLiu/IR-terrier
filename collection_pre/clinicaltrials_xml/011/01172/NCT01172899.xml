	<brief_summary>Rationale: In the Western world overweight and obesity is an increasing problem both in adults and in children. In youth, it is associated with early death and a number of co-morbidities including metabolic and endocrine changes, increased inflammatory status, cardiovascular abnormalities, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and impaired quality of life. The standard treatment for morbid obesity in children is by combined life style interventions. However, the medium and long term effects of dietetic interventions, behaviour therapy and medication is relatively poor. In adults bariatric surgery shows good results with up to 30% weight reduction in 3 years. The preliminary results in youth are similar, but surgery in this age group is relatively uncommon. In the Netherlands surgery in this age group is only allowed in clinical trials, until the benefits and risks have been established. (National Health Authorities) Objective: To determine if surgery gives a superior weight and body mass index (BMI) reduction than combined life style interventions in adolescents with morbid obesity and to assess its effect on obesity associated co-morbidity. Study design: Prospective randomised interventional study. Study population: Morbidly obese children, aged 14 - 16 years, with sex and age adjusted BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or &gt;35 kg/m2 with co-morbidity. Intervention: Bariatric surgery by laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) or combined life style interventions Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoints: weight loss, loss of excess weight, loss of excess BMI. Secondary endpoints: Body composition, pubertal development, metabolic and endocrine changes, inflammatory status, cardiovascular abnormalities, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, brain development, quality of life, and behaviour changes. The potential complications of surgery are monitored.</brief_summary>
