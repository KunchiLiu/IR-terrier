	<brief_title>Ziprasidone in Bipolar Disorder With Comorbid Lifetime Panic or Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of ziprasidone compared to placebo in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and current diagnosis at least moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 50 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will be randomized to ziprasidone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. No concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn lorazepam during the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, prn zolpidem and zaleplon for the management of insomnia and benztropine for the management of EPS. Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.</detailed_description>

Subjects who are receiving treatment with an antimanic or mood stabilizing medication (lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, or an antipsychotic), and in the investigators' judgment, require ongoing treatment with that medication.

Subjects who are allergic to or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to ziprasidone. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Subjects who have received an experimental drug or used an experimental device within 30 days. Subjects who have a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) fulfilling one of the following criteria: Unstable DM defined as enrollment glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) &gt;8.5% Admitted to hospital for treatment of DM or DM related illness within the past 12 weeks Not under physician care for DM Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not indicated that the patient's DM is controlled Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not approved the patient's participation in the study Has not been on the same dose of oral hypoglycemic drug(s) and/or diet for the 4 weeks before randomization.
