	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease that usually affects the aging population. It is an important public health problem, due to its association with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures leading to increased morbidity. Vertebral fractures are accompanied by kyphosis, reduced pulmonary function, loss of height, and are often associated with elevated pain while they may also lead to subsequent vertebral fractures. Osteoporotic individuals exhibit kyphosis in the erect standing position, which, in turn, is compensated by the deformation of other parts of the body. Improvement of postural alignment may lead to less stress on the spine, facilitate posture and proper body mechanics and may improve balance. The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of Motor Control Exercise on pain, postural alignment and spinal curvatures in women with osteoporotic vertebral fracture against the results of a control group that received the basic therapies for osteoporosis.</detailed_description>
