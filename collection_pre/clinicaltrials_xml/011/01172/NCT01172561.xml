	<detailed_description>The overall goal of Project 1 is to increase early detection of cervical cancer by increasing the proportion of Appalachian women, age 18 and older, who receive Pap smears at appropriate intervals and return for follow-up care when necessary. The project was implemented in Appalachian Ohio, a mainly rural and underserved area with a population comprised of 1.5 million adults, aged 18 and older, and used community-based participatory research (CBPR) and community relationships already established in the area by Center investigators.</detailed_description>
