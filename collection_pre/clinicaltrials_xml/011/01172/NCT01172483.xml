	<brief_summary>Summary: (Objectives and methodology of the project) AIM: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of Community physiotherapy intervention on chronic diseases (heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, back pain, mechanical neck pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis lower limbs, neurological and cancer survivors) and a group of healthy patients cardiovascular risk factors. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, prospective study. SUBJECTS OF STUDY: Patients with chronic disease go to the Local Sports Torremolinos Center INTERVENTION: Establishment of a control group that give you some advice education care (brief advice) and a group common experimental multimodal program of 12 weeks therapeutic exercise with health education (brief advice). It will follow up complete with ratings pre and post intervention to both groups and follow up at 6 and 12 months for long-term effect through specific questionnaires for each subgroup chronic disease and pain score (visual scale analog), quality of life (EuroQol-5D) and state health general (Short-Form 12, SF-12) VARIABLES: The intervention physical therapy Community. Result: Specific questionnaires for each subgroup, pain (Visual analogue scale), quality of life (EuroQoL) and general health status (SF-12). DATA ANALYSIS: descriptive statistics, measuring central tendency and dispersion of the variables study. Inferential statistics will be made between intervention of key variables and outcome (Chi square, Student t, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, by type and normal variables). Likewise, establish measures of effect size in main outcome variables, by reduction relative risk, absolute risk and odds ratio with their respective confidence intervals.</brief_summary>
