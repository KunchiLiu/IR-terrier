	<detailed_description>Overweight and obesity disproportionately impact economically disadvantaged and minority women. Overweight and obese women ages 25 to 50 are recruited from Census tracts with 25% or more residents living below poverty-level income. A skills-based intervention was designed with input from women in these communities gathered via focus groups and from a community advisory board. The intervention activities and strategies take into consideration the social and economic challenges of women with limited income, competing demands on their time and cultural beliefs about food preferences and body image.</detailed_description>
