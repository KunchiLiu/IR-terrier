	<brief_summary>A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) also meet criteria for a co-occurring substance use disorder, such as alcohol abuse or dependence; however, research examining this sub-group of patients with BN is limited. Understanding characteristics common to both eating and alcohol use disorders may enhance understanding of the mechanisms that could contribute to the co-occurrence and perpetuation of these disorders. Individuals with BN and alcohol use disorders appear to share some behavioral traits, and therefore, the primary aim of the current study is to compare patients with BN with and without an alcohol use disorder and normal controls on measures assessing an individual's mood and ability to perform certain tasks. Participants will be asked to complete computer-administered and paper-and-pencil assessments and two laboratory test meals on separate days. By probing the underpinnings of BN and alcohol use disorders, the investigators can determine whether these disorders have a shared diathesis, which will lay an essential foundation for future research to examine biological and genetic correlates of these disorders. Finally, as little is known about the treatment of patients with BN and a co-occurring alcohol use disorder, an exploratory aim of the current study is evaluate the suitability and efficacy of a 20-session cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) addressing both bulimic symptoms and alcohol use.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) also meet criteria for a co-occurring substance use disorder, such as alcohol abuse or dependence; however, research examining this sub-group of patients with BN is limited. Understanding characteristics common to both eating and alcohol use disorders may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that could contribute to the co-occurrence and perpetuation of these disorders. The primary aim of the current study is to compare patients with BN with and without an alcohol use disorder and normal controls on computer-administered and paper-and-pencil assessments and in two laboratory test meals (a binge meal and a normal meal) on separate days. Participants will also complete self-report and interview measures of eating disorder symptoms and alcohol consumption. By probing the underpinnings of BN and alcohol use disorders, we can determine whether these disorders have a shared diathesis, which will lay an essential foundation for future research to examine biological and genetic correlates of these disorders. Finally, as little is known about the treatment of patients with BN and a co occurring alcohol use disorder, an exploratory aim of the current study is to evaluate the suitability and efficacy of a 20-session cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) addressing both bulimic symptoms and alcohol use.</detailed_description>
