	<criteria>1. Adults, male and female, 18 to 65 years of age 2. Active, mild to moderate UP, with disease activity not to exceed 15 cm beyond the anal verge: the upper disease boundary will be confirmed by flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy performed within 14 days of the Baseline Visit 3. Newly diagnosed or newly relapsed UP, where newly relapsed UP is defined as UP that has relapsed within less than and equal to 6 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit 4. A Disease Activity Index (DAI) score greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10 at the Baseline Visit; the DAI must include a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore of less than or equal to 2, a rectal bleeding subscore of greater than or equal to 1 and a mucosal appearance subscore of greater than or equal to 1 5. Histological confirmation of UP with a Histological Disease Activity Score &gt; or equal to 1 for the biopsy taken from the most severe area of disease during the flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy performed within 14 days of the Baseline Visit 6. For female patients of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at the Baseline Visit; all female patients will be considered of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal for at least one year or have been surgically sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) 7. Female patients of childbearing potential must be practicing one of the following methods of birth control and must agree to continue with regimen throughout the study: hormonal methods such as oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives for a minimum of one full cycle (based on the patient's usual menstrual cycle period) before investigational product administration; total abstinence from sexual intercourse (since the last menses before investigational product administration); intrauterine device; double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream); Male patients must also agree to use acceptable methods of birth control with their female partners, and this may include use of a male condom plus spermicide. 8.

Known history of allergic reaction or clinically significant intolerance to aspirin or salicylate derivatives (including mesalamine) or nonactive ingredients of the investigational product 2. Onset of UP relapse &gt;6 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit for patients experiencing a relapse of their UP (i.e., patients who are not newly diagnosed) 3. Severe UP as defined by a DAI score of greater than or equal to 11 or a PGA subscore of 3 4. Histological Disease Activity Score &gt; or equal to 1 for the biopsy taken from the normal tissue above the disease margin during the flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy performed within 14 days of the Baseline Visit 5. UP with disease involvement greater than 15 cm beyond the anal verge as confirmed on flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy 6. Prior unsuccessful treatment of active UP or active ulcerative colitis with rectally administered mesalamine preparations of any strength 7. Any prior treatment of UP or ulcerative colitis with any oral 5aminosalicylic acid product if used at &gt;2 g/day, regardless of treatment outcome 8. Use of local, rectally administered therapies for UP or ulcerative colitis (e.g., suppositories or enemas containing mesalamine, etc.) within 30 days of the Baseline Visit 9. Use of any of the following medications: Biological therapies (e.g., infliximab) within 90 days of the Baseline Visit Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating (e.g., azathioprine) medications within 90 days of the Baseline Visit Oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or rectally administered corticosteroids within 30 days of the Baseline Visit; the use of intranasal and/or inhaled corticosteroids is permitted Oral 5aminosalicylic acid products within 7 days of the Baseline Visit, if used at &amp; less than or equal to 2 g/day Oral, intravenous, or intramuscular antibiotics within 7 days of the Baseline Visit NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) within 7 days of the Baseline Visit; lowdose aspirin (less than or equal to 325 mg/day) taken for cardioprotective reasons is permitted Antidiarrheals, antispasmodics, and iron therapy within 7 days of the Baseline Visit Transdermal nicotine products within 7 days of the Baseline Visit 10. A change in regimen (i.e., dosage or frequency of use) of permitted medications within 30 days of the Baseline Visit, or any plans to change the regimen during the course of this study 11. Use or treatment with an investigational drug, therapy, or device within 30 days of the Baseline Visit 12. A planned change in tobacco usage (e.g., smoking, oral tobacco) during the study 13. Female patients who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or who are breastfeeding 14. Diseases interfering with the DAI assessment, including but not limited to, hemorrhoids and anal fissures 15. History of Crohn Disease, short bowel syndrome, or bowel surgery (except appendectomy), or active peptic ulcer 16. A positive stool culture for enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Vibrio, E. coli O157/H7), detection of Clostridium difficile toxin through immunoassay, or enteric parasites and their ova (including Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba histolytica) on routine microscopy at the Screening Visit 17. Significant impairment of renal or hepatic function, as defined by any of the following: Creatinine &gt;1.5 x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 x ULN Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST) &gt;2.5 x ULN 18. Serologic positivity for the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), or Treponema pallidum (the causative agent of syphilis) 19.
