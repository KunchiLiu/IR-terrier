	<brief_title>A Randomized Study to Assess the Loss of HbsAg After a 48-week Treatment Period With Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2a in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to provide a therapeutical alternative to the use of an extended or undeterminated duration of treatment with prolonged nucleoside (s)/nucleotide (s)analog (s). The duration of administration is not consensual, and in most cases followed by a virological relapse, so that, the prolonged use could lead to the occurrence of viral resistance and mutations. It is therefore expected that treatment with pegylated interferon for 48 weeks in patients with undetectable HBV DNA by analog(s) may increase and promotes the loss of HbsAg and then promotes HbsAg seroconversion. In the absence of cirrhosis, the loss of HbsAg at 6 months would allow the end of treatment</detailed_description>
