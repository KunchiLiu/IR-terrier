	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi center, randomized, single blinded study designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Biosensors BioFreedom Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Delivery System at multiple time points compared to the Taxus Liberte DES in the treatment of single de novo native coronary artery lesions ranging in diameter from ≥2.5 mm to ≤3.0 mm and ≤ 14 mm in length.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BioFreedom FIM Clinical Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subject is &gt;18 years of age. The subject is an acceptable candidate for PTCA, stenting, and emergent CABG. Patients with multiple lesions as long as the last lesion to be treated fits the Inclusion criteria of the target lesion. The subject must have clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a positive functional study. The study stent target vessel must be a native coronary artery with a stenosis of &gt;50% and &lt;100%. The study stent target vessel reference diameter must be &gt;2.5 mm and ≤ 3.0 mm.(Measurements may be made by careful visual estimate or online quantitative coronary angiography.) The study stent target lesion is a de novo lesion that has not been previously stented. The study stent target lesion must be ≤ 14 mm in length thus allowing for adequate lesion coverage with a single stent. The subject is male or, if female, is either not of childbearing potential or has had a negative pregnancy test within seven (7) days prior to the procedure. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of the clinical site. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all required postprocedure followup visits. Multiple lesions to be treated in the same target vessel. Patients who require more than one BioFreedom stent except that an additional BioFreedom stent may be implanted in the target lesion for geographic miss or bailout A documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% assessed within 6 months prior to procedure by echocardiography, during a previous angiography or as measured during preprocedure angiography. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, bivalirudin, ticlopidine and, clopidogrel, stainless steel, Biolimus A9, Paclitaxel or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated. A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt;700,000 cells/mm³, or a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm³. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended treatment (defined as: Q wave or nonQ wave infarction having CK enzymes &gt; 2 times the upper laboratory normal with the presence of a CKMB elevated above the institutions upper limit of normal). A previous coronary interventional procedure was performed either a.) within 24 hours prior to the procedure or b.) within 12 months prior to the procedure for any lesion in the target vessel. The subject requires planned interventional treatment of any lesion in either the target vessel within 12 months or in any nontarget vessel within 30 days postprocedure. The target and nontarget lesion require treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent placement (such as, but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, etc.). The target vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus or is excessively (2 bends &gt; 90º to reach the target lesion) tortuous. The target lesion has any of the following characteristics: 1. Lesion location is aortoostial, left main coronary artery, or within 5 mm of the origin of the LAD, LCX, or RCA. 2. Is at a &gt;45º bend in the vessel. 3. Is moderately to severely calcified (visible by fluoro). Stenting of the target or nontarget lesion would "jail" or cover a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter or occur at the ostium of the sidebranch. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6 months or permanent neurologic deficit. History of upper GI bleeding within the prior 6 months. The subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 18 months. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints. [Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials.] Any contraindications as mentioned in the TaxusTM LiberteTM Instructions for Use (IFU).</criteria>
