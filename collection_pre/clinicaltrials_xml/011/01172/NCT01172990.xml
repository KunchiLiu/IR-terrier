	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients presenting with symptoms (onset of symptoms ≤ 12 hours) of a suspected acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or MI without persistent ST elevation) characterised as follows Clinical history consistent with ongoing ischaemic chest pain and/or symptoms AND &gt;1mm ST depression AND/OR ≥2mm T wave inversion in at least two adjacent ECG leads Pathological T wave inversion in leads 1+4 suggesting 'LAD Syndrome' Or Ischaemic ST depression/T wave inversion not fulfilling the above criteria that is felt in the opinion of the attending physician to represent an acute coronary syndrome. AND Written informed consent Main exclusion criteria 1. ≤ 18 years of age 2. Previous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting surgery 3. ST elevation myocardial infarction 4. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) 5. ST depression seen in patients during paced mode only 6. Heart rate ≥ 150bpm 7. Cardiogenic shock or other catastrophic state 8. If in the opinion of the physician the patient is not suitable for revascularisation due to comorbidity 9. Patient participating in another clinical trial such that randomisation to DANCE would result in deviation from the protocol stipulations of either trial.</criteria>
