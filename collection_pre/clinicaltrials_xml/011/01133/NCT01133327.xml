	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to get outcomes data for the Adapt Monorail Carotid System used in conjunction with the FilterWire Embolic protection system for treatment of patients that suffer from carotid artery stenosis and that cannot have surgery due to high risk factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adapt Monorail Carotid Stent System: A Postmarket Clinical Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Predominant mechanism responsible for stroke is embolism from proximal rupture of atherosclerotic plaque and thrombus. 25-30% of stroke deaths related to the carotid stenosis. The primary therapy for carotid occlusive disease is the surgical removal of this atherosclerotic plaque from inside the artery. Another treatment option for subjects with significant surgical risk factors has been found: the carotid artery stenting is a non-surgical procedure which unblocks narrowing of the carotid artery lumen by inserting a small metal tube (stent) to keep the plaque against the wall of the artery to improve blood flow.</detailed_description>
