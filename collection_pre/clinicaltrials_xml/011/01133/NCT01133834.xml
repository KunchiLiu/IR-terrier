	<brief_summary>Objectives: Meningococcal disease (MD) is a complex catastrophic phenomenon that can converge rapidly to irreversible septic shock, myocardial dysfunction, and profound coagulopathy. During meningococcal sepsis and meningitis, a myriad of cells release cytokines within the intravascular environment and subarachnoid space. Cytokines are key molecular messengers that play key roles in orchestrating and mediating the metabolic, endocrine and coagulation responses to meningococcal infection. The aim of the present study is to determine the profile of different cytokines in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during MD, as well as relate the level of these cytokines to severity of MD. Design: Prospective, nonrandomized study. Setting: Tertiary referral intensive care unit. Patients: Children and adults admitted with a clinical diagnosis of MD. Interventions: Blood and cerebrospinal fluid will sample from children and adults with MD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meningococcal disease (MD) is a complex catastrophic phenomenon that can converge rapidly to irreversible septic shock, myocardial dysfunction, and profound coagulopathy. During meningococcal sepsis and meningitis, a myriad of cells release cytokines within the intravascular environment and subarachnoid space. Cytokines are key molecular messengers that play key roles in orchestrating and mediating the metabolic, endocrine and coagulation responses to meningococcal infection. The aim of the present study is to determine the profile of different cytokines in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during MD: IL -4; IL-6; IL-10 and interferon alfa, as well as relate the level of these cytokines to severity of MD, evaluated by occurrence of shock, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and survival. Design: Prospective, nonrandomized study. Setting: Tertiary referral intensive care unit. Patients: Children and adults admitted with a clinical diagnosis of MD. Interventions: Blood and cerebrospinal fluid will sample from children and adults with MD. Measurements and Main Results: in process Conclusions: in process</detailed_description>
