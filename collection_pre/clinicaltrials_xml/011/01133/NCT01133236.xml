	<brief_title>Fluid and Salt Restriction in Decompensated Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart Failure Clinics, healthcare structures formed by a multidisciplinary team specialized in the disease, have demonstrated to provide benefits to patients through multiple non-pharmacological interventions, among them fluid and salt restriction. Sodium restriction has a class I recommendation and evidence level C, that is, general agreement that the intervention is beneficial, useful and effective, evidenced by consensus, expert opinion, small studies, retrospective studies or registries. Sodium restriction becomes even more controversial when we consider evidence suggesting the benefit of non-salt restriction or treatments with salt administration, in the form of hypertonic solutions. In face of literature evidence not showing conclusive results about the benefit of sodium and fluid restriction, we designed this study in order to assess the effect of fluid and salt restriction on the management of patients hospitalized due to decompensated heart failure</detailed_description>
