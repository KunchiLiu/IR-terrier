	<brief_summary>The anomalous origin of right coronary artery (RCA) is a rare coronary anomaly. Recently, the detection of this anomaly has been more frequent as the use of cardiac multidetector computed tomography has become more popular. It can cause myocardial ischemia, syncope and sudden cardiac death. Surgical repair is generally recommended for symptomatic patients. However, there is controversy concerning the proper evaluation and treatment strategy for patients without documented myocardial ischemia. The stenotic lesion of anomalous origin of RCA will be assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR).</brief_summary>
