	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the use of lenalidomide and prednisone in people with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for people with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions. As it is being used in this study it is considered an investigational use. An "investigational use" is a use that is being tested and is not approved by the FDA. Prednisone is approved by the FDA to treat numerous conditions. In addition, prednisone is approved by the FDA to treat Low or Intermediate-1 IPSS Risk, non-del (5q) MDS. "Study drug" refers to the combination of lenalidomide and prednisone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>10 mg/day of lenalidomide will be taken by mouth on days 1 - 28 of cycles 1-6. Dosing will be in the morning at approximately the same time each day. Planned prednisone dose: - 30 mg by mouth daily, days 1-28 of cycle 1 - 20 mg by mouth daily, days 1-28 of cycle 2 - 10 mg by mouth daily, days 1-28 of cycle 3 - 10 mg by mouth every other day on days 1-28 of cycles 4-6 - 5 mg by mouth every other day for responders beyond cycle 6</detailed_description>

Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from signing the informed consent form. Pregnant or breast feeding. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide). Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
