	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To obtain prospective, clinical practice-based data on how symptomatic VTE is managed with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin in Canadian outpatient settings. Secondary Objective: - To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with symptomatic VTE including characteristics of VTE, VTE risk factors and bleeding risk factors. - To assess the frequency of patient characteristics that would necessitate adjustment in the dose or duration of enoxaparin therapy, e.g. high BMI, impaired creatinine clearance, advanced age, cancer-associated VTE. - To assess the degree of adherence in clinical practice to Consensus Guidelines (ACCP/American College of chest Physician 2008) for the management of acute VTE, vis a vis: - Appropriate dosing of enoxaparin - Recommended duration of initial LMWH therapy - Adequate overlap of LMWH with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) - Recommended duration of longterm VKA - Frequency of use of LMWH monotherapy to treat cancer-related VTE - To access safety outcomes (including bleeding and recurrent VTE) - To describe the utilization of resources due to bleeding and recurrent VTE during the treatment period.</brief_summary>
