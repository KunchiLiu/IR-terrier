	<brief_title>Cetuximab and Lenalidomide in Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study specific FcRIIIa polymorphisms and their correlation with clinical outcome in subjects treated with cetuximab and lenalidomide. There is evidence with cetuximab in CRC, trastuzumab in breast cancer and rituximab with follicular lymphoma, that FcRIIIa polymorphisms correlate with clinical response to antibody therapy and clinical outcome. It is our hypothesis that patients with SCCHN will have clinical outcomes to cetuximab and lenalidomide that correlate with patient FcRIIIa genotype. Secondary: To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of cetuximab and lenalidomide given to treat subjects with SCCHN. To study FcRIIIa polymorphisms and the correlation with the ability of NK cells to mediate ADCC against SCCHN. It is our hypothesis that NK cells from patients with advanced SCCHN can mediate ADCC against SCCHN cell lines in the presence of cetuximab and lenalidomide and that the efficiency of ADCC correlates with FcRIIIa polymorphisms. To evaluate the ability of NK cells to induce ADCC expression of specific activation markers on the NK cell surface. It is our hypothesis that NK cells that induce ADCC will express specific activation markers that are predictive of efficiency of ADCC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form. 2. Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form. 3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 4. Recurrent or metastatic squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the head and neck that is not amenable to curative therapy. Patients who are candidates for local or locoregional therapy should not be deprived of proven beneficial palliative therapies. 5. All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy, EGFR inhibitors, and surgery, must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment in this study. 6. ECOG performance status of 01 at study entry. 7. Laboratory test results within these ranges: Absolute neutrophil count to ≥ 1000/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50ml/min by CockcroftGault estimation Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 3 x ULN or &lt; 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present. 8. Disease free of prior malignancies for &lt; 3 years with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "insitu" of the cervix or breast. Patients with malignancies diagnosed less than 3 years prior to study entry are eligible if the first cancer was no greater than stage I and did not recur. Patients with malignancies diagnosed less than 3 years prior to study entry must have the diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck confirmed pathologically. 9. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®. 10. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours of prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. See Appendix: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods. 11. Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin). 12. Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded), with minimum lesion size ≥ 2 cm on conventional measurement techniques or ≥ 1 cm on spiral computed tomography (CT) scan. Lesions that can be measured clinically must be at least 1 cm in greatest dimension by caliper measurement. 1. Primary head and neck carcinomas of the salivary gland, skin, or thyroid regardless of pathology 2. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. 3. Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide). 4. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 5. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline. 6. Prior therapy with lenalidomide for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 7. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide. 8. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. 9. Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments. 10. Known positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis, type B or C.</criteria>
