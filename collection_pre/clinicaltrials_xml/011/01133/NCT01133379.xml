	<brief_summary>This study is for people with sensitive teeth and involves going to the dentist for 6 visits over 8 weeks. During the first 2 weeks, everyone will just brush their teeth two times a day with the fluoride toothpaste provided. Then you will be assigned to a mouthwash group if you qualify to continue in the study. Two groups will get mouthwash with a certain amount of an experimental ingredient and one group will get a mouthwash with no experimental ingredients. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups. For the next 6 weeks, you will rinse with your assigned mouthwash after brushing. A dentist will look at your mouth, teeth, tongue and gums and check for sensitive teeth. The investigators will see if the mouthwash helps to reduce tooth sensitivity during the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tooth Sensitivity Relief by Two Mouthrinses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, single center, controlled clinical trial design. Approximately 200 generally healthy adults meeting the necessary inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled so that 180 subjects (60 per treatment group) would reasonably be expected to complete the study. Subjects will have their oral soft/hard tissues assessed and will be evaluated for sensitivity levels at Screening (visit 1), Baseline (visit 2), Week 1, Week 2, Week 4 &amp; Week 6. During the first two weeks of the study, subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth for one minute in their usual manner, twice daily using the provided standard fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will return for the Baseline exam and, upon qualification with entry criteria, will be assigned to one of three treatment groups. Qualified subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth two times daily for one minute in their usual manner using the provided standard fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will be instructed to rinse twice daily, after brushing, with the provided mouthrinse for 60 seconds using 10 ml or 20 ml (depending on the treatment group), for 6 consecutive weeks.</detailed_description>

Volunteers with chronic medical debilitating disease associated with constant or intermittent episodes of daily pain. Longterm daily use (â‰¥ 7 consecutive days) of analgesics and any other drugs that at the discretion of the Investigator would compromise the response of the hypersensitivity assessments. Volunteers who have been using any homecare bleaching, whitening products or have had a professional bleaching treatment within 4 weeks of the Screening visit.
