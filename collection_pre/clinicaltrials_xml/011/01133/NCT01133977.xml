	<brief_summary>Primary: - Phase Ib: To define the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenvatinib administered in combination with dacarbazine. - Phase II: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib administered in combination with dacarbazine, compared with dacarbazine alone. Secondary: -Phase II: To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of lenvatinib administered in combination with dacarbazine, compared with dacarbazine alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E7080 (Lenvatinib) in Combination With Dacarbazine Versus Dacarbazine Alone as First Line Therapy in Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); dose limiting toxicities; performance of physical examinations; concomitant medications and procedures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologicallyconfirmed metastatic melanoma (Stage IV, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)). 2. No prior cytokine, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy for Stage IV melanoma. 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. 4. Life expectancy greater than or equal to 3 months. 5. At least 1 site of measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. 6. Adequate hematologic, renal, liver, and coagulation system function as defined by laboratory values performed within 21 days prior to initiation of dosing. 7. Blood pressure must be wellcontrolled (less than or equal to 140/90 mmHg at screening) with or without antihypertensive medication. Patients must have no history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 1. Known central nervous system (CNS) lesions, except for asymptomatic, nonprogressive, treated brain metastases. Treatment for brain metastases must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 and may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery [RS; Gamma Knife, linear accelerator (LINAC), or equivalent] or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Dexamethasone must be discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to Day 1. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded. 2. Lactate dehydrogenase greater than or equal to 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN). 3. Subjects with proteinuria greater than 1+ on urine dipstick testing will undergo 24hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with 24hour urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24 hours will be ineligible. 4. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or refusing double barrier contraception, oral contraceptives or avoidance of pregnancy measures. 5. Other active malignancy. 6. History of or known carcinomatous meningitis. 7. History of or known ocular melanoma. 8. Are currently receiving any other treatment for the tumor (including palliative radiotherapy) aside from control of symptoms. 9. Received treatment in another clinical study within the 30 days prior to commencing study treatment or patients who have not recovered from side effects of an investigational drug to grade less than or equal to 1, except for alopecia. 10. Received radiotherapy within the 30 days prior to commencing study treatment or have not recovered from side effects of all radiationrelated toxicities to grade less than or equal to 1, except for alopecia. 11. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, or have undergone a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within the 28 days prior to commencing study treatment. Minor surgery such as Portacath placement or skin biopsy is permitted if greater than or equal to 7 days have passed. 12. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. 13. Current use of anticoagulants such as Vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, or low molecular weight heparin.</criteria>
