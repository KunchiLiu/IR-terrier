	<brief_title>Ascending Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Evolocumab (AMG 145) in Adults With Hyperlipidemia on Stable Doses of a Statin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants receiving low-to-moderate-dose statins were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to receive subcutaneous placebo or evolocumab and enrolled sequentially into one of 5 dose-escalation cohorts: 1. Evolocumab 14 mg/placebo once weekly (QW) × 6 doses 2. Evolocumab 35 mg/placebo once weekly (QW) × 6 doses 3. Evolocumab 140 mg/placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) × 3 doses 4. Evolocumab 280 mg/placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) × 3 doses 5. Evolocumab 420 mg/placebo every 4 weeks (Q2W) × 2 doses. Participants receiving high-dose statins were randomized 1:3 to receive subcutaneous placebo or evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks × 3 doses (Cohort 6). Participants diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) were randomized 1:2 to receive subcutaneous placebo or evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks × 3 doses (Cohort 7).</detailed_description>
