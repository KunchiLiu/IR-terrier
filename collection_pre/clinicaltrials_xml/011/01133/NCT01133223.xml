	<brief_summary>Stroke prognosis is intimately related to reperfusion. Reperfusion in acute setting can be achieved with different strategies - varying from intravenous rtPA from mechanical thrombectomy. Recently, interventional approaches have been gaining attention and playing an increasing role in stroke care. However, no solid scientifical data is available to date. The investigators want do conduct a pilot trial to test if the use of the Penumbra™ System can improve clinical outcomes in a specific stroke setting.</brief_summary>
