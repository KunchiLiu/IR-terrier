	<brief_summary>Several novel imaging technologies are currently used for detection and differentiation of colonic polyps during colonoscopy, such as NBI (Olympus), FICE (Fujinon), and i-Scan (Pentax). Several previous studies have indicated that NBI without magnification can be useful for real-time differentiation of diminutive colonic neoplasias. To date, however, there are no studies comparing NBI with other imaging systems (FICE or i-Scan) for differentiation of diminutive colonic polyps. The study objectives are to compare the diagnostic efficacy of NBI with that of i-Scan in real-time prediction of diminutive colonic polyps. In this prospective pilot study, diminutive colonic polyps detected during colonoscopy will be observed with conventional colonoscopy, thereafter will be observed with new imaging systems. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of both NBI and i-Scan will be assessed by reference to histological results obtained by endoscopic biopsy or polypectomy.</brief_summary>
