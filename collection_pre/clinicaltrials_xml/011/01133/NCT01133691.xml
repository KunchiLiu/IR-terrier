	<brief_summary>- Background: Fasting is mandatory for safety of anesthesia in elective surgery and imaging but gives rise to discomfort, hunger and thirst especially in children. Internationally accepted fasting times are often prolonged because of organisational delay in operating theatre. - Hypothesis: Clear fluids can be ingested until an imaginary anesthesia induction time without enlarging the residual gastric contents compared to overnight fast. There is no difference between residual gastric contents after 4 hours of fasting after a light meal compare to 6 hours in healthy children. - Examination of gastric volume using magnetic resonance imaging after overnight fasting and subsequent scans after either clear fluid intake or intake of a standard breakfast are performed in children aged 6 - 12 years. Time course after fluid intake is followed with scans every half hour for 2 hours. In the breakfast group 4 versus 6 hours fasting time will be simulated, e. g. intake of clear fluid is allowed for 2 versus 4 hours after the meal. Volume of gastric contents will be compared with a standardized ultrasonographic view of the stomach.</brief_summary>
