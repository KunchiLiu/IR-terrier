	<brief_summary>The study will assess the effectiveness of Pioglitazone on cellular and clinical levels in terms of improvement of both skin and systemic manifestations of psoriasis. The investigators assume that pioglitazone (one of thiazolidinediones readily available in Egypt), can regulate keratinocytes' disordered proliferation observed in psoriasis, in addition to improving the insulin resistance in peripheral tissues observed in many psoriatic patients and causing metabolic syndrome. This will allow to give a safer therapy than the available ones for psoriasis and to treat the patient in a more global perspective.</brief_summary>
