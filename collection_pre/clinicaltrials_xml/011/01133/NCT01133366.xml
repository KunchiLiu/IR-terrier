	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess how blood clotting and thinning time is effected when a single dose of warfarin is given alone and when a single dose of warfarin is given with mipomersen; to assess the blood levels of a single dose of warfarin, a single dose of mipomersen, and a single dose of warfarin when given with mipomersen; and to assess the safety of mipomersen when given with or without warfarin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Effects of Multiple Doses of Mipomersen (200 mg SC) on the Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Single-dose Warfarin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single-sequence, 2-period, crossover study to determine the effect of multiple doses of mipomersen (200 mg SC given every other day for a total of 4 doses) on the PD and PK of warfarin and to evaluate the PK of mipomersen when administered alone and in combination with warfarin. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1 until discharge from the clinic on Day 18 and return for outpatient visits on Days 19, 20, and 78. All subjects will receive a single 25-mg oral dose of warfarin given alone on Day 1 (designated the reference treatment). All subjects will then receive 200-mg SC doses of mipomersen given every other day on Days 8, 10, 12, and 14 (total of 800 mg mipomersen) with a single 25-mg oral dose of warfarin also given on Day 14 (combination designated the test treatment).</detailed_description>
