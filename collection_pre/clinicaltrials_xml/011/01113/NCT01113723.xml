	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether tracheal intubation with the CMAC device decreases the time required for intubation as compared to intubation with the fiberoptic bronchoscope in patients with an unstable cervical spine. Both the CMAC device and the fiberoptic bronchoscope are currently commonly used in standard of care practices in the intubation of patients with cervical spine injury.</brief_summary>
