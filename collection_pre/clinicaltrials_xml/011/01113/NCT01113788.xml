	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a third hypothesis based on the anatomic observations made in pathological studies. The investigators hypothesize that the anatomic architecture determines the functional properties of the TV-IVC isthmus. As a result, â€¢ Muscular bundles are preferential routes of conduction through the TV-IVC isthmus. The isthmus acts like a series of discreet conduction routes rather than as a sheet of tissue. The muscular bundles form selective targets for ablation and therefore the entire anatomic line need not be ablated. This has direct implications for ablation of the isthmus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing atrial flutter ablation will have cartosound imaging done during procedure to determine if this will shorten ablation times.</detailed_description>
