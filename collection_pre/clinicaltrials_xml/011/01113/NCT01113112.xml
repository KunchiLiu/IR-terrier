	<brief_title>Biobehavioral-Cytokine Interactions in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer. Because of low rates of survival for the majority of ovarian cancer patients, identification of factors contributing to tumor progression is of paramount importance. Epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between biobehavioral factors such as life stress, depression, low social support and cancer progression. Direct links have been demonstrated between biobehavioral factors and cytokines supporting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that enhance tumor growth and progression. However, little is known regarding tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and interactions between TAM tumor cells in a way that favors tumor growth, but there is preliminary data indicating that ovarian cancer patients with higher levels of depressive symptoms and life stress have greater TAM production of matrix metalloproteinase-9, a key molecule promoting angiogenesis and tumor invasion. We also have preliminary data that ovarian cancer patients with high levels of depressive symptoms accompanied by low social support have greater tumor expression of a number of genes related to inflammation and tumor progression.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer; FIGO stage I to IV defined surgically at the completion of the initial abdominal surgery and with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation. Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified. However, the histologic features must be compatible with primary Mullerian epithelial adenocarcinoma. GOG performance status 03 Patients with a diagnosis of borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (formerly: tumors of low malignant potential" or recurrent invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy previously are excluded. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma are excluded. Nonepithelial ovarian cancers or metastases to the ovaries from organs are excluded. Previous cancer diagnosis except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin or history of lymphoma.
