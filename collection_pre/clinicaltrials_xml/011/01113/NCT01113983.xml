	<detailed_description>Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of THV-9300 for patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis attributed to calcification and degeneration of a valve leaflet and for whom undergoing a surgery safely would be difficult. Enrollment: 69 patients Transfemoral approach: 42 patients (No. of patients needed: 23) Transapical approach: 27 patients (No. of patients needed: 19) Follow-up: Subject data collection will include clinical information at baseline and during the index procedure. Subjects will undergo clinical follow-up at discharge, 30 days, 6 months and annually for 5 years. Clinical sites: Osaka University Hospital Kurashiki Central Hospital Sakakibara Heart Institute</detailed_description>
