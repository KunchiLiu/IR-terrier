	<brief_summary>Biomarkers representing distinct biological domains including neurohormonal, inflammatory, metabolic-nutritional, oxidative-nitrosative and myocardial injury, might alone or in combination provide prognostic information on mortality in heart failure patients with preserved or impaired systolic function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers for Prognosis of Ambulatory Chronic Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon enrollment in the study, Troponin I (cTn I), BNP, norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble receptor of interleukin 2 (sIL-2R), leptin, prealbumin, free malondialdehyde, 15-F2t-isoprostane and protein-bound nitrotyrosine were measured in stable ambulatory, non diabetic, elderly heart failure patients. Patients were followed up until death or study termination (31st January 2009).</detailed_description>
