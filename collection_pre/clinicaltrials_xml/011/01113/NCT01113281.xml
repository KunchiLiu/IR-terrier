	<brief_summary>Goal of VPM is the development of a recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin expressing BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated and efficacious vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) for residents in endemic areas and persons at risk in non-endemic areas. The new vaccine should be at least as potent as the current strain and should be safer than BCG (Kaufmann, 2007a; Grode et al., 2005). The vaccine is formulated as live lyophilised bacteria to be re-suspended before intradermal injection. The preceding clinical trial in 80 volunteers in Germany indicated immunogenicity and safety being sufficient for proceeding with the clinical development. Hence, the current study is commenced in South Africa, a country highly endemic for tuberculosis. 24 volunteers were randomly allocated to 4 groups each with 6 adult healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
