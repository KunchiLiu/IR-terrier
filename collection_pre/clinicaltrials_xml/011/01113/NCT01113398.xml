	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the response rate of AMG 102 and Avastin treatment in subjects with advanced malignant glioma. Secondary objectives are to estimate overall survival and 6-month progression-free survival rates in this population and to assess the safety of this combination in this population. Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma) with no more than 3 prior progressions. Subjects will receive Avastin and AMG 102 every two weeks. Avastin will be administered prior to AMG 102. Up to 36 adult subjects will take part in this study at Duke. In initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential Avastin-associated safety issues were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage. The most common side effect for AMG 102 have been nausea and fatigue.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of WHO grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma) with no more than 3 prior progressions. Age ≥ 18 years. Karnofsky ≥ 60%. An interval of at least 4 weeks between either prior tumor biopsy or prior major surgical procedure and study enrollment. Bidimensionally measurable disease as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl, ANC ≥1500 cells/µl, Platelets ≥125,000 cells/µl (without transfusion within 14 days before enrollment). Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl, bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal, and serum SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) &lt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal. For patients on corticosteroids, they must be on a stable dose for 1 week prior to entry, and the dose should not be escalated over entry dose level, if clinically possible. Signed informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board. No evidence of active CNS hemorrhage on the baseline MRI or CT scan. If sexually active, patients will take contraceptive measures for the duration of treatment as stated in the informed consent. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Baseline ECG with QTc &gt; 0.45 second Comedication that may interfere with study results; e.g. immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids. Thrombosis or vascular ischemic events within the last twelve months, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, or myocardial infarction. Active infection requiring IV antibiotics 7 days before enrollment. History of central nervous system bleeding as defined by stroke or intraocular bleed (including embolic stroke) within 6 months before enrollment. Evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage; except for subjects with stable grade 1 hemorrhage. Less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 consecutive scans or histopathologic confirmation. Treated previously with any cMet or HGF targeted therapy. Treated previously with VEGF or VEGFR therapies, including antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treated with thalidomide or tamoxifen within 1 week before enrollment unless the patient has recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Treated with immunotherapeutic agents, vaccines, or MAb therapy within 4 weeks before enrollment unless the patient has recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Treated with alkylating agents within 4 weeks before enrollment or if the patient has been treated with daily or metronomic chemotherapy unless the patient has recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Treated with chemotherapy (nonalkylating agents) within 2 weeks before enrollment unless the patient has recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Less than 4 weeks after surgical resection of the brain tumor or less than 2 weeks after stereotactic biopsy before enrollment unless the patient has recovered from acute side effects of such procedures except for neurological effects. Plans to receive surgery, radiation therapy or other elective surgeries during the course of the study. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months before enrollment) that could compromise participation in the study. Concurrent or prior (within 7 days of enrollment) anticoagulation therapy, except: Use of low dose coumadintype anticoagulants (≤ 2 mg PO QD) low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), e.g. Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) and unfractionated heparin for prophylaxis against central venous catheter thrombosis is allowed. Grade 2 or greater peripheral edema or effusion (pleural, pericardial, or ascites). Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedure. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study. AvastinSpecific Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study entry: Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 1, the day protocol therapy starts. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1 Significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) (within 6 months prior to Day 1). History of hemoptysis (≥ 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 28 days prior to Day 1 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to Day 1 Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer or untreated bone fracture Proteinuria as defined by ≥ +1 on urinalysis dipstick Known hypersensitivity to any component of Avastin Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactation.</criteria>
