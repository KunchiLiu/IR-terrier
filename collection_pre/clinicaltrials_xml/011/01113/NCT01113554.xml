	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Rehabilitation Program in Improving Quality of Life in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate accrual, retention, adherence, and participation of breast cancer survivors to a breast cancer rehabilitation program. II. To estimate the variability of weight, six-minute walk, quality of life and other psychosocial and physical measures in women participating in the BCRP. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess changes in the anthropometric, psychosocial, and physical outcomes over the six-month period of the BCRP. II. To document the types and the rates of adverse events associated with the BCRP. OUTLINE: Patients attend exercise therapy sessions over 1 hour 3 times a week for 6 months. Exercise therapy sessions are comprised of a 10 minute warm-up of light stretching and aerobic type exercise (walking, cycling), 30 minutes of endurance type exercise (cycle, walking), and 20 minutes of resistance training exercise.</detailed_description>
