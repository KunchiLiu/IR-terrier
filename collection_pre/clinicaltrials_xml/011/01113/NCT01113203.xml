	<brief_title>Chronic and Acute Effects of Resistance Exercise on Older Subjects' Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the chronic and acute effects of resistance training on blood pressure and its hemodynamic and neural determinators in elderly, 24 healthy normotensive older subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups: trained and control. The trained group was submitted a progressive high-intensity resistance training. Before and after 16 weeks, as well as, before and after the one training session, blood pressure (clinic and ambulatory), cardiac output (CO2 rebreathing), and autonomic modulation (spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variabilities) were measured</detailed_description>
