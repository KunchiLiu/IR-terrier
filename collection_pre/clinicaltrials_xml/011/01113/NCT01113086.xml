	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine whether repetitive sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the prefrontal cortex can enhance the cognitive, affective and motor functioning of those with Parkinson's Disease. In this study we will compare active tDCS with sham tDCS. Each subject will receive two consecutive weeks of stimulation (Monday through Friday). A battery of neuropsychological and affective tests will be administered throughout the duration of the study.</brief_summary>
