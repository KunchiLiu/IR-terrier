	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI)- Imaging compared to Transient Elastography (FibroScan) in differentiating liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Patients who are scheduled to have a liver biopsy will also undergo ARFI and FibroScan testing. The liver biopsy will be used as the reference method. The target sample size is 433.</brief_summary>
