	<brief_summary>Prospective, multicenter, randomized (two-arm 1:1), non-inferiority clinical evaluation comparing 2 regimes of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin + clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with Endeavor Zotarolimus eluting stent (ZES) to evaluate the impact of different regimes of DAPT on clinical outcomes in minimally selected patients from the "real-world" clinical practice receiving the Endeavor ZES for the treatment of coronary artery lesions. Patients undergoing percutaneous treatment with the Endeavor ZES will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 regimens of DAPT including oral clopidogrel 75mg/day for 3 months versus 12 months.</brief_summary>
