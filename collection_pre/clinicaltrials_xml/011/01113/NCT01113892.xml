	<brief_title>Study Comparing Synthetic Vascular Grafts in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Who Require Artery Bypass.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, two-arm, parallel group, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FUSIONâ„¢ Vascular Graft with Bioline (heparin) coating, compared with EXXCEL Soft ePTFE in a peripheral bypass setting, to support a claim of substantial equivalence.</detailed_description>
