	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II open label study being conducted to evaluate the overall safety and initial effectiveness of an investigational drug, Eltrombopag in patients who are 60 years of age and older and who have Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Eltrombopag is an investigational drug, which means it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in this type of disease. Approximately 35 people will be enrolled on this study at the University of Pennsylvania</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eltrombopag in Elderly Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives (Phase I Portion): 1). To determine the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in elderly subjects with AML 2). To determine the maximally tolerated initial starting dose of eltrombopag for elderly subjects with AML Primary Objectives (Phase II portion): 1). To better define the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in elderly patients with AML at the maximally tolerated starting dose Page 9 of 18 determined in Phase I portion of study. 2). To determine the incidence of peripheral platelet count improvement (using baseline and response parameters as defined below) for subjects with disease related thrombocytopenia. Secondary Objectives (Phase I and II): 1). To preliminarily determine the efficacy (using AML response criteria as defined below) of eltrombopag in elderly subjects with AML. 2). To perform ex-vivo analyses using subject AML samples and stock eltrombopag to 1) assess leukemic proliferative capacity and 2) investigate potential eltrombopag induced cytoxic mechanisms for leukemic cell death. 3). To perform pharmacodynamic assessments of drug activity in leukemic cells using subject samples collected at various time points before and during drug exposure. 4). To preliminarily correlate pharmacodynamic findings with clinical response.</detailed_description>
