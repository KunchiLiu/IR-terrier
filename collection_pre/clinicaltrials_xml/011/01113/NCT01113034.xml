	<brief_title>A Safety Trial of DAS181 (Fludase®) in Adult Subjects With Well-Controlled Asthma or Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety of a new study drug called DAS181 (Fludase®). This study is being done with NexBio, Inc., the company that makes DAS181 (Fludase®). DAS181 is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however the FDA has given permission to use DAS181 in human studies. To date, DAS181 has been given to about 81 healthy people and has been well tolerated with no reported serious adverse reactions. This is the first experimental study to test if it is safe to use this drug in people with well-controlled asthma or bronchiectasis. DAS181 is not being given to treat asthma or bronchiectasis, but to learn if it is safe to use in people with well-controlled asthma or bronchiectasis. DAS181 is being developed as a medication to prevent and treat infections due to common respiratory viruses like influenza (including the pandemic H1N1 strain), parainfluenza, and other viruses. New drugs to treat respiratory viruses are needed because some currently available drugs are not effective against some types or strains of viruses. Drugs that are effective against respiratory viruses are especially important for people with asthma or bronchiectasis because these lung conditions increase the risk of serious complications due to respiratory virus infections. Making sure the new drug is safe in people with asthma or bronchiectasis is important because people with these lung conditions may have different side effects from a drug than people who don't have asthma or bronchiectasis. We plan to enroll 24 volunteers into the study: 12 persons with well-controlled asthma and 12 persons with bronchiectasis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A male or female subject must be 18 to 65 years of age. 2. Except for underlying airway disease, subject must be in good health as determined by medical history, targeted physical examination based on medical history, and vital signs (that include temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry). 3. Subject must be able to verbalize understanding of the informed consent form, verbalize willingness to complete all study procedures, and provide written informed consent (sign the informed consent form). 4. Subject must be willing to commit to participating in both the initial and crossover stages of the study. 5. Dipstick analysis of subject's urine specimen must be negative or show only trace amounts of glucose, hemoglobin, and protein. A menstruating female who tests positive for urine hemoglobin may be retested. 6. Subject must have blood screening test results that are within normal limits (according to standards set within the Clinical Center) for the following tests: alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). 7. Subject must have hematologic screening tests that are within a specified range, including hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, white blood cell count 2500/mm3, and platelet count 125,000/mm3 (all &lt;grade 1 on DAIDS severity scale). 8. A female subject must be postmenopausal (1 year without menses), have been surgically sterilized, practice abstinence, or use an effective method of birth control that may include an intrauterine device, spermicide, barrier, and hormonal contraception. A female subject must also have a negative serum test for pregnancy during the Screening period, and a negative urine test for pregnancy on the first day of drug or placebo administration. Asthma Subjects: 1. Subject must have a clinically established diagnosis of asthma based upon a history of episodic symptoms of airway obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness (i.e., wheezing). 2. Subject must have a documented increase in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) 12% (and at least 200 mL) from baseline after inhaling a shortacting bronchodilator; or a PC20FEV1 response to methacholine (i.e., the concentration of methacholine that produces a 20% decrease in FEV1 from the postsaline value during the methacholine challenge) of 8 mg/mL. 3. At the time of study enrollment, subject's asthma has been wellcontrolled for at least the past 3 months, as defined by the following: 1. Daytime symptoms occur 2 days per week 2. Normal daily activity is not limited by asthma 3. Nocturnal symptoms/nighttime awakenings 2 times/month 4. FEV1 80% predicted 5. Use of shortacting betaagonist 2 days/week 6. Exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids occur 2 times/year 7. There has been no change in asthma medication dose or regimen within 3 months of study enrollment 8. Not currently taking oral corticosteroids Bronchiectasis Subjects: 1. Subject will be recruited from ongoing NIH natural history protocols (06I0217, 01I0202, and 09I0172) and/or the National Bronchiectasis Registry. 2. Subject must have a preestablished diagnosis of bronchiectasis based on chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings within 12 months of enrollment (no diagnostic CT scans will be performed during the Screening phase of this study). 3. Subject must not have overt allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cystic fibrosis, or primary ciliary dyskinesia. 4. Subject's bronchiectasis is stable as defined by the following: a. Less than 2 acute exacerbations in the preceding 12 months and none in the preceding 4 weeks, with acute exacerbation defined as persistent (&gt;24 hour) worsening of &gt;3 respiratory symptoms associated with bacterial infection including: i. Cough ii. Dyspnea iii. Hemoptysis iv. Increased sputum purulence or volume v. Chest pain b. No change in antimicrobial regimen for at least 3 months before enrollment c. FEV1 80% predicted d. Use of shortacting betaagonist 2 days/week for at least the past 3 months e. No baseline requirement for oxygen supplementation f. Ability to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturation of 90% during and after 6minute walk test g. Not currently taking oral corticosteroids 1. Subject has received any investigational drug or vaccine within 4 weeks prior to study drug dosing, or is planning to participate in another investigational drug or vaccine trial prior to completion of this study. 2. Subject is currently taking theophylline or oral corticosteroids. 3. Subject is allergic to milk or milk products. 4. Subject currently smokes tobacco or has smoked tobacco within 1 year prior to study enrollment. 5. Subject has a baseline requirement for oxygen supplementation. 6.

The subject tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). 8. The subject's resting blood pressure is outside normal limits (defined as: systolic 90140 mmHg; diastolic 5090 mm Hg). 9. The subject's heart rate is less than 45 or greater than 100 beats per minute at rest. 10. The subject weighs less than 45 kg. 11. The subject has a Body Mass Index of greater than 35 kg/m2. 12.

The subject has overt primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or cystic fibrosis. 16.
