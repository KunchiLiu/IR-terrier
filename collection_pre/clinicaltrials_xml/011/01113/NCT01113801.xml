	<brief_title>A Study in Participants With Diabetic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to determine if LY2382770, administered monthly for 1 year, is more effective than placebo at slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease in participants treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Participants with chronic kidney disease presumed due to diabetes Type 1 or Type 2 Participants with certain levels of kidney function serum creatinine (SCr) 1.3 to 3.3 mg/dl (115 to 291 micromol/L) inclusive for women and 1.5 to 3.5 mg/dl (132 to 309 micromol/L) inclusive for men, or an eGFR 20 to 60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² Participants with protein in the urine 24hour urine protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) greater than or equal to 800 mg/g (greater than or equal to 91 mg/mmol). Participants must be on a stable and acceptable dose of an ACE (angiotensinconverting enzyme) inhibitor or an ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker), or not able to tolerate these medications. Main Female participants who can become pregnant, are pregnant or breastfeeding Participants who have any of the following medical conditions (the site research staff will discuss these criteria and determine a patient's ability to participate) Chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases Chronic Kidney Disease from causes other than diabetes An organ transplant Too high a blood pressure Viral Hepatitis B or C liver infection, liver cirrhosis, or significant liver disease Recent gastrointestinal bleeding Acute kidney injury within the 3 months before screening Major surgery within 3 months before screening or plan to have it during the study period HIV infection the virus that causes AIDS Heart disease that is not considered stable Cancer that is too recent or other condition which poses too high a risk for developing cancer Required to take drugs that change the immune system</criteria>
