	<brief_summary>The incretin effect in patients with type two diabetes is reduced. The investigators have previously shown that it is possible to induce a defect in the incretin effect in healthy individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the insulinotropic affect of the incretin hormones in healthy individuals before and after a deterioration of the glucose homeostasis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incretin effect in patients with type two diabetes is reduced. The investigators have previously shown that it is possible to induce a defect in the incretin effect in healthy individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the insulinotropic affect of the incretin hormones in healthy individuals before and after a deterioration of the glucose homeostasis. The evaluation is done by infusing GIP, GLP-1 or saline during hyperglycemic clamps.</detailed_description>
