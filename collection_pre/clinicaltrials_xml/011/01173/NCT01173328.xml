	<brief_summary>Pursed-lip breathing (PLB) has been advocated to reduce respiratory rate and improve oxygen saturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at rest. Although PLB is a strategy that potentially reduces expiratory flow limitation, there are only few studies addressing its effects on exercise. This study aimed to assess the ability of PLB to change the breathing pattern, degree of dynamic hyperinflation (DH) and arterial oxygenation in COPD patients during exercise. Exercise tolerance was evaluated by endurance time and respiratory mechanics was evaluated by forced oscillation technique.</brief_summary>
