	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the response rate for triple negative breast cancer patients with brain metastasis when INIPARIB is used in combination with irinotecan. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Histologicallyconfirmed, ER negative, PR negative and Her2 negative adenocarcinoma of the breast with brain lesion on radiographic imaging. 2. ECOG Performance Status of 02. 3. Life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks. 4. No limit to prior therapies with last anticancer treatment ≥ 2 weeks from initiation of protocolbased therapy provided all toxicities (other than alopecia) have resolved to ≤Grade 1 or baseline. 5. No active serious infection or other comorbid illness which would impair ability to participate in the trial. 6. Stable or decreasing dose of steroids for ≥ 7 days. 7. Interval ≥ 4 weeks between open brain biopsy and initiation of protocolbased therapy. 8. Patients must have adequate organ function. Exclusion Criteria 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding 2. Prior allergic reaction to INIPARIB 3. Prior allergic reaction to irinotecan. 4. Evidence of hemorrhage or impending herniation on baseline brain imaging 5. Evidence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease on brain MRI or by previously documented CSF cytologyNOTE: discrete dural metastases are permitted. 6. Clinically significant cardiac, renal, hepatic, infectious or pulmonary disease which might affect trial participation. 7. Concurrent or planned radiation, hormonal, chemotherapeutic, experimental or targeted biologic therapy. 8. Contraindication to gadoliniumenhanced MRI imaging. 9. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures.</criteria>
