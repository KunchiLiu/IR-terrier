	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to design an incentive-based intervention to motivate a tobacco-free lifestyle among high school students and to pilot the intervention in the first academic year in two schools (CT and NY) and examine feasibility and acceptability. Preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be assessed by implementing it in two new schools (CT and NY) in the second academic year and determine an effect size estimate for a larger trial. The study is intended to assess the number of students joining the program and pledging to be smoke-free and to examine changes in tobacco use rates and attitudes following intervention exposure. We hypothesize that the schools will have lower rates of tobacco use and improvement in attitudes, norms and behavioral control over tobacco use after participating in the program.</brief_summary>
