	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of vitamin D3 versus vitamin D2 in raising vitamin D levels and suppressing parathyroid hormone levels in patients with kidney disease who are not on dialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplement Study for Stage Three and Four Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized and assigned to one of the treatment groups (D2 or D3). Subjects will be dispensed a supply of 1.25 mg cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol tablets, depending on their randomization outcome. The number of pills dispensed and medication instructions will be determined by their 25OHD level and K/DOQI guidelines. Both Study personnel and subject will be blinded to randomization group. The treatment phase will be 24 weeks in duration with lab visits every 6 weeks. All laboratory specimens will be drawn either at CCF Main hospital labs or at a CCF family Health center lab. Subjects will be have telephone interviews at week 4, 10, 16, 22 and possibly at weeks 28 and 34.</detailed_description>
