	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center evaluation of the performance of the GORE速 ACUSEAL Vascular Graft. The study will enroll patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), who are either currently receiving or expected to require hemodialysis through a prosthetic vascular graft within 30 days. Gore proposes to demonstrate that the 6 month cumulative patency of the GORE速 ACUSEAL Vascular Graft is similar to that of other arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A total of 138 Subjects will be enrolled. Once the study procedure has been successfully completed, cannulation may occur at any time at the Investigator's discretion. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subjects will be selected from up to 20 Investigational Sites.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>&gt; 1. Patient requires the creation of a vascular access graft for hemodialysis secondary to a diagnosis of EndStage Renal Disease. &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Patient is currently on hemodialysis or ready to begin hemodialysis within 30 days following placement of study device. &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The patient must be able to have the vascular access graft placed in an upper extremity. &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The patient is 18 years of age or older. &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. The patient has a reasonable expectation of remaining on hemodialysis for 12 months. &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The patient or his/her legal guardian understands the study and is willing and able to comply with followup requirements. &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. The patient or his/her legal guardian is willing to provide informed consent. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. The patient has a documented and unsuccessfully treated ipsilateral central venous stenosis via imaging technique. &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The patient currently has a known or suspected systemic infection. &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The patient has a known hypercoagulable or bleeding disorder or requires treatment with warfarin or heparin. &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The patient has had a previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT2) or has known sensitivity to heparin. &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. The patient is being considered for a live (living donor either related or unrelated to patient) donor kidney transplant. &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The patient is enrolled in another investigational study. &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. The patient has comorbid conditions that may limit their ability to comply with study and followup requirements. &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. Study device is intended to be used temporarily. &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. The patient has had &gt;2 previous arteriovenous accesses in treatment arm. &gt; &gt; &gt; 10. Patient is taking Aggrenox速. &gt; &gt; &gt; 11. The patient is in need of, or is scheduled for a different vascular surgical procedure within 30 days of the study procedure. &gt; &gt; &gt; 12. The patient is currently taking maintenance immunosuppressant medication such as rapamycin, mycophenolate or mycophenolic acid, prednisone(&gt;10 mg), cyclosporine, tacrolimus or cyclophosphamide. &gt; &gt; &gt; 13. The patient has a known hypercoagulable or bleeding disorder or requires treatment with warfarin or heparin. &gt; &gt; &gt; 14. Life expectancy is less than 12 months. &gt; &gt; &gt; 15. The patient is pregnant. &gt; &gt; &gt; 16. The patient is a poor compliance risk (i.e. history of IV or oral drug abuse).</criteria>
