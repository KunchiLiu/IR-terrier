	<brief_title>A Study of 28431754 (Canagliflozin) on Gastrointestinal Glucose Absorption and Metabolism in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center study that will be conducted in two Parts (Part 1 and Part 2) to evaluate the effect of a single-dose of canagliflozin on the absorption of glucose in healthy volunteers. Part 1 is a pilot (small) study where responses to key pharmocodynamic (PD) parameters (ie, specific tests on blood samples to evaluate effects of no treatment on the body) will be measured to confirm the study design and number of volunteers planned for Part 2. Part 2 is the main study where volunteers will be randomized (assigned to study drug or placebo by chance) to receive double-blind (neither the volunteer or study physician will know the identity of the treatment assigned) treatment with canagliflozin or placebo (treatment identical in appearance to canagliflozin but contains no active drug) to evaluate the effect of canagliflozin compared to placebo on gastrointestinal glucose absorption using a radiolabeled glucose tracer approach (ie, where a radioactive substance is combined with glucose allowing the movement of glucose in the body to be traced or detected). Blood and urine samples will be collected from volunteers at pre-defined times during the study for PD analysis. Safety will be monitored during the study by evaluating adverse events and results from clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations performed. Volunteers in Part 1 will receive 240 ml of water 10 minutes before starting of the MMTT in each period (Periods 1 and 2). Volunteers in Part 2 will receive study drug 20 minutes prior to starting of the MMTT in treatment sequence 1 (a single 300-mg dose of canagliflozin in Period 1 followed by matching placebo in Period 2) or in treatment Sequence 2 (matching placebo in Period 1 followed by a single 300-mg dose of canagliflozin in Period 2). Periods 1 and 2 will be separated by 7 to 21 days.</detailed_description>
