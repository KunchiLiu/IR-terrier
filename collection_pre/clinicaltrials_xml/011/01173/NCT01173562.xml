	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet formulation in a pediatric population. Mebendazole is a drug used for the treatment of soil-transmitted parasitic helminth (STH) (ie, parasitic worm) infections such as pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm, and American hookworm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of Mebendazole in Children 2 to 10 Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to study participant and investigator), single-center, single-dose, single-arm (ie, 1 treatment group) safety study. This study will consist of a screening visit on Day 1 at which time all study-related screening procedures will be performed. After all results are reviewed, children who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the open-label phase of the study. A single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be administered on Day 1 and the children will remain at the study site so that adverse events can be recorded at approximately 30 minutes postdose. Study participants will return to the study site 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) postdose at which time adverse events will be recorded again. Safety will be monitored during the study by assessing adverse events by direct observation at 30 minutes after dosing and at 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) after dosing, by direct observation of the study participant, report by the parent or guardian, or both. On Day 1, a single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be chewed and swallowed by each study participant. If desired, study participants will be allowed to drink water when administered study drug.</detailed_description>
