	<brief_summary>The secretion by tumor cells of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was observed in 50 to 60% of hepatocellular carcinoma. The AFP can be used as a marker for tumor recurrence after treatment and may be considered as a tumor antigen specific for hepatocellular carcinoma.The aim of the project is to use the alpha fetoprotein (AFP) as a tumor antigen and to propose an approach of immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma based on the injection of autologous dendritic cells loaded with specific peptides of AFP.</brief_summary>
