	<brief_title>Evaluation of Multisensor Data in Heart Failure Patients With Implanted Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of MultiSENSE study is to collect data about patient events during worsening heart failure, determine how sensor measurements vary during patient daily activities and during the development and recovery from events of worsening heart failure, develop algorithms capable of detecting the onset of worsening heart failure prior to the overt presentation of patient symptoms using reference measurements: thoracic impedance, heart sounds, physiologic responses to activities and respiration.</detailed_description>
