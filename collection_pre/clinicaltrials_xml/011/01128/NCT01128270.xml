	<brief_summary>This is a research study to look at how Dichloroacetate (DCA), and investigational drug and chloral hydrate are broken down in the body. The purpose of the study is to better understand how humans metabolize these two common chemicals that are widely present in the environment. The study focuses on how the drug chloral hydrate is broken down and how it effects DCA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject's general health is assessed by a history and physical exam and routine blood work. I normal the individual undergoes five nights of receiving 1.5ug/kg of chloral hydrate. On day 6 the individual receives 2.5 micrograms/kg of Dichloroacetate (DCA) and kinetics are drawn. After 30 days the subject comes back and receives 1.5ug/kg of chloral hydrate for five nights and has kinetics drawn on night one and five. On days 6-9 the subject returns for a blood draw. After 30 days the same process as above is done except the subject receives 1gram of chloral hydrate for five nights and 25mg/kg of Dichloroacetate one day then 30 days later the subject receives 1gram of chloral hydrate for five nights and has kinetics done on night one and five and blood samples drawn on days 6-9</detailed_description>
