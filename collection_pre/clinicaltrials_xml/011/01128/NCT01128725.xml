	<brief_summary>Beta amyloid immunoreactivity is probably due to a significant number of Ab catabolites corresponding to N-terminally truncated and Cterminally truncated or extended forms which display distinct propensity to aggregation. Very few things are known concerning the mechanisms and proteases by which they are generated. Furthermore, the link between truncation and toxicity has not been delineated. Finally, little is known concerning Ab fragments in biological fluids and whether they could be seen as early biomarkers and thereby, as putative targets for AD diagnostic. The present project will allow to examine the human biological samples and to identify various cohorts after complete clinical evaluation.</brief_summary>
