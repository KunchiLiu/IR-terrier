All restorations in a good state of repair Currently wearing a removable mandibular partial denture with sufficient room in the posterior buccal flange area to accomodate two enamel specimens required dimensions 12 x 7 mm. Willing to have their denture modified to accomodate enamel test specimens Willing and capable of wearing removable mandibular partial dentures 24 hours per day during the treatment periods. Salivary flow rate in the range of normal values (unstimulated whole saliva flow rate greater than or equal to 0.2 mL/ minute; gum base stimulated whole saliva flow rate greater than or equal to 0.8 mL/minute. Individuals currently taking antibiotics, or who have taken antibiotics within 30 days prior to the first treatment visit.
