	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the abductor muscle strength measured with a dynamometer in patients with reverse oblique inter- or subtrochanteric fractures treated either with a proximal femur locking plate or a trochanteric nail. "Proximal femur locking plates" stands for both the PF-LCP (Synthes) and the PeriLoc (Smith &amp; Nephew). Trochanteric nails allowed in this study are the Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA), the Titanium Trochanteric Fixation Nail (TFN) and the Gamma Nail (GN).</brief_summary>
