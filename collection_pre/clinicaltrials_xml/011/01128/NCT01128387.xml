	<brief_summary>The overall study objective is to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities and the recommended phase II dose of Panitumumab when combined with the standard of care treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiation in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. The investigators will also be assessing the ability of PET imaging to predict the degree of pathologic response. All patients will have a pre-study FDG PET scan and will receive radiation therapy and chemotherapy over a 35 day period. 4-8 weeks post radiation and chemotherapy patients will be restaged with a PET/CT scan. It is anticipated that approximately 30 patients enrolled will undergo an esophagectomy which is considered standard of care post radiation and chemotherapy. The surgery will allow us to compare this study regimen to the historical standard of care (Cisplatin/fluorouracil chemotherapy with radiation therapy).</brief_summary>
