	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to determine the best dose combination of S-Amlodipine and Telmisartan as compared to monotherapy by assessing the blood pressure lowering effects of a once daily regimen of various combinations of S-Amlodipine and Telmisartan, compared to their monotherapy components and placebo, in patients with stage I or II essential hypertension(a mean seated cuff diastolic blood pressure &gt;=95 and &lt;=115 mmHg).</brief_summary>
