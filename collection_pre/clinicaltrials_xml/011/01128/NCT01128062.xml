	<brief_summary>Canthaxanthine is a naturally occurring carotenoid that has been a popular over-the-counter oral artificial tanning agent in Europe, Canada, and Australia since 1979. It is also used at low dosage as a food-colouring agent and as a therapeutic agent for photosensitivity disorders such as erythropoietic protoporphyria. Canthaxanthin retinopathy was first described in 1982 by Cortin et al. In Germany the office of the federal board of health refused the permit for oral tanning agents containing canthaxanthine in 1985. At that time the long-term course of the disease was not known. 25 years later the investigators did these long-term follow-up examinations.</brief_summary>
