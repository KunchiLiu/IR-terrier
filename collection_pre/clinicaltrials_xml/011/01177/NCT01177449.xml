	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of prolotherapy on balance and lumbar flexibility in the patients with a sacralized L5 vertebra. Evaluations for ability on balance include sensory organization test (SOT,) rhythmic weight shifting (RWS) and limits of stability (LOS.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Prolotherapy on Balance and Lumbar Flexibility in the Patients With a Sacralized L5 Vertebra</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) is a congenital variety of vertebral bony construction, which is most frequently presented as sacralized L5 or lumbarized S1. LSTV would alter the kinetics of the spine thus induce inadequate mobility and dynamic compensation. Patients with LSTV were commonly found when they visited clinicians for treatment of low back pain. Prolotherapy is a technique that stimulates the body to repair the painful area by assistance of injecting an otherwise non-pharmacological and non-active irritant solution into the body.</detailed_description>
