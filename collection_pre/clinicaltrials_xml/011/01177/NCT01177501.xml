	<brief_summary>The early relapse of ovarian cancer occurring within 6 months of chemotherapy including platinum regimen are called relapses 'platinum resistant' consecutively patients die quickly of their disease. For relapses occurring between 6 and 12 months, no recommendation occur and few studies are conducted. Therefore it seems interesting to develop a research on intensive chemotherapy using a combination of carboplatin (a drug widely used in most ovarian cancer) with Topotecan , use in a high dose protocol. Topotecan has demonstrated its efficacy in relapse ovarian cancer and its possible use in high doses, a recent study (ITOV01) have demonstrated the feasibility of dose escalation of topotecan monotherapy (MTD set at 9 mg / m² / dx 5 days). This project is a feasibility research of the combination of topotecan and carboplatin in a high dose escalation protocol for early ovarian cancer relapse occurring 6 to 12 months after conventional chemotherapy-based platinum salts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of High Dose Topotecan With Carboplatin in Patients With Relapsed Ovarian Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination Topotecan plus carboplatin at high doses has been published by Miles Prince et al in 2001. In a triple combination, the authors were able to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 3.5 mg / m² / day x 5 days for topotecan, 250 mg / m² for paclitaxel and AUC at 12 for carboplatin (46). The MTD of topotecan combined with carboplatin (AUC 16) and VP 16 could not be determined by Carroll et al (47). However, in the study ITOV01bis (ASCO abstract 2007 No. 1661), the MTD of topotecan was determined in combination with cyclophosphamide at 120 mg / kg and was fixed at 9 mg/m2/jx 5 days, the same as the DMT used in monotherapy ITOV 01). Studies related above, the combination of high dose of topotecan and carboplatin seems possible with a limited dose of carboplatin at AUC 20, an allocation of 5 days for both drugs [with a fixed daily AUC 4 for carboplatin , same as the program TAXIF I in germ cell tumors, published by our team (Annual Oncology 2004) as well as TAXIF II developed by Tenon's hospital] with an administration time of 30 minutes daily for topotecan and 2 hours for carboplatin. these data justify the pattern of our study: - established treatment of 5 consecutive days provides the best therapeutic index, - infusion of 30 minutes, seems to give less non-haematological toxicity compare to continuous infusion, which prevailed in the trial ITOV 01, - Rescue by blood stem cells (collected by chemotherapy mobilization-type high-dose cyclophosphamide followed by hematopoietic growth factors (G-CSF, Filgrastim) reinjection is scheduled to H96 after the treatment end , - six sequential doses established in the absence of limiting toxicity, as follows: 7.5 - 8.0 - 8.5 - 9.0 - 9.5 - 10.0 mg/m2. Steps 9.5 mg / m² and 10 mg / m will be discussed after approval by an independent committee in charge of the studyContinuation of Topotecan at conventional dose can be done thanks to clinical data based on efficacy and tolerance</detailed_description>
