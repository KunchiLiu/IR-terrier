	<brief_title>Investigation of an Adaptive Treatment Algorithm for Post-op Thoracic Patients to Reduce the Length of Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective study, a treatment algorithm is tested in a subgroup of patients with postoperative pulmo-pleural fistula. The primary aim is to reduce the duration of pulmo-pleural fistulation. Secondary aim is to reduce the duration of chest tube therapy.</detailed_description>
