	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy of Cryolipolysis on the Fat of Thigh in Korean Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryolipolysis is a new concept to reduce fat since Zeltiq machine had been introduced several years ago. Several different trials such as high frequency, liposuction and chemical lipolysis to remove fat had been emerged and tried. Therefore, we would like to know the clinical efficacy of cryolipolysis through comparative experiment with former frequency method on each thigh on healthy Korean women. Healthy premenopausal women who want to reduce the fat on thigh were included. 28 healthy volunteered women recruited for this study, 15 subjects among participated after interviewing, sampling their metabolic variables at initial visit. A total of 15 subjects would be investigated through food diary(24hour), femoral CT, anthropometric, metabolic variables at initial, 4th, 12th week. Histological examination under skin(initial and 12th week), questionnaire(4th, 12th week) for satisfaction, adverse events would be monitored during 3 month.</detailed_description>
