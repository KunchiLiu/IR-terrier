	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether therapy for Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) veterans with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms can be delivered effectively using videoconferencing technology ("telepsychology"), which allows a therapist and patient who are not in the same room as one another to communicate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovative Service Delivery for Secondary Prevention of PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OIF and OEF service men and women exposed to high levels of violence are at risk for developing mental health disorders including Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Even those with less severe symptoms who fail to meet diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder may struggle to return to pre-deployment functioning. Studies suggest that a significant percentage of veterans may suffer from "subthreshold" PTSD; although their symptom presentation is less severe, these veterans experience emotional distress and reduced quality of life. Given that Veterans Affairs (VA) mental-health service providers are faced with the important and challenging task of alleviating the emotional suffering of our service men and women while staying within budget confines, we need effective, practical, evidence-based treatments that can be delivered in an expedient and cost-effective manner. Thus, the current project has two primary objectives: 1) to develop, implement, and evaluate a treatment program (Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure, BATE) for OIF and OEF veterans with PTSD symptoms, and 2) to determine whether or not this program delivered via telepsychology will be as effective as in-person treatment. Secondary objectives include determining: 1) which treatment modality is more effective in terms of process variables (e.g., treatment satisfaction, session attendance), 2) which treatment modality is more cost-effective, and 3) whether treatment effects differ across race and gender. Study participants will be randomized to two treatment conditions, BATE delivered via telepsychology (BATE-T) and BATE delivered in-person (BATE-IP). The current treatment protocol is based on two, research-supported therapeutic rationales, Behavioral Activation (BA) and Therapeutic Exposure (TE). Briefly, the treatment aims to increase the participant's engagement in healthy activities (i.e., activities that are naturally reinforcing and promote the participant's life values) and exposure activities (i.e., activities that target specific PTSD symptoms such as avoidance and hyperarousal). Treatment will be implemented in eight, one and half hour sessions. Although research supports the effectiveness of behavior- and exposure-based treatments for trauma-related mental health problems, a potential risk for any counseling program that targets avoidance symptoms is a temporary increase in emotional distress. Therapists will inform participants that this is a normal "side effect" of treatment. However, over the course of treatment should a participant's emotional distress rise to a level above what can be handled via outpatient counseling, the participant will be removed from the study and appropriate referrals will be made. The anticipated duration of this study is four years. Based on results of the study, we will finalize the treatment manual. In terms of clinical applicability, we plan to present study findings at conferences and disseminate the treatment manual to VA mental health service providers in approximately four to five years. Study findings will address important gaps in the PTSD literature, yielding several contributions to the field. First, to the extent that BATE effectively reduces symptom severity, this investigational treatment may benefit individual OIF/OEF service men and women by alleviating emotional suffering and improving quality of life. Second, to the extent that BATE prevents the development of full-blown PTSD in subclinical military personnel, this investigational treatment may reduce attrition from the military due to untreated mental health problems. Third, only a small percentage of those who might benefit from counseling actually seek services due to barriers associated with traditional service delivery practices such as geographic distance from the VA hospital and stigma of psychological treatment. Thus, as telemedicine has been shown to circumvent these barriers to care, the current project has the potential to reach an otherwise underserved population: subclinical OIF and OEF service men and women who may be reluctant to seek care. Fourth, to the extent that BATE-T produces results comparable to BATE-IP, this study may potentially identify a cost-effective alternative to in-person treatment thereby reducing post-service treatment costs to VA's.</detailed_description>
