	<brief_title>Study of Effectiveness of Mental Health Interventions Among Torture Survivors in Southern Iraq</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For each intervention, participants will undergo 12 sessions (CBI or CPT) that are standardized by training and manual for community mental health workers (CHMWs). CMHWs will be trained in only one intervention. Prior to the starting sessions, a baseline assessment of depression, anxiety and trauma symptoms and function will be carried out. A follow up assessment will be carried out after the 12 sessions have been completed. Expected time between sessions is one week. The total time per client is expected to last about 4-5 months to complete the 12 therapy sessions. Participants will be randomized (within CMHW) to either immediate intervention or wait-list control. Participants that are wait-list control will be contacted monthly for assessment of condition. Any participant (intervention or control) with suicidal thoughts or distress that does not abate will be referred for psychiatric care.</detailed_description>
