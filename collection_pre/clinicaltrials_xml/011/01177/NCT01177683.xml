	<brief_title>Bendamustine in Combination With Bortezomib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I component Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 IV bolus, Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, Day 4 Bendamustine escalating cohorts IV over 1 hour, Days 1 and 4 1 Cycle = 28 days Phase II component Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 IV bolus, Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, Day 4 Bendamustine at MTD IV over 1 hour, Days 1 and 4 Filgrastim (if defined in MTD) 5 µg/kg/day SC, Starting day 6 until neutrophil recovery to ANC &gt;1000 1 Cycle = 28 days; Patients will continue treatment for a total of up to 8 cycles. ECOG Performance Status: 0-2 Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.2 x K/mm3 - Platelets ≥ 75 x K/mm3 Hepatic: - Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN - ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Renal: - Serum creatinine &lt; 3.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: - LVEF &gt;45% corrected by MUGA scan or echocardiogram. - No unstable angina pectoris or recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A histologically established diagnosis of multiple myeloma with evidence of relapse or refractory disease. Must have a detectable serum or urine MProtein by protein electrophoresis that is at least 500 mg/dL (serum) or 1 gm/24 hours (urine), respectively, or serum free light chain level &gt;100 mg/l for the involved free light chain. Must have received at least one (1) prior line of systemic treatment that has included either lenalidomide or thalidomide. Must be willing to provide correlative blood samples. Must not have received an excessive cumulative dose of anthracycline No ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. No cytotoxic chemotherapy within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. No autologous stem cell transplant within 6 months prior to registration for protocol therapy No prior radiation therapy to &gt; 25% of bone marrow forming bones (i.e., pelvis) within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. See Study Procedures Manual to calculate percent of prior radiation. No current corticosteroid therapy in doses greater than 10 mg daily of prednisone (or equivalent) if given for management of comorbid conditions. No known central nervous system involvement by myeloma. No poorly controlled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, poorly controlled diabetes, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social climate that in the opinion of the investigator would limit compliance with study requirements. No patients known to be positive for HIV, or active Hepatitis A, B, or C. No major surgery within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. Placement of a venous access device within 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy is allowed.</criteria>
