	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this first human study with CC-223 is to assess the safety and action of a new class of experimental drug (dual mTOR inhibitors) in patients with advanced tumors unresponsive to standard therapies and to determine the appropriate dose and tumor type for later-stage clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Oral CC-223 for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initially, patients will be treated with oral CC-223 for one month. During this time, various tests (involving blood and urine collections, ECGs, etc) will be performed. Those whose tumors stabilize or regress may continue receiving treatment for as long as they benefit from CC-223. Different dose levels of CC-223 will be tested in a dose-rising study design.</detailed_description>
