	<brief_summary>Management of dental pain emergencies is a challenge for the clinician, particularly when pain is due to endodontic infection.

	<brief_title>Efficiency Evaluation of Intradiploic Intra-osseus Anesthesia Versus Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management of dental pain emergencies is a challenge for the clinician, particularly when pain is due to endodontic infection. Failure rate of local anesthesia highly increases with irreversible pulpitis or inflamed periradicular tissue. Tested hypothesis is intradiploic anesthesia is more effective and quicker than inferior alveolar nerve block for mandibular molars anesthesia (from teeth 35 up to 38 and from 45 up to 48). The primary aim of the study is the evaluation of Quicksleeper efficiency used in first intention versus inferior alveolar nerve block used in most current dental treatment. Four clinical situations are evaluated : pulpitis; periapical abcess; pulpal hyperemia; asymptomatic decayed tooth. Evaluated parameters are : speed of sedation, ability of cure, additional anesthesia needed, total of needles and cartridges used, side effects. Time and validation of complete anesthesia is controlled by pulp tester. Studied population is patients cared in restorative, endodontics department. Pulpal and periapical molar and premolar sedation is randomly managed by inferior alveolar nerve block or Quicksleeper intraosseous anesthesia, among studied population (divided in 2 groups of 50 patients). Pulp-tester measures anesthesia minute by minute. The comparison of study results to bibliography, guidelines and advantages for using mechanical Quicksleeper anesthesia system will be discussed.</detailed_description>
