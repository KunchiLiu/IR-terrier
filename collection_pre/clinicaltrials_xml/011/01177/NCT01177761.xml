Within the Erlanger Fitness and Osteoporosis Study (EFOPS, an ongoing controlled exercise study with currently 16 years of supervised exercise with 45-50 osteopenic, early-postmenopausal women in exercise and sedentary control group each, the investigators therefore focus on overall-fractures, Bone Mineral Density and falls.</brief_summary>
