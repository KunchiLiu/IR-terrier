	<brief_summary>The Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a rare syndrome observed in women under 40 who induced estrogen deficiency and often leads to infertility final. The etiologies of POF remain unknown in more than 85% of cases. There are 5-10 % of familial cases.The main objective of this study is to recruit, phenotype and genotype 20 families with at least two subjects with nonsyndromic POF in order to identify new loci using a single technical standard nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This study will also include related population and population control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis of Familial Cases of Premature Ovarian Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It was decided to move towards a study of familial cases of IOP. This study will identify areas of susceptibility in new families, identify candidate genes, sequence these genes in cases familial POF and sporadic cases in order to detect potential mutations, and in the control population.</detailed_description>
