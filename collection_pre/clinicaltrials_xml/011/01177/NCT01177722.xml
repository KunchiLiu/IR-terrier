	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate immunogenicity and safety data of an investigational hexavalent DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine compared to a control vaccine, Infanrix hexa™ when given along with Prevenar™ and Rotarix™ vaccines. Primary Objectives: - To demonstrate the equivalence of immunogenicity of 3 lots of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine 1 month after a 3-dose primary series (2, 4 and 6 months) when given with Prevenar™ and Rotarix™, in terms of immunoresponses. - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the hexavalent DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine to the licensed hexavalent Infanrix hexa vaccine when given with Prevenar™ and Rotarix™. Secondary Objectives: - To describe in each group the immunogenicity parameters for all antigens for each vaccine - To assess the safety profile in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events in each group for each vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each participant will receive 3 doses of 1 of 3 lots of the investigational hexavalent vaccine or the control vaccine, Infanrix hexa™, administered with Prevenar™ at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and Rotarix™ at 2 and 4 months of age. All participants will be monitored for safety for 6 months after the last injection of the primary vaccination series.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Two month old infants (55 to 65 days old) on the day of inclusion. Born at full term of pregnancy (≥ 37 weeks) with a birth weight ≥ 2.5 kg. Informed consent form signed by one or both parents or by the legally acceptable representative as per local requirements. Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Received Hepatitis B and Bacille de CalmetteGuérin (BCG) vaccines between birth and one month of life in agreement with the national immunization calendar. Exclusion Criteria : Participation in another clinical trial in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination. Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy, or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy. Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the trial vaccine or a vaccine containing the same substances. Chronic illness at a stage that could interfere with trial conduct or completion, in the opinion of the Investigator. Blood or bloodderived products received since birth that might interfere with the assessment of the immune response. Any vaccination before trial vaccination (except Hepatitis B and Bacille de Calmette Guérin given at birth). Any planned vaccination until 1 month after the last trial vaccination (except the study vaccines, rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugated vaccines). Documented history of pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Hepatitis B infection(s) (confirmed either clinically, serologically or microbiologically). Previous vaccination against pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, or Haemophilus influenzae type b infections. Known personal or maternal history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C seropositivity. Known coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder preceding inclusion contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination. History of seizures or encephalopathy. Febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C), or moderate or severe acute illness/infection on the day of inclusion, according to the Investigator judgment.</criteria>
