	<brief_title>Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of H1N1 Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, placebo-controlled, single blinded dose escalation study to preliminarily assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of different HAC1 vaccine formulations. This study will assess a novel HAC1 vaccine, which is plant derived. This vaccine will be compared to Placebo of normal (0.9%) saline, and reference vaccine consisting of an approved monovalent vaccine containing an A/California (H1N1)-like strain.
