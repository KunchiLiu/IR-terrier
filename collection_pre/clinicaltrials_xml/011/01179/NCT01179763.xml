	<brief_title>Thickness of Retinal Layers in Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia is a visual disorder characterized by a reduction of vision that cannot be immediately improved by refractive correction or accounted for by clinically determined anatomic defects of the eye or visual pathway. Evidence for direct retinal changes in eyes with amblyopia has been controversial. It has been hypothesized that amblyopia may affect the postnatal maturation of the retina including the postnatal reduction of retinal ganglion cells. However, although some studies have found incrased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in amblyopic eyes, others have found no significant differences. This sutdy will examine the retinal layer thickness in amblyopia and compare the retinal layer thickness between amblyopic eyes and nonamblyopic fellow eyes.</detailed_description>
