	<brief_title>Role of Radiotherapy Following Oesophageal Stenting in Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A majority of patients with oesophageal cancer present with inoperable disease and require rapid and long lasting palliation of dysphagia. STUDY AIM: To compare dysphagia relief in patients treated with oesophageal stenting and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), versus oesophageal stenting alone and to assess overall survival, treatment related complications, and quality of life in the two groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer with high grade dysphagia to be randomised to receive oesophageal stenting alone (Group I), versus a combination of stenting followed by EBRT (Group II). Dysphagia relief, treatment related complications, overall survival, and quality of life to be assessed in the two groups.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Oesophageal cancer patients with locally advanced unresectable cancer (such as invasion of tracheobronchial tree, aorta, pulmonary vascular structures, etc), Metastatic disease, and comorbid conditions precluding major surgical procedure (such as severe cardiopulmonary, hepatic and renal diseases) with grade 3 and 4 dysphagia, were included in the trial. Patients with carcinoma of the cervical oesophagus and those who had already received prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or any other modality of treatment were excluded</criteria>
