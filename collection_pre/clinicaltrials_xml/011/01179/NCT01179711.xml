	<brief_summary>In most clinics, physicians reduce diopter of hyperopic glasses in older patients with accommodative esotropia. However, there are risks of decompensation in that practice. The authors are going to try measure the change of stability of eye alignment after reducing diopter of hyperopic glasses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Under-correction in Refractive Accommodative Esotropia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion criteria : patients with accommodative esotropia At initial visit(of study), the physician will reduce the diopter of hyperopic glasses as much as the patient can maintain their eye alignment (maximum amount 1.5D). Outcome measure : Follow-up examinations are scheduled at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the patients begin wearing under-corrected spectacles. At every visit, symptoms such as asthenopia, diplopia, or blurred vision will be documented and ocular examinations, including visual acuity and ocular alignment status for distance and near will be performed. Tests of fusion and stereoacuity will be performed at the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
