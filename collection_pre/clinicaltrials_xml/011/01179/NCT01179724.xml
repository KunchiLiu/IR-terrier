	<brief_summary>after endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD) of early gastric cancer, conventional proton pump(PPI) inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists have a controversial effect on preventing bleeding from artificial ulcers. the aim of this study was to investigate whether a stronger acid suppression (high dose PPI) more effectively prevents bleeding after ESD</brief_summary>
