	<brief_summary>Ultrasonic coagulating shears are made for performing for cutting and hemostasis at once during operation. It was proved that a laparoscopic gastric resection showed significantly shorter operative time and less work load distribution, and more stability of bleeding than before an introduction of ultrasonic coagulating shears . In an open gastric cancer surgery, ultrasonic coagulating shears have been often used for lymph node dissection or cutting of small vessels in some hospitals in Korea. However its usefulness or effectiveness has not been fully proved. There was only one report about using ultrasonic coagulating shears in open gastrectomy. The report contained small number of subjects and surgical procedures were different from the investigators. The investigators expect to reduce operative time and blood loss with ultrasonic coagulating shears. Ultrasonic coagulating shears will also enable us to dissect lymph node with closure of lymphatics. This may reduce the amount of drainage fluid from peritoneal cavity and shorten the removal time of a drain, which will also shorten the hospital stay. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and benefit of ultrasonic coagulating shears in open gastrectomy including usefulness and effectiveness by a randomized controlled, prospective study.</brief_summary>
