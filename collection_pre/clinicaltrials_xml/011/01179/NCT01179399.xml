	<brief_summary>Overview of Study Design: This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of TAK-960 in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. This study will be the first to administer TAK-960 to humans. The patient population will consist of adults with a nonhematologic malignancy for which standard treatment is no longer effective or does not offer curative or life-prolonging potential, or for which no standard treatment is available.</brief_summary>

Patients with brain metastases must: have stable neurologic status for at least 2 weeks following completion of local therapy AND be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of adverse events Prior allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplant Prior therapy or treatment as specified in protocol Female patients who are lactating or who have a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening period of within 3 days before the first dose of TAK960 Myocardial infarction within 6 months before first dose of TAK960 Any of the cardiovascular conditions or values as specified in the study protocol within 6 months before the first dose of TAK960 Infection requiring systemic antiinfective therapy within 14 days before the start of TAK960, or other severe infection Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, hepatitis B surface antigenpositive or known suspected active hepatitis C infection A diagnosis of or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before the first dose of TAK960 or previous diagnosis of another malignancy and any evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the completion of treatment Recurrent nausea or vomiting or requirement for antiemetic therapy within 14 days before the first dose of TAK960 Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerability of TAK960, including difficulty swallowing capsules Treatment with any investigational products within 21 days before the first dose of TAK960 Systemic use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers within 14 days before the first dose of TAK960 Patients enrolled in the expansion cohorts where tumor biopsies are required must meet additional criteria according to the study protocol</criteria>
