	<brief_summary>Recent research has focused on the investigation of sublingual microcirculatory alterations in different patient categories, like cardiac surgery and sepsis. The microcirculation plays a pivotal role in tissue oxygenation and can be non invasively visualized by sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging. The objective is to carry out a international multi center study to investigate the prevalence of microcirculatory alterations in intensive care patients. Up to the present time, a comprehensive prevalence study like this has not been carried out.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visualization of the sublingual microcirculation at a fixed time point with SDF- or OPS-imaging in all adult patients of participating intensive care units, regardless of their underlying disease. Concurrently, data on both patient characteristics (e.g. severity of illness, treatment) and ICU characteristics will be obtained.</detailed_description>
