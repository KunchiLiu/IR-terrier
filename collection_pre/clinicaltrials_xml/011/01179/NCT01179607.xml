	<brief_summary>M0002, an orally active, selective non-peptidergic antagonist of the vasopressin V2 receptor inhibits vasopressin-induced water reabsorption from the kidney. Therefore the aquaretic effect of M0002 has a potential clinical benefit in the treatment of ascites and hyponatreamia in cirrhotic patients.</brief_summary>
