	<detailed_description>Bacteremia is a well-recognized invasive medical condition. In most cases, it is a transient phenomenon without clinical consequences. In certain patients, such as those with structural cardiac abnormalities, it may lead to the development of infectious endocarditis. According to an American Heart Association statement, routine endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated prior to invasive procedures with relatively high bacteremia rates, such as dental care,certain types of catheterization and rigid bronchoscopy [1].Fibreoptic bronchoscopy, with or without biopsy is not included in this list due to a very low bacteremia rate [1].This even applies to particularly high risk patients with prosthetic valve or previous endocarditis. Yigla et al. assessed the incidence of bacteremia following bronchoscopy and found 6.5% of bacteremia rate. (2) Recently, Steinfort et al. assessed the bacteremia rate following endobronchial ultrasound and found 7% of bacteremia rate following the procedure. All bacterial isolates were typical oropharyngeal commensal organisms. The transbronchial needle aspiration washing culture was positive in 35% of the patients. However, none of the bacteremic patients had clinical features suggestive of infection and no complications were seen among the cohort. (3) No data are available, however about the bacteremic rate following interventional bronchoscopy for endobronchial obstruction and advance lung carcinoma. In these cases, palliative setting of alleviating central airway obstruction, laser resection, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation and stenting are techniques that can provide immediate relief. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is uses ionize argon gas jet flow to conduct electrons allowing a noncontact mode of treatment (lightning effect). (4, 5) APC has been popular in gastrointestinal endoscopy for superficial coagulation of large mucosal surfaces. The argon gas quite flexibly flows around bends and corners. Coagulated tissue has a higher resistance that automatically drives the argon gas flow away to nearby untreated tissue. An immediate effect really can be seen during electrocautery treatment, which corresponds well with the histological effect of coagulative necrosis. We therefore conduct a prospective study to assess the bacteremic rate following APC in patients with endobronchial involvement.</detailed_description>
