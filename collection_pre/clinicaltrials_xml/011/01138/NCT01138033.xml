	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be concurrent. Part 2 will explore further the safety, PK, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with tumors known to overexpress focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Part 3 will characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in hair, skin and tumor tissue at doses that will not go lower than 80 mg or above the MTD dose levels tested during the Phase 1 dose escalation. Part 4 will explore further the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints. Part 5 will investigate the time course, the extent of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing, and screen for potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure of GSK2256098 at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5 may be concurrent.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints. Subjects with solid tumors will receive GSK2256098 orally without interruption on consecutive days. The planned starting dose in Part 1 will be a total daily dose of 160 mg administered as 80 mg twice daily (BID) during the repeat dose phase of the study. In the first cohort, administration of study drug will be initiated as a single dose (80 mg) on Day 1 that will be followed by collection of PK samples. Subjects may then begin repeat dosing (80 mg BID) on Day 2 following the collection of the 24-h PK sample. In subsequent cohorts, administration of study drug will be given as a single dose (half the total daily dose) on Day 1 followed by collection of PK samples. Subjects may begin repeat dosing on Day 2 following collection of the 24-h PK sample. During dose escalation (Part 1), a modified accelerated dose titration design will be followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation design until the MTD is established. After the MTD is established approximately 30 additional subjects with tumors reported to have FAK over-expression will be enrolled to further explore the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of GSK2256098 (Part 2). Additional cohorts below the MTD may be expanded to further explore and characterize the range of biologically effective doses (Part 3). Part 4 will further explore the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Part 5 will investigate the time course, the extent of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing, and screen for potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure of GSK2256098 at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent provided. 18 years old or older. Confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy that is not responsive to accepted standard therapies or for which there is no standard or curative therapy. Subjects with malignancies related to HIV infection or organ transplantation are excluded. Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale Able to swallow and retain oral medication A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he either: agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse from the first dose of study drug and until 21 days after last dose of study medication, or agrees to use a condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository from the first dose of study drug and until 21 days after last dose of study medication, or is surgically sterile. NOTE: Male subjects must use contraception to prevent pregnancy in a female partner and prevent exposure of any partner to semen by any means (refer to Section 8.1). A female is eligible to enroll in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any woman who is characterized by at least one of the following: oHas had a hysterectomy oHas had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) oHas had a bilateral tubal ligation oIs postmenopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year) Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following from at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and until 21 days after last dose of study medication: Use an intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

NOTE: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential for drugdrug interaction. Adequate organ system function Paraffinembedded, archival tumor tissue available for testing. If archival tissue is available but it is not feasible to obtain within the screening period, subjects may enroll and enter the study prior to these specimens being received for analyses. In situations that archival tumor specimens are not available, (i.e. insufficient archival tumor specimens or a local hospital refuses to release a tissue block or specimen for the purposes of the study), only subjects for Part 1 would be eligible under such circumstances if there is documentation to explain why this tissue is not available Inclusion Criteria Part 2 and Part 3 Confirmed cancers of the breast, esophagus, ovary, head and neck, colon, rectum, stomach, liver, endometrium, cervix, oral epithelium, thyroid, lung, prostate, sarcoma and other tumors reported in medical literature to overexpress FAK that are not responsive to accepted standard therapies or for which there is no standard or curative therapy.
