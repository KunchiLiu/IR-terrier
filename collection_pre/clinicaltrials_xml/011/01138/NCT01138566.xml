	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are: 1. To estimate the prevalence of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and/or AmpC among Enterobacteriaceae which cause community-onset urinary tract infections (UTIs) 2. To collect the background, risk factors and clinical outcome of patients with community-acquired uropathogenic condition related to Enterobacteriaceae (both ESBL, AmpC- and non ESBL and/or AmpC producing) after receive different antibiotic regimens. 3. To develop a scoring system to early identify patients at risk of being infected with ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae by comparing the risk factors for community-onset UTIs caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC-positive against non ESBL -and/or AmpC Enterobacteriaceae 4. To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ertapenem for the empiric treatment of community-onset UTIs in patients at risk for ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing organism. The study hypothesis (i) Patients infected with community-acquired uropathogenic ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae who receive regimens other than carbapenems have a worse outcome. (ii) There are certain risk factors predicting the acquisition of community-onset UTIs caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. (iii) The use of ertapenem is an effective and safe empirical therapy compared with other agents for community-onset UTIs caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patients who admitted to the Taipei Veterans General Hospital with the diagnosis of communityonset UTI caused by Enterobacteriaceae will be eligible for inclusion in this study if hospitalization for parental antimicrobial therapy is required pregnancy or lactation in women, history of serious allergy or intolerance to study drug therapy (patients with a history of mild rash to βlactams could be enrolled), complete obstruction of the urinary tract, perinephritic or intrarenal abscess, prostatitis, any rapidly progressive disease or terminal illness, immunocompromising illness or immuno suppression therapy, the need for concomitant antimicrobials in addition to study therapy, a baseline pathogen resistant to study drug, treatment with a systemic antimicrobial agent for &gt;24 h within 72 h prior to enrolment, or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm3. Men with a history or physical findings suggestive of acute or chronic prostatitis will also excluded.</criteria>
