	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this prospective multi-centre study is to prove the diagnostic accuracy of in vivo 3T multi-modality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (high resolution T2-weighted MRI, DCE-MRI, MRSI and DWI techniques) in distinguishing carcinoma from other prostate tissue. The gold standard for distinguishing the tissue types is the analysis of whole-mount sections of the resected prostate by a genitourinary histopathologist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Localization With a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (MR) Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goal Proving that multi-parametric MR imaging in a multi-centre setting allows for localizing clinically significant (volume &gt; 0.5cc; Gleason &gt; 6) prostate carcinoma in the prostate. Objective 1 To determine the diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve) of 3-Tesla multi-modality non-endorectal coil (ERC) MR imaging in localizing prostate cancer, by correlating: 1. focal areas of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images; 2. the extent and degree of deviating metabolite ratios derived from MRSI. This can be the choline+creatine/citrate ratio or if possible, the choline / citrate ratio; 3. the extent and degree of apparent diffusion coefficient reduction on DWI; 4. the extent and degree of perfusion abnormality on DCE-MRI; with the presence or absence of cancer at (reconstructed) whole mount section histopathology. Objective 2 Proving that multi-modality MR data allows for predicting tumor grade. The parameters from the different MR methods for a tumor focus can be correlated to the local Gleason grade of the corresponding lesion in the histopathological specimens.</detailed_description>
