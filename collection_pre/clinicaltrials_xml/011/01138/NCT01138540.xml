	<brief_title>The Gravity-VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is planned to compare, in patients sedated, intubated or tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated, the efficacy and safety of two body positions in reducing incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The semi-recumbent position prevents gastro-oropharyngeal aspiration of bacteria laden gastric contents and the "gastro-pulmonary" route of colonization. The lateral-Trendelenburg position aims to promote outward drainage of bacteria-laden oropharyngeal secretion, while avoiding bacterial translocation from the oropharynx into the lungs.</detailed_description>
