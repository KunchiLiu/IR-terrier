	<brief_summary>CPAP, the standard treatment for Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) that reduces sleep fragmentations and neurocognitive deficit in OSAS may also have a key role in reduction of cardiovascular, mortality risks in the same patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of CPAP on Biomarkers in Patients With OSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which there is collapse of the upper airway during sleep, as a result of which there is a decrease or complete cessation of airflow. This leads to repeated episodes of hypoxia during sleep and sleep fragmentation. It is a highly prevalent though under-recognized clinical problem.There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays important role in development of cardiovascular complications in patients with OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for OSA with significant symptoms.However, it is a costly treatment option and poor compliance is an important limiting factor. CPAP treatment has been shown to improve the daytime somnolence and neurocognitive function in people with OSAS. However, its effect on cardiovascular biomarkers in people with OSAS has not been satisfactorily assessed. This study aims to assess the effect of CPAP treatment on cardiovascular biomarkers in OSA.</detailed_description>
