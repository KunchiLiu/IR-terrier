	<brief_summary>Aims: During the last decades overweight/obesity has increased markedly. They are associated with a high risk for diabetes and death. Effective intervention is mandatory. Following participation in treatment programmes children/adolescents often fail to reach sufficient long-term weight reduction. The present trial aims to integrate telemedical support in therapy to improve long term outcome. Methods: All children/adolescents with overweight/obesity were included (n=66,age 13.9±2.6 years, body mass index [BMI] 31.2±5.4kg/m², body mass index standard deviation score [BMI-SDS] 2.41±0.6) admitted to our hospital 04-03/2009. To asses physical activity and eating habits electronic health technology was used (Fraunhofer-Institute). The system consists in a motion sensor integrated in a mobile phone(DiaTrace). The system analyses kind, intensity and duration of physical activity and eating habits.</brief_summary>
