	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of ligand-independent phosphorylation of Stat3 in a small cohort of samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia including, but not limited to, samples known to express mutated c-kit. - Measure the level of Stat3 phosphorylation in these samples after stimulation of three key cytokine receptors expressed on hematopoietic cells IL-6R, G-CSFR, and c-kit. OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for levels of various components of the Stat3 pathway via western blotting.</detailed_description>
