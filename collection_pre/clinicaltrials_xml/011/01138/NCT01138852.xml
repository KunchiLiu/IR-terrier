	<brief_summary>The efficacy and safety of a single dose of ampicillin/sulbactam compared to a single dose of cefuroxime at cord clamp for prevention of postcesarean infectious morbidity has not been assessed. Women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomized to receive a single dose of either 3g of ampicillin-sulbactam or 1.5g of cefuroxime intravenously, after umbilical cord clamping. An evaluation for development of postoperative infections and risk factor analysis was performed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The efficacy and safety of a single dose of ampicillin/sulbactam compared to a single dose of cefuroxime at cord clamp for prevention of postcesarean infectious morbidity has not been assessed. The investigation was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of ampicillin/sulbactam 3g compared to a single dose of cefuroxime 1.5g in preventing postoperative morbidity. The primary outcome was development of an infection either at the surgical site or elsewhere e.g. urinary tract infection. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed from July 2004 to December 2008 in one major tertiary care hospital in Athens Greece. All patients undergoing a cesarean delivery were eligible.Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5g of cefuroxime, or 3g of ampicillin/ sulbactam intravenously after the time the umbilical cord was clamped.</detailed_description>
