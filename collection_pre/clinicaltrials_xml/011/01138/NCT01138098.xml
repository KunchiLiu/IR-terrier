Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the challenge dose of HBV vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Receipt of hepatitis B (containing) vaccine after vaccination in the primary study 217744/031 (NCT01457495). History of hepatitis B disease. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before and ending 30 days after the HBV vaccine challenge dose. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the challenge dose of HBV vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the challenge dose of HBV vaccine. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the HBV vaccine or evidence of hypersensitivity after previous immunisation with a vaccine containing the hepatitis B component.
