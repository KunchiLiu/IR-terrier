	<brief_summary>Clozapine remain the drug of choice for treatment resistant schizophrenia and up to 60% of patients not responding to other antipsychotics will respond to clozapine. However, the use of clozapine is restricted due to the risk of agranulocytosis and consequently the need for mandatory hematological monitoring. CHEMPAQ XBC is a point-of-care device that can be used in patients home and analyze WBC and granulocytes by a single capillary blood drop. This study aims to investigate whether this new procedure increases the acceptability of clozapine</brief_summary>
