	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the test-retest repeatability of lactate and other metabolites measured by single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and multi-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging experiments (MRSI) in tumor tissue in patients radiographically diagnosed with glioma. These measurements will test whether the concentration of lactate in tumor will be higher than the concentration of lactate in normal tissue of the same patient.</brief_summary>
