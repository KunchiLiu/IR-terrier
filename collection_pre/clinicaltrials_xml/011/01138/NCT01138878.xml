	<brief_summary>Surveillance data suggests that approximately one third of the 82 000 HIV infected adults in the UK remain undiagnosed - that is, they are living with the infection but do not know this. The majority of HIV testing in the UK to date has taken place in sexual health clinics and in antenatal care. Published National guidelines advocate routine HIV testing of 16-65 year olds in more general healthcare settings in parts of the country with relatively high rates of HIV (more than 2 per thousand individuals diagnosed locally). The HINTS Study investigates the utility, feasibility and acceptability, to patients and staff, of offering routine HIV testing in four general medical settings, all set in areas of high HIV prevalence. The settings comprise: Primary Care, Outpatients, an Acute Care Unit and an Emergency Department.</brief_summary>
