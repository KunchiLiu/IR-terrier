	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Efficacy in HELLP I Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of HELLP syndrome usually is restricted to measures of support and treatment of complications. In 2005, in a subgroup analysis we showed that, among patients with HELLP 1, there were a shorter average time to platelet recovery and less duration of hospitalization in women who received dexamethasone therapy, however the importance of this finding is diminished because this was an unplanned analysis and the severity of the disease was not taken into account at randomization.</detailed_description>
