	<brief_summary>Objective. Capsular contracture is a frequent complication after breast implantation with unclear etiology. Summary Background Data: Microorganisms may trigger chronic periimplant inflammation with subsequent capsular fibrosis. Study Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that with sonication adherent microorganisms can be detected on removed implants . Methods: In a prospective multicentre study all breast implants explanted are collected to be analyzed by sonication. The resulting culture results are correlated with patient, surgical and implant characteristics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is performed in order to find a correlation between the degree of capsular fibrosis and presence of biofilm bacteria on the surface of the implant.</detailed_description>
