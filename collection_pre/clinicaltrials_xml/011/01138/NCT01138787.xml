	<brief_summary>Rationale: Consuming Plant Sterols (PS) fortified foods is widely accepted as easy to apply, life-style change to combat modestly elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. PS are typically formulated as PS fatty acid ester (PSE) from margarines. In this study, PS will be formulated in a new innovative type spread. To confirm that the new spread results in a comparable cholesterol absorption inhibition as the reference product a dual isotope cholesterol study is planned, prior to any larger efficacy study. Primary objective: Cholesterol absorption inhibition (%) calculated from plasma concentration vs. time curves from labeled cholesterol, for the PS or PSE containing products, compared to a control product without PS or PSE. Secondary objectives: PK parameters for cholesterol as derived from the plasma concentration vs. time curves. Study design: Acute, single dose, double-blind, randomized, cross-over. Study population: 18 healthy, non-obese men (BMI 20-27 kg∙m-2, age range 20 - 65 yr) Test products: PS (2250 mg) formulated in innovatively processed spread (30 g); PSE (2250 mg PS) reference product (30 g); Control product without PS or PSE (30 g) Intervention: Three study periods during which a single dose of either Test, Reference or Control (regular light spread) spreads will be consumed together with standard breakfast. At each study period, 50 mg of D7-cholesterol is added to the meal and 30 mg of 13C-cholesterol is injected to measure cholesterol absorption. Before and four times after consumption of each spread, blood samples will be taken at 24 h intervals up to 7 days. Key parameters: Enrichments of labeled cholesterol isotopes as determined by GCMS and IRMS. Fractional absorption is determined by the ratio of the two isotopes in plasma cholesterol after 7 days.</brief_summary>
