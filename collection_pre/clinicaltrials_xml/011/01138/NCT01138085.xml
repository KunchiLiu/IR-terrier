	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase 1 dose-escalation open-label study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and regimen for the combination of the orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 and the orally administered AKT kinase inhibitor GSK2141795. The study consists of two parts. Part 1A will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a Zone-Based, modified 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure. The starting dose (Zone 1, Cohort 1) will be 0.5mg GSK1120212 combined with 25mg GSK2141795. Dose escalation will continue based on predefined parameters until a MTD is established. The initial regimen for dose escalation in Part 1A will be continuous oral daily dosing. Once the continuous daily dosing MTD or RP2D has been established in Part 1A, Part 1B will explore alternate dosing schedule(s) in which the dosing schedule may be adjusted for either GSK1120212 or GSK2141795. Dose escalation will proceed using a 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure until an MTD or RP2D of that alternate schedule is defined. Part 2 will explore further in specific tumor types the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of the combination of GSK1120212 and GSK2141795 at the recommended dose(s) and regimen(s) identified in Part 1.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1 Dose Escalation Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all of the following criteria: Male or female 18 years or older, at the time of signing the informed consent. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy that is not responsive to standard therapies or for which there is no approved or curative therapy or for subjects who refuse standard therapy (Part 1A). Part 1B subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of one of the following (documented lab results confirming mutational status must be available at Screening): colorectal cancer (CRC): KRAS mutation nonsmall cell lung (NSCLC): KRAS mutation Pancreatic: no mutational status specified Endometrial: no mutational status specified Ovarian: no mutational status specified Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: no mutational status specified BRAF wild type melanoma (preferentially enrolled to Part 2) BRAF inhibitor failure melanoma. This includes BRAFmutant melanoma that is either initially refractory to BRAFinhibitor therapy OR that Initially responds to BRAFinhibitor therapy but eventually develops documented radiographic progression to a BRAF inhibitor while on therapy Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (preferentially enrolled to Part 2) NOTE: Subjects who do not meet one of the categories described above but who have molecular evidence suggesting benefit from the study drugs may be considered for enrollment after discussion with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor. Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. Must agree to collection of blood samples for the evaluation of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) (Part 1B or Part 2). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] greater than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml [less than 140 pmol/L] is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 7.3.2 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Additionally, women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until four weeks after the last dose of study medication. Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drugdrug interaction and should only be used in combination with the alternative methods outlined in Section 8.1.1. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until four months after the last dose of study medication. Adequate organ system function as defined in protocol. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 X 10 to the ninth/L Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.5 g/dL Platelets greater than or equal to 75 X 10 to the ninth/L Prothrombin time (PT) / International Normalized Ratio (INR) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) less than or equal to 1.1 X ULN Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (isolated bilirubin greater than 1.5 x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35 percent) AST and ALT less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN Albumin greater than 2.5 g/dL Creatinine less than or equal to ULN OR Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min OR 24hour urine creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min Fasting Serum Glucose les than 126mg/dL Cardiac Ejection fraction greater than or equal to lower limit of normal (LLN) by ECHO Inclusion Criteria for Part 2 Expansion Cohort: Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of one of the following: Triple negative (estrogen receptor(ER)/ progesterone receptor(PR)/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) breast cancer in the locally advanced or metastatic setting BRAFwild type melanoma. Based on emerging data, subjects with these tumor histologies may be required to meet specific genetic selection criteria if those criteria are felt to improve the likelihood that a given subject will respond to study drug(s). If this is to occur, the site and the Investigational Review Board (IRB) will be notified but this change will not constitute a protocol amendment. Known Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) status of tumor. At least 6 of the subjects enrolled in Stage 1 with each tumor type will have PTEN deficiency while at least 6 others will be PTEN wild type. If the subject's tumor PTEN status was previously determined by an acceptable, analytically validated assay (i.e., Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), sequencing, copy number analysis) then PTEN by IHC at Screening will not need to be repeated for the purpose of enrollment in this study. However, archival tumor tissue or tissue from a fresh biopsy specimen should be submitted for confirmation of PTEN status by a central laboratory using IHC. If PTEN status was not previously determined, archival tissue from a previous tumor biopsy specimen must be available for PTEN IHC analysis; if archival tissue is not available or found to not contain tumor tissue, a fresh biopsy is required to obtain tumor tissue for testing. Subjects in Part 2 that have been previously diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes must also meet the additional following criteria: Diagnosis of diabetes greater than or equal to 6 months prior to enrolment HbA1C less than or equal to 8 percent at Screening visit Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or other anticancer therapy including investigational drugs within 28 days or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter prior to the first dose of any one of the investigational drugs described in this study.
