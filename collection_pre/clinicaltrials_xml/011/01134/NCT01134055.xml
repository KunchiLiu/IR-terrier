	<brief_title>Dose Ranging Study of Pazopanib to Treat Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MD7110852 is a Phase 2b dose-ranging study designed to demonstrate the 1 year efficacy and safety of pazopanib eye drops for the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration (AMD) in subjects whose disease is currently managed with anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injection therapy. Eye drop regimens are double-masked with placebo eye drops and will have access to open-label ranibizumab IVT injection if needed. The ranibizumab IVT injection every 4 weeks control arm is open-label.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and women aged ≥50 years. Active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion secondary to AMD in study eye: Total lesion area ≤12 disc areas with CNV ≥50% total lesion area. AntiVEGF intravitreal injection experienced and in need of retreatment. Bestcorrected visual acuity of at least 24 letters (equates to approximately 20/320 Snellen equivalents or better). Prior ocular investigational drug/device for choroidal neovascularization, photodynamic therapy, radiation, subfoveal or juxtafoveal focal laser photocoagulation. Prior failure to antiVEGF intravitreal injection therapy. Recent ocular investigational drug/device for nonCNV condition. Prior ocular surgeries (vitrectomy, scleral buckle, or glaucoma filtering/shunt surgery). Cataract surgery permitted if ≥3 months and has posterior chamber intraocular lens. Centerfovea involvement of any of the following: fibrosis, atrophy, serous retinal pigment epithelial detachment, or retinal pigment epithelial tear. CNV in either eye due to other causes. Clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema. Recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. Uncontrolled hypertension in spite of antihypertensive medications.</criteria>
