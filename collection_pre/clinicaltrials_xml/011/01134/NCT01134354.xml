	<brief_summary>Design: Prediction trial, up to 10 sites in Asia and Europe Goal: To better understand the "success" or "failure" after orthopedic trauma surgery by developing a model that can be applied clinically as a user-friendly "baseline" questionnaire - capable of predicting "success" or "failure" based on a patient's pre-surgical expectations of their final outcome and to validate a novel outcomes measure (TOM). Primary aim: To assess the psychometric properties of predictive validity, internal consistency and reproducibility of the trauma expectation factor (TEF) in the Eurasian population. Secondary aim: To assess the psychometric properties of criterion validity, internal consistency,reproducibility, and sensitivity to change of the TOM in the Eurasian population. Key questions related to patient and surgeon expectations: - How different, or similar, are patient and surgeon expectations? - Do expectations change over time? - Do patient expectations predict outcomes in validated measures use today?</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Isolated ankle or distal tibia fracture Scheduled for and undergoing one of the following surgeries for their fracture: Open fracture and internal fixation (ORIF) external fixation (EF) EF followed by ORIF 18 years of age or older Understand and read country national language at elementary level Able to understand the purpose of the clinical trial, Able and willing to conduct all followup visits Signed informed consent Subject has previously undergone internal fixation surgery for this ankle/distal tibia fracture. Subject has disease entity, or condition that precludes likelihood of bony union (e.g., metastatic cancer, metabolic bone disease). Subject has severe dementia or other severe mental health problem that may preclude him/her from completing study questionnaires. Subject is participating in other competing clinical research that may interfere with participation in this research. Subject is unlikely to attend study related followup visits. Subject has polytrauma (more than one organ system compromised) Subject has additional fracture(s) other than ankle fracture Subject is a prisoner Fracture occurred more than 28 days before surgery</criteria>
