	<brief_summary>This is a single centre, open-label phase I trial to investigate the effects of moderate to severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in comparison with healthy volunteers. Furthermore the short-term safety and tolerability of a single dose of prucalopride will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Prucalopride in Subjects With Moderate and Severe Hepatic Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this phase I trial two groups of 6 to 8 hepatically impaired subjects will be evaluated. The first group are the moderate hepatic impairment (Grade B) subjects and the second group the severe hepatic impairment (grade C) subjects. Subjects for both groups will be recruited and treated in parallel. After all subjects with hepatic impairment completed the treatment a third group with matching healthy volunteers will be recruited. Eight healthy subjects will be selected matching for age, gender and weight (BMI based). The subjects will receive a single dose of 2 mg prucalopride in the morning after overnight fasting followed by the consumption of a standard breakfast after 2 hours. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of blood samples will be done immediately before and at a specific timepoint up to 120h post-dosing. Urine samples will be taken to determine prucalopride. Adverse events, including serious adverse events, will be reported from signing the Informed Consent until the last visit. Safety blood samples and a urine sample for urinalysis will be taken.</detailed_description>
