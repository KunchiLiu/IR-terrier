	<detailed_description>The goal of this research is to develop and test innovative strategies to help prevent unhealthy weight gain in college students attending 2-year community or technical colleges. The intervention we propose for Phase 2, and will refine through our formative experiences in Phase 1, will be based on social ecological and social networks models with students randomized to conditions. Students (n=440) with BMIs between 20.0 and 34.9 will be recruited to participate in an intervention trial that lasts 24 months. After the initial screening and consent procedures, students will complete baseline measures that include: assessment of body composition; blood pressure and a blood draw; a behavioral and psychosocial survey; medical and weight history and two 24-hour online dietary recalls. After the completion of baseline assessments, students will be randomized into treatment or control conditions. Students randomized into the intervention condition will participate in a 1-credit course offered through their 2-year college that focuses on eating, activity, sleep and stress management as ways to help maintain or achieve a healthy weight; three course sections will be offered to accommodate students' scheduling needs and learning preferences. A web-based social network and support component will be introduced as part of this course and will continue as the intervention channel for 20 months following the 1-credit course. This supported intervention phase will use a study-designed website to reinforce, inform and encourage exchange and support between all intervention participants. Students will be asked to track their weight and weight-control behaviors on the website and intervention staff will interact with participants electronically or through phone calls offering encouragement and helping with problem solving. Control students will receive their health assessments and usual care including existing public health information on maintaining a healthy weight and information regarding health services offered on their school's campus. The effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention approaches will be evaluated. The primary aim is to examine the effectiveness of a 24-month weight gain prevention intervention to positively affect BMI in 2-year college students. Our hypothesis is that students randomized to an intervention condition will experience a smaller increase in mean BMI post treatment, as compared to students randomized to the control condition. The secondary aims of this study are to: 1) Examine the effectiveness of a weight gain prevention intervention to positively affect weight in 2-year college students' and 2) compare the effects of the intervention and control groups with regard to change in BMI and weight from baseline to four months and from baseline to 12 months.</detailed_description>
