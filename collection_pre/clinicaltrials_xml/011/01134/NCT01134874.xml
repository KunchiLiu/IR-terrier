	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to compare the changes in body weight between a technology-based system, an in-person behavioral weight loss intervention, and a combination of both during a 12 month behavioral weight loss intervention in adults. Sedentary, healthy overweight and obese adults will be recruited to participate. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6, and 12 months. This is a randomized trial in which participants will be randomized to one of three groups: standard behavioral weight loss (SBWL), standard behavioral weight loss plus technology (SBWL+TECH), and technology alone alone (TECH).</brief_summary>
