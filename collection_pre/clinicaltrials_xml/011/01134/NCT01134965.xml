	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of multiple doses of flibanserin on the single dose pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy female and male volunteers. Digoxin is a narrow therapeutic index drug for which a large number of relevant drug-drug interactions are known. Flibanserin is now under evaluation in postmenopausal women which increases the likelihood that flibanserin and digoxin will be administered together in the clinical setting.</brief_summary>
