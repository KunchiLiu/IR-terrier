	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to gain insight into the neural mechanisms of learning multiple tasks. By examination of cognitive and behavioral output during the performance and learning of several computer maze tasks, and through a detailed examination of the neural activity obtained from functional near-infrared (fNIR) and electroencephalography (EEG), it may be possible to gain insight into the impact of the amount of practice and the organization of practice has on learning fine motor skills. This insight may provide direction as to how to better develop instructional and rehabilitation protocols in addition to clinical interventions to facilitate recovery of function, relearning and transfer of cognitive and fine motor skills based upon neural responses to physical practice.</brief_summary>
