	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that implementation of a comprehensive handoff program (CHP) - i.e., implementation of a computerized handoff tool along with teamwork training for pediatric residents on inpatient units at Children's Hospital Boston - will lead to reductions in resident miscommunications / medical errors and improvements in workflow and experience on the wards.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementing a Comprehensive Handoff Program to Improve Pediatric Patient Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following collection of baseline data on two inpatient pediatric wards, teamwork training is to be provided to all pediatric residents. On our primary intervention unit, this will be accompanied by the introduction of a new computerized handoff tool that facilitates accurate transmission of data. The effects of this combined intervention on safety and workflow will be assessed on the primary intervention ward as compared with the historical control unit and the concurrent unit that received teamwork training without the computerized tool.</detailed_description>
