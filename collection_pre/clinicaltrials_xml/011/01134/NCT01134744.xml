	<brief_title>Evaluating Validity of Clinical Criteria for Requesting Chest X-Rays in Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, a Chest x-ray is obtained from all trauma patients having suspicion to chest trauma. The indications for such radiographs are not well defined. This results in a large number of unnecessary chest radiographs being obtained. Our goal was to identify the clinical criteria for requesting a chest x-ray in a patient with blunt trauma and its findings such as clinical signs with a high sensitivity could be used in a larger study to codify the final criteria.</detailed_description>
