	<brief_summary>The question that prompted this study is the extent to which results from clinical trials can be translated into everyday practice (external validity). First and foremost are questions about tolerability and the efficacy of an antiretroviral combination treatment with Viramune and other antiretroviral partners. In particular, adverse events will be recorded depending on gender and the therapeutic effect will be monitored via the course of viral load and improvement of the immune system, based on the CD4 cell count.</brief_summary>
