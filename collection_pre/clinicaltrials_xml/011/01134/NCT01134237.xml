	<brief_title>Intrapleural Urokinase for Retained Hemothorax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will recruit 32 patients in this study. The patients with retained hemothorax will be randomly divided into the urokinase group and the placebo group. In the urokinase group, urokinase 100,000 IU in 100 mL NaCl will be injected into the intrapleural space. We will record the daily drainage amount and evaluate the therapeutic effect by the chest X-ray. The therapeutic effect, safety, hospital stay, and medical cost between the two groups will be compared. This study will be done in four medical centers in northern Taiwan.</detailed_description>
