	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the alternative current and the direct current signal changes of photoplethysmography between both feet during one side lumbar sympathetic block. The hypothesis is that signal changes occur earlier than other indices to decide whether it is successful following lumbar sympathetic block on only one-side.</brief_summary>
