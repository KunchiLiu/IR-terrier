	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine, at 3 years of life, how the neurologic and functional outcomes in infants with single ventricles are different when comparing children treated with the Hybrid strategy to the Norwood strategy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid Versus Norwood Management Strategies in Infants Undergoing Single Ventricle Palliation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurologic deficits in children with single ventricle physiology are believed to be associated with the reconstruction of the aortic arch during the initial Norwood procedure as a neonate. In the last few years, a new management strategy (the 'Hybrid' strategy) has been proposed which defers the aortic arch reconstruction to a second stage procedure at 4-6 months of age. Proponents of the Hybrid strategy assert that the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest in the neonatal period will avoid neurologic injury in the critical neonatal period and thereby result in superior long-term neurologic outcomes. We are testing whether the Hybrid management strategy is associated with superior neurologic outcomes or not.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of functional single ventricle anatomy amenable to Norwood or Hybrid first stage palliation. 2. Informed consent of parent(s) or legal guardian. 1. Preoperative identification of anatomy rendering either a Norwood or Hybrid procedure clinically inappropriate; 2. Recent history of significant cerebral bleed or necrotizing enterocolitis; 3. Severe hemodynamic instability; 4. Any other major congenital abnormality (i.e. congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tracheoesophageal fistula) or clinically significant acquired extracardiac disorder (e.g. meconium aspiration with need for high frequency ventilation, persistent renal failure requiring dialysis).</criteria>
