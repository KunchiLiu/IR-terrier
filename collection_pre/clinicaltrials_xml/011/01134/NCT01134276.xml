	<brief_summary>Preoperative biliary drainage methods include percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD), and endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD). Endoscopic biliary drainages often induce peritumoral inflammation and it increase difficulties in determining a proper resection margin. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinicopathological outcomes according to the methods of preoperative biliary drainage in periampullary cancers causing obstructive jaundice, and to find out a proper biliary drainage method.</brief_summary>
