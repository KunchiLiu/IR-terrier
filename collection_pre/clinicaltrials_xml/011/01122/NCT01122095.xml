	<brief_title>Cross-sectional Evaluation of Biological Markers of Cardiovascular Disease in Children and Adolescents With Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis was initially considered an inflammatory condition primarily of the skin. However, advances in medical knowledge have allowed insight into the wide-ranging systemic effects of long-term uncontrolled inflammation, thus shifting the concept of psoriasis from an inflammatory disease restricted to the skin to a systemic process. Adults w/ psoriasis have higher rates of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking and the prevalence of each risk factor increases as the extent of psoriasis increases.1 It is uncertain if any of this relates to a behavioral reaction to having psoriasis or as a separate part of the disease process. Inflammation has a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease most noted by multiple observational studies of psoriasis patients which demonstrate an increased risk of arterial or venous events, notably myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, pulmonary emboli, cardiovascular death or mortality overall. Specifically, Gelfand et. al. show an increased relative risk for myocardial infarction and an increased hazard ratio for mortality in patients with severe psoriasis, but most notably, show highest risk in younger adult patients. There is a paucity of data on risks with psoriasis in the pediatric and adolescent age group.</detailed_description>
