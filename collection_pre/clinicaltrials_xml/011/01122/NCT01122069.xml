	<brief_summary>In patients with acute myocardial infarction, treatment logistics are primarily defined based upon ST segment shift in the electrocardiogram. While patients with ST elevation (STEMI) are forwarded to immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, patients without ST elevation (NSTEMI) are initially medically treated and recommended coronary angiography within 48-72 hours. Early invasive treatment has been found cost-effective in intermediate and high-risk NSTEMI patients and current guidelines recommend use of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score to identify patients who will benefit from early intervention due to high risk of new infraction and cardiovascular death. However, new research has suggested that TIMI risk score may not always identify patients with severe angiographic disease. The purpose of this study was to assess if contrast echocardiography could be used to identify NSTEMI patients with angiographically severe disease independent of their TIMI risk score.</brief_summary>
