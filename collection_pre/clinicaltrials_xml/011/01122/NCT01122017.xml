	<brief_title>A Modified (Retro-Tubercle) Opening Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy Versus the Conventional Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are various methods for correcting varus deformity; therefore the best surgical method must be individualized. We concluded that in a varus knee where only correction in the coronal plane without patella infra, changes in Q- angle, tibial plateau inclination is all that is needed, a retro- tubercle medial opening- wedge osteotomy is the preferred approach.</detailed_description>
