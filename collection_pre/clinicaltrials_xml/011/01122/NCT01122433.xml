	<brief_title>Airway Management Study to Evaluate the C-MAC Video Laryngoscope as an Alternative to the Direct Laryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unanticipated difficulties during tracheal intubation and failure to intubate are among the leading causes of anaesthesia related morbidity and mortality. Using the technique of video laryngoscopy, the alignment of the oral and pharyngeal axis to facilitate endotracheal intubation is obsolete. In this study we evaluate the C-MAC video laryngoscope (STORZ, Tuttlingen, Germany) for endotracheal intubation in difficult intubation situations (Cormack &amp; Lehane (CL) grade 3 and 4) validated by Macintosh laryngoscope. We hypothesize that endotracheal intubation is possible using the C-MAC in patients after failed direct laryngoscopy. We also examine whether visualisation of the glottis is improved with this device compared to direct laryngoscopy and possible complications such as soft tissue injury.</detailed_description>
