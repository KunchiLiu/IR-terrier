	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of the Verinata Health Test to detect fetal Trisomy 21 (T21) compared to karyotype results obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Secondary objectives are to assess performance of the test to detect male gender (XY) and other less common aneuploidies (Trisomy 13 (T13), Trisomy 18 (T18), and Turner Syndrome (45, X)) compared to clinical fetal karyotype.</brief_summary>
