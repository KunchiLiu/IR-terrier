	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma. Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gamma-Secretase/Notch Signalling Pathway Inhibitor RO4929097 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). (Group A) II. Efficiency of neurosphere generation after pretreatment with RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097). (Group B) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Radiographic response rate. (Group A) II. Toxicities associated with this regimen. (Group A) III. Overall survival. (Group A) IV. Expression levels of Notch pathway components and downstream targets. (Group B) V. Tumor propagation. An extension of lifespan by 50% in tumor bearing mice (mice bearing fresh tumor tissue). (Group B) VI. Patient event-free survival in correlation with expression levels of Notch pathway components and downstream targets. VII. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6). VIII. Toxicities associated with this regimen. IX. Overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. GROUP A: Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP B (surgical resection indicated): Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days -6 to -1. Patients undergo surgical resection on day 0. Within 30 days after surgical resection, patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 as in Group A. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically proven glioblastoma which is progressive or recurrent following radiation therapy +/ chemotherapy Patients must have measurable contrastenhancing progressive or recurrent glioblastoma by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging within two weeks of starting treatment; patient must be able to tolerate MRIs GROUP B PATIENTS ONLY: Patients must be eligible for surgical resection according to the following criteria: Expectation that the surgeon can resect &gt;= 50% of the Gdenhancing tumor with low risk of inducing neurological injury Absence of hematologic, cardiac or other medical contraindications to surgery Surgery must take place MondayThursday with the exception of patients being treated at Cleveland Clinic/University Hospitals: these patients may undergo surgery MondayFriday Patients must have a tumor size &gt;= 2.5 cm in diameter in two perpendicular planes in order to enable correlative studies Paraffin embedded tissue must be available from initial surgical resection at diagnosis (prior to any treatment) Patients may have an unlimited number of prior therapy regimens but no prior gammasecretase inhibitors Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy; the following intervals from previous treatments are required to be eligible: 3 months from the completion of radiation 6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy 3 weeks from a nonnitrosourea chemotherapy 4 weeks from any investigational (not Food and Drug Administration [FDA]approved) agents 2 weeks from administration of a noncytotoxic, FDAapproved agent (e.g., small molecule targeted therapy, thalidomide, bevacizumab, etc.) Patients may not be on an enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug (EIAED); if previously on an EIAED, patient must be off for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of RO4929097 Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 60% (i.e. the patient must be able to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others) Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin =&lt;

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately PREGNANCY TESTING: Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 1014 days prior to treatment start and be required to agree to have the test repeated within 24 hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will also be administered every 4 weeks (within 24 hours prior to starting every cycle) if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing RO4929097, the investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the potential of RO4929097 to cause serious or lifethreatening birth defects Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows: Patients with regular menses Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding Women who have had tubal ligation Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the following reasons: The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24 consecutive months Patients may not be breastfeeding Patients must have no concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or bladder; patients with prior malignancies must be diseasefree for &gt;= five years Patients must have a Mini Mental State Exam score of &gt;= 15 Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety, are ineligible Patients with prior treatment with gammasecretase inhibitors are ineligible Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to RO4929097 or other agents used in the study are ineligible Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption are ineligible;
