	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Intravenous Artesunate for Severe Malaria Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current first line treatment for severe malaria in Uganda is intravenous quinine with artemisinin derivatives as an alternative. Intravenous artesunate, a water soluble artemisinin derivative is more effective than quinine with faster schizonticidal action and improved clinical outcome. It is generally well tolerated and safe. This study aims is to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of IV artesunate in treatment of severe malaria in adults admitted to Mulago National Referral and Teaching hospital, Uganda.</detailed_description>
