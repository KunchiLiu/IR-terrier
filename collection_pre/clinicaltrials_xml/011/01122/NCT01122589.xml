	<detailed_description>Quitting smoking reduces the risks of developing smoking related illnesses as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with these illnesses. In 2006 approximately 44.5 million American adults smoked an overall prevalence of 20.8%. The prevalence is much higher among incarcerated populations and approximately 80% of the women in RI smoked prior to incarceration. This proposal is designed to evaluate an intervention utilizing Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to provide the skills necessary to maintain smoking abstinence after release. MI utilizes specific techniques for providing feedback on an individual's risk and self efficacy. CBT provides the skills necessary to maintain abstinence after release. The investigators plan to recruit 350 men and women from the Rhode Island Department of Corrections and randomize them to two interventions: an Intentional Behavioral Intervention (IBI) with 6 sessions of in jail MI/CBT and two post release booster sessions compared to CONcise Tapes Reviewing Obstacles to healthy Living (CONTROL) group which will receive a smoking cessation pamphlet and watch a series of six weekly 30-45 minutes general wellness videos.</detailed_description>
