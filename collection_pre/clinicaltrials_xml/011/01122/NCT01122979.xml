	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: &gt;To obtain an estimation for both treatment groups of the proportion of patients that reach the target of HbA1c &lt;= 7% without confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemia in each treatment group. Secondary Objectives: - Glycemic control, measured by HbA1c and FPG (fasting plasma glucose) at baseline and after each period of treatment. - Incidence of confirmed symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia. - Incidence of confirmed severe hypoglycemia (&lt; 36mg/dL or need of help to recover). &gt;Weight variation for each period of treatment. - Creatinine clearance at baseline and after each period of treatment. - Overall safety: Incidence of adverse events.</brief_summary>
