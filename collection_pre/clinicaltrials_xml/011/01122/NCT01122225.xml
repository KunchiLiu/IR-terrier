	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major organ failure in septic shock. Current medical tests (serum creatinine and urea) cannot identify AKI until approximately 48 hours after it occurs. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may be able to predict ischemic AKI more effectively and faster than serum creatinine and urea levels. The purpose of this study is to take a blood sample from patients at admission and then at 24 and 48 hours after to test their plasma for NGAL and compare the NGAL levels to their creatinine and urea levels. The investigators hypothesize that NGAL is an earlier marker to classify the kidney failure as acute tubular necrosis or pre-renal azotemia than creatinine and urea.</brief_summary>
