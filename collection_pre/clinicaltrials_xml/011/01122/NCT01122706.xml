	<brief_summary>Background: Excessive exposure to psychosocial stress can be a potent trigger for somatic diseases and psychological disorders, a cause for missing work, and eventually lead to high economic loss. Therefore, for health and economic reasons the assessment of effectiveness of stress preventive interventions is of high relevance. According to several clinical studies, Taiji, a Chinese form of mindful and gentle movements, can significantly reduce symptoms of somatic diseases and psychological disorders. Some recently conducted Taiji-studies with healthy subjects indicate a stress protective effect. However, the stress protective impact of Taiji regarding psychosocial stress has not yet been examined. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of a 12 week Taiji training as a stress prevention program by measuring psychosocial stress reactivity in a laboratory setting, as well as the subjective perception of stress and coping-resources in daily life of 70 healthy volunteers. Hypothesis: Healthy subjects attending a 12 week Taiji course (frequency: twice a week for 1h) will show significantly reduced psychobiological reactivity, decreased stress perception and increased coping-resources on a standardized psychosocial stress test compared with healthy subject of the waiting list.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Excessive exposure to psychosocial stress can be a potent trigger for somatic diseases and psychological disorders, a cause for missing work, and eventually lead to high economic loss. Therefore, for health and economic reasons the assessment of effectiveness of stress preventive interventions is of high relevance. According to several clinical studies, Taiji, a Chinese form of mindful and gentle movements, can significantly reduce symptoms of somatic diseases and psychological disorders. Some recent Taiji-studies with healthy subjects indicate a stress protective effect. However, since these findings mainly focus on effects during or immediately after a Taiji training session, their study designs and outcome measures are not comparable with existing stress prevention efficacy studies and their sample sizes are generally too small, the present available results remain inconclusive. Also, the impact of a Taiji training on psychosocial stress has not been assessed so far. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 12 week Taiji training as a stress prevention program by measuring psychosocial stress reactivity in a laboratory setting, subjective perception of stress and coping-resources of 70 healthy subjects in daily life. Methods: The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used to measure the psychobiological stress reactivity. Salivary cortisol, alpha amylase, heart rate and heart rate variability will be measured in each subject to asses stress reactivity, Also, the primary appraisal secondary appraisal (PASA) questionnaire and the multidimensional mood questionnaire (MDBF) will be used to assess psychological stress reactivity, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure perceived stressfulness. Additionally to the TSST setting, pre-, post-intervention and 2 months follow up measurements will be taken. The following tools will be used: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Stress Reactivity Scale (SRS)(to assess perceived stress), and self-efficacy-expectancy questionnaire (SWE), questionnaire for measuring wellbeing (FEW-16), Freiburg mindfulness inventory (FMI) and self compassion scale (SCS) (to assess perceived coping resources).</detailed_description>
