	<brief_summary>Background: Children's emotional eating is related to greater BMI and less healthy diet but little is known about the early development of this behavior. Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationships between preschool children's emotional eating and parental feeding practices using experimental manipulation of child mood and food intake in a laboratory setting. Design: 25 3-5 year old children and their mothers sat together and ate a standard meal to satiety. Mothers completed questionnaires about their feeding practices. Children were assigned to a control or negative mood condition. Children's consumption of snack foods in the absence of hunger was measured.</brief_summary>
