	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Janus OPTIMA Tacrolimus-Eluting Stent (Optima TES, CID) for the treatment of de novo coronary lesions when associated with short-term (two months) dual antiplatelet (aspirin + clopidogrel) regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brazilian and Italian Evaluation of Safety Using Tacrolimus-eluting Stent With Short-term Dual Antiplatelet Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is a post-market, prospective, international, two-center, single arm study involving 60 patients with single, de novo non-complex coronary lesions. Enrolled patients will be asked to return for follow-up clinical evaluation at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. At 3 months there will be an additional follow-up by phone contact. Furthermore, the first 15 patients should undergo angiographic and OCT follow-up at two months. The remaining 45 patients should undergo angiographic and IVUS follow-up at 8 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with &gt;18 years of age; Symptoms of stable or unstable angina and/or presence of a positive functional test for ischemia; Presence of a single de novo target lesion located in a native coronary vessel suitable for percutaneous treatment with the study stents; Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft(CABG)surgery; The subject is willing to sign a written informed consent prior to procedure, and is willing to undergo ALL study protocol followups,including angiographic, IVUS and OCT assessments. Single, de novo lesion Target lesion located in a major epicardial coronary vessel with reference of 2.53.5mm in diameter (by online QCA) Target lesions ≤19mm in length (by visual estimation) that can be treated (covered) by one single study stent (19 or 24mm in length); ≥50% and &lt;100% diameter stenosis; TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade ≥2.

Target lesion or vessel with angiographic evidence of moderate or severe calcification; Presence of severe tortuosity; Presence of severe angulation (&gt;60o); Presence of intraluminal thrombus; Target lesion involving a bifurcation (side branch ≥2.0mm); Target lesion located in the left main stem; Aortoostial lesion location; Target lesion involving a side branch with reference diameter≥2.0mm; Presence of a significant stenosis (&gt;40%) in the target vessel either proximal or distal to the target lesion that will be untreated; Previous placement of a stent within 10mm of the target lesion; Total occlusion (TIMI flow grade 0 or 1); Target lesion located in an arterial or vein graft; Target lesion due to instent restenosis; Coronary anatomy unsuitable for percutaneous treatment with implantation of the available study stents.</criteria>
