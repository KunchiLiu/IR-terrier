	<brief_summary>The surgical treatment of wrist fractures (distal radius bone) has been changed by the introduction of a new plate design, the locking plate. This results in improved fixation and stabilisation of the fracture fragments allowing early movement. This type of plate has been increasingly used throughout the world but questions have been raised regarding the potential complications of the surgery, particularly nerve and tendon injury. The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital has treated over 250 distal radial fractures with this type of plate. The investigators plan to recall these patients to asses their long term function, general satisfaction and radiological results.</brief_summary>
