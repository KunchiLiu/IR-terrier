Cohorts will continue to be enrolled at the next higher dose level until the highest dose level (3 mg) has been achieved or until the study is discontinued due to adverse events or Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score of &gt;8. A 0.03 mg dose will also be tested. A 0.01 mg dose will be tested if 4 or more subjects experience 1 or more bowel movements within the 24 hour period post dose in the 0.03 mg dosing cohort</detailed_description>
