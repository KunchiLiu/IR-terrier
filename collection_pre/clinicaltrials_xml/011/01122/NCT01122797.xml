	<brief_summary>Increasing evidence attests the influence of multiple metabolic genetic risk factors in the progression of alcoholic liver disease. Deleterious pathways involved in metabolism such as lipid peroxidation and cytokines have been implicated in promoting inflammation leading to fibrosis increase and liver injury progression. The aim of this study was to assess the role of rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism in the PNPLA3 gene in alcoholic liver disease patients.</brief_summary>
