	<criteria>Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of agerelated bilateral cataracts that are considered amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification cataract extraction. Subjects must require a spherical lens power from 10.00 D to 33.00 D Subjects must have the potential for corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/32 or better in both eyes, as documented by a Potential Acuity Meter Subjects with conditions with increased risk of zonular rupture, such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Zonular rupture during cataract surgery may affect postoperative centration, tilt, and stability of the lens. Subjects who have any active inflammation or edema (swelling) of the cornea, including but not limited to the following: keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and keratouveitis. Subjects with visually significant diabetic retinopathy (proliferative or nonproliferative) which reduces potential acuity to 20/32 or worse.</criteria>
