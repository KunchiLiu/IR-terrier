	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Ropivacaine Nebulization for Pain Control After Gynecologic Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a recent study the investigators found that nebulization of Ropivacaine 30 mg before or after gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery significantly reduces postoperative pain and postoperative morphine consumption. Ropivacaine was effectively administered with non-heating nebulizers (AeronebProÂ®). However, almost all patients still use morphine after surgery. The investigators hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine 150 mg may prevent the use of morphine after the laparoscopic ovarian cyst surgery.</detailed_description>
