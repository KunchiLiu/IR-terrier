	<brief_title>Comparison of Billroth-I and Roux-en-Y Reconstruction After Distal Subtotal Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most common procedure for the resection of gastric cancers located in middle or lower stomach is distal subtotal gastrectomy. However, the optimal reconstruction procedure after that has still not to be established. Although B-I reconstruction is most common method due to the safety and simplicity, the duodenal fluid may reflux into the remnant stomach which may contribute to the mucosal injury to remnant stomach and esophagus. Roux en Y reconstruction may reduce the reflux to remnant stomach due to the length of Roux en Y limb, although it is more complicated procedure. Therefore, we plan to collect 120 patients to compare the degree of reflux between Roux en Y and Billroth-I reconstructions after distal subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In addition, we compare the surgical outcome and quality of life between two groups.</detailed_description>
