	<brief_summary>TegaCHG is a multicentric randomized study aimed at evaluating the possibility that the use of TegaDerm CHG dressing may reduce the incidence of catheter related blood stream infections (CRBSI). It implies the comparison between the incidence of CRBSI in patients with central venous catheter dressed with TegaDerm without chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and with CHG. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of CRBSI and the secondary endpoints are: catheter colonization (growth of microbes from the culture of catheter tip, &gt; 15 CFU according to semi-quantitative method or &gt; 1000 CFU according to quantitative method); incidence of catheter exit site infection; occurrence of catheter related infections/sepsis or other severe infection-related complications; safety profile evaluation: occurrence of hypersensitivity to the dressing on the basis of local objectivity (erythema, edema, other) or on that of patient symptoms (itch, burning sensation); relating to the device performance: incidence of high/medium/low dressing edge lift, ability to visualize the catheter insertion site, easiness of removal, easiness of dressing application; incidence of unscheduled dressing change. The study hypothesis implies that the use of slow release device containing chlorhexidine may decrease the incidence of CRBSI. This has already been showed for chlorhexidine impregnated sponges. Scope of the study is to verify if this property is also true for TegaDerm CHG,which is a new chlorhexidine-releasing dressing in which the medication is directly released by an integrated transparent gel pad, so that the catheter exit site remains visible and easy to inspect without removing the dressing.</brief_summary>
