	<brief_summary>This is a research study for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma has returned (relapsed). Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that begins in white blood cells called plasma cells. Plasma cells make proteins that help fight infections. Current therapy for multiple myeloma includes high dose chemotherapy and autologous (patient's own cells) stem cell transplantation. There will be two parts (or phases) to this study: The purpose of the first part is to find the highest dose of a drug called lenalidomide (Revlimid®) that can be given in combination with high dose melphalan without causing severe adverse events. The purpose of the second part is to find out the effects of this treatment (good and bad) on multiple myeloma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and High Dose Melphalan Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide is a drug that interferes with the development of tiny blood vessels that help tumors grow. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma. It is also approved for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), another blood cancer. Other research studies using lenalidomide in combination with other drugs in subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma also show good response rate. High dose melphalan is approved by the FDA and is commonly used in multiple myeloma treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. This combination of lenalidomide, high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplantation has not been studied in newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma, so it is considered experimental. In research studies, "experimental" refers to a drug or procedure that has undergone basic laboratory testing and received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be tested in human subjects. A drug or procedure may be approved by the FDA for use in one disease or condition, but be considered experimental in other diseases or conditions. In this study, lenalidomide will be given together with melphalan (chemotherapy) with the hope that more disease will be killed before the stem cell transplant. Three months after the transplant, patients will take lenalidomide again with the hope that this will help prolong the time when the disease is in remission.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I: Patients with diagnosis of multiple myeloma at any stage of disease undergoing high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Phase II: Patients with myeloma undergoing a first high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation after achieving at least stable disease following induction therapy. Any induction regimen prior to transplantation is allowed. No more than 2 prior lines of therapy prior to transplantation are allowed. All previous therapy not associated with peripheral blood stem cell transplant, including radiation, hormonal therapy, and surgery, must have been discontinued 4 weeks prior to treatment in this study.
