	<brief_title>Dental Caries Management by Risk Assessment: Identification and Treatment of Risk Factors Among (IDF) Personnel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On the intervention group, which includes a couple of hundreds participants, a thorough caries management by risk assessment plan will be conducted. The risk assessment will include the following criteria: - Saliva check - Plaque control - Plaque acidity - Diet - Frequency of carbohydrate intake - Previous caries experience and present carious activity - Others (prosthetic/orthodontic appliances, systemic diseases etc.) After obtaining the data the patients will be categorized into 1 of 3 distinct risk level - low, medium, high. Each category will be treated according to a tailored treatment protocol: - Dietary instructions - Oral hygiene instructions - Antibacterial therapy - Fluorides - Restoration - Follow ups The control group will be treated according to standard protocol of treatment in the IDF dental clinics, which is based on removal the cavitated lesions, and lacks any reference to caries as a multifactorial infectious disease. We assume that personalized treatment of the disease, based on identifying risk factors will lower the number of patients with active disease.</detailed_description>
