	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to study the caecal intubation rate of a prototype ultra-thin colonoscope compared to a standard colonoscope and to study usefulness of this new colonoscope as a rescue instrument for failed initial colonoscopy with a standard colonoscope and to study the patient satisfaction scores using a validated endoscopy GHAA-9 for a new prototype colonoscope as compared to a standard colonoscope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of an Ultra-thin and Standard Colonoscope in Achieving Caecal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy is a common endoscopic procedure, widely used for the investigation of lower gastrointestinal tract diseases manifesting as altered bowel habit, per rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. It is used to diagnose colonic polyps, colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease to name a few examples. Colorectal cancer screening has been shown to decrease colorectal cancer. Despite this the uptake by the general population is suboptimal. A new prototype colonoscope from Olympus with an additional distal bending section was designed. The investigators hypothesize that its performance characteristics will be similar to a standard colonoscope with patient tolerability. This randomised control trial aims to invite patients attending their first outpatient colonoscopy and who are able to provide informed consent.(so they have had no prior experience) to assess the completion rate, patient and endoscopist satisfaction. Patients with prior colorectal surgery or previous colonoscopy were excluded.</detailed_description>
