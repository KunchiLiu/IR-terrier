	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel with or without cixutumumab works in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cixutumumab may kill cancer cells by blocking the action of a protein needed for cancer cell growth. Giving paclitaxel with or without cixutumumab may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel With or Without Cixutumumab as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of paclitaxel plus cixutumumab (IMC-A12) versus paclitaxel alone as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic esophagus or gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the overall survival of paclitaxel plus cixutumumab (IMC-A12) versus paclitaxel alone in this patient population. II. To evaluate the response rate of paclitaxel plus cixutumumab (IMC-A12) versus paclitaxel alone in this patient population. III. To evaluate the toxicity of cixutumumab (IMC-A12) plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in this patient population. IV. Exploratory analyses will assess potentially relevant cixutumumab (IMC-A12) pharmacodynamic biomarkers obtained from serum samples, including but not limited to, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-2, and IGFBP-3. OUTLINE: Patients are equally randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 day cycle. ARM II: Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 1 hour at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of every 28 day cycle and paclitaxel as in Arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding due to potential harm to fetus from cixutumumab (IMCA12) and paclitaxel; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 48 hours prior to registration to rule out pregnancy Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method or birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study therapy and for 3 months after the last dose of cixutumumab (IMCA12); should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Patients must have measurable disease Patients must have metastatic disease of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction Histologic, cytologic or radiologic documentation of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction; radiologic, endoscopic, histologic or cytologic evidence of locally recurrent or locally residual (postresection) disease is also permitted For the purposes of this study, undifferentiated adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous tumors will be considered as adenocarcinomas; in addition, tumors involving the gastroesophageal junction will be defined by the Siewert classification Patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors who are eligible: Adenocarcinoma of the esophageal junction (AEG) Type I: adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus which usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus, i.e., Barrett's esophagus, and may infiltrate the esophagogastric junction from above AEG Type II: true carcinoma of the cardia arising from the cardiac epithelium or short segments with intestinal metaplasia at the esophagogastric junction Patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors who are NOT eligible: AEG Type III: subcardial gastric carcinoma which infiltrates the esophagogastric junction and distal esophagus from below Patients must have received and progressed on one and only one line of prior systemic therapy for esophagus or esophagogastric cancer; this could have included one regimen for metastatic disease, or one regimen with radiotherapy for initially locally advanced disease; prior radiation therapy is permitted If patients progress or recur within 6 months of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, this will be considered one line of therapy; for patients progressing or recurring more than 6 months after neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, they will need to receive one line of therapy for recurrent disease to be eligible If patients receive one regimen in which a chemotherapy agent is dropped for toxicity without progression, this treatment will be considered one line of therapy; however, substitution or addition of a new agent will be considered a second line of therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin =&lt;

patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse Patients have received prior taxane or antiinsulin growth factor receptor (IGFR) therapy Patients must not have any of the following conditions: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus; patients with a history of diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided that their blood glucose is within normal range (fasting glucose =&lt; 160 mg/dL [8.8 mmol/L] or below the ULN and hemoglobin A1C =&lt; 7% [0.07 SI units]) and that they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition Recent major surgery, hormonal therapy (other than replacement) or chemotherapy, within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cixutumumab (IMCA12) Psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from giving informed consent Medical conditions such as active/uncontrolled infection (including HIV) or cardiac disease that would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient in the opinion of the treating physician; cardiac disease may include uncontrolled high blood pressure, unstable angina, or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia</criteria>
