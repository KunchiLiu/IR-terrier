	<brief_title>Feasibility of Online Adaptive Radiotherapy for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm multicentre feasibility trial in which the primary aim is to determine the compliance rate of patients to online adaptive radiotherapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer over multiple Australian and New Zealand centres. The compliance rate is defined as the proportion of patients successfully completing treatment without a major protocol deviation. Subject to the accrual being at least 40 patients in the first 2 years, accrual will continue until a total of 50 patients have been accrued. If this accrual target is not met, then consideration will be given to stopping the trial early due to poor accrual. Each patient will be followed-up until 2 years after the last patient's date of accrual. Assessments for toxicity and recurrence or progression will take place at four weeks after completion of treatment, then three monthly from the end of treatment for the first 12 months and then 6 monthly thereafter.</detailed_description>
