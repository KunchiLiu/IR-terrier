	<brief_title>Effects of Dihydrocapsiate on Adaptive and Diet-Induced Thermogenesis With a High Protein Very Low Calorie Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-six subjects will be recruited by public advertisement. Postmenopausal women and men over age 30 with a body mass index (BMI) between 27 to 35 kg/m2,and in good health by history, physical examination, and basic laboratory screening (complete blood count, serum chemistries, liver panel, and lipid panel) will be selected for study. Subjects with type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance will be excluded as will individuals who regularly drink more than one alcoholic beverage daily. Thirty-six men and women who meet the selection criteria below will be randomly assigned to one of three arms providing CH-19 at two dose levels per day vs. placebo capsules. This will be a prospectively randomized double blind study in which neither the subjects nor the clinical research personnel will be aware of whether the subjects will be assigned to placebo or dihydrocapsiate at two different doses. A total of 36 subjects will be divided among three groups. To keep the number of capsules taken by each subject constant, all subjects will take three capsules three times per day containing the appropriate number of active or placebo capsules and will be randomized after screening to one of three groups: - Group 1: Dihydrocapsiate 1 capsule and 2 placebo capsules three times a day within 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner. - Group 2: Dihydrocapsiate 3 capsules three times per day within 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner - Group 3: Placebo 3 capsules three times per day within 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner</detailed_description>
