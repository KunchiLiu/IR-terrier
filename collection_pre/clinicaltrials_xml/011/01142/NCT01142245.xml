	<brief_summary>The investigators previously showed that the use of a high-dose intravenous PPI regimen after endoscopic control of bleeding from peptic ulcers reduced rate of recurrent bleeding, decreased the need for endoscopic and surgical interventions and in general improved patients' outcomes. A trend towards reduced mortality associated with the use of high-dose intravenous PPI was also observed. Recent clinical trials from Asia have provided evidence that high-dose oral PPIs are associated with a reduction in rebleeding. Current meta-analysis suggests that both high dose (intravenous) and low dose (oral) PPIs effectively reduce rebleeding vs placebo. However, there has been no clinical study to compare IV infusion to oral PPI in this patient population. The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral Esomeprazole in patients with peptic ulcer hemorrhage who are at risk for recurrent bleeding. The investigators hypothesize that using IV infusion is superior to oral PPI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators previously showed that the use of a high-dose intravenous PPI regimen after endoscopic control of bleeding from peptic ulcers reduced rate of recurrent bleeding, decreased the need for endoscopic and surgical interventions and in general improved patients' outcomes.

Current meta-analysis suggests that both high dose (intravenous) and low dose (oral) PPIs effectively reduce rebleeding vs placebo. However, there has been no clinical study to compare IV infusion to oral PPI in this patient population. Endoscopic stigmata in bleeding peptic ulcers are prognostic and allow risk stratification. Patients with a clean ulcer base have a &lt; 5% risk of rebleeding; this increases progressively with a flat spot, adherent clot, non-bleeding visible vessel and active bleeding (55%). Early endoscopy in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers selects the high risk ulcers for therapy and evaluation of adjuvant PPI use.</detailed_description>
