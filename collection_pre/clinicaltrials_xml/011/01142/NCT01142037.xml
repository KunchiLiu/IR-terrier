	<brief_summary>Certain plant foods are high in furanocoumarins. Test tube and animal studies suggest that furanocoumarins may help prevent cancer. It is difficult to determine in humans if furanocoumarins do prevent cancer because there isn't an objective way to tell who has eaten these compounds. This study will develop a urine test to determine if an individual ate foods that contain furanocoumarins.</brief_summary>
