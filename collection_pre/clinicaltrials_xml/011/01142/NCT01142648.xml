	<brief_summary>According to our experience, electroencephalogram-based indices of anaesthetic state show elevated numbers after administration of sugammadex (new reversal of neuromuscular blockade). This can be due to altered anaesthetic state, or some kind of artefact. In this study, the phenomenon is evaluated in detail.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade is antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. BIS, Entropy and the biosignal collected from the Entropy strip are collected on computer. The behaviour of these parameters before, during and after reversal on neuromuscular blockade will be analyzed in detail.</detailed_description>
