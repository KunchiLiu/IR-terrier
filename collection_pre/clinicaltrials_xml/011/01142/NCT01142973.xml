	<brief_title>The Clinical Course of Coronary Artery Disease in Coronary Multidetector Computed Tomographic Angiogram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The natural history of individual plaques is unknown and needs to be established. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography is a useful noninvasive imaging modality for assessing coronary plaque. Using MDCT, the researchers prospectively investigate the relationship between the presence of coronary plaques and cardiovascular events</detailed_description>
