	<brief_summary>With the rapid growing aging population, age-related eye diseases including cataract are becoming more prevalent. The demand for cataract surgery and post-surgical care posed enormous financial burdens to the government. Lycium barbarum contains lutein and zeaxanthin which can filter the phototoxic blue light and neutralize the reactive oxygen species, thus provide a protective effect against cataract formation. This study aims to determine the effects of Lycium barbarum Supplements on the progression of senile cataract in Hong Kong Chinese elderly.</brief_summary>
