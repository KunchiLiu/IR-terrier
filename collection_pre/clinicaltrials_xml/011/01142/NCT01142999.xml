	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to determine the feasibility of doing larger follow-up studies examining whether emollients used from birth can prevent eczema in high-risk babies and to help investigators find out if emollients (moisturizing skin creams) used from birth can prevent eczema in high-risk babies. Hypothesis: Enhancing the skin barrier from birth using emollients will prevent or delay the onset of eczema, especially in predisposed infants.</brief_summary>
