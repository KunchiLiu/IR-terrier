	<brief_summary>This was an observational, single arm, multicentric study conducted for the adjustment of treatment strategy and its monitoring using high-frequency and high-dosage administration of interferon-beta (Rebif) in MS subjects. Study focussed on assessment of the effectiveness and safety of existing immunomodulatory basis therapy in MS subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study Evaluating Therapy Optimisation Using High-frequency and High-dosage Administration of Interferon-beta (RebifÂ®) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of MS, which progresses to attacks or episodes, with interferon-beta has established itself as therapy of the first choice. On the basis of different studies, the hypothesis was substantiated that the effectiveness is dependent on dose and application frequency. These realizations justify the use of high-dose interferon-beta not only in subjects in the initial stages of disease, but also in those subjects, who have a progressing disease activity even in the advanced stage, if other therapies fail. For achieving maximum benefit for the subject, an optimum therapy is imperative. The therapy plan (Immunomodulatory Therapy) of "MS Therapy Consensus Group" (MSTKG) is being widely used. In the article: "Optimising lmmunomodulatory Therapy for MS Patients" that appeared in the "International Journal of MS care" in the year 2002, a simple 9-scale model" is proposed that defines four areas respectively: not conspicuous, conspicuous, alarming and measures are necessary, in the three areas: attacks/episodes, disease progression and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). The modification of an existing therapy, such as modifying the application plan, increasing the dosage, or substance change is recommended, if 'conspicuousness' is shown in all three areas, two areas are shown as 'alarming' or an area is shown as 'action necessary'. The decision for a therapy adjustment with the help of the "three scale model" should not happen solely on the results of the MRT. The model in the study involved attack or episode pertaining to: frequency, degree of severity, ability of involution and the response to a cortisone pulse therapy. OBJECTIVES - To assess the effectiveness and safety of existing immunomodulatory basis therapy in MS subjects - To identify candidates suitable for possible therapy adjustment</detailed_description>
