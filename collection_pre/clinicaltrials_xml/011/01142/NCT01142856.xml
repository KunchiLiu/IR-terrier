	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single patient safety study for harvesting, expanding ex vivo and injecting autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's) into the subarachnoid space of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated from adipose tissue by subcutaneous biopsy and expanded using an FDA-approved protocol. They will then be injected by lumbar puncture into the cerebrospinal fluid. Injection will be completed in the in- patient clinical research unit (CRU). the patient will be followed for two years.</detailed_description>
