	<brief_summary>Rationale: Mechanical loading is well-known to have a strong anabolic effect on bone. It has therefore been proposed that a mechanical intervention could be an effective non-pharmacological approach to treat bone loss associated with conditions such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. Data from in vitro experiments indicate that the purine nucleotide adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is released by bone cells and mediates cellular crosstalk via P2 purinergic receptors in response to mechanical stimulation. ATP release by bone cells may thus be part of a general mechanism by which mechanical loading ultimately results in increased bone formation, but this remains to be investigated in humans in vivo. The investigators hypothesize that a mechanical intervention in humans leads to a rise in systemic ATP concentrations due to ATP release from bone. Objective: To investigate in vivo whether a measurable increase in systemic ATP levels occurs in response to mechanical stimulation of bone in humans. Study design: Intervention study with a non-randomized, non-blinded design. All subjects will participate in a single experiment, lasting approximately 3 hours, during which the subjects will receive a mechanical intervention at a fixed dose. Study population: Maximally 10 healthy human volunteers (18-35 y). Intervention: Subjects will receive a gentle and safe mechanical intervention, which will be administered by means of a Juvent 1000 Vibration Platform delivering low-magnitude mechanical stimuli (i.e. vibrations) to the forearm. The mechanical stimulation will be administered at a frequency of 90 Hz and amplitude of 10 µm in an intermittent fashion, i.e. three 10-minute periods of stimulation with 10-minute rest periods in between. Main outcome parameters: As the primary outcome parameter, a change in extracellular ATP concentrations as a result of the mechanical intervention will be assessed systemically.</brief_summary>
