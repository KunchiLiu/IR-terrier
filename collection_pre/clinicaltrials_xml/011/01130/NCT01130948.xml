	<brief_title>Sleep, Breathing and Psychomotor Performance at Altitude: A Physiologic Study in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep is essential for well being and performance. Sleep disturbances by recurrent apnea and hypoxia in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome impair quality of life, cognitive and cardiovascular functions. Similar consequences occur in healthy subjects exposed to hypoxia at altitude due to periodic breathing with recurrent central apnea. This project will investigate effects of altitude on sleep, breathing, psychomotor performance and on the cardiovascular system in healthy subjects and patients with sleep apnea. The results will help to better understand mechanisms of sleep disturbances and psychomotor impairment induced by hypoxia and to prevent adverse effects of altitude exposure.</detailed_description>
