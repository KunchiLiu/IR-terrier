	<brief_summary>Despite a large and growing body of knowledge concerning the diagnosis of temporal arteritis, this potentially crippling disease still requires pathological diagnosis in practically every case. It seems likely that a correctly estimated clinical probability could help in evaluating imaging results in a way that might safely obviate temporal biopsy in a large segment of suspect cases. With this aim in view, we intend to identify useful clinical items and integrate them in an appropriate diagnostic pathway.</brief_summary>
