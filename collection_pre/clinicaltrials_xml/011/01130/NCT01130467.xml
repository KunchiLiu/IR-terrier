	<detailed_description>The aims of this study are to explore the various cognitive impairments of ADHD children, to differentiate various subtypes of ADHD children, and to investigate the efficacy of anti-ADHD drugs on various cognitive performance of ADHD children by event-related potentials(ERP). Children, aged six to 18 years old, are enrolled and assigned to three groups (normal control, pure ADHD, and ADHD with comorbidities). ADHD children fulfill the DSM-IV-TR criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD. ADHD children are evaluated by Chinese version of SNAP-IV Rating Scale for rating ADHD-related symptoms before and after medication. EEG and audiometric testing are required for every participant to exclude dialeptic seizures and hearing impairment respectively. Methylphenidate (either immediate-release or extended-release formulations) or atomoxetine Hydrochloride is given to ADHD participants.Continuous performance task (CPT) and ERP tasks are applied.</detailed_description>
