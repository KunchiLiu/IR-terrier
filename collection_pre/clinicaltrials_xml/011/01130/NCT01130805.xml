	<brief_summary>In order to improve survival of metastatic gastric cancer patients, we plan to to conduct a phase II trial of CapeOx with 800 mg once-daily pazopanib as a first-line chemotherapy in metastatic gastric cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Pazopanib With CAPEOX in AGC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvements in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer, many patients present with inoperable disease and an effective, novel combination treatment is urgently needed for these patients population. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy improves survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer compared with best supportive care alone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.52] and that combination chemotherapy is superior to monotherapy (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93) (Wagner et al., 2006). For advanced gastric cancer, 5-FU in combination with cisplatin (FP regimen) is commonly used reference regimen, which are successfully replaced by capecitabine and oxaliplatin in recent phase III trial (Cunningham et al., 2008; Okines et al., 2009). In phase II trial, CAPEOX (capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin) regimen also showed promising activity for the metastatic gastric cancer (Park et al., 2006; Park et al., 2008). In order to improve survival of metastatic gastric cancer patients, various clinical trials incorporated novel molecularly targeted agent in combination with the reference arm.</detailed_description>
