	<brief_summary>Consumption of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and the protective effect may be due to polyphenolic compounds contained within these foods. The mechanism by which polyphenols exert this effect is not clearly understood but research has focused on their potential to affect platelet function. The purpose of this study is to quantify the anti-clotting activity of a range of plant food extracts and component compounds.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single sample of whole blood will be collected from 15 male or female volunteers aged between 18 and 65 years. After collection whole blood will be treated with a range of flavonoids to evaluate their effects on platelet function.</detailed_description>
