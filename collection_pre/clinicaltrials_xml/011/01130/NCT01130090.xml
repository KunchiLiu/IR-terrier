	<brief_summary>In patients under bi-level pressure support ventilation for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, this study aims to determine if it is better, in terms of efficacy and patient-ventilator synchronisation to use - Spontaneous mode (S) - Spontaneous/Timed mode (ST) with an intermediate back-up rate, slightly below the respiratory rate of the patient - Timed mode (T), with a ventilator respiratory rate above that of the patient. This issue has to our knowledge only been marginally studied without any consensus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligibility: patients under home bi-level pressure support ventilation for obesity hypoventilation in a stable clinical condition, aged over 18 Methods: Three consecutive sleep studies in a randomised sequence with usual parameters Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure(IPAP), Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) and change of only back up respiratory rate (RR): one night in a spontaneous mode, one with an intermediate RR, and one with a RR above that of the patient Endpoints: Quality of sleep and sleep structure (polysomnography), patient-ventilator synchronisation and respiratory events under NIV, efficacy of ventilation: oxygen saturation measured by pulse oxymetry (SaO2); transcutaneous capnography (PtcCO2), and comfort.</detailed_description>
