	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of individualized titration of patiromer according to serum potassium. This study also assessed the safety and tolerability of patiromer and the effects of patiromer on serum potassium in heart failure (HF) participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Patiromer Titration in Heart Failure Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate a titration regimen for patiromer in approximately 63 HF participants with CKD receiving one or more of the following: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta blockers (BBs). This study was considered to be exploratory. Upon successful completion of screening evaluations (-10 to -5 days prior to enrollment), all eligible participants were assigned at Baseline (Day 0 visit) to an initial dose of patiromer (20 g/day) and spironolactone (25 mg/day). Study visits for enrolled participants were scheduled for Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56. A follow-up visit occurred on Day 63. At selected study visits, patiromer or spironolactone doses may have been titrated. The study dosing algorithm was designed to maintain an individual's serum potassium value in the range of 4.0 - 5.1 mEq/L (based on local lab data). Any participant with a local laboratory serum potassium value &lt; 3.5 or &gt; 5.5 mEq/L on two consecutive scheduled study visits, despite titration of patiromer or spironolactone, were withdrawn from the study, permanently discontinued patiromer and spironolactone, and returned for a follow-up visit within 7 days.</detailed_description>
