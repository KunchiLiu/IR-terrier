	<criteria>**Inclusion Criteria *Tumor Types Tumor type/location: Stratum A: Newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas OR any biopsy proven highgrade glioma* involving the brainstem. Patients may not have received chemotherapy during or after radiation. (Note: Stratum A is closed to accrual.) Stratum B: Newly diagnosed, nonbrainstem highgrade glioma* Patients may not have received chemotherapy during or after radiation. (Note: Stratum B is open to accrual.) Stratum C: Unresectable lowgrade gliomas that have received at least two chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. (Note: Stratum C is closed to accrual.) Stratum D: Nonbrainstem highgrade gliomas* that have recurred following treatment. (Note: Stratum D is closed to accrual.) Stratum E: Newly diagnosed highgrade gliomas* or brain stem gliomas who received chemotherapy during radiation therapy. Patients may not have received chemotherapy after radiation therapy was completed. (Note: Stratum E is closed to accrual.) Stratum F: Newly diagnosed highgrade gliomas with metastatic disease within the CNS requiring craniospinal radiation therapy. Patients may or may not have received chemotherapy during radiation, but cannot have received chemotherapy after radiation therapy was completed. (Note: Stratum F is closed to accrual.) Eligible histologies include glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or gliosarcoma. Patients with any oligodendroglioma component are NOT eligible. HLAA2 positive based on flow cytometry. Patients in Stratum A B and E must have received standard involved field radiation therapy [RT] defined as fractionated external beam radiotherapy with total doses between 50006000 cGy. Patients in these strata must be registered within 412 weeks of completing RT. Patients in Stratum F must have received craniospinal radiation. Patients must be clinically stable and off or on lowdose (no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day Dexamethasone) corticosteroid for at least one week prior to study registration. All patients must sign an IRBapproved informed consent document Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt;22 years of age at the time of study registration. Patients must have a performance status of ≥ to 60. Patients must have life expectancy of at least 8 weeks. Documented negative serum βHCG for female patients who are postmenarchal. Pregnant females will not be included in the study. Males and females must agree to use effective birth control methods during the course of vaccination. Patients must be free of systemic infection. Patients with adequate organ function as measured by: Bone marrow: ANC &gt; 1,000/µl; Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl (transfusion independent); absolute lymphocyte count of ≥500/uL; Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dl (may be transfused). Hepatic: bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional normal for age; SGPT (ALT) &lt; 3x institutional normal. Renal: Serum creatinine based on age or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt;70 ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m² Patients on Strata C and D must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: at least 3 weeks form the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least 1 week from the last dose of nonmyelosuppressive biologic therapy. No overt cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary or psychiatric disease. Patients living outside of North America are not eligible. Presence of metastatic disease for patients in Stratum A, B, D and E. Patients with low grade gliomas (stratum C) may have tumor spread within the CNS. Patients in Stratum F must have tumor spread within the CNS. Patients enrolled in Strata A and B may not have received any prior chemotherapy or antiglioma therapy of any type other than radiation therapy. Patients enrolled on stratum C must have received at least two prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy regimens and may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. Patients on Strata A, B, E, and F can not have received chemotherapy after radiation therapy was completed. Concurrent treatment or medications (must be off for at least 1 week) including: Interferon (e.g. IntronA®) Allergy desensitization injections Growth factors (e.g. Procrit®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®) Interleukins (e.g. Proleukin®) Any investigational therapeutic medication Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders. Use of immunosuppressives within four weeks prior to study entry. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used in the perioperative period and/or during radiotherapy, must be tapered (no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day dexamethasone) for at least one week before study registration. Topical corticosteroids are acceptable. Patients with known addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs.</criteria>
