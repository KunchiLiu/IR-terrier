	<brief_title>Study of the Health Information Needs of Brain Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A mere subset of the reasons behind unmet health care literacy needs include the health care systems' increasing complexity, increased time constraints, profound treatment decision making requirements, decreased financial resources, fracturing social networks and diversifying educational and cultural needs. This project will use focus groups to explore the factors involved in brain cancer health care literacy from the perspectives of patients and those involved in their care. Hypothesis generated from this project will be directly applied toward future projects. The overarching goals are improved access and adequacy of health care literacy information through the eventual development of validated, useful, reliable health care literacy information tools for brain cancer patients and those involved in their care.</detailed_description>
