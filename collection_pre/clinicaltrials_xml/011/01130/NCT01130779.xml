	<brief_summary>Newly developed or progressive brain metastasis during erlotinib treatment is considered progressive disease requiring change of treatment regimens despite no progression in extracranial lesions. Given that there is a dissociation in terms of response to erlotinib between brain and extracranial sites, we intend to conduct this pilot study to determine whether the continuation of erlotinib treatment can prolong the progression free interval of extracranial lesions as long as cranial lesion is controlled separately by conventional treatment modalities such as surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and whole brain radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
