	<brief_summary>Roux-and-Y gastric bypass is one of the most common forms of bariatric surgery; due to a reduction in size of the stomach and intestine, the available surface area for the absorption of oral drugs is strongly decreased. This may lead to a reduced bioavailability resulting in a reduced efficacy of the drug. However, in literature there is no information available about the impact of bariatric surgery on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. This protocol evaluates the moxifloxacin plasma levels, the variability between subjects and the absolute bioavailability, after oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin in healthy volunteers who have had a gastric bypass at least 6 months ago and who now have a stable body weight.</brief_summary>
