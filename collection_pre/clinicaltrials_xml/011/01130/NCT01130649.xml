	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a novel method for tracking the seizure frequency, side effect burden, and medication compliance for patients with epilepsy. The investigators intend to utilize a table-top device currently for tracking other chronic disease to collect remote data from epilepsy patients. The hypothesis is that the use of this device will lead to better longterm treatment outcomes than the standard outpatient mechanism of following patients longitudinally.</brief_summary>
