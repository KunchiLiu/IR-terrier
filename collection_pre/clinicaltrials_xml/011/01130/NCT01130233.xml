	<brief_title>Randomized Trial on Robotic Assisted Resection for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized trial comparing the bladder and sexual function of patients who undergo laparoscopic and robotic assisted rectal resection for rectal cancer The primary objective of this study is to compare the bladder and sexual functions of patients who undergo laparoscopic and robotic assisted resection for rectal cancer through a randomized controlled trial. The secondary outcome measures include 1. The operative outcome in terms of the complication rate, hospital stay and reoperation of the two groups; 2. The quality of life of the patients and the cost of the two groups 3. The quality of the resected specimens 4. The local recurrence rates at two years after the surgery</detailed_description>
