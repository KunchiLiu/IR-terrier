	<brief_summary>Xenografts and cell cultures provide sufficient material for analyses at the protein, RNA and DNA level. Patient derived NSCLC xenografts and cell lines are available but none however are Asian in origin. Given the emerging evidence to suggest inter-ethnic differences in NSCLC biology, new models of preclinical drug evaluation should be designed and validated using Asian tumors. Furthermore, such models will allow studies of biological mechanisms of sensitivity and/or resistance and also the study of dynamic regulations under standardized conditions in the Asian context.</brief_summary>
