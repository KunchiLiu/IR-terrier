	<brief_summary>Study IPI-926-03 is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate IPI 926 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Phase 1b is designed as a dose escalation study. Once the maximum tolerated dose of IPI-926 in combination with gemcitabine is established in the Phase 1b portion of the study, the Phase 2 portion will commence. Phase 2 is designed as a randomized, double-blind (investigator/patient), placebo-controlled study. There is no cross-over option for patients in either arm of the Phase 2 (i.e., there is no option for patients receiving placebo to cross-over to IPI-926).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IPI 926 is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog Pathway. IPI-926 in combination with gemcitabine may improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Infinity is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI-926 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
