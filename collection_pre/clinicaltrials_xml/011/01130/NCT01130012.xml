	<brief_summary>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)is a major health problem - growing prevalence of obesity - the older age of pregnant women A randomized controlled trial in 54 pregnant voluntary women at high risk for GDM. - feasibility of an early intervention - glucose tolerance at weeks 26-28</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at weeks 8-12 1. voluntary women in early pregnancy (n=96) 2. 54 high risk mothers were randomized - lifestyle intervention group (n=27) - close follow-up (n=27) 2. An OGTT was performed again at weeks 26-28 - the lifestyle intervention group (n=27) - the close follow-up group (n=27) - other high-risk women of the early care group (n=42)who were not randomized 3. An OGTT was also performed at weeks 26-28 in two neighboring municipalities - a standard care high-risk group(n=171)who did not undergo early intervention 4. Primary outcomes - number of at risk participants developing GDM during pregnancy in the two arms 5. Secondary outcomes - the effect of intervention on fetal growth</detailed_description>
