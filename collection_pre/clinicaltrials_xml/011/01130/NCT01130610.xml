	<brief_title>Pre-anesthetic Evaluation and Cost Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pre-anesthetic evaluation is essential in the care of surgical patients. Among its benefits stands the reduction of costs related to preoperative preparation. However, most studies evaluating costs was performed in hospitals abroad, whose reality does not always apply to our environment. The aim of this study is to compare the costs of preoperative evaluation performed by the surgeon (conventional tillage), with the cost of preparation performed by the anesthesiologist (pre-anesthetic evaluation). Two hundred patients scheduled for surgical or diagnostic procedures under anesthesia form included in the study. After admission patients were assessed by physician anesthesiologists. In Form 1 (conventional tillage), it was noted tests or specialist consultations made in the preoperative period. In Form 2 (pre-anesthetic evaluation) was noted comorbidities, physical examination and complementary examinations given in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Anesthesiology Department of the institution. Form data were compared with a data form 2. Besides the costs, we compared the number of tests considered unnecessary and disagreements in the classification of physical status according to the American Society Anesthesiology (ASA).</detailed_description>
