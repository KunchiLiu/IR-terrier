	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), including the possible association with bisphosphonates (BPs). This study used the research infrastructure from the three NIDCR-funded dental practice-based research networks (DPBRN, PEARL, PRECEDENT). De-identified data from the DPBRN were merged with comparable de-identified data from PEARL and PRECEDENT to form a single trans-PBRN data set used for analysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aims of this study were to (1) test the hypothesis that (BP) treatment is a risk factor for (ONJ); (2) to test the hypothesis that dental diseases (particularly periodontal disease), and invasive dental procedures such as dental extractions are true risk factors for (ONJ).</detailed_description>
