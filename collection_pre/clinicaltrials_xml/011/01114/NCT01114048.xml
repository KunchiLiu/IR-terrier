	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will analyze the long-term outcomes of remission and survival, and identify those with primary resistant disease as more likely to benefit from CTD (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone) and early intensification of Vel-CD (bortezomib and CD) as induction chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for the patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Response-adapted Intensification of Induction Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to assess the efficacy and toxicities of CTD and Vel-CD induction followed by high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma.The investigators already investigated the thalidomide-based chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM. The combined regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) for induction treatment. CTD chemotherapy resulted in a favorable response with 79.4% overall response rate including 42.6% complete response (CR) or very good partial complete response (VGPR), and tolerable toxicity in MM patients. Moreover, CTD chemotherapy did not affect the yield of the stem cell collection.The investigators also published that the clinical efficacy and safety of a four-drug combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone was assessed for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma Vel-CTD chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
