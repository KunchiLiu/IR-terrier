	<brief_summary>Though cervical insufficiency is a common cause of second trimester pregnancy loss, the placement of an emergent cerclage in these patients is thought to improve perinatal outcomes. It is unknown whether the use of tocolytics and antibiotics prolongs pregnancies complicated by need for emergent cerclage. The objective is to determine whether administration of peri-operative antibiotics and indomethacin to patients receiving emergent cerclages for cervical insufficiency increases latency period to delivery compared with patients receiving emergent cerclage alone.</brief_summary>
