	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a diet rich in broccoli on cardiovascular disease risk using biochemical indicators such as blood lipid profiles, most notably cholesterol; markers of inflammation as well as established physiological measurements such as Pulse wave velocity (PWV), Augmentation index (AIx) and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurements (ABPM). Broccoli contains compounds known as glucosinolates which are metabolised to isothiocyanates when consumed. The major glucosinolate in broccoli is known as glucoraphanin which produces the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. The glucosinolates are thought to be the principal component in broccoli that may reduce CVD risk. The investigators will use a standard cultivar of broccoli and a cultivar that has enhanced levels of glucosinolates ('HG broccoli'). This broccoli has been used in previous intervention studies (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00535977). Volunteers will be asked to consume 400g of standard broccoli, HG broccoli or peas each week over a 12 week period in a double blinded (for the broccoli) parallel study. The volunteers recruited will, according to the Joint British Societies (JBS 2) Guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in clinical practise, have a 10-20% (mild to moderate) risk of developing cardiovascular disease or having a cardiovascular (CV) event in the next 10 years.</brief_summary>
