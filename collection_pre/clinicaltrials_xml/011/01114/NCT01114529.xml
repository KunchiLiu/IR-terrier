	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an early Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI) to everolimus conversion at 10-14 weeks post transplantation improves renal allograft function without compromising efficacy compared to standard CNI treatment in de novo renal allograft recipients. In addition, the study is designed to evaluate the impact of a CNI-free regimen on evolution of cardiovascular parameters in de novo renal allograft recipients</brief_summary>
