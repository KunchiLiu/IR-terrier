	<brief_title>Post Marketing Study in Subjects Who Have Type 2 Diabetes Using the EndoBarrier™ Gastrointestinal Liner</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with obesity are at significantly greater risk of developing complications such as pulmonary dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, and other co-morbid risks. NIH panel recommendations state that even a 10% short-weight loss would greatly reduce these risks. GI Dynamics' EndoBarrier represents a viable alternative to other short-term pre-surgical weight loss methods. EndoBarrier is a device that can be implanted and removed through minimal invasive endoscopic techniques. This endoscopic procedure brings potential benefits to patients in that it is minimally invasive, efficacious, and allows patients to recover faster with less morbidity and mortality</detailed_description>
