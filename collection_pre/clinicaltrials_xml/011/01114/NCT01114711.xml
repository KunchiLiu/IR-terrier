	<brief_summary>We are looking for women who suffer from menstrual migraine to participate in a 2-visit migraine brain imaging research study. Our goal is to see how the menstrual migraine brain's pain pathways function when the migraineur has been taking Frovatriptan. During the screening visit (Visit 1) participants will sign the informed consent form, complete questionnaires, meet with the study physician, and have QST (quantitative sensory testing: to determine your pain thresholds for a heat stimulus) performed. For Visit 2's MRI scan, subjects will be asked to lie very still while the scan is occurring. In some parts, they will not have to do anything, while in others they will be asked to rate pain and unpleasantness for brush and thermal stimuli. Participants are compensated for both visits.</brief_summary>
