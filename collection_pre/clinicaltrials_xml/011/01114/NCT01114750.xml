Other medical conditions, drug treatments or significant medical problems that would preclude participation in a clinical trial that, in the opinion of the investigator, disqualifies the subject. Participation in a clinical trial within the prior 3 months History of GI surgery (other than appendectomy) or known GI motility disorders. History of a serious infection, including but not limited to hepatitis, pneumonia, or pyelonephritis, or have been hospitalized or received intravenous antibiotics for an infection, during the previous two months.

Known to have had a substance abuse (drug or alcohol) problem within the previous 5 years Alcohol use within 48 hours prior to visits to the study unit.
