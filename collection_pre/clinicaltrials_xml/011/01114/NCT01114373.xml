	<brief_title>Melatonin and Nighttime Blood Pressure in African Americans--24 mg Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main outcome of interest is the mean nighttime blood pressure. The investigator is also trying to see the mechanism of action of melatonin on blood pressure by analyzing data from sleep studies to see if melatonin lowers blood pressure by providing a better quality of sleep or is that independent of the quality of sleep. The investigator is also looking into the effect of melatonin on sympathetic nervous system by measuring urinary catecholamines. Finally, the investigator is looking into changes in vascular biology markers P-selectin and e-selectin) on Melatonin.</detailed_description>
