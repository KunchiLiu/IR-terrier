	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to assess the clinical value of the SeptiFast Test as an adjunct to traditional microbiological, clinical, and other laboratory assessments in early detection and identification of a potential pathogen and therefore early targeted antimicrobial management of neutropenic hematological patients with suspected infection or sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Value of the LightCycler® SeptiFast Test MGRADE for the Pathogen Detection in Neutropenic Hematological Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections, including sepsis, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic diseases. Early diagnosis of infection, rapid identification of the causative pathogen(s), and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment (the first 24 hours are most critical) all have a major impact on mortality. The LightCycler® SeptiFast Test MGRADE (SeptiFast Test) is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the direct detection and identification of DNA from bacterial and fungal microorganisms in human EDTA whole blood. The SeptiFast test can detect nucleic acids from the most common pathogens (approximately 90%) responsible for hospital-associated bacteremia. The test is used in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and established microbiological assays and other laboratory markers as an aid in antimicrobial treatment decision making for patients with suspected sepsis and other bloodstream infections. This is a randomized prospective study of the use of the SeptiFast Test as an adjunct to traditional management of neutropenic haematological patients suspected of having infection or sepsis. The study will be performed in a two-armed manner. The blood sample for the SeptiFast Test will be collected from all included patients. However, analysis of the SeptiFast Test in the control group will only be performed at a later point in time; thus, in the control group results will not become available until the end of the study and, therefore, cannot be used for guiding clinical decisions. Patients complete the study when the episode of infection or sepsis resolves, or the patient is discharged from a hospital, or the patient died.</detailed_description>
