	<brief_title>A Comparison of Changes in Bone Density With the Same Bone-health Plan, But With Different Bone-health Supplements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The US Surgeon General's Report on Bone Health suggests America's bone-health is in jeopardy and issued a "call to action" to develop bone-health plans that: 1. improve nutrition, 2. increase health literacy and, 3. increase physical activity. The purpose of this study was to use a comparative effective research model to compare 6-month changes in bone mineral density (BMD)in two study groups. Both followed the same bone health plan that contained the three components listed above with the same plant-source calcium supplement, but enhanced with different levels of calcium, vitamin D3, vitamin K and magnesium.</detailed_description>
