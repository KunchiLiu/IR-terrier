	<brief_summary>Vascular inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of atherosclerosis.Resistin was shown to induce vascular endothelial dysfunction and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising tool for identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to demonstrate the correlation between circulating resistin and vascular inflammation detected by 18FDG-PET in obese persons.</brief_summary>
