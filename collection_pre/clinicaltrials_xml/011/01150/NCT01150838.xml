	<brief_title>Determination of the Amount of Propofol Needed to Supplement 5% Sevoflurane for Intubation of Children Without Neuromuscular Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The practice of tracheal intubation of children without neuromuscular blockade (TIWNB) is widespread in pediatric anesthesia practices. There are several different methods reported for TIWNB, most of which involve administration of an inhaled anesthetic in combination with another medication. The technique of administering propofol IV, immediately after IV placement, after a sevoflurane induction is a popular methods for pediatric TIWNB in the United States and worldwide (personal communication, and personal practice of this technique). To date, nobody has studied this technique, and therefore nobody has quantified the amount of propofol needed in this context.
