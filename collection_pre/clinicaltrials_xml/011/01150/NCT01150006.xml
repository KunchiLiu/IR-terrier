	<brief_summary>The inflammatory state and composition of atherosclerotic plaques are considered the main contributing factors responsible for acute cardiovascular events, rather than the degree of stenosis. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) has been suggested as a promising novel imaging technique to identify the inflammatory state of atherosclerotic plaque. Recently, a few clinical studies showed that circulating A-FABP level had a close relation with the development of atherosclerosis in human. Therefore, in the present study, the investigators examined the relationship between circulating A-FABP and vascular inflammation of carotid arteries measured using FDG-PET in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
