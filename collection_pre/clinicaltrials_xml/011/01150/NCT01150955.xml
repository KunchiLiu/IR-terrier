	<brief_title>Potential Beneficial Effects of Resveratrol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to investigate potential metabolic effects of resveratrol in healthy but obese men. We hypothesize that resveratrol will counteract some of the detrimental effects of obesity, and as an imitator of calorie restriction will give new insight into the basic biochemical pathways underpinning human metabolism. Of special interest is the potential connection between resveratrol, calorie restriction, SIRT1, STAT5b and the GH/IGF-I axis.</detailed_description>
