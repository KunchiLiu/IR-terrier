	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying cell samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer PURPOSE: This research study is studying drug biomarkers in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug Biomarkers in Cell Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine, in vitro, the cytotoxic activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate agents in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). - To define the characteristics of AML cells responding to or resisting these agents. OUTLINE: Cell samples are thawed and used for in vitro studies to determine the cytotoxic activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate agents, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin, for genotyping characterization by flow cytometry-based assays and/or western blot, and colony-forming cell assays.</detailed_description>
