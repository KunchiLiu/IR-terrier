	<brief_summary>The main hypothesis are: 1. Passive and Active-Passive airway conditioning devices reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia 2. Active-Passive airway conditioning devices reduce the incidence of endotracheal tube obstruction 3. Nurses' workload is reduced with Passive and Active-Passive airway conditioning devices</brief_summary>
