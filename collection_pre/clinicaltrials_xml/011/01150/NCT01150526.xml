	<brief_summary>The proposed study will test efficacy of HMB in free acid gel to decrease muscle damage, diminish inflammatory response, and improve muscle strength recovery following an acute exercise stress. HMB in a free acid gel or in CaHMB capsule form will be administered as either a single dose before a bout of acute exercise or in multiple doses (one before and three daily doses for the 4 days following the acute exercise). We hypothesize that HMB in free acid gel will result in less muscle damage, diminished inflammatory response, and improved muscle strength recovery than either a placebo or CaHMB treatment following a bout of acute eccentric exercise. Our endpoints will include measurements of: (1) markers for muscle damage (CPK and LDH); (2) indicators of inflammation (CRP, TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1ra and IL-18); and (3) muscle strength recovery and soreness.</brief_summary>
