	<brief_summary>Compare the efficiency of the association, first line, the intravenous levetiracetam and the intravenous clonazepam, in that of a monotherapy of clonazepam intravenous in the pre-hospital treatment of tonicoclonic generalised status epilepticus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Antiepileptic Drug in Generalised Convulsive Status Epilepticus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At this time, the prehospital treatment of the status epilepticus use some molecule ("FOSPHENYLOINE") with large contra-indications. In this case the physician is not able to know the past medical history of the patient, the biological examinations and so he can not decide which molecules he can use. The levetiracetam is a knowledge medication in the epilepsy since more than twenty years. One of specificity of the levetiracetam is to be able to be used in all situations (no clinical or biological contre-indication). This molecule seems like to be very interesting to be used in prehospital system. The goal of this study is to evaluate the association levetiracetam / clonazepam in first line in the prehospital treatment of the status epilepticus</detailed_description>
