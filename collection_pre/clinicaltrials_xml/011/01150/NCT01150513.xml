	<brief_summary>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a relatively bad prognosis whereas there is no standard regimen. Some data showed that platins could improve the efficacy of advance TNBC. In this trial, it is the hypothesis that TP (docetaxel plus carboplatin) has a better efficacy than EC-T (epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel).</brief_summary>
