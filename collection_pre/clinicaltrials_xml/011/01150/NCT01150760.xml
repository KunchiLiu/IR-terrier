	<brief_summary>Alvimopan is the first and currently the only FDA-approved therapy for acceleration of the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis. The primary objective of this retrospective observational trial is to assess postoperative morbidity and mortality as reported during the index hospitalization for bowel resection and 15/30-day readmissions of alvimopan vs. non-alvimopan matched patients in the combined Premier/Care Science database(a large medical claims database).</brief_summary>
