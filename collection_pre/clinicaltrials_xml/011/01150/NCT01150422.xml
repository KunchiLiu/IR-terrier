	<brief_summary>This trial will compare the efficacy and acceptability of post-medical abortion follow-up by assigning women to either 1) alternative follow-up via routine semi-quantitative pregnancy test and a self-administered follow-up questionnaire, or 2) the standard of care: a routine follow-up visit including a bimanual exam and vaginal ultrasound. The goal of the study is to provide answers to the following questions: 1. Is a follow-up protocol that employs a self-administered questionnaire and at home use of a semi-quantitative pregnancy test effective at identifying women with ongoing pregnancies? 2. Is an innovative follow-up protocol more acceptable to women and providers than the current standard of care? 3. Is an innovative follow-up protocol feasible to implement in abortion services in Vietnam?</brief_summary>
