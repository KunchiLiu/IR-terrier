	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient rehabilitation is equal for patients operated with two different knee implant designs. The patients are randomized to treatment with either a simple hinge design implant (fixed bearing) or an implant with a mobile bearing polyethylene. This design difference might in principle enable the patients in the latter group to rehabilitate towards a more normal gait pattern.</brief_summary>
