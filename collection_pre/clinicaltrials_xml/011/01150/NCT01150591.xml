	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1: Microaspiration, as diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) pepsin, is common in patients with IPF. Hypothesis 2a: Baseline clinical variables and co-morbid conditions are risk factors for microaspiration in patients with IPF. Hypothesis 2b: Baseline biological variables reflecting alveolar epithelial injury and inflammation are markers of microaspiration in IPF. Hypothesis 3a: Microaspiration will lead to a more rapid rate of decline in pulmonary function. Hypothesis 3b: Microaspiration will lead to higher rates of urgent medical care use (i.e. unscheduled clinic visit, emergency room visit, or hospitalization).</brief_summary>
