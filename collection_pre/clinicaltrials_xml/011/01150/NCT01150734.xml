	<brief_summary>Muscle evoked potentials (MEP) are supposed to different in schizophrenic and depressed patients, compared to a sample of healthy volunteers. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-evoked MEP are measured in all three groups at baseline and after tDCS (2 mA, 20 minutes). MEP amplitudes are supposed to normalize quickly in healthy volunteers, to stay diminished in depressed patients and to stay elevated in schizophrenic patients. These differences should disappear after regular pharmacological treatment. Outcome measures will be done in week 2 and week 4.</brief_summary>
