	<brief_summary>In order to evaluate the efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose + erythropoietin versus ferric carboxymaltose versus placebo in reducing the percentage of patients who receive red-cell transfusion in the perioperative period of hip fracture, a multicenter, randomized, parallel groups, double-blind clinical trial in adult patients admitted for osteoporotic hip fracture is designed. Required sample size is of 87 patients per arm (87x3 = 261). Primary efficacy variable is the percentage of patients who receive red-cell transfusion during hospitalization; secondary end-points: average red-cell packs per patient,haemoglobin at 24 h and 72h after the intervention, at the time of hospital discharge and 60 days after hospital discharge, hospital stay and mortality during hospital-stay and 60 days afterwards. Adverse clinical events and side effects are assessed as safety variables. In addition health related quality of life will be measured at inclusion and after 60 days. A cost-efficacy analysis (by means of incremental cost-efficacy method using as a primary endpoint each patient not requiring transfusion, and as secondary end-point every patient who survived the index admission is performed). The investigators would like to demonstrate a double benefits: optimizing precious resource such as blood products and reducing complications arising from their use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Ferric Carboxymaltose With or Without EPO Reducing Red-cell Transfusion Packs in Hip Fracture Perioperative Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three arms of treatments: A: ferric carboxymaltose and erythropoietin, B: ferric carboxymaltose and placebo, arm C: two placebos. Primary objective:reduction of red-cell packs needed for elderly patients with osteoporotic hip fracture which requires surgical intervention in the perioperative period.</detailed_description>
