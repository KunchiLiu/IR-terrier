	<brief_title>Clinical Implication of DAC (Detrusor After-contraction)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The definition of detrusor after-contraction (DAC) is usually accepted as the increase of detrusor pressure (Pdet), whether it is sudden or not, after cessation of urinary flow. The amount of increase in Pdet is sometimes included in the definition of DAC (14, 15, 20 cmH2O or at least two times the level of the maximal Pdet during the voiding phase). However, it is clear that the lack of a well-established definition may induce much bias in the interpretation of the clinical implication of DAC. The previous studies showed a wide range of prevalence.1-4 DAC seemed to occur more frequently in children and the occurrence rate usually decreased with age in urodynamic studies.</detailed_description>
