	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to explore if a 8-weeks dietary intervention with polyphenols and omega 3 fatty acids (alone or combined) may be effective on postprandial lipids metabolism and other cardiovascular risk factors in people at high cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Dietary Polyphenols and ω-3 Fatty Acids on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in High Risk Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fish consumption is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk and dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids reduces plasma triglyceride levels. The mechanisms of action of ω-3 fatty acids are currently not completely understood. It has been hypothesized that polyunsaturated ω-3 fatty acids beneficial effects may be mediated through their ability to facilitate plasmalogen replenishment. Polyphenols are associated with beneficial effects on some cardiovascular risk factors, in particular with a reduced lipid oxidation. Less data are available on their effects on lipid metabolism. Recent data suggest that these effects could be mediated by changes in plasmalogen levels. The effects on lipid metabolism of combining the two dietary approaches (ω-3 fatty acids and polyphenols) are not known. While developed populations live for the most part in the postprandial state, much of the information on lipid metabolism refers to fasting condition. Dietary Intervention Study Design Eighty people at high cardiovascular risk randomly assigned to one of the four different nutritional 8-week interventions: (A) Control diet poor in omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols (B) Diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids (C) Diet rich in polyphenols (D) Diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols</detailed_description>
