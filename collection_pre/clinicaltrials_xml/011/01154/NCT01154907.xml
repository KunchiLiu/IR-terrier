	<brief_summary>Schistosomiasis is a poverty-related water-transmitted parasitic disease affecting more that 200 million people world wide. Infection with Schistosoma haematobium may cause Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) with pathological lesions in the female genital tract, especially the cervix. Findings indicate that FGS is a hitherto under-diagnosed illness of young women in endemic poor tropical countries, deserving further attention. A cross-sectional study from Zimbabwe indicated that the pathologic genital lesions were unchanged two years after praziquantel treatment in adult women whereas in those who had been treated with praziquantel in childhood the prevalence of genital lesions was significantly lower. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of HIV was detected in women with FGS compared to those without. The proposed project aims at achieving a better understanding of how annual distribution of praziquantel to pre- and post-pubertal schoolgirls may prevent FGS. This information can be of use in current schistosomiasis control programs in the near term resulting in improved strategies for treatment. Preventing or reducing the risk of FGS and genital lesions will lead to improved reproductive health among in women living in schistosomiasis endemic areas. Project Goal: Contribute to a reduction of the global burden of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) through improved knowledge about the prevention of gynecological lesions and through improved diagnosis of FGS.</brief_summary>
