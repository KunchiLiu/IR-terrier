	<brief_summary>Long-term, observational, prospective, multicenter registry following patients who have been implanted with the SUPERA Interwoven Self-Expanding Nitinol Stent for treating stenosis in the superficial femoral and/or femoropopliteal arteries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Data Registry Following Patients Using Supera Stent in the Femoral Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This registry follows up to 200 patients for at least 5 years. The STRONG Data Registry will follow patients under real world conditions, evaluating restenosis rates, periprocedural/postprocedural complications, patency, target lesion revascularization, walking distance, stent fractures, and adverse events/serious adverse events.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(Clinical) Patient or legal guardian understands registry procedures and has voluntarily signed an informed consent in accordance with institutional and local regulatory policies. (Note: Retrospective data may be collected and entered into the EDC system after a fully executed informed consent has been provided). RutherfordBecker classification 2 through 5 only Patient is at least 18 years of age and of legal age of consent. Patient must be willing to participate in the registry for at least 5 years. (Angiographic) Target lesion is a single de novo or restenotic (outside a stent) SFA or Popliteal artery lesion ≥ 1 cm from origin of another stent; additional lesions may be present., but there is only one target lesion All SFA target lesions are to be located with the proximal point at least 2 cm below the origin of the profunda femoris artery. All Popliteal Artery target lesions are to be located with the most distal point at least 1 cm proximal to the bifurcation of the anterior tibial artery and the tibioperoneal trunk. Target lesion length 120 cm (visual estimate) Target lesion stenosis ≥50% (visual estimate) Popliteal artery patent if the lesion is in the SFA SFA patent if the lesion is in the popliteal artery At least one widely patent (&lt; 50% stenosis) infrapopliteal artery (for distal runoff) (Clinical) Evidence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or intravenous tPA, Plavix, Ticlid, or aspirin therapy sensitivities Patient is participating in a clinical study that could confound results Patient is pregnant/breastfeeding at time enrollment or plans to become pregnant during the course of participation in the registry. (Angiographic) Target lesion length &gt; 20 cm Instent restenotic / reoccluded target lesion Acute (≤ 4 weeks) thrombotic occlusion Untreated ipsilateral pelvic stenosis</criteria>
