	<detailed_description>- Adverse Events The whole study discontinuation is determined based on the following criteria with Adverse Events classified using US NCI (National Cancer Institute) 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) - Pharmacokinetic assessment Real sampling times will be used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters. Concentrations below the lower limit of quantification, samplings which are not applicable, or missing data will be substituted by "&lt;LLOQ", "NA", or "MD" respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed on CG100649 only.</detailed_description>
