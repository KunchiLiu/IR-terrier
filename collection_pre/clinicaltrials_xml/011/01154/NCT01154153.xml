	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of a 6-week treatment with TAA-AQ (110 μg) and TAA-AQ (220 μg) once daily (QD) versus placebo on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function as measured by serum cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) in children (&gt;=2 to &lt;12 years old) with allergic rhinitis (AR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasacort AQ Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Study in Children With Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of a run-in single-blind screening phase (prerandomization) followed by an approximately 6-week double-blind treatment phase (postrandomization). Total study duration per participant lasted from 7.5 to 13 weeks and consisted of: - Screening and single-blind phases (these 2 phases ran concurrently, prerandomization) for 8 to 24 days. During the screening phase participants were given a single-blind placebo nasal spray to enable them to practice their intranasal application technique once daily in the morning (1 actuation/nostril). - Randomization to the double-blind treatment phase. Treatment assignment was randomized with stratification by sex and age group (&gt;=2 to &lt;6, &gt;=6 to &lt;12 years old). - Double-blind treatment phase which lasted at least 42 days and ran up to 47 days. Participants were administered either TAA-AQ nasal spray or placebo nasal spray. - An evaluation at the end of treatment 1-3 days after completion of the double-blind phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who met the following criteria were eligible for this study: History of AR documented by the investigator, as follows: At least a 1year clinical history (6month history if the participant was &gt;= 2 to &lt; 4 years of age) of perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR); or a clinical history of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) over 2 seasons and positive skin test (prick or intradermal) to a seasonal or perennial allergen that was present in the participant's environment at time of screening. Written informed consent and ability of parent/legal guardian of the participant to give a written informed consent before any study related procedures. Participants &gt;=7 years of age (or younger according to the governing institutional review board [IRB]) had to provide a signed assent form Concomitant medical condition that might have interfered with the administration of a nasal spray, including anatomical abnormalities of the nose, face (eg, polyposis, markedly deviated septum) Presence of any active, untreated, or clinically significant musculoskeletal, endocrinologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurological condition that might have interfered with the study Any conditions or treatment that might have affected the HPA axis or the plasma cortisol assay, including but not limited to: Documented disorder involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, or adrenal gland Current use of serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, opiates, immunomodulatory, hormonal drugs, and lipidlowering agents Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraarticular) within 3 months prior to Visit 1 Treatment with systemic corticosteroids for &gt; 2 courses received up to 1 year before Visit 1 was exclusionary. Up to 2 courses of systemic corticosteroids, each course not exceeding 14 days, up to 1 year before Visit 1 was allowed Treatment with inhaled, intranasal, or highpotency topical corticosteroids within 6 weeks of Visit 1 History of hospitalization due to asthma within 1 year before screening. Participants with mild asthma that was wellcontrolled without the use of inhaled corticosteroids within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 were eligible for the study Any clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) abnormal laboratory test at Visit 1 Morning serum cortisol outside the reference range at Visit 1 Any of the following missing serum cortisol samples from the Visit2 collection: first sample (before administration of investigational product), 20hour sample, 24hour sample, or any 2 consecutive samples Any medical condition where use of corticosteroids might have been contraindicated or could have led to disease exacerbation (eg, glaucoma, cataract, ocular herpes simplex, tuberculosis, growth retardation) History of hypersensitivity to corticosteroids or to the rescue medication, investigational product, or to any of their excipients Unresolved upper respiratory tract infection, sinus infection, or nasal candidiasis (ie, symptomatic or under treatment) within the last 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 and Visit 3 Females of childbearing potential not protected by effective contraceptive method of birth control or were unwilling to abstain from sexual activity and/or, were unwilling or unable to test for pregnancy. Only female adolescent with onset of menses were to be checked by serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 Pregnant female adolescent (who tested positive for pregnancy at Visit 1) The above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
