	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to document and evaluate how a bone graft material (Healos®) can help rebuild bone width. Dental implants can only be placed when enough bone is found and this bone graft may help to rebuild bone width for dental implant placement. The ultimate goal of this study is to evaluate how this graft material can help bone healing.</brief_summary>
