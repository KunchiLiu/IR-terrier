	<brief_title>Alisertib in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors or Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the objective response rate to MLN8237 (alisertib) in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and leukemias, administered once daily for 7 days every 21 days. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To further define and describe the toxicities of MLN8237 administered on this schedule. II. To further characterize the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 in children with refractory cancer. III. To evaluate aurora A kinase expression using immunohistochemistry in solid tumors and leukemic blasts from tissue obtained at diagnosis and, if available, at relapse. IV. To explore the relationship between polymorphic variations in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene UGT1A1 and exposure to MLN8237, and to assess 2 common polymorphic variants in the aurora A kinase gene, Phe31Ile and Val57Ile. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

ARM X (ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA): Patients receive alisertib PO QD on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM XI (ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA): Patients receive alisertib PO QD on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM XII (RHABDOID MALIGNANCY): Patients receive alisertib PO QD on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Plasma samples are collected from all patients at baseline and periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic and other studies. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
