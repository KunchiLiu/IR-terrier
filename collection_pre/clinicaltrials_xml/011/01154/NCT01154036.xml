	<brief_summary>This study will compare the lipid-altering efficacy and safety of switching to co-administration of ezetimibe and atorvastatin versus treatment with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin in high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved specified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The primary hypothesis is that the co-administration of ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg will be superior to both atorvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 10 mg with respect to the percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 6 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MK0653C in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients With High Cholesterol (Switch Study)(MK-0653C-162)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 18 week randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study composed of a 6 week screening/run-in and 12 week double-blind treatment period (composed of 2 phases; each 6 weeks in duration). Only those participants who do not meet low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goals at the end of Phase I (Week 6), were eligible to continue into Phase II (Week 12).</detailed_description>
