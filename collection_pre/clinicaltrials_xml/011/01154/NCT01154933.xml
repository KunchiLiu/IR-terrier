	<brief_summary>Exenatide has been shown to result in better glycemic control in type II diabetes patients. Obesity and diabetes are states of increased inflammation; exenatide is expected to lead to decreased inflammation by virtue of better glycemic control and weight loss. The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of Exenatide to diabetic patients will reduce the requirements of insulin particularly the short acting insulin. Exenatide may also lead to decreased inflammation by virtue of better glycemic control and weight loss, or an independent effect.</brief_summary>
