	<brief_summary>The project aims to precisely quantify the postprandial amino acid utilization of egg proteins in vivo in humans, and also to assess their satiating power, in relation with nutrient postprandial waves and incretin secretions. For that purpose, 2 independent studies are conducted. The first one is realized using stable isotopes on 8 volunteers ingesting an egg test meal. The second one is a cross over design performed on 30 volunteers to compare the satiating effect of 2 equivalent snacks: whole eggs or cottage cheese.</brief_summary>
