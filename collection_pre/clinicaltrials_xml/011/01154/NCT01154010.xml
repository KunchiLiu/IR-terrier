	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a medical device (ActiPatch) that emits a low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) will benefit patients with anterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis (aka iritis) is an inflammatory disease involving the front segment of the eye. This is a common cause of a painful red eye, and ActiPatch has been shown to be effective in treating tissue inflammation. The conventional treatment of iritis typically involves frequent administration of topical steroids which have their own inherent risks (development of cataracts and/or glaucoma). The purpose of this study is to determine if ActiPatch therapy can be used to shorten the length of time and/or quantity of steroids administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEMF: an Adjunct Therapy for Anterior Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iritis is an inflammatory disease focused in the anterior chamber of the eye. The inflammation inside the eye can lead to a number of conditions that ultimately effect vision. These can include glaucoma, posterior synechiae, cystoid macular edema, and cataract. The standard treatment for the disease is drug therapy centered around the administration of corticosteroids. These are administered in the form of eye drops, and if necessary periocular/intraocular injections, or/and by systemic oral/IV administration. Unfortunately, the treatment with corticosteroids can similarly induce severe side effects including glaucoma and cataract formation. ActiPatch is a medical device that emits a low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field. This device has been shown to reduce inflammation and pain in a number of conditions, eg blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). ActiPatch is FDA approved for use after blepharoplasty to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. The treatment is not invasive, does not require additional medication, and side effects from ActiPatch and other PEMF devices have not been reported. The potential benefit of treating uveitis with ActiPatch is the potential to reduce the time and/or amount of steroid administration. This would benefit patients by reducing the risk of unwanted side effects of the corticosteroid treatment. The benefit to society would be an improved treatment for anterior uveitis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Human subjects who have been clinically diagnosed with anterior uveitis (iritis) but are in otherwise in good health will be recruited for the study. The age requirement will be a minimum of 18 yrs. We will recruit 24 patient for this study. Subjects will only be included who have been clinically diagnosed with anterior uveitis (noninfectious). Eligibility will be determined by the treating Ophthalmologist (principal investigator) for inclusion in the study. Vulnerable subjects, as defined by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), will not be recruited for participation (This includes individuals under 18, pregnant women, prisoners, fetuses, patients mentally or physically unable to provide written informed consent). Other groups excluded include: patients with pacemakers and patients with ferromagnetic metal implants since these devices may be effected by the pulsed electromagnetic field.</criteria>
