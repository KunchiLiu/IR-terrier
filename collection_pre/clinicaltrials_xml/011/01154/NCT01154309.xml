	<brief_title>Group CBT for Depression and AOD Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1. To adapt an existing group therapy (CBT for depression), creating a manualized treatment and accompanying implementation measures and tools for use with clients with persistent depressive symptoms and AOD disorders and to obtain preliminary assessments of the treatment from patient and provider perspectives. Aim 2. To conduct a pilot test of the revised treatment in which we (a) demonstrate that when the therapy is implemented with fidelity, clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms and AOD use occur; (b) estimate the likely effect size; and (c) investigate the underlying mechanisms of change, including both cognitive-behavioral and group processes and their relationship to depression and AOD treatment outcomes.</detailed_description>
