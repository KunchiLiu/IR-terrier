	<brief_title>Study to Assess Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Double-Blind S-707106 Alone and in Combination With Open-Label Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety will be evaluated by monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, 24-hour telemetry monitoring, and physical exams. Specific study withdrawal criteria during washout periods of metformin have been established for loss of glycemic control, i.e., glucose monitoring. Pharmacokinetic assessments of monotherapy cohort versus add-on therapy will be performed</detailed_description>
