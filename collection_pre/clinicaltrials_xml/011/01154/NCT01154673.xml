	<brief_summary>This trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of intensified antiretroviral treatment that includes raltegravir and maraviroc during the early stages of HIV infection. With the proven efficacy of these antiviral drugs in pre- and post-clinical trials, we would like to investigate the ability of the combination of raltegravir and maraviroc plus a standard HAART backbone to further decrease the viral load in acutely infected treated HIV infected individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Intensive cART During Acute/Early HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study with follow-up to 5 years. Thirty-two individuals presenting with newly diagnosed acute or early HIV-1 infection as described in the inclusion criteria will be enrolled, with sixteen randomized to each arm. Individuals will be randomized to one of two arms: the "Intensive" arm with standard HAART (Emtricitabine 200mg /tenofovir 300mg QD + Lopinavir 400mg /ritonavir 100mg BID) + Raltegravir + Maraviroc or the "placebo" arm with standard HAART+ Placebo for 48 weeks. Another group of individuals diagnosed with acute or early HIV-1 who elect to forego early treatment will be followed as non-randomized, untreated controls. At week 48, all patients will be informed of study results. If results are positive in the intensive treatment group, the placebo group will be offered to roll-over to the intense treatment arm and followed as an open-label cohort out to five years. Participants may stop treatment at any time and withdraw from the study. If they choose to do so, they will be followed according to the standards employed for all HIV-1 patients at the Maple Leaf clinic. At the five year point, the decision to terminate treatment will be made based on the existing state of the HIV-1 literature at the time.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The major single criterion for inclusion into the study will be the presence of confirmed acute/early HIV1 infection, as defined by one of the three following criteria: 1. Positive HIV1 antibody test result (Western blot), with a documented negative test result in the previous six months or 2. Positive or weakly positive HIV1 antibody screening ELISA test result, with indeterminate and evolving confirmatory test result with demonstrated HIV1 antigenemia (p24 antigen test result) or viremia (HIV1 bDNA ≥ 500 copies/ml) or 3. Negative HIV1 antibody test result in the setting of an illness compatible with acute seroconversion with demonstrated HIV1 antigenemia (p24 antigen test result) or plasma viremia (HIV1 bDNA ≥ 500 copies/ml) Other inclusion criteria are: Ages 18 or older Ability to provide informed consent HIV1 viral load ≥ 5,000 copies/ml 1. Participants who would have difficulty participating in a trial due to nonadherence or substance abuse 2. Participants with any of the following abnormal laboratory test results in screening: Hemoglobin &lt; 85 g/L Neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/uL Platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/L AST or ALT &gt; 5X the upper limit of normal Creatinine &gt; 250 umol/L 3. Participant with a malignancy 4. Participant with other significant underlying disease (nonHIV1) that might impinge upon disease progression or death 5. Participant who is pregnant or who is trying to conceive</criteria>
