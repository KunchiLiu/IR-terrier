	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to study the immune activity of certain proteins present in the blood of patients with severe periodontal disease. Periodontal disease (gum disease) is the major cause of tooth loss among adults. Moderate to severe periodontal disease is reported to affect 5-15% of American adults. It begins with an infection of the tissues surrounding the teeth, and leads to a worsening inflammatory response. This study will aid in clarifying the way in which gum disease might affect certain systemic diseases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project will have two specific goals: 1. Identify microorganism components in the serum of patients with severe periodontitis; and 2. Characterize the immune regulator activity of periodontitis serum. This proposed feasibility study will then aid in providing the support for an increased sample size and other design requirements for larger, more expanded human clinical trial testing.In this study, forty (40) subjects will be divided into 2 groups: 1) Healthy oral status group and 2) Severe periodontal disease. Patients will be clinically screened using standard periodontal measurements.</detailed_description>
