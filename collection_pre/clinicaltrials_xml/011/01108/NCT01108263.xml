	<brief_summary>- After determining if subjects meet the criteria to be included in the study they will be randomly placed in either Group 1 or 2 and patient will be blinded from randomization group. - Subjects will walk across a pressure plate to determine different areas of high pressure under the foot. This will be done before the INTEGRA application and at every other follow-up visit. - Both groups will be debrided and have pictures taken in the OR - Group 1 will have Integra Flowable Wound Matrix applied onto the wound in the OR and Group 2 will have the Integra Flowable Wound Matrix applied onto the wound and injected subcutaneously in the OR. - Subjects will be placed in a total contact cast at each visit. If wound healing occurs prior to 12 weeks, a final assessment visit will be done and the status of the healed ulcer will be assessed.</brief_summary>
