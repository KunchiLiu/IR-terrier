	<brief_summary>BCCs are the most common human cancer in the US and affect over 1 million people. There is no effective drug to prevent basal cell carcinomas of the skin. We hope to learn if an oral antifungal drug, Itraconazole, might inhibit a marker of proliferation and a biomarker (tumor signaling pathway) of BCC development. Itraconazole is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin, and has been used for the past 25 years with relatively few side effects. It has been shown in mice to reduce a BCC biomarker and to reduce growth of BCCs. Thus, it may reduce BCC growth in humans.</brief_summary>
