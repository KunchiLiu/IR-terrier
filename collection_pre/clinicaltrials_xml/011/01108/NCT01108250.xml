	<brief_summary>This study is to investigate whether variants in the LOC387715 locus and the HtrA serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1) gene within the 10q26 locus are associated with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and whether they are associated with clinical patterns including angiographic phenotype in a Korean population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LOC387715/HTRA1 Variants in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy in a Korean Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cross-sectional case-control study. One hundred Korean patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and 100 control subjects were genotyped for the LOC387715 (rs10490924) and the HTRA1 gene polymorphism (rs11200638)</detailed_description>
