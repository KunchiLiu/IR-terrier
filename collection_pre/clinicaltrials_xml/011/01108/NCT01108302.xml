	<brief_summary>This cluster randomized community-based trial is designed to test the hypothesis that the intramuscular administration of 10 IU of oxytocin in Uniject™ during the third stage of labor by an Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) at births occurring in homes, Sub-Centers and Primary Health Centers in Bagalkot, India will reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage by 44% (from 9% to 5%) relative to home births attended by the same type of provider who does not provide the intervention drug. The study will also document correct use of oxytocin in Uniject, adverse maternal and fetal events associated with inappropriate use and a number of indicators reflecting the programmatic feasibility of implementing this intervention.</brief_summary>
