	<brief_summary>Cisplatin and carboplatin induce ototoxicity manifested as sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vestibular disturbances. Ototoxicity is induced via damage to inner ear structures by reactive oxygen species. Previous animal studies demonstrated that transtympanic injection of Ringer's Lactate (RL) provided near complete otoprotective effect against cisplatin. The purpose of this study is to determine if transtympanic administration of Ringer's Lactate via a pressure equalising (PE) tube in patients undergoing platinum based chemotherapy treatment will prevent tinnitus, vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss especially at high frequencies. Pre- and post- chemotherapy treatment audiometry will be measured and statistically analysed for significance.</brief_summary>
