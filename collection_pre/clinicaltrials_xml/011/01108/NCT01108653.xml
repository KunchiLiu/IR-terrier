	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators aim at comparing the effect on quality of life and the cost-effectiveness of a structuralised sick-leave program compared to usual care sick leave management in patients after an acute non ST myocardial infarction(NSTEMI).The investigators hypothesize that a structuralised sick-leave program after an acute NSTEMI is cost-effective without a negative effect on quality of life compared to usual care management in this patient group.</brief_summary>
