	<brief_title>Treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia With D-ribose- a Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia (CFS/FMS) are debilitating syndromes affecting ~ 2-4% of the population. Although they are heterogeneous conditions associated with many triggers, including infections, autoimmune illnesses, hormonal dysfunctions and other processes, they appear to have the common pathology of being associated with impaired energy metabolism. As D-ribose has been shown to increase cellular energy synthesis in heart and skeletal muscle, and was shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in CFS/FMS in an earlier pilot study, we conducted a larger, community based, multicenter trial to see if these findings could be generalized to a broader patient population. We hypothesized that giving D-ribose would improve function in CFS/FMS patients.</detailed_description>
