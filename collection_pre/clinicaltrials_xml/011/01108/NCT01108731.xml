	<brief_title>The Effect of Milnacipran in Patients With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Fibromyalgia will show elevated ventricular lactate levels as measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Patients treated with Milnacipran will show normalization of ventricular lactate levels compared to those treated with placebo, and will also show normalization of the increased latency to respond to complex reaction time probes compared to those treated with placebo.</detailed_description>
