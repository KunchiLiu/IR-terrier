	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine how Buprenorphine, a form of opioid addiction treatment, changes the ability to think and reason among people addicted to opiates, who are either HIV negative or HIV positive. In addition, blood samples will be stored for HIV+ and HIV- individuals who take buprenorphine to study its effect. We hypothesize that the HIV positive participants will demonstrate significant improvement in thinking and reasoning ability at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline, but that their thinking and reasoning ability will still be lower than HIV negative participants. We also hypothesize that the biomarkers in participants' blood samples will be associated with measures of change in thinking and reasoning ability.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented HIVserostatus Englishspeaking Age 1860 Able to give voluntary, signed informed consent Plan to initiate buprenorphine treatment in the next month. Over age 60: Participants over the age of 60 will be excluded, as normal ageassociated cognitive changes may confound neuropsychological (NP) assessment and diagnosis of HIVrelated cognitive disorders. Neurologic: History of head injury with loss of consciousness for greater than 12 hours; previous penetrating skull wounds; previous brain surgery; known seizure disorder, or any other nonHIV related CNS disorders that might affect neurocognitive functioning (e.g., previous cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor). Medical: e.g. collagen vascular disorder (e.g. lupus), oxygen requiring chronic pulmonary disease,, or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Psychiatric: Lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Less than 6 years of education. Acute intoxication due to alcohol or other drugs, as assessed by research staff. Use of buprenorphine in the past month, either prescribed or purchased on the street.</criteria>
