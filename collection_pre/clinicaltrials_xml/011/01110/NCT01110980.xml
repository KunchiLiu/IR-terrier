	<brief_summary>- Background: Oral nutrition appears to be a challenge for patients with head and neck cancer after radiotherapy. Many patients desire to (their) `normal food intake` and return to oral nutrition with normal consistency without modifications and diet formulas. Due to the dysphagia experienced post treatment this seems tremendously difficult. Referral to a speech-language therapist for swallowing therapy is no standard procedure. - Study design: A prospective randomized study in patients with a tumor in Oral cavity, Nasopharynx, Oropharynx, Hypopharynx or Larynx with stage II-IV (UICC TNM-tumor classification), â‰¥ 18 years, eligible for primary treatment with (chemo)radiation or adjuvant radiotherapy with curative intent. - Intervention: Individually tailored swallowing therapy by an experienced speech-language therapist in cooperation with individual dietary counselling (by an experienced dietician, `usual care`) pre-, per- and post treatment (until 6 months after treatment). This might improve `normalcy of food intake`, quality (no food modifications) and quantity of food intake and besides decrease the use of tube feeding and/or nutritional supplements. Also patients quality of life and nutritional status may be influenced positively. - Study hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to determine whether combined individual swallowing therapy and individual dietary counselling in patients with head and neck cancer receiving (chemo)radiotherapy can improve 'normal food intake'. Food intake without modifications and tube feeding and/or nutritional supplements.</brief_summary>
