	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a new formulation of ketoconazole 2% cream is as effective as a current formulation of ketoconazole 2% cream (Nizoral) compared with placebo in treating patients with Tinea pedis, a skin infection commonly known as "athlete's foot" that is caused by a kind of mold called a fungus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy Study of a New Formulation of Ketoconazole 2% Cream in Patients With Tinea Pedis, Commonly Known as Athlete's Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned treatment), multicentre study in Poland and the United Kingdom designed to assess the mycological (fungal) cure rate and clinical efficacy of a new formulation of ketoconazole 2% cream (F126) with the current formulation of ketoconazole 2% cream (Nizoral) (F012) compared with placebo cream in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated interdigital (between the toes) Tinea pedis, a skin infection commonly known as "athlete's foot" that is caused by a kind of mold called a fungus. Approximately 548 patients who have symptomatic uncomplicated interdigital Tinea pedis confirmed by positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy (examination using a microscope) and mycological (fungal) culture will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 formulations of ketoconazole 2% cream (formulation F012 or F126) or placebo cream. There will be 4 study visits during the study. At Visit 1 (baseline), patients will sign the informed consent and be assessed for mycological and clinical signs and symptoms of Tinea pedis. Baseline demographics (age, race, etc), medical history and medication (s) that the patient is currently taking will be recorded. Patients will be issued with a tube of the cream and instructed to apply the cream sparingly to all affected areas of the foot (or feet), once daily (at night or in the evenings) for a total of 4 weeks according to protocol-specified guidelines. During the 4-week treatment period patients will return to the study every 2 weeks to be assessed for clinical signs and symptoms. After the 4-week treatment period, patients will continue participation in the study for an additional 2 weeks without medication. Patients will return then return to the study center for a final visit (Visit 4, Week 6) at which time skin scrapings will be sampled from interdigital spaces on both feet for KOH microscopy and mycological culture. The primary efficacy endpoint is to determine whether a new formulation of ketoconazole 2% cream is equivalent (or as effective) as the current formulation of ketoconazole 2% cream (Nizoral) compared to a placebo cream in achieving a mycological cure (defined as negative KOH microscopy and negative mycological culture) following 4 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome measure in the study is a mycological cure (defined as negative KOH microscopy and negative mycological culture) at week 6. Patients will be monitored for safety (occurrence of adverse events, use of concomitant medications, and reasons for premature discontinuation from the study) from Visit 1 through Visit 4 (Week 6 or time of early termination from study). Patients will be provided with up to two 15g tubes of ketoconazole cream (formulation F126 or F012) or matching placebo cream and be instructed to apply cream sparingly to affected areas of the feet once daily at night or in the evening for 4 weeks according to protocol specified guidelines.</detailed_description>
