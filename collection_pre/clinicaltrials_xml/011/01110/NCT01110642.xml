	<brief_summary>This is an open label-pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of a novel cholesterol-lovastatin topical solution in children with rare syndromic ichthyoses. Often times, these children have difficulty in finding easily applied treatments to make their psoriasiform and ichthyotic plaques more manageable. We propose the use of a cholesterol-lovastatin topical solution as a treatment option with the hypothesis that it will lead to regression of involved areas and decreased erythema and warty-like appearance of the plaques. We plan to enroll children with syndromic ichthyoses over the age of 1 year for a 12 month study with a total of 5 visits and 5 phone calls.</brief_summary>
