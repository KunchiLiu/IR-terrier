	<brief_summary>By ingesting a non-radioactive and non-toxic compound "heavy water" for 6 weeks, the DNA of newly developed cells in the body of subjects with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be labeled and followed by performing routine blood draws at specified time intervals. By using mass spectrometric analysis we can measure how quickly new B-CLL cells are generated in the bone marrow and how quickly they leave the blood, a measure of cell turnover. This will help us to better understand the unique characteristics of this disease process.</brief_summary>
