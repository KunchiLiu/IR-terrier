	<brief_title>ABT-348 as Monotherapy or Combination With Carboplatin or Docetaxel to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose of ABT-348 as monotherapy and when given in combination with carboplatin or docetaxel. The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety at the recommended Phase 2 dose and evaluate preliminary efficacy data regarding objective response rate time to progression, duration of overall response, and ECOG performance status of ABT-348 as monotherapy and when given in combination with carboplatin or docetaxel.</detailed_description>
