	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to test the experimental reproducibility and within-subject variability of qEEG (quantitative electroencephalogram) using two probe compounds: MK3134 and lorazepam. This study will test the hypothesis that EEG (Electroencephalogram) theta power, averaged across a topographical region of interest is decreased 6 hours after administration of MK3134 compared to placebo. The objective of this study is to test the experimental reproducibility and within-subject variability of qEEG using two probe compounds: MK3134 and lorazepam.</brief_summary>
