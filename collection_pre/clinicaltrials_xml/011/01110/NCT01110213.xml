	<brief_title>Goal Setting and Lifestyle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goal setting has become an integral part of physical activity and dietary interventions; however, few studies have examined the theoretical constructs that drive goal-setting theory. To address the limitations and gaps in the literature, we designed an 8-week health behavior intervention for a racially and ethnically diverse sample of older adults. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether older adults randomized to a goal-setting intervention for physical activity or fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake would make significant improvements in physical activity or F&amp;V intake. The secondary aim of this study was to determine whether participating in goal-setting interventions was associated with changes in theoretical constructs related to goal-setting. We hypothesized that older adults assigned to the physical activity condition would significantly increase metabolic minutes (MET-minutes) of physical activity from baseline to follow-up and that participants assigned to the F&amp;V intake condition would significantly increase mean servings of F&amp;V. In addition, we hypothesized that mean scores of goal specificity, difficulty, effort, commitment, persistence, barrier self-efficacy, and task self-efficacy would significantly increase from baseline to follow-up for both groups.</detailed_description>
