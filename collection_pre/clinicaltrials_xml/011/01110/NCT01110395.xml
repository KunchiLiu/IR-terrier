	<brief_summary>Heart needs constant supply of energy to continue working. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows us to measure energy produced in the heart. The purpose of this study is to determine if the energy production is reduced in failing heart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phosphorous Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Heart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will use non-invasive phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique to measure creatine kinase (CK) flux in failing heart. The studies will be done on Siemens 3.0T human system. We will recruit subjects with LV dysfunction due to prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
