	<criteria>Signed informed consent prior to study specific procedures. Premenopausal, regularly menstruating women. Age ≥18 years. Body weight between 50 and 90 kg. Haemoglobin ≥115 g/L. Iron deficiency at screening defined as follows: Sferritin level &lt;50 ng/mL, AND, TfS &lt;20%, OR, Sferritin level &lt;15 ng/mL. Serum Creactive protein: &lt;5 mg/L if not on oral contraception, OR, &lt;20 mg/L if use of oral contraception. Minimum total score of 5 on the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) (mean of items 2 to 23). Negative pregnancy test (serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at screening. Normal levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid at screening. Adequate contraception during the study period and for 1 month following study completion. Availability and willingness to complete all study visits and procedures per protocol. Haemoglobin level &lt;115 g/L. Haemoglobinopathy. Haemochromatose. Major depressive disorder based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) (5 items with scores ≥2; one of which corresponds to question number 1 or 2). Any active or unstable concurrent medical condition (e.g., cancer, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase (AST); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3fold upper limit), angina (Class IV). Known human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. Chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease). Documented history of clinically significant level of sleep apnoea defined as 5 or more episodes per hour of any type of apnoea. Intake of concurrent medications that could interfere with physical or mental performance (e.g., antidepressive, antihistamines, narcotic or any chemotherapeutic agents known to cause drowsiness). Important recent weight loss (&gt;10% within the past month). Body weight &lt;50 kg or &gt;90 kg. Thyroid dysfunction, thyroid stimulating hormone &gt;4 μU/mL. Intake of iron preparations 4 weeks prior to screening. Use of gestagens e.g., Implanon, Mirena, DepoProvera for menstruation repression (see Section 7.7, Prohibited Therapy or Concomitant Treatment, page 35). Known hypersensitivity to FCM or to any other iron preparation. Pregnancy (positive hCG test at screening) or breast feeding. Participation in any other interventional trial within 4 weeks prior to screening. Inability to fully comprehend and/or perform study procedures or provide written consent in the Investigator's opinion. Subject is not using adequate contraceptive precautions during the study and for up to 1 month after the last dose of the study medication. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner. Subject previously has entered this study. Subject will not be available for followup assessments.</criteria>
