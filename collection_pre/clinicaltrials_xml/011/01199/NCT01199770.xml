	<brief_summary>Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds to pasta containing different amounts of protein and fiber when provided in two different portion sizes. In this research study, subjects will be asked to eat an entire pasta serving containing different amounts of protein and fiber mixtures. Subjects will be asked to do this on six separate occasions. One time subjects will not receive pasta, only water. After the pasta serving, there will be a buffet of deli style lunch items and subjects may eat as much they desire. Thereafter subjects will describe their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat for 3 hours. In addition, blood will be taken throughout the study period to determine how eating pasta servings in different portion sizes impacts certain hormones released from the intestine, and therefore how they influence appetite. All study visits will take approximately 4 Â½ - 5 hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pasta Formulations, Portion Sizes and Their Effect on Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized, 7-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 3-hour postprandial crossover study to evaluate the satiety and metabolic effects of pasta formulations in 2 portion sizes on lunch intake in healthy weight women. The study design will test 3 varying pasta formulations (2 experimental and 1 standard control) at 2 fixed portion sizes in a preload plus test lunch setting in relatively healthy unrestrained women. This study will require one initial screening visit (approximately 1 hour) and seven study visits each lasting approximately 5 hours. All visits should be completed within 2 months. We are looking for healthy, non-smoking women older than 18 years of age with no significant medical history. The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and waist circumference measurements, vital signs, blood glucose test (finger prick) and completion of a series of surveys relating to eating, health, exercise and mood. If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have seven study visits. The pasta meal will be provided 5 hours after a standardized breakfast which is considered the usual breakfast for each subject at the same time of day on each study visit day. Upon arrival at each visit, subjects will have anthropometric measurements, vital signs and blood glucose finger prick. Thereafter, subjects will document subjective feelings of satiety followed by a blood draw. Upon completion of pre-study procedures, subjects will be asked to consume an entire pasta serving (with the exception of one visit, where no pasta will be served). Shortly thereafter, subjects will be served a buffet lunch and they may eat as desired, asking for more if desired. Throughout the study and after the lunch buffet, subjects will be followed for 3 hours assessing subjective feelings of satiety at designated time points along with blood draws measuring metabolic associated meal responses. During the course of the study, subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual level of activity and diet. Four day food records will be maintained throughout the course of the study.</detailed_description>
