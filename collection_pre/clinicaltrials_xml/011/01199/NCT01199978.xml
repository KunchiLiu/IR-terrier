	<brief_summary>In this research study we are looking at another type of radiation called proton radiation which is known to spare surrounding normal tissues from radiation. The proton radiation will be delivered using fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) to improve localization of the small tumor target. Proton radiation delivers minimal radiation beyond the area of the tumor. This may reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with conventional radiation therapy. In this research study, we are looking to determine the effects of fractionated proton radiotherapy on long-term hearing preservation and controlling tumor growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hearing Outcomes Using Fractionated Proton Radiation Therapy for Vestibular Schwannoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Proton radiation will be delivered daily for approximately 5.5 weeks. Participants will be assessed weekly for any side effects they may be experiencing. - Participants will have a follow-up visit 6 months after their last proton radiation treatment and then every year from the time of treatment completion for 5 years. The following tests and procedures will be performed at these visits: medical history, physical exam, MRI scan, comprehensive hearing tests and a questionnaire.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MRI confirmed unilateral vestibular schwannoma within 8 weeks prior to study entry Measurable disease, defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension No prior radiotherapy with dose delivered to structures in proximity to the internal acoustic canal is allowable Participants must have baseline "useful hearing" defined at the discretion of the treating physician in the irradiated ear 18 years of age or older Life expectancy of greater than 60 months Karnofsky performance status 60 or greater Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception during the interval of irradiation Able to tolerate the supine position as required for the radiation treatment unit and able to tolerate rotation needed for treatment delivery Willing and able to comply with comprehensive audiologic testing, at baseline prior to radiation therapy, at 6 months from treatment completion, and at annual timepoints for 5 years after completion Participants who have had prior radiotherapy, with dose delivered to structures in proximity to the internal acoustic canal Participants with tumors (or residual tumor after surgery) measuring &gt; 3cm in greatest dimension Participants may not be receiving any other study agents History of adverse reaction to radiotherapy Participants receiving any medications or substances that are known to cause ototoxicity are ineligible Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women Individuals with a history of malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of malignancies are eligible if they have been diseasefree for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be a low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. HIVpositive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy Patients with coexisting major ear disease, such as chronic otitis, Menieres disease, or otosclerosis</criteria>
