	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Oral Mirabegron on the Heart in Healthy Males and Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject will be randomized and participate in two 10-day treatment periods during which once daily dosing of mirabegron and mirabegron/moxifloxacin placebo or moxifloxacin and moxifloxacin/mirabegron placebo will occur followed by a 1-day post-treatment period. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 12 days from the last dose of study drug on Day 10 of Period 1 to Day -4 of Period 2.</detailed_description>
