	<brief_summary>This registry is primarily aiming to demonstrate the correlation between good practices of anesthesiologists and patient related outcomes including decreased overall anesthesia cost. The investigators would also like to demonstrate how the training background, and experience in inhalational anesthesia of the anesthesiologist influence their daily practice. At the end of the registry, the investigators would be able to demonstrate the influence of different practice pattern on patient related outcomes between the sites at which anesthesiologists follow modern anesthesiology practice based on their training/experience background and at which anesthesiologists do not follow same type of practice due to lack of their inhalational anesthesia training/experience.</brief_summary>
