	<brief_summary>Background: Limited published evidence shows specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) to be a potential intervention option for cow's milk proteins (CMPs) allergy. Our hypothesis is that SOTI should be started early in order to improve its efficacy and prevent CMPs sensitization from evolving towards persistent allergy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SOTI in 2-year-old children with cow's milk allergy, as a treatment alternative to elimination diet. Methods: A total of 60 children between 24-36 months of age with IgE-mediated allergy to CMPs were included in this multicenter study and were randomly divided into two different groups. Thirty children (group A: treatment group) began SOTI immediately, whereas the remaining 30 (group B: control group) were kept on a milk-free diet and followed-up on for one year.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Infants between 2436 months of age. 2. IgEmediated allergy to CMPs meeting all the following diagnostic criteria: Immediatetype clinical manifestations, skin (urticaria, angioedema and/or erythema), digestive (acute vomiting and/or diarrhea) or respiratory (bronchospasm and/or rhinitis) involvement in the first two hours after cow's milk ingestion. Skin test readings ≥ 3 mm and specific IgE titers &gt; 0.35 kU/l for whole cow's milk or someone of isolated CMPs (casein, alphalactalbumin, betalactoglobulin ) 3. Persistence of CMP allergy in the four weeks prior to tolerance induction, based on the following criteria: Skin (prick) test readings ≥3 mm and specific IgE titers (CAPFEIA) &gt;0.35 kU/l for whole cow's milk or someone of isolated CMPs (casein, alphalactalbumin, betalactoglobulin ) Doubleblind placebocontrolled challenge (DBPCFC) positive to cow's milk. 4. Written informed consent from the parents. 1. Clinical manifestations of anaphylactic shock after the ingestion of cow's milk. 2. NonIgEmediated or nonimmunological adverse reactions to cow's milk. 3. Malignant or immunopathological diseases and/or severe primary or secondary immune deficiencies. 4. Patients receiving immunosuppressor therapy. 5. Patients receiving betablockers (including topical formulations). 6. Associated diseases contraindicating the use of adrenalin: cardiovascular disease or severe hypertension</criteria>
