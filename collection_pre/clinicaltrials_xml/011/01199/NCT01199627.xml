	<brief_summary>The bleeding caused by hip replacement surgery (CRT) is an important source of demand for blood in the hospital. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a drug that has proved useful in reducing bleeding associated with other surgeries and CRT results have been positive, but the variety of dosages difficult to evaluate the results To determine the efficacy and safety of TXA in reducing bleeding caused by surgery of total hip replacement. PATIENTS: Patients ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) I-III that they are to perform hip replacement surgery and cementless unilateral total that have signed the informed consent. Group A: 1st dose 15mg/kg of TXA in 100ml saline 0.9% after the completion of regional anesthesia, and before the start of surgery. 2nd dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in 100ml of saline 0.9% at three hours after the first administration. Group B: 1st dose: 10mg/kg of TXA in 100ml 0.9% saline after the completion of regional anesthesia, and before the start of surgery. 2nd dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes of 10mg/kg of TXA in 100ml saline 0.9% at three hours after the first administration. Group C: 1st dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in 100ml of 0.9% saline after the completion of regional anesthesia, and before the start of surgery. 2nd dose: intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in 100ml of saline 0.9% at three hours after the first administration.
