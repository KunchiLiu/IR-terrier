	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to describe patients with a high bone mass phenotype due to a mutation in the low density lipoprotein l receptor 5 gene (LRP5) and compare them with age and sex matched controls. Moreover, bone density and microarchitecture as well as markers of bone metabolism are evaluated</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment of Patients With High Bone Mass Due to Mutation in Lrp5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cases and controls are closely matched on age and sex and evaluated cross-sectionally. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) are used in order to evaluate bone density as well as microarchitecture. Bone turnover markers and body composition are also measured.</detailed_description>
