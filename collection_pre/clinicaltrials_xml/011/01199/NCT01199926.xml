	<brief_summary>The study was designed to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation during exercise training on body composition, muscle function, and glucose tolerance. The investigators hypothesis for these studies is that vitamin D supplementation enhances exercise-induced increases in strength and lean mass, potentially through enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation.</brief_summary>
