	<brief_summary>Objective of the study is to test whether Daptomycin (6 mg/kg bodyweight) is non-inferior in treatment of severe diabetic foot infections (MRSA) in comparison to antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin (effective blood-plasma concentration of 15 mg/l). In case of microbiologically confirmed gram-negative co-infection effective antibiotic treatment according to microbiologic analysis will be administered upon medical decision in both therapy groups. The study will be carried out as a randomized, open label study.</brief_summary>
