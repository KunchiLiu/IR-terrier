	<brief_title>Study Comparing Plate Stabilization to Conservative Treatment in Midshaft Clavicle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Midshaft clavicle fractures are common comprising 2% of all fractures and 35% to 45% of all shoulder girdle injuries in adults. Old-established treatment practices, based on no randomised controlled trials, are used for clavicle fractures. By tradition, midshaft clavicle fractures have been treated conservatively with arm immobilized to a sling for few weeks. The goal of treatment is to restore painless function of the upper extremity. There have been some recommendations for operative treatment, such as skin compromising in fracture area, open fracture, floating shoulder, neurovascular symptoms in upper extremity, or multiple injuries. Recently, increasing interest has emerged in the surgical treatment.</detailed_description>
