	<brief_summary>Participants in this single-center, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study will initially receive intravenous (I.V.) IMC-3G3 once every 2 weeks or on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 6 weeks (one cycle). After the first cycle, patients experiencing an overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) will continue to receive IMC-3G3 at their cohort dose and schedule until there is evidence of progressive disease (PD), or until other withdrawal criteria are met.</brief_summary>
