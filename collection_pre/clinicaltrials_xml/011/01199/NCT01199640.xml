	<brief_summary>This was a phase 2a study of MLN1202 to determine safety, tolerability and initial efficacy in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It was conducted in 2 dose cohorts enrolling a total of 50 patients. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the numbers of new gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions during the screening and treatment periods.</brief_summary>
