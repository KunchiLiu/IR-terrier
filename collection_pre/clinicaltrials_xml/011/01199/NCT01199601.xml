	<brief_summary>Baseline information indicates there are measurable levels of hepatitis B SAg and low utilization of postpartum contraception, correct breastfeeding practices, or adherence to infant vaccination schedules in Kabul, Afghanistan. This intervention will randomize hospitals to assess the following aims: Aim 1: To determine whether the re-training and assignment of health care providers dedicated to intrapartum rapid testing and post-partum counseling will positively impact maternal and neonatal health indicators as compared to utilization of existing health providers for these services among women delivering in publish health maternity hospitals in Kabul, Afghanistan. Aim 2: To assess whether patients randomized to the intervention and their spouses perceive value in concentrated post-partum counseling. Aim 3: To investigate whether an intervention providing immediate post-partum provision of a long-acting family planning method would be feasible and acceptable to both men and women in Kabul, Afghanistan. Outcomes will be assessed through questionnaire responses and inspection of vaccination cards at six month intervals by trained study staff. The third aim will be addressed at the 12 month follow-up visit.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline information indicates a measurable prevalence of hepatitis B SAg and low utilization of postpartum contraception, correct breastfeeding practices, or adherence to infant vaccination schedules in Kabul, Afghanistan. This intervention randomizes providers at maternity hospitals to assess the following aims: Aim 1: To determine whether the re-training and assignment of health care providers dedicated to intrapartum hepatitis B rapid testing and postpartum counseling will positively impact maternal and neonatal health indicators as compared to utilization of existing health providers for these services among women delivering in public health maternity hospitals in Kabul, Afghanistan. Aim 2: To assess whether patients randomized to the intervention and their spouses perceive value in concentrated postpartum counseling. Aim 3: To investigate whether an intervention providing immediate postpartum provision of a long-acting family planning method would be feasible and acceptable to both men and women in Kabul, Afghanistan. Outcomes are assessed through questionnaire responses and inspection of vaccination cards at six month intervals by trained study staff through one year total study time. Differences between groups will be assessed with generalized linear mixed modeling. Information obtained to address Aim 3 will be gathered at the 12 month follow-up and analyzed with simple proportions and Chi-square test to assess differences between sexes and other socioeconomic indicators.</detailed_description>
