	<brief_title>Study of CX-4945 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated CK2 activity has been associated with malignant transformation and aggressive tumor growth. Over expression of CK2 has been documented in multiple types of cancers, including multiple myeloma, and inhibition of CK2 represents a potential therapeutic strategy to target a specific molecular defect perpetuating many cancers. CX-4945 has demonstrated potent inhibition of CK2 enzymatic activity. This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of CX-4945 when administered to patients with multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>
