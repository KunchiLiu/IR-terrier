	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate a new approach to immunotherapy in NHL by combining two antibodies, veltuzumab and epratuzumab. For treatment, epratuzumab has also been attached to a radioactive isotope called 90yttrium (90Y-epratuzumab). Veltuzumab and 90Y-epratuzumab attack different areas on lymphoma cells. Because of this, treatment with the combination may provide more effective treatment in NHL than either veltuzumab or 90Y-epratuzumab given alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Veltuzumab and 90Y-Epratuzumab in Relapsed/Refractory, Aggressive NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment portion of this study consists of study drug administrations each week for four weeks in a row (a total of 4 treatment days). Patients will then return at intervals up to 12 weeks for blood samples and for evaluations to see if their disease responded and to monitor any adverse effects related to treatment. Some blood tests may then need to be repeated at least a few times and/or until any abnormal findings at earlier evaluations have resolved. Otherwise, patients will continue to be evaluated every 3 months for two years, then every 6 months up to 5 years or until the disease worsens. Participation in the study will end when NHL disease worsens.</detailed_description>

Screened for hepatitis B (no time limit) and negative by tests included in NCCN guidelines (hepatitis B surface antigen/antibodies, core antigen/antibodies, hepatitis B eantigen). Patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice birth control during the study until at least 12 weeks after last veltuzumab infusion; women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test to enter the study.

Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy test NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction to prior antiCD20 antibodies (rituximab, veltuzumab, etc.) A known antiantibody response to prior antiCD20 antibodies (HACA positive, HAHA positive, etc) Prior radioimmunotherapy, including Zevalin or Bexxar. Prior highdose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Prior therapy with other human or humanized monoclonal antibodies, unless HAHA tested and negative Primary CNS lymphoma, HIV lymphoma or transformed lymphoma, or presence of symptomatic CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis. Rituximab or veltuzumab resistant, defined as having progressed during or within 6 months of any prior rituximab or veltuzumab treatment. Bulky disease by CT, defined as any single mass &gt;10 cm in its greatest diameter Bone marrow involvement ≥25% Prior external beam radiation therapy to &gt;30% bone marrow. Pleural effusion with positive cytology for lymphoma Patients known to be HIV positive, hepatitis B positive, or hepatitis C positive Known autoimmune disease or presence of autoimmune phenomena. Evidence of infection or requiring antibiotics within 7 days. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks, except low dose regimens (prednisone, &lt;20 mg/day, or equivalent) which may continue if unchanged. Prior malignancies (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) unless disease free for 5 years. Prior malignancy with less than a 5year diseasefree interval, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of study procedures and followup examinations</criteria>
