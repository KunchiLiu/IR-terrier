	<criteria>Subject understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent. Subject is willing to return to the investigational site for the thirty day and six month followup evaluations. Age 18 years to 80 years. Subject with a nonruptured saccular, or fusiform intracranial aneurysm arising from a parent vessel with a diameter of &gt; 2mm and &lt; 6mm. Pregnancy Enrollment in another trial Allergy or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, local or general anesthesia History of life threatening allergy to contrast dye. Major surgery within previous 30 days or planned in the next 90 days after enrollment date. Severe neurological deficit that renders the patient incapable of living independently Dementia or psychiatric problem that prevents the patient from completing required follow up Comorbid conditions that may limit survival to less than one year Subject with anatomy not appropriate for endovascular treatment due to severe intracranial vessel tortuosity or stenosis, or intracranial vasospasm not responsive to medical therapy. Subject with an intracranial mass (tumor (except meningioma), abscess, or other infection), or is undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma or sarcoma of the head or neck region. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5, or will refuse blood transfusions. Subject has a serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dL (within 7 days of procedure) which the investigator determines restricts the use of contrast agents. Subject has a previously implanted intracranial stent associated with the symptomatic distribution within the past 12 weeks prior to enrollment date Stenting, angioplasty, or endarterectomy of an extracranial (carotid or vertebral artery) or intracranial artery within 30 days prior to enrollment date Subject has a previously implanted carotid stent associated with the symptomatic distribution within the past 12 weeks prior to enrollment date Subject has uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or known cardiac disorders likely to be associated with cardioembolic symptoms. Subject had a subarachnoid hemorrhage within 12 weeks prior to the enrollment date. Subject with resistance to ASA and/or Clopidogrel. Subject with two or more aneurysms in associated distribution unless the device is used to treat both aneurysms. Subject has a nontreated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the territory of the target aneurysm. Target aneurysm is expected to require more than one device.</criteria>
