	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest marker of atherosclerosis and is measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. The purpose of the study was to measure FMD in mild, stable SLE patients and look for change in FMD with the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).</brief_summary>
