	<brief_summary>This study is a Ph I trial to test the safety of the study drug, hLL1-DOX at different dose levels in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma. HLL1 is also known as milatuzumab and is attached to doxorubicin in this clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of hLL1-DOX (Milatuzumab-Doxorubicin Antibody-Drug Conjugate) in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this clinical research trial, hLL1-DOX will be administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. This treatment cycle will be repeated every 3 weeks as long as patients continue to tolerate it, for a maximum of 8 treatment cycles (approximately 6 months).</detailed_description>
