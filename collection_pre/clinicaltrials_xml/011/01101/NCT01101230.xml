	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to build the evidence base for approval of FDA health claims related to almonds and cardiovascular disease. A randomized, 2-period, crossover controlled feeding study was designed to compare the effects of two blood cholesterol lowering diets that meet the American Heart Association recommendations. The nutrient profiles of the control diet (no almonds/day) and almond diet (1.5 oz. of almonds/day) are matched for protein, saturated fat, and cholesterol. The study population consists of two cohorts of 25 men and women with moderately elevated LDL-C. The investigators hypothesize that a cholesterol-lowering diet designed with almonds confers greater cardioprotective effects than a cholesterol-lowering diet without almonds on the basis of the LDL-C lowering response, effect on LDL particle size, abdominal adiposity and vascular health.</brief_summary>
