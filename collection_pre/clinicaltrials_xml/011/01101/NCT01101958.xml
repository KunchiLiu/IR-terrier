	<brief_title>A Study of the Use of Chartis Assessment System to Optimize Subject Selection for Endobronchial Lung Volume Reduction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center study which will enroll up to 120 patients. Subjects will undergo a Chartis Assessment prior to EBV treatment. The Chartis assessment will determine the presence or absence of collateral ventilation, a potential determining factor in the success of EBV therapy. This study is not randomized; all subjects are eligible to receive EBV Treatment, regardless of Chartis Assessment outcome. Follow-up data will only be collected on those patients that meet the Chartis inclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
