	<brief_summary>This study's primary objective is to determine if continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can adequately remove the sulfobutylether-ÃŸ-cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD) vehicle from the blood so that intravenous voriconazole can be utilized in critically ill patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis. Secondarily, the pharmacokinetics of intravenous voriconazole and its metabolite (UK121-265) and adverse effects of SBECD accumulation will also be evaluated. The study hypothesis is that CRRT is effective at removing SBECD and allows patients to receive intravenous voriconazole without the concern of SBECD accumulation.</brief_summary>
