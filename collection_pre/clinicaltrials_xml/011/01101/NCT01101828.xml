	<brief_title>Self-collected Swabs for HPV Testing in 18-24 Year Old Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a cross-sectional study among 150 women in the United States who have used Internet dating sites in the past year in order to examine risk factors for high-risk HPV infections in 18-24 year old online daters, and evaluate strategies for transporting and storing self-collected samples for HPV testing. We will ask participants to complete a written questionnaire on their health, sexual behavior, and attitudes toward self-collecting vaginal swabs, HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer screening. Also, we will ask the women to self-collect two sequential vaginal swab samples that will be transported and stored according to the two strategies described above. Each sample will be tested for type-specific HPV DNA using a PCR-based assay.</detailed_description>
