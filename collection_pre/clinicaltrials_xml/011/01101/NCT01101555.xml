	<brief_title>Repeat Dose Subcutaneous Rhumatoid Arthritis Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Otelixizumab is a humanized, aglycosyl, non-mitogenic, anti CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against the ε domain of the human lymphocyte antigen CD3, which is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patients and has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients in small exploratory studies. Otelixizumab has been administered via the subcutaneous route as a single dose in type I diabetes patients. This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study of otelixizumab administered subcutaneously in rheumatoid arthritis patients. One cohort will receive a single dose of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott) as rescue medication to assess additional concomitant safety and tolerability issues. This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby otelixizumab will be administered to cohorts in a staggered fashion. Six cumulative doses will be evaluated covering a 10-fold dose range in seven cohorts. The starting regimen will be three doses (1.5 mg cumulative dose), increasing to 15 doses (15 mg cumulative dose). Cohorts 1a and 1b have been included as optional lower doses. Serial blood samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum otelixizumab PK parameters, and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the previous dose(s) will be evaluated prior to dose escalation or modification to ensure safety and to achieve target systemic peripheral blood pharmacology. Adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to monitor and ensure patient safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: 1. Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive. 2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: 1. Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. 2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1.1 for an appropriate period of time to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for at least two weeks prior to dosing and for at least 60 days after the last dose. 3. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until at least 60 days after the last dose of otelixizumab or two months after adalimumab (Cohort 6 only). 4.
