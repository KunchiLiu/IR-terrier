	<brief_summary>The endothelial dysfunction is the early event in atherosclerosis. The investigator previous study showed that impaired endothelial function exist in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that intensive multifactorial therapy including intensive blood control and intensive hypertension control as well as intensive blood lipids control of 1 year can improve vascular endothelial function. Moreover, the improvement of endothelial function maintains after 5 years or 10 years of intensive multifactorial therapy, called "Metabolic Memorial Effect of improvement of endothelial function".</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Intensive Multifactorial Therapy on Endothelial Function in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- We select 1000 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. They are divided into two groups, respectively (Intensive multifactorial therapy and conventional multifactorial therapy groups). After those therapy for one year, a 10 years of follow up study will be performed. During this period, we take them together intensive education, and take conventional multifactorial therapy for both of two groups. - At the beginning (0 year),the end of intensive multifactorial therapy (1 year), 5 years and 10 years, we will measure the endothelium-dependent arterial dilation, endothelium related cytokines such as ET-1, vWF,as well as blood glucose, HbA1c for all of individuals. - We will compare the endothelial function,endothelium related cytokines such as ET-1, vWF,as well as blood glucose, HbA1c between intensive therapy group and conventional therapy group at different time points.</detailed_description>
