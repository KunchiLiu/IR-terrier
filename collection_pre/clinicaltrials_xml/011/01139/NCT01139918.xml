	<brief_summary>This exploratory study will be used to identify questions that will be part of a new QoL questionnaire for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to determine the sample size needed for its validation. The new questionnaire will be a global QoL questionnaire which will take into account the impact of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on QoL. STUDY OBJECTIVES - To evaluate the influence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on patient's answers to QoL questions from DLQI, HAQ, EQ-5D, FACIT-fatigue and SF-36. - To identify an equal number of questions from DLQI, HAQ, EQ-5D, FACIT-fatigue and SF-36 where answers are mostly influenced either by psoriatic arthritis or by psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study on Quality of Life in Patient With Moderate Psoriasis and Moderate Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will recruit three cohorts of 40 patients each: moderate psoriatic arthritis and moderate psoriasis, mild psoriatic arthritis and moderate psoriasis, moderate psoriatic arthritis and mild psoriasis. Eligible patients will fill the following questionnaires: Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), EQ-5D, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). In addition, each patient will be asked on a 4 point Likert scale how much their answer to each question is related to the impact of their skin disease or their psoriatic arthritis.</detailed_description>
