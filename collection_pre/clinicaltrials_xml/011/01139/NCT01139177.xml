	<criteria>Screening 1. Patient must be ≥ 21 years of age with life expectancy &gt; 1 year. 2. Symptomatic leg ischemia requiring treatment of the superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery (Rutherford category 24; claudication, rest pain). 3. Patient must be a suitable candidate for PTA and stenting. 4. Patient is willing and able to return to the site of the investigation at the specified study intervals and undergo followup requirements. 5. The patient or legal representative has provided written informed consent using a form that is reviewed and approved by the EC for the Clinical Site. PreIntervention 1. Target lesion has ≥ 50% stenosis as demonstrated angiographically. 2. Lesion length ≤ 15 cm. 3. Reference vessel diameter of 5 to 6 mm. 4. Patient has at least 1 vessel runoff prior to treatment. Screening 1. The subject is pregnant or will become pregnant during the study or has any other condition that would preclude having xrays. (Premenopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of the procedure.) 2. Patients who have experienced a cardiovascular accident (CVA) or a myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months prior to the procedure. 3. Subject has had or plans to have a surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days before or after the implantation procedure of the SAMBA Stent. 4. Existing hemorrhagic disease or coagulation problems or inability to take dual antiplatelet therapy. 5. Contrast allergy that cannot be corrected with medication (e.g. steroids, etc.). 6. Subject has other medical, social, or psychological problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures and evaluations pre and posttreatment. 7. Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study. PreIntervention 1. Uncorrectable severe aortoiliac occlusive disease or severe common femoral artery stenosis preventing access or limiting inflow (e.g., stenosis greater than 50%). 2. Uncorrectable occlusive disease limiting outflow (e.g., stenosis greater than 50%) 3. Patients with previous surgery in the target vessel or stent that will be closer than 2 cm to either edge of SAMBA Stent(s). 4. Lack of 1 cm of healthy vessel proximal to proximal target 5. Lack of popliteal reconstitution (at least 2 cm of normal distal popliteal). 6. Inability to cross the lesion with a guidewire. 7. More than 1 lesion in the same limb requiring treatment that will not be covered by continuous stenting. 8. Unsuccessful balloon predilation (i.e., the residual stenosis is greater than 30%).</criteria>
