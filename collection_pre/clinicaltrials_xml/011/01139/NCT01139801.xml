	<brief_title>Cervical Ripening for Induction of Labor: Misoprostol Versus Oxytocin in Conjunction With Foley Balloon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design of this study is a randomized, controlled study with two arms. Both groups will undergo placement of a Foley catheter, through the external and internal os of the cervix, according to standard practice. In group A, receiving intravenous infusion of oxytocin, will serve as the control group as it is standard protocol at Aultman Hospital. Group B, intravaginal placement of misoprostol, will serve as the experimental group. The expected duration of participation begins at induction of labor and concludes at time of delivery.</detailed_description>
