	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of DNA from patients receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin may help doctors learn more about the effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in DNA samples from younger patients with newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To analyze candidate-coding polymorphisms in CD33 of DNA samples from children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin on COG-AAML03P1. - To determine the association between these polymorphisms and clinical response of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for candidate polymorphisms in CD33 by PCR-based sequencing.</detailed_description>
