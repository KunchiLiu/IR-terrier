	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying blood and tumor tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate Mer and Axl expression in samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). - To determine if abnormal expression of Mer and Axl is associated with poor clinical characteristics (e.g., induction failure or relapse) of AML in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Archived samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia are analyzed for Mer and Axl expression by flow cytometry and western blot assays.</detailed_description>
