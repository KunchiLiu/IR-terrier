	<brief_summary>The purpose is to test the effectiveness of an organized care program for chronic or recurrent depression. Using a two-arm design, the investigators will randomly assign 300 participants with chronic or recurrent depression to one of two conditions: continued usual care (UC); or an 18-month organized treatment program focused on outreach and engagement, including a weekly group self-management training program, monthly visits with a psychotherapist (in-person or by telephone), and optional one-on-one visits with a peer support specialist. All intervention components are intended as adjuncts to any existing depression treatment (usually antidepressant medication) provided by participants' regular providers.</brief_summary>
