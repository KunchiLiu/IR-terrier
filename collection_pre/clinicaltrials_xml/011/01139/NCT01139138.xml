	<brief_title>Safety Study of the Combination of Panitumumab, Irinotecan and Everolimus in the Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label uncontrolled phase IB/II study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the efficacy of everolimus, irinotecan and panitumumab when given in combination for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and KRAS wild-type (WT). Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that have failed fluorouracil based first line therapy will be included. It is anticipated that approximately 50 patients will be enrolled over a period of 24 months</detailed_description>
