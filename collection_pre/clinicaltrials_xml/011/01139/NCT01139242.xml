	<brief_summary>This is an intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening and physical activity in members of African-American churches who are 50 years old and older. The control arm receives the Body &amp; Soul program, a program to increase fruit and vegetable intake. The investigators hypothesize that those receiving the intervention, which includes four tailored newsletters and peer counseling, will be more likely to be screened if not up-to-date, and more likely to increase physical activity if screening was up-to-date at baseline, than controls.</brief_summary>
