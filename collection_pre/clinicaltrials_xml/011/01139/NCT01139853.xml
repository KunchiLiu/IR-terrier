	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this research study is to determine the effect of a pre-operatively placed nasogastric tube compared to no nasogastric tube, on post-operative emesis rates and postoperative length of stay in infants with a primary diagnosis of pyloric stenosis treated with pyloromyotomy. This study will also examine the feasibility data of the pilot data to develop estimates of treatment effect of a pre-operative nasogastric tube on post-operative rate of emesis and length of stay to be used to determine the sample size of the definitive trial.</brief_summary>
