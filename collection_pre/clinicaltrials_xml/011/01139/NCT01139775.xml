	<brief_summary>LY2603618 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). It is being developed as a chemotherapeutic-enhancing agent in the treatment of cancer. Ongoing Phase 1 studies have shown the feasibility of combining LY2603618 with either gemcitabine or pemetrexed. The objective of this study is to find the dose of LY2603618 that can be safely combined with standard doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin and to test if this triplet offers a significant improvement in progression-free survival in participants with Stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line of palliative treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase 1 portion: Participants with a cytologic or histologic diagnosis of nonsquamous Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) which is classified as Stage IV according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification and for whom the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin is deemed to be appropriate Participants with histologic or cytologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma which is unresectable Participants with histologic or cytologic diagnoses of advanced or metastatic solid tumors who are not candidates for any standard therapy and for whom the combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin is deemed to be appropriate Phase 2 portion: Have a histological diagnosis of NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology which is classified as Stage IV according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification Be eligible for a first line of palliative treatment with a platinum doublet Have archived tumor tissue (not cytology) Phase 1 participants can have measurable or nonmeasurable disease. Phase 2 participants must have at least 1 measurable lesion according to Investigational New Drug (IND) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) definitions. Tumor lesions located in a previously irradiated area can be considered measurable if they are new or if have shown unequivocal progression. Have a performance status of less than or equal to one on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Have adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal organ function Prior radiation therapy for treatment of cancer is allowed to less than 25% of the bone marrow, and participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of their treatment prior to study enrollment. Prior radiation to the whole pelvis is not allowed. Prior radiotherapy must be completed at least 4 weeks before study entry For women: Must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or compliant with a highly reliable contraceptive method (failure rate less than 1%) during and for 6 months after the treatment period; must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days before study enrollment and must not be breastfeeding.For men: Must be surgically sterile or compliant with a contraceptive regimen during and for 6 months after the treatment period Have serious preexisting medical conditions or serious concomitant systemic disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or his/her ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the investigator (for example, unstable angina pectoris or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus). Special attention should be paid to kidney and heart conditions that may be worsened with cisplatin treatment or hydration Have central nervous system (CNS) metastases (unless the participant has completed successful local therapy for CNS metastases and has been off corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks before starting study therapy). A screening computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before enrollment in the absence of a clinical suspicion of brain metastases is not required Have current active infection that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy Have known allergy to pemetrexed, cisplatin, LY2603618, or any ingredient of pemetrexed, cisplatin, or LY2603618 Have clinically significant (by physical exam) thirdspace fluid collections; for example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry Patients taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) who cannot interrupt the treatment appropriately according to the guidelines Have received a recent yellowfever vaccination (within 28 days of enrollment) or are receiving concurrent yellowfever vaccination Phase 1 portion: Have received more than 2 previous lines of chemotherapy for the advanced/metastatic disease Have received more than 6 cycles of therapy containing an alkylating agent</criteria>
