	<brief_summary>Framingham risk score is well known screening tool that detect cardiovascular (CV) risk. But it is not suitable for CV risk in mild risk group. So 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a new imaging technique for detecting vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques and hsCRP is also arising detection tool of CV risk. The investigators are examining this association in normal and impaired glucose tolerance patients groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Framingham Risk Score, hsCRP and Vascular Inflammation: Analysis With 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We examined vascular inflammation using FDG-PET scan in 178 subjects (Normal and impaired glucose tolerance groups). Vascular 18F-FDG uptake was measured as both the mean and maximum blood-normalized standardized uptake value (SUV), known as the target-to-background ratio (TBR). And We analyzed that the association with Framingham risk score, hs CRP and vascular inflammation by FDG-PET scan.</detailed_description>
