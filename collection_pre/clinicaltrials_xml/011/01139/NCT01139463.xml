	<brief_summary>Blood lactate levels in patients receiving typical or atypical antipsychotics have not been described in the literature. The goal of this study is to assess the dynamics of lactate levels in the blood from typical or atypical antipsychotics not confounded by prior antipsychotic treatments, the investigators conducted a prospective study of lactate levels in patients receiving antipsychotic medication. The investigators hypothesized that 6 months of treatment with haloperidol or olanzapine would result in a change in blood lactate levels and extrapyramidal side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Blood Lactate Levels in Patients Treated With Antipsychotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to compare the blood lactate levels in patients receiving typical or atypical antipsychotics. Subjects included sixty patients with psychotic disorder were assigned to treatment for 6 months with haloperidol (typical antipsychotic), N=30 or olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic), N=30. Blood lactate levels, other metabolic parameters, and scores on the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) were assessed.</detailed_description>
