	<brief_summary>Overweight and obesity play a role in both cancer incidence and survival rates. Many people have found attending weight loss support groups to be time-intensive. Past research has shown electronic media, particularly the Web, to be effective in producing weight loss. The Web, however, lacks portability, which prevents people from accessing the information when it is convenient for them. Providing weight loss information via podcasting (audio files that may be listened to on portable audio players) may allow people to receive weight loss tips anywhere. A previous research study showed that podcasts emphasizing healthy eating and exercise can help people lose weight. This study was short-term and did not include additional social support. The purpose of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of a weight loss intervention delivered through podcasts as compared to the same podcast with added mobile media such as self-monitoring software (such as a pedometer) and support delivered via a social networking site. For this research study, the investigators will conduct a 6-month study in 104 overweight adults to determine if a podcast plus mobile media support leads to greater weight loss than a podcast alone.</brief_summary>
