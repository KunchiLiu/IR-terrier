	<brief_summary>The investigators are interested in the role of the autonomic nervous system in the regulation of endothelial function among obese hypertensive subjects. In particular, the investigators will study how endothelial function (response to intra-arterial acetylcholine) changes during autonomic withdrawal.</brief_summary>
