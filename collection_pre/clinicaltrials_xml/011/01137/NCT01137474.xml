	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether dapagliflozin, after 12 weeks, can improve (decrease) blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled hypertension who are on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key inclusion criteria Participants willing and able to give signed and written informed consent Males and females, aged 18 to 89 years, who have type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c between 7% and 10.5%) and uncontrolled hypertension (seated systolic blood pressure of 140 to 165 mm Hg and seated diastolic blood pressure 85 to 105 mm Hg) Mean 24hour BP&gt;=130/80 mmHg determined by ABPM Stable dose of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) for at least 6 weeks (12 weeks for thiazolidinedione) or a stable daily dose of insulin as monotherapy or in combination with another OAD, for 8 weeks, and a stable dose of an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensinreceptor blocker for at least 4 weeks Cpeptide level ≥0.8 ng/mL Body mass index ≤ 45.0 kg/m^2 Key exclusion criteria Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase level &gt;3*upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum total bilirubin level &gt;1.5*ULN Serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL unless subject was on metformin, where exclusionary limits were serum creatinine ≥1.50 mg/dL for men and ≥1.40 mg/dL for women Estimated creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min Hemoglobin ≤10.0 g/dL for men and ≤9.0 g/dL for women Creatine kinase &gt;3*ULN Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen Positive for antihepatitis C virus antibody Abnormal free T4 value History of diabetes insipidus Symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes that would preclude participation in this trial, including but not limited to, marked polyuria and polydipsia with greater than 10% weight loss during the 3 months prior to enrollment. History of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma History of malignant and accelerated hypertension Known or suspected secondary hypertension Any of the following within 6 months of enrollment visit: Myocardial infarction Cardiac surgery or revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery /percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) Unstable angina Unstable congestive heart disease or New York Heart Association Class III or IV Transient ischemic attack or significant cerebrovascular disease Unstable or previously undiagnosed arrhythmia</criteria>
