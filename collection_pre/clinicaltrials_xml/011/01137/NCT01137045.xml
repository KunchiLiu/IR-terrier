	<brief_summary>A comparative,randomized (1:1)study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a new chromatographically purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA) and chromatographically purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA)which is filled by Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (TRCS SPEEDA)vs. reference vaccine (purified vero cell vaccine; VERORAB)when using with post-exposure rabies intradermal vaccination with or without equine rabies immunoglobulin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study of A New Chromatographically Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine With ID Regimen and ERIG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rabies is an important world health problem especially in developing countries.Although the case-fatality ratio of human rabies is 100%,the disease is preventable by the modern cell-culture vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin.Post-exposure rabies vaccination with the modified Thai Red Cross intradermal(modified TRC-ID)regimen has been approved by WHO and proven to be immunogenic and effective. It represents a significant saving in vaccine cost and is now established in several developing countries. SPEEDA,chromatography purified vero cell derived rabies vaccine,approved by Thai FDA on 8 April 2009 and drug registration code of SPEEDA is 1C 90022/51. This study has a goal to determine the immunogenicity and safety of SPEEDA and TRCS-SPEEDA (SPEEDA which is filled by Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute)vs. reference vaccine (purified vero cell vaccine; VERORAB)when using with post-exposure rabies intradermal vaccination with or without equine rabies immunoglobulin.</detailed_description>
