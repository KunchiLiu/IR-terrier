	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the an N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP, also known as acetaminophen) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) combination versus an APAP-placebo combination as an anti-pyretic agent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acetaminophen in Combination With N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) Versus Placebo in Treating Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), or more commonly known as acetaminophen in the United States, accounts for more overdose and overdose deaths in the United States and United Kingdom than any other pharmaceutical agent. If N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is given within 8 to 10 hours of APAP ingestion, it has been shown to prevent serious liver failure and death in the setting of overdoses. Therefore, it may be beneficial to administer APAP in combination with NAC routinely to reduce rates of liver failure and death. Because NAC's main role is to reduce the accumulation of APAP's toxic metabolites, the concomitant administration of NAC should have no impact on the efficacy of APAP as an antipyretic and analgesic. Thus, we propose a single-center, non-inferiority randomized control study comparing the efficacy of the APAP-NAC combination as compared to APAP-placebo as an anti-pyretic agent.</detailed_description>
