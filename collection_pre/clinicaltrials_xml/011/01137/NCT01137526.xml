Subject has a known hypersensitivity or intolerance to donepezil that led to discontinuation or a known reported history of donepezil treatment failure. 2. Subject is currently taking or has taken a medication for the treatment of AD or dementia within 60 days of Screening Visit 1, or is participating in cognitive therapy for the treatment of AD or dementia. 3. Subject has a history of a drug or alcohol disorder (abuse/dependence), based on either DSMIVTR or ICD10 criteria, excluding nicotine, within 2 years prior to Screening Visit 1. 4.
