	<brief_summary>Despite the acknowledgment that physical activity is important for health, there are still few population-based or school-based studies that uses the current physical activity guidelines for adolescents. Physical inactivity was defined a less than 300 min/w of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity practice. Previous research has shown very high prevalence rates of physically inactive adolescents and a strong association with demographic, socioeconomic and biological factors. Based on this information, the investigators are elaborating a systematic review of literature to obtain and provide more accurate information in this context.</brief_summary>
