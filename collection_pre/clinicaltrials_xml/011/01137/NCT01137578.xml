	<criteria>Functioning central venous catheter in the upper or lower venous system Cohort A: Asymptomatic patients having placement of a new central venous catheter in the last 40Â±20 days Cohort B: Subjects who have experienced symptoms for a CVCrelated DVT with a CVC in place or subjects who have been incidentally identified by radiographic imaging (imaging modalities to diagnose an incidental CVCrelated DVT may include, but is not exclusive of Echocardiogram, CT scan, MRI, or Ultrasound) performed for other clinical reasons, as having a CVCrelated DVT in the veins where the current catheter is placed Males and females from fullterm newborns to &lt; 18 years For Cohort A subjects only, present therapeutic dosing of a systematic anticoagulant, systemic thromboprophylaxis or antiplatelet therapy. Local thromboprophylaxis [flushes, low dose infusions of heparin of up to 5 u/kg/hr or locks with heparin, urokinase, tplasminogen activator] according to standardofcare at the respective center will be allowed Patients unable to undergo contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging Renal function &lt; 50% of normal for age and size</criteria>
