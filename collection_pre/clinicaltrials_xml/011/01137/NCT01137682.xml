	<criteria>1. Patients with written informed consent prior to any study related activity 2. Patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly as defined by a mean GH concentration of a 5point profile over a 2hour period &gt; 2.5 Âµg/L and sex and ageadjusted IGF1 &gt; 1.3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 3. Patients treated with maximum indicated doses of octreotide LAR or lanreotide ATG for at least 6 months prior to visit 1 (screening). The maximum indicated dose for octreotide LAR is 30mg and for lanreotide ATG is 120 mg 4. Patients with diagnosis of pituitary micro or macro adenoma. Patients can have been previously submitted to surgery 1. Patients who have received pasireotide (SOM 230) prior to enrolment 2. Concomitant treatment with Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR)antagonist or dopamine agonists unless concomitant treatment was discontinued 8 weeks prior to visit 1 (screening)(8 weeks wash out period). Such patients must have been treated with octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg monotherapy continuously for a minimum of 6 months prior to starting combination therapy and they should have been inadequately controlled on monotherapy. 3. Patients with compression of the optic chiasm causing acute clinically significant visual field defects 4. Patients who require a surgical intervention for relief of any sign or symptom associated with tumor compression 5. Patients who have received pituitary irradiation within 10 years prior to visit 1 (screening). 6. Patients who have undergone major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 4 weeks prior to visit 1 (screening). 7. Patients who are hypothyroid and not adequately treated with a stable dose of thyroid hormone replacement therapy Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
