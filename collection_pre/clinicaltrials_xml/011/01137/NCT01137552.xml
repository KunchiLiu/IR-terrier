	<brief_summary>This is a first in human, open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of AMG 780 in up to 62 subjects with advanced solid tumors. The dose escalation part of the study is aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AMG 780. The dose expansion will consist of up to 20 subjects and the dose level of AMG 780 will be dependent upon emerging safety and PK data from the dose escalation part of the study.</brief_summary>
