	<brief_summary>Annuloplasty device for repair of mitral valve regurgitation with option to adjust device post implant off pump, to optimize correction of mitral regurgitation. Unlike conventional annuloplasty ring, the Cardinal system offers the clinician the opportunity to make adjustments after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Adjustability is expected to reduce the number of patients leaving the operating room with residual regurgitation after mitral valve repair.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient is a candidate for mitral valve repair. Patient able and willing to return to the implant center for followup visits. Able and willing to give informed consent and follow protocol procedures. Severe organic lesions with retraction of chordate tendineae, severly fibrotic and immobile leaflets, severely deformed subvalvular apparatus. Evolving endocarditis or active endocarditis in the last 3 months. Heavily calcified annulus or leaflets. Congenital malformation with limited valvular tissue Patient requires mitral valve replacement. Previously implanted prosthetic mitral valve or annuloplasty ring/band. Patient requires aortic or pulmonic valve replacement or repair. Patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive) or lactating. Patient has a major cardiac or noncardiac disease, which in the investigator's experience produces an unacceptable surgical risk. Life expectancy of less than twelve months. Patient is participating in concomitant research studies of investigational products</criteria>
