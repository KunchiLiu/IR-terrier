	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of the study is that those obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not respond to the FDA approved dose of 120 mcg of pramlintide (Symlin®) 3 times daily with expected glucose control require higher than FDA approved dosage. The primary objective of the study is to determine whether higher doses of pramlintide (Symlin®) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus control glucose better than the FDA approved dose of 120 mcg three times daily. The secondary objectives include proving whether higher dose pramlintide (Symlin®) is more efficacious in causing weight loss and reduction in waist circumference than standard dose pramlintide (Symlin®),to determine whether blood levels of certain hormones correlate with need for higher dose therapy,and to determine whether or not the rate of common adverse effects exceeds the maximum FDA approved pramlintide (Symlin®) dose of 120 mcg three times daily.</brief_summary>
