	<brief_summary>Our primary objective is to compare two treatment options for prevention of seizures following a subarachnoid hemorrhage and determine if a short-course regimen of levetiracetam is as efficacious in the prevention of in-hospital seizures when compared to an extended course.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Short Duration Levetiracetam to Extended Course for Seizure Prophylaxis After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)</brief_title>
