	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy versus trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive and p95HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Eligible subjects will have newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) either as a primary diagnosis or as a recurrence following treatment of curative intent; not have received systemic or local treatment for MBC and have breast cancer that is positive for HER2 and p95HER2. The primary objective is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) of lapatinib plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in subjects with MBC exhibiting concurrent HER2 overexpression (and/or gene amplification) and expression of carboxy-terminal fragments of HER2 (p95HER2). The secondary objectives are to evaluate overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit response rate and the safety as well as tolerability of lapatinib plus chemotherapy and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

Exception: Subjects who have been diseasefree for 5 years or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal or squamous) are eligible Concurrent anticancer treatment or concurrent treatment with an investigational drug Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of study treatment Prior treatment with antiHER2 therapy, except trastuzumab or lapatinib (time from last dose of trastuzumab or lapatinib to randomization must be ≥3 months) Serious cardiac illness or medical condition including but not confined to: Uncontrolled arrhythmias Uncontrolled or symptomatic angina History of congestive heart failure (CHF) Documented myocardial infarction &lt;6 months from study entry Current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment) Concurrent disease or condition, or any preexisting medical disorder that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures Pregnant or lactating female Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels (consult with GSK Medical Monitor if uncertain about eligibility) Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to any of the study drugs or their excipients that, in the opinion of the investigator contraindicates participation</criteria>
