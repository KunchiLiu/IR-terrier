	<brief_summary>The immune response to Helicobacter pylori (Hp) importantly determines the pathogenesis of infection as well as the success of antibiotic eradication of the bacteria. The investigators want to demonstrate the importance of cathepsin X (CTSX), a cysteine protease, for the Hp eradication success. The diversity of the innate immune response to H. pylori antigens leading to either successful eradication of the infection or maintenance of chronic inflammation is connected to CTSX. The aim of this study is to determine whether H. pylori suppresses the CTSX expression and cytokine secretion in macrophage cell line THP-1 in the individuals that are not capable of eradicating the infection, opposite to H pylori in patients with successful H pylori eradication . The investigators also investigate the possibility whether strain-dependent differences in H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) influence the CTSX expression and cytokine secretion.</brief_summary>
