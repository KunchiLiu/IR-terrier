	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect that weight loss has on the severity of psoriasis in obese subjects. Fifty obese (BMI equal to or greater than 30) patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be enrolled in a weight loss intervention program. The severity of their psoriasis will be reevaluated at month 3 and month 6 of the program to determine what effect weight loss has had on their psoriasis. Serum TNF-alpha will be measured at month 0 and month 6. The hypothesis that will be tested is that weight loss will lead to a significant improvement in the severity of psoriasis and a reduction in TNF-alpha levels.</brief_summary>
