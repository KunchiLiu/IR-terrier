	<brief_summary>Patients with a cardiac stab wound could be complicated by a posttraumatic acute myocardial infarction (PAMI). Traditionally, the investigators can explain it by the occlusion of a coronary artery; but the PAMI isnÂ´t constantly related with coronary artery injuries or their damage in the cardiac injury repair. The investigators objectives are to know the PAMI incidence, make an approximation to PAMI pathophysiology, and propose management strategies.</brief_summary>
