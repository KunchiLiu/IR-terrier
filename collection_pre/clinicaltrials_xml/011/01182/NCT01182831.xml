	<brief_summary>Coeliac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is a management option for pain control in carcinoma pancreas.CPN is conventionally performed by percutaneous technique with fluoroscopic guidance. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is increasingly used for CPN as it offers a better visualization of the plexus. There are limited data comparing the two modalities.The patients are on follow-up for 6 months post neurolysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Two Techniques of Celiac Plexus Neurolysis for Treatment of Pain in Carcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoma pancreas patients with abdominal pain requiring daily analgesics for more than 4 weeks were included.we are randomising about 100 patients into two groups to undergo either of the two procedures, i.e. celiac plexus neurolysis by percutaneous technique or by endoscopic ultrasound guided technique.The pain scores have been recorded by visual analogue scale for an average follow-up of 6 months.</detailed_description>
