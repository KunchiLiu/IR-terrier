	<brief_summary>More than one million people in Europe suffer from a stroke every day. Normally older people have a stroke, but also a significant number of younger people between 18 and 55 years. Usually, these can only be explained for a minority by the classical risk factors such as diabetes, overweight and high blood pressure. New studies indicate that in about 1 - 2 % of the younger stroke patients the etiology can be an undiagnosed genetic disease, e.g. Fabry disease. Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder known to cause vasculopathy. The purpose of this study is to determine in a large number of young stroke patients, how many strokes were caused by Fabry disease and what risk factors might be able to predict this disease.</brief_summary>
