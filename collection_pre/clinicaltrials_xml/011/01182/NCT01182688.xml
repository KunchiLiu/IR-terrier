	<brief_summary>This study is designed to demonstrate the value of Procalcitonin (PCT) in assisting the rapid diagnosis of post- operative infection that includes elevation of Procalcitonin above and beyond the changes seen with the acute and inflammatory response induced by cardio-pulmonary bypass. Procalcitonin is an innovative and highly specific biomarker for clinically relevant severe bacterial infections and sepsis. PCT supports early diagnosis and clinical decision making.This is a prospective single center study designed to assess the normal change in PCT levels following major surgery and the utilization of PCT regarding the diagnosis of infection and the response to treatment, following major cardiac surgery</brief_summary>
