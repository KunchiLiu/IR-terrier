	<brief_summary>Graves' disease is characterized by thyrotoxicosis, goiter, ophthalmopathy and dermopathy. Pathogenesis involves autoimmune process. The investigators think temperatures of the area involved in the inflammation may change. Thus the investigators plan to take temperature pictures of Graves' patients using digital infrared thermal imaging system and observe the change.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Application of Digital Infrared Thermal Imaging (DITI) in Graves' Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will recruited patients of Graves' disease from out patient clinics. We will perform thyroid echo and soft tissue echo first. Then we let patients sit before the thermal camera and take thermal images of eyes necks and tibia. After data collection, we analyse the relation between temperature and laboratory data such as thyroid function and autoimmune profiles.</detailed_description>
