	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase II, single-stage study evaluating the use of panitumumab, paclitaxel, carboplatin and 5FU as an induction regimen in subjects with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The expectation is that this combination will both increase potential overall survival by incorporating novel biologic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting and decrease potential surgical mortality by eliminating pre-operative radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
