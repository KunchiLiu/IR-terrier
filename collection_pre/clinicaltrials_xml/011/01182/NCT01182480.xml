	<brief_summary>This proof of concept study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of a communications-technology-based chronic care and patient relationship management program to improve diabetes self management among adult diabetic patients in an urban safety net population by providing between-visit reminders and chronic disease support through cell phone text messaging. The investigators hypothesize that diabetic patients enrolled in the program will be less likely to miss scheduled appointments and will have greater perceived self-efficacy and improved patient satisfaction concerning chronic disease management. No-show rates among patients enrolled in the program are expected to be lower than among patients receiving standard care.</brief_summary>
