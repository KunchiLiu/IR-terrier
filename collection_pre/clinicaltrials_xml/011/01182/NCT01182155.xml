	<brief_summary>Patients treated with radiation therapy for lung tumors can experience inflammation after treatment. This study hopes to evaluate the use of breath analysis to evaluate changes in the composition of exhaled breath in patients undergoing radiotherapy. If changes can be detected, this may ultimately serve as biomarkers for identifying patients at highest risk for radiation-induced lung injury (radiation pneumonitis).</brief_summary>
