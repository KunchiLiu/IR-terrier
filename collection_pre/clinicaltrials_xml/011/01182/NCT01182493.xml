	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of insulin pump therapy versus multiple daily injections in insulin-taking type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who are sub optimally controlled with multiple daily injections (MDI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OpT2mise Glucose Control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) With Insulin Pump Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The type of study is interventional post-market release. All the devices under investigation have CE mark, and are used within intended use. This study has been designed to be prospective randomized controlled with a single-arm cross-over in the continuation phase. Four hundred type 2 Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) treated patients will undergo a screening (run-in) phase of 8 weeks. The aim of the screening phase is to eliminate the study effect that might result in a decrease of HbA1c and to make sure that patients, who are failing current MDI therapy, are selected. After this screening phase, eligible patients will be randomised to receive either Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) treatment or continue MDI treatment. The first 6-months phase (2-arms parallel) will be followed by another 6-months continuation phase (single cross-over of the MDI arm alone switching to CSII).</detailed_description>
