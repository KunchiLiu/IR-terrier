	<brief_summary>The SCAN Memory Program Evaluation study is an evaluation of a randomized controlled trial intervention consisting of a care management program for cognitively-impaired health plan members and for their informal/family caregivers. The program includes collaboration between the health plan, partnering medical groups, and community organizations. Program activities include: 1) telephonic-structured assessments with informal caregivers conducted by SCAN Memory Program care managers; 2) problem identification as a result of these assessments; and 3) pre-established protocols and procedures for problem resolution. ACCESS, the prototype for the SCAN Memory Program, was developed and tested in San Diego County and was very successful in helping affected patients and their caregivers.</brief_summary>
