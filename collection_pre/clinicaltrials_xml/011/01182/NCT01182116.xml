	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Patients That Undergo J Pouch or Side to End Coloanal Anastomosis for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The side to end anastomosis has become popular in recent years as it is technically simple to construct. The difference between the Baker type(side to end) of anastomosis and the J pouch, is that no formal pouch is constructed in the side to end. It has one staple line and the anastomosis. The investigators hypothesis is that the patients who receive a side to end anastomosis have bowel outcome and quality of life that is equivalent to those who receive a J pouch.</detailed_description>
