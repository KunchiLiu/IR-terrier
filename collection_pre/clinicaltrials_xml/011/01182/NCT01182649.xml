	<brief_title>Everolimus Stent in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared with the currently available first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), second-generation DES have been designed with the goal of improving safety and efficacy. Everolimus, a sirolimus analogue, is released from a open cell, thin-strut, cobalt-chromium frame. A significant reduction in cardiac events was noted in patients with the everolimus-eluting stent compared with those who had a paclitaxel-eluting stent. Sirolimus eluting stent was the first available drug eluting stent and is the most tested. Therefore the investigators compared the safety and efficacy of the everolimus-eluting and sirolimus eluting stents in unselected patients in real world practice.</detailed_description>
