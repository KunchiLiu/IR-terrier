	<brief_title>Effect of Child Delivery on Intraocular Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about the changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) during child delivery. During labor there are several stages which are accompanied by many physiological changes and pharmacological interventions that may potentially influence the IOP. Among these are delivery position (lying versus sitting or kneeling), vascular changes and pharmacological effects (anesthetic agents, oxytocin and other drugs). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of child delivery on the intraocular pressure (IOP) in healthy women. This will expend our understanding of the physiology of labor and its effect on the eye and it may serve as basis to determine the management of labor.</detailed_description>
