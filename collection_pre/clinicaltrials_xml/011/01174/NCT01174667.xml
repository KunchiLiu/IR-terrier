	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to use diagnostic ultrasound to compare the thickness of soft tissues in the low back in a group of patients with chronic low back pain treated with massage to a control group of non-treated patients. It is hypothesized that on average, soft tissue thickness in the lumbar region will change in the group receiving massage compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
