	<brief_summary>The increased incidence of pain syndromes requires the investigation of pathophysiological coherences as well as searching for new therapies. In the recent years neurostimulating techniques have been a promising approach regarding their analgesic effect. Combined with therapeutic standard procedures they can increase these effects and can have a positive impact on co-morbid diseases. The stimulation of the vagus nerve was proved as an efficient analgesic method in animal experiments and open clinical pilot studies amongst humans. Despite the lack of controlled approaches applying the method against defined pain syndromes, the stimulation of the vagus nerve has shown up as an effective method treating other psychiatric diseases like depression. The processing of stress, which is involved directly and indirectly in the pathogenesis of pain, seems to be susceptible for vagal stimulation. Compared with invasive methods the transcutaneous stimulation offers obvious advantages concerning appliance and occurrence of side effects. There are no studies so far dealing with the neuromodulatory effect on the handling of pain or the clinical therapy of defined (chronic) pain related diseases using the t-VNS system. The study hypothesis implies a change of experiencing pain when applying the t-VNS in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
