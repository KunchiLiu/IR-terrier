	<brief_summary>Patients with specific metastatic cancers who failed prior therapeutic regimes will be treated with NDV for at least a year or until disease progression. The study will measure progression-free disease and posits that it will be extended.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Castle Disease Virus (NDV) in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), Sarcoma and Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Present therapeutic regimes have not much improved the survival of patients with metastatic cancer. Therapeutic cancer vaccines are a form of immunotherapy designed to educate the immune system to recognise tumor cells as foreign rather than self. New Castle Virus (NDV) has a long history as a broad system oncolytic that can destroy tumor cells and stimulate the immune system. Up to 30 patients suffering from recurrent, refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme, soft an bone sarcomas and disseminated neuroblastoma will be enrolled in this trial and receive daily doses of NDV at least 5 days a week for a minimum of a year or until disease progression.</detailed_description>
