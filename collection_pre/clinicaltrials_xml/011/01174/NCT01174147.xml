	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the incidence rate of Candida blood stream infection (candidemia) among people hospitalized in participating medical centers in Brazil, and will assess the antifungal drug susceptibility patterns of Candida clinical isolates. No hypotheses will be tested in the study. Candida blood stream isolates collected from people hospitalized for any reason during the study period will be sent to a core mycology laboratory for antifungal drug susceptibility testing. All people who develop candidemia while hospitalized will be considered participants in the study.</brief_summary>
