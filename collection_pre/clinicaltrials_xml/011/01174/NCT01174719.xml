	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare three different regimens for volume replacement during cardiac surgery, e.g. Albumin 5%, Hydroxyethylstarch 130/0.4 (HES) and Ringer-Lactate (RL). Main Outcome parameters: chest tube drainage and coagulation parameters. The investigators hypothesis is that HES is as safe as Albumin, however less expensive. Whether RL is an even less expensive and as safe alternative has to be shown.</brief_summary>
