	<brief_summary>MTWA-CAD is a feasibility study designed to evaluate Microvolt T-Wave Alternans (MTWA) testing for the purpose of detecting active ischemia in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). MTWA is a subtle, alternating pattern in the T wave portion of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) that is associated with increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ischemia, a common trigger for arrhythmias, is a well-documented cause of repolarization alternans. Human studies have shown that active ischemia can be associated with visible as well as microvolt-level T-wave alternans. While MTWA testing is traditionally used to evaluate arrhythmic risk, this known association with ischemia may allow MTWA testing to be used as a diagnostic tool to detect underlying CAD. The MTWA-CAD study will assess the feasibility of this concept by measuring MTWA during routine nuclear stress testing or stress echocardiography with treadmill exercise. This is a feasibility study designed to verify preliminary observations under controlled environments and to generate hypotheses, endpoints, and sample sizes for future investigations.</detailed_description>
