	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to gain understanding of the basic responses of the lung to inflammation and specifically if a certain medication can reduce the inflammation alone or in combination with another. Inflammation is the way our bodies react to irritation or injury, and involves red, warm, and often painful swelling of the affected tissue. "Acute lung injury" involves inflammation that is not specific to one area of the lung and is caused by any one of several conditions: infection, trauma, breathing toxic substances, etc. When lung injury is severe, not enough oxygen can get into the body; this can lead to the need for mechanical support of breathing (mechanical ventilation), problems with brain, heart or other organ function, and in some cases, death.</brief_summary>
