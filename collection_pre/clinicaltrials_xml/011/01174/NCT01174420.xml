	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Ologen Collagen Matrix Versus Mitomycin-C in Trabeculectomy: A Study in Germany</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ologen® Collagen Matrix (CM) is an artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) specifically configured to support repair in connective and epithelial ocular tissue. The device is constructed so as to minimize random growth of fibroblasts and instead to allow them to grow through the pores in the matrix. ologen® CM is a biodegradable scaffold matrix, inducing a regenerative non-scarring wound healing process without using anti-fibrotic agents. For application in glaucoma filtration surgery, ologen® CM is designed to prevent scar formation (subconjunctival and scleral flap scarring is the major risk factor for failure of trabeculectomy). After implanting the ologen® CM on top of the scleral flap in the subconjunctival space, a functional bleb can be created. The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of the ologen® CM and reduce wound scarring, thereby increasing success of trabeculectomy without side effects of MMC. A means of producing better success rate and reduced complications is the purpose of ologen® Collagen Matrix for the aid of glaucoma surgery.</detailed_description>
