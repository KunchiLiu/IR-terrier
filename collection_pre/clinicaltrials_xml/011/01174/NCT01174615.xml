	<brief_summary>The collection of Blood and/or Bone Marrow from patients with blood disorders, blood cell malignancies and associated conditions will serve as a convenient and comprehensive source of tissue to give us further information about the differences between normal blood cells and blood cells of affected individuals. This will be an invaluable asset for understanding the biology of blood disorders. The collected samples will be used by investigators for studies including immunology, molecular biology and genetics to name a few.</brief_summary>
