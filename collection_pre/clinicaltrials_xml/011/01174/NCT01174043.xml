	<brief_summary>This research study is looking for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), AML that has returned (relapsed), or it has not responded adequately to previous treatments. Treating certain patients with chemotherapy may not be to their benefit or may cause more harm than benefit. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) erlotinib has on patients and their AML.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of AML with no history of previous clonal/malignant hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders. Newly diagnosed patients will be age 70 or older Relapses patients will be age 60 or older any time following first relapse, if patient is not considered candidate/not interested in salvage chemotherapy. Refractory disease patients will be age 1859 who have failed at least 2 lines of conventional chemotherapy (1 induction and 1 salvage) Patient must have discontinued all previous therapies for AML at least 14 days and recovered from the nonhematologic side effects of the therapy. Laboratory tests must be within protocolspecified ranges Patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medication. Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia by spinal fluid cytology, flow cytometry or imaging. History of antecedent preleukemic hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders. Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) Patients who require chronic anticoagulation, are current smokers or who are taking rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort are not eligible. Patients with active corneal erosions or history of abnormal corneal sensitivity test. Patients with serious illness such as: significant ongoing or active infection, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), new onset angina (began within the last 3 months), myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy, cerebrovascular accident within past 3 months, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with the study requirements.</criteria>
