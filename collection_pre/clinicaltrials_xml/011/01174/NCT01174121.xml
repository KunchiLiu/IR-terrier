	<brief_summary>Background: The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells. Objective: The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe. Eligibility: - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancer who have a tumor that can be safely removed. Design: Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed. Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product. Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.} Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Metastatic digestive tract cancers, in particular esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and hepatobiliary carcinomas, are associated with poor survival beyond five years and poor response to existing therapies. - Data from the Surgery Branch and from the literature support that metastatic cancers are potentially immunogenic and that TIL can be grown and expanded from these tumors. - In metastatic melanoma, TIL can mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when administered to an autologous patient with high dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a nonmyeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen. - The recent young-TIL approach, in which TIL are minimally cultured in vitro, not selected for tumor recognition, before rapid expansion and infusion to metastatic melanoma patients, has lead to objective response rates comparable to previous trials relying on TIL screened for tumor recognition, with no added toxicities. - In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody enhances the anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells. - We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TIL adoptive transfer therapy in combination with pembrolizumab for metastatic cancers. Objectives: -With Amendment Q, to determine the ability of autologous TIL infused after minimal in vitro culture in conjunction with high dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen and anti-PD-1 to mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancers. Eligibility: Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have: - Metastatic digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial cancers refractory to standard chemotherapy, originating from a) gastric or gastroesophageal junction, or b) pancreas, liver or biliary tree, c) colon or rectum, d) bladder, e) breast, or f) ovarian/endometrial; - Normal basic laboratory values. Patients may not have: - Concurrent major medical illnesses; - Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden; - Unpalliated biliary or bowel occlusion, cholangitis, or digestive tract bleeding; - Any form of immunodeficiency; - Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study; - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration. Design: - Patients will undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines, and for frozen tissue archive. Lymph nodes, ascites,peritoneal implants, and normal tissue adjacent to metastatic deposit will also be obtained when possible for ongoing and future research as described in 03-C-0277. - All patients in cohort 3 will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and pembrolizumab. On day 0 patients will receive the infusion of autologous TIL and then begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 12 doses). - Pembrolizumab will be administered prior to TIL admiistration and continue for 3 additional cycles. - Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated at the first follow-up evaluation following the last dose of pembrolizumab. - Twenty-one patients will be initially enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and tumor responses. If two or more of the first 21 patients per groups shows a clinical response (PR or CR), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response. - Up to 290 patients may be enrolled over 3-8 years</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Measurable metastatic (stage IV) gastric, gastroesophageal, pancreatic, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder, colorectal, urothelial, breast, and ovarian/endometrial carcinomas with at least one lesion that is resectable for TIL generation with minimal morbidity preferentially using minimal invasive laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery for removal of superficial tumor deposit, plus one other lesion that can be measured. 2. All patients must be refractory to approved standard systemic therapy. Specifically : Metastatic colorectal patients must have received oxaliplatin or irinotecan.
