	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib. Studying the effects of meals on the absorption of vismodegib may help doctors prescribe correct doses and label the drug accurately.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Food Effect on Pharmacokinetics of Vismodegib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of prandial states on the pharmacokinetic parameters of GDC-0449 (vismodegib). II. To evaluate the effect of fat content of meals on the pharmacokinetic parameters of GDC-0449. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of prandial states and fat content of meals on the safety profile of GDC-0449. II. To describe any anticancer activities of GDC-0449. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive a single dose of vismodegib orally (PO) on an empty stomach. Beginning 7 days later, patients receive vismodegib PO on an empty stomach daily on days 1-28. ARM II: Patients receive a single dose of vismodegib PO after eating a high fat meal. Beginning 7 days later, patients receive vismodegib PO on an empty stomach daily on days 1-28. ARM III: Patients receive a single dose of vismodegib PO after eating a low fat meal. Beginning 7 days later, patients receive vismodegib PO after eating a meal daily on days 1-28. In all arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 48 hours prior to the first dose of GDC0449 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the 24hour period prior to the administration of GDC0449; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing GDC0449, the investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the teratogenic potential of GDC0449 Female subjects of childbearing potential are defined as follows: Patients with regular menses Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding Women who have had tubal ligation Female subjects may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the following reasons: The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy The patient is medically confirmed to menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24 consecutive months Prepubertal females; the parent or guardian of young female patients who have not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun; if a young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she is to be considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time forward Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to GDC0449 or other agents used in study Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow capsules Patients with clinically important history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with GDC0449 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Patients with medical conditions that require the following medications will be excluded Strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, verapamil, and diltiazem) Strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (fluconazole and amiodarone) Inducers of CYP3A4 (carbamazepine, dexamethasone, modafinil, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, troglitazone) Inducers of CYP2C9 (rifampin, and secobarbital) Patients who have a medical condition or dietary restrictions that prevent him or her from fasting for at least 10 hours (overnight) or eating a high calorie meal Any ambiguity in the inclusion/exclusion criteria should be clarified and resolved by communication with the study investigators</criteria>
