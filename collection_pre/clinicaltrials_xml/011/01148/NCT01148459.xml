Subjects who are known to be HIVinfected (documented positive DNA PCR), whether taking HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) or not. Subjects who are born following a normal gestation period. The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If ANY exclusion criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study: Acute disease at the time of enrolment. However, the presence of an illness listed as Grade I or Grade II (WHO pediatric AIDS clinical staging) will not of itself constitute an exclusion criterion. Enrolment should be deferred if axillary temperature is &gt;=37.5°C. Grade III or Grade IV abnormality on screening laboratory blood sample. Grade III or IV AIDS at the time of enrolment (WHO pediatric AIDS clinical staging). Major congenital defects. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol prior to or within 7 days of study vaccine. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine 30 days preceding Dose°1 of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Previous participation in any other malaria vaccine trial. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial including administration of experimental treatment. Same sex twins. History of allergic reactions (significant IgEmediated events) or anaphylaxis to previous immunizations. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine. Child in care.</criteria>
