	<brief_summary>To reduce door-to-needle times in acute stroke treatment. Using an organizational behaviour intervention (a large stopwatch), we will post a visual cue to remind all parties that "time is brain". We hypothesize that this simple visual cue will improve door-to-CT scan times and door-to-needle treatment times, and thus improve treatment response, and reduce adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CLOQS Trial - Countdown Lights to Optimize Quality in Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will construct a large, "in-your-face" red LED stopwatch-clock that is the intervention. The clock will be attached to the stretcher of patients presenting for hyperacute stroke treatment (consideration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment at the moment of their Emergency department arrival. This will act as a constant visual reminder to all team members (physicians, RN's, CT technologists) of the urgency of the situation. The study will be a block randomization, by week of presentation. All patients presenting during "on" weeks will have a stopwatch timer with them during the hyperacute stroke workup. During "off" weeks, the clocks will not be used.</detailed_description>
