	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the time point of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin stabilization after a thirteen-treatment period following a ferumoxytol load, as well as to determine the point at which serum ferritin and TSAT concentrations can be checked in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) hemodialysis patients.</brief_summary>
