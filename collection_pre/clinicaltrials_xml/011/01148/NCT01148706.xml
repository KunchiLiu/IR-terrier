	<brief_title>Effectiveness of ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System in Patients Undergoing CT-Guided Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System is an optical navigation system designed to assist physicians performing percutaneous interventions under CT guidance. The system allows the user to select an obstacle free path to a target lesion based on pre-procedure CT images, and then provides real-time information for guiding the interventional tool towards the target along the selected path. The ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System employs a miniature video camera mounted on the needle and a reference pad attached to the skin to register the needle into the CT image space, and thus, track the needle advance towards the target. CT scans are used as needed to verify the location of the needle. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System in assisting in CT-guided percutaneous procedures.</detailed_description>
