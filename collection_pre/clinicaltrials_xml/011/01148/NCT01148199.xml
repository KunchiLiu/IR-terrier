	<brief_summary>Biliary complications are one of the most common problems after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT),occurring in up to 24% of patients. Anastomotic strictures have been endoscopically managed with plastic stents placement. Recently, partially and fully covered metal stents have been alternatively used to treat refractory benign biliary stenosis. The investigators purpose is to compare efficacy and safety of metallic stents versus multiple plastic stents in the endoscopic management of post transplant biliary complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-expandable Metallic Stent Versus Multiple Plastic Stents in Post Orthotopic Liver Transplantation Biliary Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with biliary stricture after OLT will be randomly assigned following simple randomization to temporary placement of fully covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) or multiple plastic stents placement were randomized according to a computer generated randomization sequence and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups. Final success will be defined as clinical resolution of the stricture without the need to repeat endoscopic, percutaneous or surgical treatment.</detailed_description>
