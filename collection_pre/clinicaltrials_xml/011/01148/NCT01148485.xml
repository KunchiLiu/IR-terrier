	<brief_summary>There are only very few data about the prevalence of CA-MRSA in France and no in athletes. In USA, the clone USA300 is widely disseminated and in Europe the clone ST80 predominates. The aim of the study was to study the carriage of S. aureus in athletes in a French county (Limousin) and to evaluate the proportion of CA-MRSA. The athletes will be met during their training, each one will fill-in a clinical information questionnaire. Nasal, throat, inguinal and skin lesions swab samples will be performed. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the Staphyloccocus aureus strains isolated will be performed as well as the detection of the PVL gene. Strains will also be typed by different molecular methods (PGFE (Pulsed Gel Field Electrophoresis), SCCmec type (Staphylococcal Chromosome Cassette mec), and MLST (MultiLocus Sequence Typing)). The CIC (Clinical Investigation Center) of the Limoges University Hospital will be in charge of the inclusions of the athletes. The sample analysis will be centralized and performed at the Laboratory of Bacteriology of the Limoges University Hospital. A Clinical Research Officer of the Limoges University Hospital will be in charge of the survey of the study and will organize monthly meetings with all the participants of the study.</brief_summary>
