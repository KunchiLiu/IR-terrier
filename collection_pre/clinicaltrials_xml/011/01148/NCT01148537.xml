	<criteria>Males and females 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive. Body weight ranging from 50 to 100 kilograms (kg) and a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 30 kg/m2. Healthy as determined by unremarkable medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram (ECG), and a 24hour screening ECG telemetry. Willing to refrain from strenuous exercise or contact sports during the study. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or using an effective contraceptive method (intrauterine device, hormonal contraceptive, or doublebarrier method). Any clinically significant illness during the 30 days prior to randomization. Any history of allergy to buprenorphine, any excipient of BTDS, opioids, psychotropic or hypnotic drugs, and/or moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of drugs. A clinically significant history of allergic reaction to wound dressings or bandages. Any medical or surgical conditions which might interfere with drug absorption (transdermal or gastrointestinal), distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Abnormalities on physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory values, unless those abnormalities are judged to be clinically insignificant by the Investigator. Any cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 94% as measured by pulse oximetry. Any personal or family history of prolonged QT interval or disorders of cardiac rhythm. Abnormal cardiac condition denoted by any of the following: QT interval ≥ 450 milliseconds (msec). PR interval &gt; 240 msec or ≤ 110 msec. Evidence of second or thirddegree atrioventricular (AV) block. Pathological Qwaves (defined as Qwave &gt; 40 msec or depth &gt; 0.5 mV). Evidence of ventricular preexcitation, complete left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block (RBBB), or incomplete RBBB. A resting heart rate outside the range of 50 to 85 beats per minute (bpm). Other protocolspecific exclusion/inclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
