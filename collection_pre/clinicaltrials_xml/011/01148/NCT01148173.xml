	<brief_summary>Central nervous system (CNS) relapses of aggressive lymphomas are a rare but devastating complication. There is no therapy standard, conventional approaches are palliative. This study investigates an intensive chemotherapy with CNS penetrating drugs followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation as a potentially curative approach.</brief_summary>
