	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing the use of Propofol and Remifentanyl and traditional sedation (Midazolam and Fentanyl) for diagnostic colonoscopies in patients with compensated cirrhosis child A-B. The working hypothesis is that the use of propofol will be translated in a shorter recovery and discharge times with a higher patient satisfaction and a decrease in general complications (Hepatic Encephalopathy) in the context of patients with advanced liver disease.</brief_summary>
