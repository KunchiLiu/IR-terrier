	<brief_summary>Autoimmunity is the main cause of diabetes type 1 and an important factor as cause of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA). Recently, research has found that being deficient of T-reg cells is an important cause of autoimmunity. The study hypothesis are: 1. Patients with newly found diabetes type 1 have less T-reg than healthy. 2. Patients with newly found diabetes type 1 have less T-reg than patients with long duration of the illness. 3. The number of T-reg is negative associated with HLA-risk-haplotype. 4. The number of T-reg is negative associated with LADA. 5. Differences relating to inflammatory cytokines will be seen among patients with newly found diabetes type 1, but not among others.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research has worked out that b-cells are being destroyed by cytokines released from inflammatory cells. One hypothesis in that T-reg is a cause of autoimmunity, and that T-reg concentrations are low in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes type 1. Blood samples will be taken from 10 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and type 1 diabetes older than 10 years and the same amount of samples from healthy, age- and sex-matched blood donors. Markers of autoimmune diabetes will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
