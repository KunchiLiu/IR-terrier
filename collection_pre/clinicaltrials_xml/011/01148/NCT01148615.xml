	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To confirm the dose of aflibercept in western studies by assessing the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenous (IV) aflibercept when administered in combination with docetaxel given intravenously every 3 weeks in Chinese patients with solid tumors. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the safety profile of intravenous (IV) aflibercept when administered in combination with docetaxel - To determine the pharmacokinetics of IV aflibercept and docetaxel when administered in combination - To make a preliminary assessment of antitumor effects of the combination of docetaxel plus aflibercept in patients with evaluable disease - To evaluate the immunogenicity of IV aflibercept - To measure endogenous free Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Intravenous Aflibercept With Docetaxel in Chinese Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of screening, treatment, and follow-up are within 21 days, 3 weeks/cycle, and 90 days after the last aflibercept administration. Patients will be administered aflibercept in combination with docetaxel until when/if a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is met such as progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal to continue.</detailed_description>
