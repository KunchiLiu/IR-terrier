	<brief_summary>Cholangitis is the most prevalent infectious complication of ERCP. Stenting of biliary strictures and stenosis is one of important risk factors for post-ERCP cholangitis. Adding antibiotics to contrast media has proposed in some studies for prevention of cholangitis but remains controversial. In this study we compare effect of adding gentamicin versus placebo in preventing cholangitis in patients who undergone endoscopic stenting for non-calculus strictures and stenosis.</brief_summary>
