	<criteria>Patient with type 1 diabetes or Cpeptide negative diabetes Diabetes duration &gt; 5 years No residual insulin secretion (plasmatic basal and stimulated Cpeptide &lt; 0.3 ng/ml) HbA1c considered acceptable by the selection committee Insulin needs &lt; 0.85 IU/kg/day Islet cell infusion after kidney graft Patient with terminal renal failure and functional kidney graft for at least 6 months (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 35 ml/min) Patient whose glycaemic control obtained with insulin therapy could threaten kidney graft survival and/or significantly alter quality of life. This situation is assessed by a diabetologist Islet cell infusion only: patient with major glycaemic variability despite proper intensive insulin therapy, closely monitored by a diabetologist. Poor glucose control, assessed by a diabetologist, endangers the patient's life and/or significantly alters personal, social, professional and family quality of life. At least one of these criteria must be fulfilled : Hypoglycaemia unawareness, blood glucose level &lt; 3mmol/L or 0.54 mg/L At least 2 severe hypoglycaemia events (defined by the necessity of a third party's assistance) per year or a ketoacidosis requiring patient's hospitalization during the last year. Impairment of quality of life or lifethreat for patient or other persons, or progressive complications despite optimal insulin therapy Social Security membership or benefit from Social Welfare Age&lt; 18 and &gt; 65 Diabetes duration &lt; 5 years Criteria specifically related to the islet intraportal injection procedure: hemostasis problem, haemoglobin level &lt; 11g/dL for women and &lt;12g/dL for men, abnormalities of complete blood count, documented liver pathology (alkaline phosphatases, gamma GT, transaminases levels over twice normal values) ; pancreatitis history, gallbladder stones that could potentially migrate; HLA hyperimmunisation (PRA &gt;20%). Criteria related to diabetes complications : Nonstabilized proliferating diabetic retinopathy Creatininaemia &gt; 16 mg/dL Exclusion criteria nonspecifically related to islet infusion: evolutive vascular disease, evolutive cardiopathy (especially myocardial infarction less than 6 months ago, cerebrovascular stroke less than 6 months ago, evolutive arteritis with trophic disorders) ; systemic infection including hepatitis C and HIV ; leuconeutropenia ; thrombocytopenia, nonstabilized neoplastic pathology ; pregnancy or project of pregnancy within the next 24 months ; poor therapeutic compliance Criteria related to immunosuppressive protocol : renal failure (glomerular filtration &lt; 35 ml/min/1.73 m²) and/or proteinuria &gt; 0.5 g/24h ; nontreated hyperlipidemia (LDLC &gt; 130 mg/dL) ; blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mmHg Clinical insulin resistance : assessed by patient's weight, BMI and exogenous insulin requirements (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m² or insulin dose &gt; 0.85 UI/kg/day)</criteria>
