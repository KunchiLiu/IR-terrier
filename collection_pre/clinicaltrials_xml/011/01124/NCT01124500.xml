	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of the Methylphenidate patch and a placebo patch (a patch that contains no medicine) on patients and their fatigue caused by cancer or by cancer treatment. The Methylphenidate patch contains a medication that is known to increase alertness and wakefulness. Oral methylphenidate has been used in the past to treat cancer related fatigue and is often used to treat unusual sleepiness. But this is the first time that the patch form is offered to try treating cancer fatigue in patients who cannot always swallow tablets.</brief_summary>
