	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood samples from patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with sorafenib tosylate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Blood Samples From Patients With Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Sorafenib Tosylate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the mutation rates of BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate on protocol ECOG-2501. - To determine the association between BRAF, KRAS, or EGFR mutation status and clinical benefits in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. DNA is isolated from archived plasma samples and analyzed for BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR mutations.</detailed_description>
