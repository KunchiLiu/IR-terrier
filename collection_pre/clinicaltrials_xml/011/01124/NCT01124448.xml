	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will try to confirm if application of probiotic strains isolated from breast milk actually have a beneficial effect on women suffering lactational mastitis. This project has been design to offer an integrated vision of the effects of probiotherapy (Lactobacillus salivarius PS2) on the human host. Therefore, the investigators propose a multidisciplinary approach involving the application of microbiological, immunological, genomic, metagenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic techniques. The hypothesis is that probiotherapy will cause different effects on the host, and the objective is the finding of markers that may support the beneficial effect of the strain in such condition.</brief_summary>
