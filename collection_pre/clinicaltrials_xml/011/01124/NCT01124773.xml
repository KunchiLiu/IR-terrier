	<brief_title>Memory Study of Youngest Women Enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Therapy (HT) Arm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y) is proposed to assess the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy (equine estrogen alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone versus placebo) among women who were aged 50-54 at the time of randomization into the WHI hormone trials. Secondary objectives relate to the consistency of any treatment effects across unopposed or opposed therapy and whether there exists evidence of graded relationships between cognitive effects and age of administration, years from menopause, and baseline risk factors for cognitive impairment.</detailed_description>
