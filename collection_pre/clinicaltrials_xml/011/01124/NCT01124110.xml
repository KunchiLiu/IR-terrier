	<brief_summary>This is a clustered randomized control trial to test the Tobacco Tactics intervention among Operating Engineers (heavy equipment workers). The intervention group will be directed to the Tobacco Tactics website, and the control group will be directed to the state supported 1-800 quit-now telephone hotline during routine annual safety training that all Operating Engineers are required to attend. The web-based quitting intervention includes provision of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy and will be followed by nurse email and/or telephone counseling. It is expected that Operating Engineers who are randomized to the Tobacco Tactics website intervention will have at least equal or greater decreases in smoking at 30-day and 6-month follow-up compared to those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW quit line. In addition, the investigators expect to find that Operating Engineers randomized to the Tobacco Tactics website intervention will: a) be able to accomplish tasks; b) be able to accomplish goals with skill and speed; c) be able to operate the system; d) be satisfied with the website; e) access the site repeatedly; and f) spend time on the site during the intervention period.</brief_summary>
