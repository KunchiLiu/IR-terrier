	<brief_summary>The aim of this feasibility study is to determine the therapeutic potential of the L19SIP antibody, labeled with the radionuclide 131I in combination with radiochemotherapy, for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable, locally-advanced NSCLC following the promising results with this agent in previous clinical studies. The L19SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a rare event in the adult (with the exception of the female reproductive tract), but it is a characteristic pathological feature for most types of aggressive cancer.</brief_summary>
