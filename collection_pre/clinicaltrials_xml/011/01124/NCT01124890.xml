	<brief_summary>SIAM III was a multicenter, randomized, prospective, controlled trial in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction receiving fibrinolysis &lt;12 hours after onset of symptoms. All patients received reteplase, aspirin in combination with ticlopidin, and heparin. Patients of the early PCI group were transferred within 6 hours after fibrinolysis for PCI. The conservative group received elective PCI two weeks after fibrinolysis. In total 197 patients were included, 163 were treated by PCI. The primary end point was the composite of ischemic events, death, reinfarction, and target lesion revascularization.</brief_summary>
