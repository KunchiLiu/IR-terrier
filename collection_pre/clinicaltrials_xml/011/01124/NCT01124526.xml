	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rituximab administration with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide results, are better, than the ones obtained with conventional therapy such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone) and also to determine whether the rituximab administration as maintenance treatment during two years, increase the global clinical responses and the disease free time interval.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Response Duration and Toxicity of Rituximab, Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide (RFC) as 1st Line Treatment and Rituximab (R) in Maintenance Treatment in Follicular Non Hodgkin (FNH) Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of monoclonal antibodies, specifically the chimerical humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Rituximab, MabTheraÂ®) represents one of the most innovative aspects in the indolent lymphoma treatment. Preliminary data show from 40% to 50% of response with a median response duration between 6 and 11 months in patients with relapsing FL. This response rate increase when rituximab is administered as initial treatment. Therefore, not only due to the clinical results but also to the tolerance, and based on an innovative mechanism of action and in its minimal toxicity, it seems reasonable to raise the possibility to incorporate the administration of the monoclonal antibody with chemotherapeutic agents. The development of a new treatment scheme that includes Rituximab administration within treatment protocols that combine fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, whose results are better than the ones obtained with conventional treatments such as CHOP, should increase the molecular response rate and contribute therefore to increase the disease-free time interval (time to progression), without adding any toxicity, in addition to achieve a higher proportion of clinical responses (as global as complete responses). In order to increase the time interval to progression, a maintenance treatment will be carried out for 2 years, which has shown an evident benefit in the time to progression in preliminary studies.</detailed_description>
