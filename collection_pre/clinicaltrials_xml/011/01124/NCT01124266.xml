	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Korea. Colonoscopy with polypectomy decreases the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer. However, significant lesions can be missed during colonoscopy. Recent retrospective studies have shown that fellow involvement as a second observer may increase adenoma detection rate in colonoscopy. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized study is to evaluate the impact when endoscopy nurse participate in adenoma detection during screening colonoscopy. The primary outcome measure is the adenoma detection rate (ADR).</brief_summary>
