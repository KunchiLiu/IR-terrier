	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether using information from a special arterial blood pressure monitor to guide how much fluid is given during surgery changes how long a patient stays in the hospital after the surgery. There is scientific evidence from using similar information from different devices that this technique might allow us to do a better job giving fluids during surgery and that this may be associated with a shorter hospital stay after surgery.</brief_summary>
