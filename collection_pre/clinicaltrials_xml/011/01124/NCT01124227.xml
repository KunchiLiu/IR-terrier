	<brief_summary>Rationale: End-stage congestive heart failure is a serious invalidating condition with a poor prognosis and increasing incidence. Non-randomized observations showed peritoneal dialysis (PD) in these patients to improve clinically from NYHA stadium III-IV to as low as NYHA stadium I-II. A randomized trial is needed to test whether PD improves symptoms in this condition and to find an optimal scheme. Objective: To improve symptomatology in severe chronic failure patients. Study design: Open, parallel intervention trial comparing 2 schemes of peritoneal dialysis with icodextrin (Extraneal®) with standard medical therapy.. Study population: Patients with chronic refractory left ventricular congestive heart failure (LVEF &lt; 30%, older than 18 years). Intervention: Peritoneal dialysis with one (night) or two (night and day) dwells with icodextrin (Extraneal®). Main study parameters/endpoints: Reduction in NYHA classification of symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure at 8 months after start of PD therapy. Burden of congestive heart failure: measured by reduction in unfavorable days (noted by patients in diaries and including days of hospitalization for CHF-deterioration and death).</brief_summary>
