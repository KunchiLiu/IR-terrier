	<brief_summary>This study aims to study the impact image guided radiotherapy with Cone beam CT will have on the outcomes(toxicities and response) of head and neck cancer when compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy without CBCT based setup error verification.Also,the various dosimetric variations in Adaptive RT will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of 3DCRT Versus IGRT and Analysis of Early Response in Head and Neck Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims and Objectives 1. To assess the patient's radiation dose planning for GTV, CTV and PTV for primary and nodal regions and derive comparison between IGRT and 3D-CRT. 2. To assess the dosimetric variation in different phases of adaptive RT due to changes in tumor shape and volume during the course of entire treatment in IGRT arm in head and neck cancer patients. 3. To evaluate the optimal setup correction methodology using planar (EPID) and volumetric images (CBCT) in HNSCC between 3D-CRT and IGRT treatment delivery respectively. 4. To compare the early tumour response and acute and chronic radiation morbidities between IGRT and 3D-CRT.</detailed_description>
