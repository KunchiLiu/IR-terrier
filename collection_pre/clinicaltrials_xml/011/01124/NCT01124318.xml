	<brief_summary>The purpose is to study efficacy of Lactofiltrum in adult patients with atopic dermatitis. Lactofiltrum consists of 85% of hidrolytic lignin and 15% of lactulose and acts as an enterosorbent, which enables to enhance metabolism and elimination of endotoxins and to normalize metabolic and immune processes. Additionally, lactulose stimulates Bifidobacterium flora and in aggregate it could improve skin condition afflicted by atopic dermatitis.</brief_summary>
