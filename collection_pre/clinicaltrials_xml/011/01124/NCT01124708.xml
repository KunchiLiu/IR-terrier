	<brief_summary>ADHD has been associated with persistent deficits in the efficient allocation of attention and supports the notion that regulation of the cholinergic system may improve these cognitive deficits in ADHD. It has been suggested that the effects of nicotine are most pronounced on tasks that demand effortful processing (Rusted and Warburton 1994). In addition, a recent theory proposes that the cholinergic system allocates additional attentional resources during tasks that are demanding (i.e. sustained attention, set shifting, etc; Sarter and Bruno 1997). Thus it may be that in ADHD, cholinergic systems are under-responsive or under-developed and thus stimulation of nicotinic receptors via nicotinic agents may result in improved cognitive performance particularly on tests requiring effortful processing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of TC-5619 in Adults With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, parallel, forced-titration design is being used to assess effects of TC-5619 versus placebo on efficacy. A parallel group design allows the effects of TC-5619 to be clearly established, and the randomized nature of the design allows minimization of observer and subject bias. Because a forced dose up-titration design will be used, effects of individual doses will be preliminary, because the design confounds dose with time. The doses chosen (1mg, 5mg, and 25mg) reflect an appropriate range around the anticipated efficacious dose (3-10 mg), based upon preclinical extrapolations to the human, and upon the pro-cognitive effects of TC-5619 identified by CDR in the MRD study (Targacept Study TC-5619-238-CLP-002). All subjects will be tobacco non-users. It is possible that tobacco (nicotine) interferes with Î±7 NNR-mediated effects.</detailed_description>
