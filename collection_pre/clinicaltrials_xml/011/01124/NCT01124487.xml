	<brief_summary>Objectives: To investigate the acute effects of olive oil, palm olein and lard on lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory markers. Hypothesis: Different dietary fats will alter lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory markers postprandially.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Acute Effects of Oleic Acid Enriched-diets on Lipids, Insulin Sensitivity and Serum Inflammatory Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, single blind, crossover design was undertaken to test meals enriched with palm olein vs olive oil vs lard. Volunteers were asked to participate in three postprandial challenges, separated by at least 3-days. Subjects were provided a low fat meal(&lt;10g fat) the day before the intervention. Fasting blood was collected the next day and the subjects were instructed to consume test meals (50g high fat meal). Further venous blood was collected at 30 min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 4h postprandially. Primary outcome variable: Triacylglycerol (TAG) Secondary outcome variables: Insulin sensitivity (glucose, insulin), non esterified fatty acids (NEFA), inflammatory markers</detailed_description>
