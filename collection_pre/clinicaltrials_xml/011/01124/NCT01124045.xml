	<brief_title>Difluprednate Pediatric Study for the Treatment of Inflammation Post-Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parents or guardians instilled patients' assigned study medications once on the day of surgery (Day 0) and 4 times daily (QID) beginning on the day after surgery (Day 1) for 14 days followed by a tapering period of 14 days (dependent upon the Investigator's determination of adequate response to treatment). Patients were evaluated for safety and efficacy on the following visits: Day 0 (day of surgery), Day 1, Day 8 ± 1 day, Day 15 ± 2 days and Day 29 ± 2 days (end of study drug treatment). Additional safety visits occurred at 1 week after the last dose + 2 days and at 3 Months + 1 week. No inferential statistical analysis was planned for this study. Data was summarized using descriptive statistics.</detailed_description>
