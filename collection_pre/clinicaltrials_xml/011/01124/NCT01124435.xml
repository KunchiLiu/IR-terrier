	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the antitumor activity and potential adverse effects of the combination celecoxib plus carboplatin in patients with recurrent, heavily pre-treated Ovarian Cancer (OC). The potential changes induced by the experimental combination on angiogenesis-related serum markers and quality of life measures will be also evaluated.The main objective is to evaluate the response rate. Secondary objectives are the following:toxicity;progression free survival;overall survival;duration of response;quality of life;modulation of angiogenesis-related molecules.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Combination Carboplatin Plus Celecoxib in Heavily Pre-treated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II prospective study will be conducted at the Gynecologic Oncology Units of the Catholic University of Rome and Campobasso, Italy. The study is non-sponsored, investigators initiated. The primary objective is to determine the tumor response rate by RECIST criteria. Secondary objectives included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity assessment, and QoL measures.Patients are required to take celecoxib (200 mg tablets by mouth twice daily, day 1 to 28), associated to intravenous carboplatin (area under the curve (AUC) 5 over 30 to 60 minutes, every 28 days). Patients who will develop carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) will follow a desensitization protocol, or alternatively will switch to cisplatin. Erythropoietic stimulating agent and myeloid growth factors are not permitted for cycle 1 of study treatment, and their use will be chosen by the treating physician, according to hospital policy.Treatment will be discontinued when any of the following events occurs: radiographic or clinical evidence of cancer progression; deterioration of health or intolerable toxicity; patient refusal. Before starting treatment, patients will be evaluated by medical history, physical examination, cell blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, Ca125, and either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan. The primary endpoint is to determine the overall response (OR) rate. Secondary endpoints include the assessment of duration of response, PFS, OS, toxicity events and QoL scores. When treatment will be discontinued, patients will receive a follow-up visit every 3 months</detailed_description>
