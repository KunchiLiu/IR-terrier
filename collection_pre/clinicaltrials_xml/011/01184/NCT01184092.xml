	<brief_summary>In this study, a 10 mg dose of tasocitinib (CP-690,550) will be given to study subjects on three separate occasions using one of three different tablet formulations (tablet versions) each time. The amount of tasocitinib (CP-690,550) available in the blood following administration of each tablet formulation will be measured and compared. The overall aim of the study is to establish that a similar amount of tasocitinib (CP-690,550) is absorbed into the blood following administration of the same dose of each different tablet formulation.</brief_summary>
