	<brief_summary>Cognitive disorders in patients underwent general anesthesia are discussed for decades, but whether there were precise relationship between general anesthesia and dysgnosia is yet to be guaranteed. Although controversial data reported from experimental studies in animals, the investigators still proposed that general anesthetics could impair the normally organized system of the central nervous system, which finally displayed a dysfunction of cognition after general anesthesia in a short- or long-term period. Therefore, different types of general anesthetics such as inhalational anesthetics and intravenous anesthetics, the investigators hypothesized, had a long-term influence on patients' cognitive ability.</brief_summary>
