	<brief_summary>Non-adherence to the treatment regimen is a common problem associated with injectable drugs (e.g. Betaferon) that are used in multiple sclerosis patients. Certain patients omit single injections or even totally discontinue therapy that normally should be long-term. It is therefore crucial to identify the factors which have the most significant effect on regularity of administration of Betaferon and the risk of premature discontinuation of treatment in order to undertake appropriate preventive measures. This study is conducted in routine practice setting and aims to identify those risks. Pre-defined risk factors associated with technical aspects of the treatment, support provided to the patient, stage of the disease and possible adverse effects of the medication are checked on a quarterly basis with a questionnaire method. Monitoring of omitted doses of the prescribed medication (Betaferon) is carried out by the study nurse.</brief_summary>
