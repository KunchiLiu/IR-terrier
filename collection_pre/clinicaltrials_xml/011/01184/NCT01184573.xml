	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a non-invasive, non-radioactive Pancreatic Breath Test (PBT) as a diagnostic tool to detect early stages of chronic pancreatitis (CP). If successful, this method could have important advantages over existing diagnostic tests for detecting early stage CP. This diagnostic breath test may have a clinical impact if it leads to early detection of CP and intervention to mitigate disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Breath Test to Detect Early Stage Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disorders of the pancreas affect more than one million persons in this country with nearly $3 billion in health care costs. The incidence rate of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is rapidly increasing and may be related to expanded alcohol abuse. Advanced CP can be easily detected by imaging techniques. However, mild to moderate CP presents a more difficult challenge for clinicians. Imaging techniques fail to recognize less advanced CP cases about 40% of the time. The gold standard for monitoring early stage CP is the secretin stimulation test. However, the secretin stimulation test is only done in a few US centers. The investigators have developed the Pancreatic Breath Test (PBT) as an alternative to the secretin stimulation test. The breath test uses a tracer dose of sodium 13C-bicarbonate to detect the amount of bicarbonate released after stimulation of the pancreatitis by a meal (liquid Ensure). A normal pancreas releases unlabeled bicarbonate upon stimulation, decreasing the ratio of 13C/12C of exhaled carbon dioxide. This ratio will change much less in a diseased pancreas. A case-control study in 25 mild to moderate CP patients and 25 healthy controls will be utilized to show feasibility of the new breath test.</detailed_description>

For case subjects with mild to moderate chronic pancreatitis, they must have either an abnormal endoscopic ultrasound (greater than 4 abnormalities), an abnormal secretin stimulation test, an abnormal endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an abnormal CT scan of the pancreas (dilation of the main pancreatic duct or atrophy of the pancreas), a serum trypsin level &lt;29 ng/ml but &gt;20 ng/ml, or a fecal elastase of less than 200 mcg/gram stool but greater than 100 mcg/gram stool. Females who are lactating or pregnant. Subjects with acute pancreatitis. Subjects known to have a significant medical and/or mental disease. Subjects receiving an investigational new drug within 30 days. Subjects on enzyme therapy, proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists. Subjects who have had a recent febrile illness within 5 days of scheduled entry into the study. Body temperature must be normal for at least 72 hours before entering the study.</criteria>
