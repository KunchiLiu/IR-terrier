	<brief_summary>The research proposed in this collaborative application Implementation and Evaluation of Formal Training for Mentors of K-Series Mentored Career Development Awards will uniquely study mentor training in the biomedical academic community. The randomized controlled trial will be conducted at 15 Clinical and Translational Science Award sites over a 21-month period with six months for baseline data collection, nine months for the intervention, three months for follow-up, and three months for analysis. The multi-site trial will be conducted to determine whether the resultant skills-focused, case-based, mentor training program can improve the mentoring skills of K series mentors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial will be conducted over a 21-month period with six months for baseline data collection, nine months for the intervention, three months for follow-up, and three months for analysis. The trial will be conducted to determine whether the resultant skills-focused, case-based, mentor training program can improve the mentoring skills of K series mentors. Our modified Wisconsin Mentoring Seminar Curriculum will consist of four 2-hour sessions administered within an 8-week period, using trained facilitators. Scholars will include all recipients of a K-Series Award at the 3 CTSA sites (e.g., K01, K08, K12, K23, K24, K99, KL2), who will be funded during the two-year cycle of this Administrative Supplement. We will randomly assign 300 K-award mentors of these scholars to a control group (n=150) or to the experimental intervention (n=150).</detailed_description>
