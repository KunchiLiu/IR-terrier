	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about why some obese persons are resistant to developing obesity-related metabolic diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), while others are prone to developing these conditions. We will do this by studying obese persons before and after a 5% body weight gain. Subjects will be asked to increase their current diet for a period of 8-12 weeks in order to increase their current body weight by 5%. Each will then be asked to maintain this weight increase for 3 weeks. We will monitor subjects throughout this time period with weekly medical evaluations. At the completion of the study, we will provide each subject with a 6-month weight loss program.</brief_summary>
