	<brief_summary>The use of virtual reality simulation training in obstetrics and gynecology has not been widely studied. The investigators hypothesized that residents randomized to the trainer would not perform differently when compared with those who are not randomized. Residents in Obstetrics and gynecology are randomized to a 4 month training course on our simulator. They are objectively evaluated performing various laparoscopy tasks prior to and after the course.</brief_summary>
