	<brief_title>Integrated Behavioral Intervention for Cigarette Smoking and Binge Drinking in Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of Integrated Intervention that targets both cigarette smoking and binge drinking on the cigarette smoking behavior of young adult smokers at 6-month follow-up. II. To evaluate the efficacy of Integrated Intervention that targets both cigarette smoking and binge drinking on binge drinking behavior of young adult smokers. III. Examine the effect of Integrated Intervention on several possible mediators of change corresponding to mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the relationship between cigarette smoking and alcohol use. These mediators include cravings to smoke, perceived similarity to the typical smoker, and self-efficacy for smoking abstinence. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.All patients receive nicotine patch therapy in weeks 4-11. ARM I: Patients attend behavioral sessions for smoking and binge drinking cessation over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-6. ARM II: Patients attend behavioral sessions for smoking cessation over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-6.After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24.</detailed_description>
