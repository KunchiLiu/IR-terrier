	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to help investigators to understand more about the development of characteristics related to being male or female (what is called gender development). The investigators will study girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) aged 10 to 13 to learn more about the girls' interests and activities, thoughts and feeling about being female, and family relationships. This will help investigators to understand the ways in which gender development is shaped by hormones and family relationships.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interviewers will visit girls in their home when it is convenient for the family. Girls will answer questions about the things they do and are interested in, how they think and feel, and complete some cognitive tasks. Girls will also provide saliva so we can examine their hormones and determine the CAH gene mutation they have. Parents will also be asked to complete questionnaires about their own activities and interests and about their daughter's behavior. Shortly after the home visit, interviewers will telephone girls and their parents on several days and ask what the girls did during the day.</detailed_description>
