	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire that asks how you feel before the procedure. It will take about 5 minutes to complete. After you have completed the questionnaire, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to Group 1 or Group 2. You will have an equal chance of being in either group. If you are in Group 1, you will receive routine information before the lung biopsy and you will watch a video on a handheld or laptop machine with headphones. The video is designed to help you understand the biopsy procedure. This video should last about 5 minutes. You will then complete a questionnaire that asks how you feel after watching the video. It will take about 5 minutes to complete. If you are in Group 2, you will receive routine information before the lung biopsy. You will then complete another questionnaire that asks how you feel before the procedure. It will take about 5 minutes to complete. After your routine lung biopsy, both groups will complete a questionnaire that asks how you feel after the procedure. It will take about 5 minutes to complete. For Group 1, the total time to complete the questionnaires and watch the video will be 20 minutes. For Group 2, the total time to complete the questionnaires will be 15 minutes. Length of Study: Your participation in this study will be over once you complete the questionnaire after your lung biopsy. This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
