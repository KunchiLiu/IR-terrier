	<brief_summary>Varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are both effective smoking cessation treatments. Anecdotally smokers who are finding their quit attempt difficult have reported benefiting from adding NRT to varenicline. This proof-of-principle placebo-controlled double-blind study will examine whether combining NRT and varenicline provides better withdrawal and craving relief than varenicline alone. A total of 120 smokers would be randomised to receive varenicline +15mg/16hr patch or varenicline + placebo patch. All participants will receive standard NHS Stop Smoking Service support. The primary outcome would be ratings of craving and withdrawal discomfort 24 hours and one week after the target quit date.</brief_summary>
