	<brief_summary>This research study is evaluating the combination of pazopanib and everolimus in patients that have a malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, or metastatic or locally advanced unresectable kidney cancer. In this research study the investigators are testing the safety of the combination of pazopanib and everolimus as well as to find the appropriate dose to use for further studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Phase I Pazopanib and Everolimus in Advanced Solid Tumors and Previously Treated Advanced Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This protocol has two parts, Phase I and Expansion Cohort. Once the maximum tolerated dose has been identified in the Phase I portion, an expansion cohort of patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable kidney cancer will be enrolled. - Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which the participant will be taking pazopanib and everolimus orally daily.</detailed_description>
