	<brief_title>ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Size 3 vs 4 in Non-paralyzed Female Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ProSealTM laryngeal mask airway (PLMA; Laryngeal Mask Co. Limited, Mahe, Seychelles) is a laryngeal mask device with an added dorsal cuff to improve the seal and a drainage tube to prevent aspiration and gastric insufflations(Brain, Verghese et al. 2000).Despite its utility, there are complications associated with PLMA insertion such as sore throat and mucosal injury including oropharyngeal blood. The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to determine if size 3 PLMA would induce less mucosal damage indicated by blood on the cuff than size 4 in non-paralyzed female patients. The secondary objective of this study is to compare insertion time, number of attempts, oropharyngeal leak pressure, hemodynamic variables, and incidence of complications with size 3 and 4 PLMA.</detailed_description>
