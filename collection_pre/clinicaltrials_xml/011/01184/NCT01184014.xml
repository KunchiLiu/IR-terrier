	<brief_title>Hospital Insulin Protocol Aims for Glucose Control in Corticosteroid-induced Hyperglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall study objective of this research is to establish the efficacy and assure the safety of achieving glycemic control in hospitalized patients who receive greater than physiologic doses of steroids. This study will compare 2 methods of achieving glycemic control in hospitalized patients who develop steroid-induced hyperglycemia (blood glucose (BG) &gt;180 mg/dL): 1) a study-specific steroid NPH dosing algorithm plus standard recommended care (Experimental group) vs. 2) the standard recommended care (Methodist Hospital Complete Insulin Orders (Control group).</detailed_description>
