	<brief_summary>For patients with end-stage kidney disease, transplantation is the treatment of choice, offering improved quality of life by restored metabolism and freedom from dialysis. However, demands regarding the acquirement of knowledge in life post transplantation are high. In order to reduce rejection episodes, graft loss and the negative consequences of life-long immunosuppressive medication, it is essential for kidney recipients to possess knowledge about important aspects regarding immunosuppressive medication, graft surveillance and the benefit of specific lifestyle behavior.
