	<brief_summary>Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a communication style demonstrated to decrease drug and alcohol use. A five session MI intervention (BSF) was implemented in the Swedish correctional system. The intervention was delivered by counsellors with workshop only MI training (BSF) or by counsellors with workshop MI training followed by peer group supervision based on audio taped feedback (BSF+). Aim was to examine whether BSF in prisons reduces drug and alcohol use more effectively than interviews conducted according to the usual planning interview routine (UPI).</brief_summary>
