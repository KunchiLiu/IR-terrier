	<brief_summary>The goals of this project are to 1)determine the responsiveness of the 6 Minute Push Test (6MPT) and 2) explore the relationship between 6MPT distance and measures of handicap, wheelchair satisfaction, depression, and self-reported avoidance of environmental features.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6 Minute Propulsion Test Sensitivity to Increased Aerobic Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 6 minute walk test is a widely used assessment of aerobic capacity, function, and functional change in the ambulatory population. A similar clinical and research outcome instrument that is responsive to changes in aerobic capacity and function are lacking for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). A 6 minute push test, adapted from the 6 minute walk test may fill the void. The primary aim of this project is to assess if distance traveled in 6 minutes of wheelchair propulsion changes after an increase in aerobic capacity. We hypothesize that participants will push farther in 6 minutes after their aerobic capacity increases. The secondary aim is to explore the correlation between 6MPT distance and handicap, depression, wheelchair satisfaction, and self-reported avoidance of environmental features. We hypothesize increasing 6MPTdistance will be correlated with decreasing depression, decreasing handicap, decreasing self-reported avoidance of environmental features, and increasing wheelchair satisfaction. This is a low risk, high benefit study.</detailed_description>
