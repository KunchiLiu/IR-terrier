	<brief_summary>Direct in-vitro identification of S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from positive blood cultures by MicroPhage's bacteriophage-based diagnostic platform, two gold-standard reference methods, and two predicate devices with similar indications for use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Into the Performance of the MicroPhage S. Aureus/MSSA/MRSA Test Direct From Blood Culture Positives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, FDA clinical study designed to investigate the safety and performance of the MicroPhage S. aureus/MSSA/MRSA test direct from blood culture positives. Informed consent is not anticipated, as this is a laboratory performance study with no patient intervention. The MicroPhage Test will be compared to site standards of care, market-available rapid tests, two predicate tests, and two disk diffusion tests for antimicrobial susceptibility. The study will last approximately 4-6 months (Bactec), dependent on the accrual rate of each institution. This study is designed to support the following product indications for use: The MicroPhage S. aureus/MSSA/MRSA Blood Culture Test is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid identification of Staphylococcus aureus and determination of methicillin susceptibility (MSSA) or methicillin resistance (MRSA) directly from positive blood cultures. The test uses bacteriophage amplification to rapidly and phenotypically identify the presence of S. aureus and assess the response of the target organism to cefoxitin as an analog to methicillin. This test is performed on positive blood cultures. Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary for further susceptibility test determinations. Results of the study analysis will be in the form of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, frequencies) for all study variables. Associations among variables will be presented using correlation coefficients, as well as odds ratios and parameter estimates from multivariable regression (linear and logistic) where applicable.</detailed_description>
