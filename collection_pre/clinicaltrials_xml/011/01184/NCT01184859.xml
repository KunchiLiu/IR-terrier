	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparative trial to be conducted in nocturia patients. The trial is designed to characterize the dose-response relationship of Minirin (desmopressin) Melt in order to establish correct dose recommendations in the target patient population. In particular, the trial is designed to link the duration of action to the clinical endpoint. Furthermore, the trial is designed to describe the safety of four different dose levels of desmopressin.</brief_summary>
