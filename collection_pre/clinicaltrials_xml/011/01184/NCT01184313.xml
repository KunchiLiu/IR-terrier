	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective, randomized clinical trial is to understand and measure lung injuries caused by CPB in aortic valve surgery. Study questions: - Is there any correlation between the release of pro-inflammatory biomarkers and lung injury degree? - Is there any correlation between oxyhaemodynamic parameters and lung injury degree? - Is there any correlation between oxyhaemodynamic parameters and the release of pro-inflammatory biomarkers? - Are budesonide, erdostein and acetylcystein effective in the prevention of lung injuries?</brief_summary>
