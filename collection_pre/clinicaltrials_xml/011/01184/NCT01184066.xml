	<brief_summary>The 5-year survival after a first diagnosis of breast cancer is 13% lower in black than in white American women, an alarming disparity that cannot be explained by stage of disease at presentation. Nonadherence to breast cancer treatment and treatment delays from diagnosis to initiation of treatment may be among the reasons for worse breast cancer outcomes in black women. This recognition is critical because it suggests that breast cancer survival disparity can be decreased through clinical interventions that increase adherence to chemotherapy. The ACTS (Attitudes, Communication, Treatment, Support) Intervention is a onetime, intensive psycho-educational intervention using a race-matched breast cancer survivor interventionist to: address Attitudes, including perceptions and stressors, that may impact adherence to clinical visits and treatment; encourage and model patient Communication with health care providers regarding physical and emotional needs, with attention to race-discordant situations; and provide tailored, understandable information about Treatment and its rationale. The Support component is threaded throughout the intervention via the presence of a race-matched breast cancer survivor and supportive video messages from the black community. This study is a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the ACTS Intervention vs. Usual Care on the primary outcomes of adherence to recommended breast cancer chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
