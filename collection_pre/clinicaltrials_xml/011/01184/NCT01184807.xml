	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial comprises 2 stages: a dose escalation stage at 8 dose levels of 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/day,and possibly additional intermediate doses, to determine the MTD and recommended dose, and a subsequent 2 parts of expansion stage to investigate the safety profile and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1, Dose-escalation Trial of OPB-51602 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In expansion stage part 1, up to 20 advanced sold tumor subjects will be investigated the safety profiled and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose for 3 weeks per cycle（2 weeks treatment and 1 week washout). In the expansion stage part 2, a maximum of 20 subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Melanoma or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) will be treated until an investigational Medicinal product (IMP) efficacious case can be found. subject dosing will be started on Day 1 without 2-day treatment free interval and continued until Day 28 at recommend dose (4mg) first in cycle 1. After safety and tolerability are confirmed, same subjects will be treated at the MTD(5mg) from cycle 2 onwards as a once-daily oral dose for 4 weeks per cycle to obtain additional information about safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of OPB-51602</detailed_description>

Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastasis Uncontrolled concurrent illness, including active infection, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or heart failure (NYHA class III or IV, Appendix 2 New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification) Concurrent malignancy of a different type Immunocompromised subjects, including those who are known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with trial requirements Pregnant or breastfeeding women Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or male subjects whose partners are WOCBP who cannot or will not use effective contraceptive measures Administration of another investigational agent within 6 weeks prior to start of IMP administration Use of any of the prohibited medications and other substances listed in Appendix 3 CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers within either 1 week prior to start of IMP administration or a period of at least 5 times the respective elimination halflife, whichever is longer Known severe gastrointestinal disorder, including malabsorption (at screening) Patients with CTCAE Grade 1 or higher pneumonitis (interstitial pneumonia) or pulmonary fibrosis* * If interstitial lung abnormalities, (e.g. groundglass or linear opacity) are suspected on chest CT scan (highresolution CT), regardless of whether or not there are any accompanying symptoms it must be confirmed, such as through consultation with a respiratory or radiology expert if necessary, that the patient dose not fall under this exclusion criterion before the patient can be enrolled in the trial.</criteria>
