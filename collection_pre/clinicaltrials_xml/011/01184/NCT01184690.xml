	<brief_summary>Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) is a new device that allows diagnosis and treatment throughout the entire small intestine. Although the originally described method requires two operators, the investigators have recently developed a method to perform DBE by a single operator. The investigators here assessed the clinical usefulness of this one-person method in comparison to the conventional two-person DBE.</brief_summary>
