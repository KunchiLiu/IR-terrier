	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the effects of a high protein (HP) and a normal protein diet (NP) on patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls in a sample of southern Brazilian women. Patients will be randomized to receive high protein (30% protein, 40% carbohydrate, 30% lipid) or normal protein (15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, 30% lipid) during eight weeks. The investigators hypothesis is that a different diet composition may have influences in changes of the main characteristics of PCOS, like hyperandrogenism and metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
