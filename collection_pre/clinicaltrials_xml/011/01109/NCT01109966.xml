	<brief_title>An Elimination Diet Using a New Amino Acid Based Formula: Immunological and Clinical Effects in Cow's Milk Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants with CMA cannot tolerate proteins contained in milk, although they are able to tolerate amino acids which are the 'building blocks' of proteins. Unlike standard infant formulas which are made from milk proteins, amino acid formulas (AAF) are made from nonallergenic aminoacids plus all the other nutrients required to support growth and development.</detailed_description>
