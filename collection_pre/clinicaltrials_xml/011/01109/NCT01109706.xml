	<brief_summary>PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) plays a key role in LDL-cholesterol (LDLC) metabolism by inhibiting LDL receptor (LDLR) at post-transcriptional level. PCSK9 loss of function mutations are associated to decreased LDLC levels and a cardiovascular protection. In this context, the development of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9, in association with statins treatment, represents a major therapeutic issue for LDLC modulation. It was previously shown that PCSK9 plasmatic concentration correlated with plasmatic LDLC, TG and glucose concentrations. However, no data are available on predictive value of PCSK9 plasmatic level concerning coronary disease severity. The main objective of this study is to determine whether plasmatic PCSK9 concentration is linked to coronary damage severity in patients with acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
