	<brief_summary>Study aims to improve osteoporosis care through patient tailored education materials in a group-randomized trial of patients referred to home health care with a history of fracture and/or an osteoporosis diagnosis. Project investigators will conduct telephone surveys and examine electronic medical record data to assess fracture related morbidity and mortality, osteoporosis treatment and adherence, and use of calcium and vitamin D supplements. We hypothesize that patients that receive the intervention materials will be more likely to initiate or maintain osteoporosis treatment.</brief_summary>
