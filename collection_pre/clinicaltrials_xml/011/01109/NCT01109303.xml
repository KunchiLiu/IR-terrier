	<brief_summary>Ankle fracture is frequent and its number is increasing. In Canada, surgical treatment of these lesions is advised and the options currently used all have in common a rigid fixation of the syndesmosis which results in residual stiffness and a high level of secondary surgery, mostly to remove the implant. The purpose of the study is to compare the treatment of ankle syndesmotic rupture by a dynamic fixation to a static fixation suggesting that the dynamic fixation method will improve the Olerud-Molander functional score of more than 15 points at the 3 months follow-up.</brief_summary>
