	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare two interventions for preparing diabetic teens and young adults for transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transition of Adolescents and Young Adults With Diabetes From Pediatric to Adult Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One will represent a short-term intensive social-behavioral intervention supported by peer-to-peer social networking in which subjects receive "usual care" from their current diabetes provider outside the parameters of the study. The second intervention will be a traditional transition clinic model, where subjects will receive the standard of diabetes care from a team of combined pediatric and adult practitioners and educators, with added educational modules and behavioral evaluation and support designed to facilitate the transition to adult care (i.e., that foster "developmentally tailored care"). The first is a much less intensive intervention from the standpoint of the providers and gives special prominence to peer support; the second is provider-intensive. The goal of both interventions is to improve self-efficacy (confidence in taking ownership of and managing one's diabetes); i.e., to prepare the patient to move from primary support by family and providers to a reliance on self-ownership and self-management as a responsible, independent adult. Optional sub-study available for parents, spouses, and significant others.</detailed_description>
