	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether bindarit is effective to reduce albuminuria, compared to placebo, in nephropathic patients treated with irbesartan, as a background therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Bindarit in Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot phase II, double-blind, multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study in patients with DN undergoing irbesartan therapy. According to screening urinary albumin excretion, at baseline and before randomization, all patients will be categorized into 2 strata: Stratum 1: microalbuminuria (20 to 200 μg/min, in at least 2 of 3 consecutive overnight urine samples collected at the screening) Stratum 2: macroalbuminuria (&gt;200 μg/min, in at least 2 of 3 consecutive overnight urine samples collected at the screening). Within each stratum, patients will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to the 2 treatment arms (after one month induction period): - bindarit 600MG twice a day - placebo All patients will be treated with irbesartan 300 mg/day as background therapy. After 12 months of treatment albuminuria will be evaluated as primary endopoint.</detailed_description>
