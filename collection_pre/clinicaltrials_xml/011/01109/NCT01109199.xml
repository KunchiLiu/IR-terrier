	<brief_summary>This 18 week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial will examine the effects of thick dietary fibre (PGX) supplementation of a low calorie diet (LCD) on appetite, weight loss, body composition, and compliance in overweight and moderately obese female. The investigators believe that 15 grams/day PGX supplementation of a low calorie diet over a 14-weeks period will elicit a better appetite score (e.g. reduced hunger) compared to the rice flour supplementation of the LCD.</brief_summary>
