	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is the mainstay of therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, providing cure in a high percentage of cases. Conventional ablation techniques require the use of fluoroscopy to place and navigate catheters in the heart, thus exposing patients to ionizing radiations with an additional risk of cancer. The feasibility and safety of a non-fluoroscopic RFCA of a wide range of supraventricular arrhythmias using the EnSite NavX mapping system have been recently reported. The NO-PARTY is a multicenter, randomized-controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that supraventricular arrhythmias RFCA through the non-fluoroscopic EnSite NavX mapping system results in a clinically significant reduction of the exposure to ionizing radiations compared with conventional ablation techniques. NO-PARTY trial will determine whether supraventricular tachyarrhythmia RFCA through a non-fluoroscopic EnSite NavX mapping system is a suitable and cost-effective approach to achieve a clinically significant reduction of ionizing radiation exposure for both the patient and the operator.</brief_summary>
