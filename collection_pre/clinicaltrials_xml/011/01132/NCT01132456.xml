	<brief_title>RESOLUTE Asia: Evaluation of the Endeavor Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent System in a Patient Population With Long Lesion(s) and/or Dual Vessels in Asia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 249 to 411 patients will be enrolled from Asia at approximately 25 centers where Endeavor Resolute stent is commercially available. There are two study cohorts: 1. 38 mm cohort: a minimum of 46 patients and maximum of 111 patients with at least one lesion amenable to treatment with a 38 mm length Endeavor Resolute stent. Patients may have one or two lesions, if the two lesions are located in separate target vessels. 2. Dual vessel cohort: a minimum of 203 patients and maximum of 300 patients with dual vessel treatment where each vessel has a lesion with length ≤ 27 mm and reference vessel diameters between 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm.</detailed_description>
