	<brief_title>AIN457 Regimen Finding Extension Study in Patients With Moderate to Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to provide long term clinical data for the compound for the treatment of the indication of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. In the Proof-of-Concept study (CAIN457A2102), AIN457 has proven to be efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. As a result, a phase IIb regimen finding study has been started (CAIN457A2211). The data gathered in this extension study of the core study (CAIN457A2211) will be used to expand the safety database of the compound for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. The patients in the extension study will continue to stay on the exact same treatment regimen they were taking when completing the core study.</detailed_description>
