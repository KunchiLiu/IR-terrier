	<brief_summary>Malnutrition in children has even more severe consequences on disease course and long-term health than malnutrition in adults. According to prior studies, malnutrition affects about 15-30 % of hospitalized children in Europe (ESPGHAN 2005, Pawellek et al 2008, Joosten and Hulst 2008). However, available criteria for defining malnutrition in paediatric patients are inconsistent, not based on firm evidence, and not generally agreed upon. Current guidelines do not address assessment of and screening for childhood malnutrition. Therefore, a large number of affected children are not adequately diagnosed. One aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and patients at risk for malnutrition among at least 2700 hospitalized children mainly across Europe. In addition criteria to link anthropometric measurements and the prediction of outcome, i.e. length of hospital stay, shall be established. A further goal then is to establish agreed, evidence-based criteria for malnutrition in children with the purpose of leading to an agreed, evidence-based screening tool for paediatric malnutrition in developed countries. This tool shall include a set of simple questions, based on previously suggested tools. Thereby this study will provide a strong basis for implementing evidence-based nutritional interventions in paediatric patients by harmonisation of diagnostic criteria for childhood malnutrition in developed countries.</brief_summary>
