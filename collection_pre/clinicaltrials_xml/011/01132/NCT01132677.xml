	<brief_summary>Do differences exist between patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of corticosteroid versus patients who receive a single intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Viscosupplementation and Corticosteroid Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary i. To determine if patients' VAS "pain while walking" is different at 6 weeks post-injection in patients who receive a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) versus patients who receive a single injection of Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Oneâ„¢) for treatment of knee OA. Secondary i. To determine if differences in VAS "pain while walking" scores exist at 1 and 3 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients. ii. To determine if differences in VAS "pain at rest" scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients. iii. To determine if differences in VAS "pain with stairs" scores exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients. iii. To determine if differences in KOOS questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients. iv. To determine if differences in WOMAC questionnaire scores exist at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients. v. To determine if differences in adverse events exist at 1, 3 and 6 weeks, and 3, and 6 months post injection between MPA and HA patients. vi. To track the number of patients who receive additional injections after 3 months following their index injection.</detailed_description>
