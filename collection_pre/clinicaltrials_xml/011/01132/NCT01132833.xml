	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving chemotherapy may help doctors learn more about the effects of chemotherapy on cells. It may also help doctors understand how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers related to thrombosis in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma receiving chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Related to Thrombosis in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To measure levels of circulating tissue factor (TF) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma at several time points before, during, and after the administration of chemotherapy and/or antiangiogenic agents. Secondary - To measure the correlation of TF with two markers of coagulation activation (i.e., D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin [TAT] complexes) and two markers of endothelial activation (i.e., soluble E-selectin, soluble thrombomodulin) in these patients. - To measure and compare (descriptively) our microparticle-associated TF procoagulant activity assay with two other assays using samples from these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then periodically during treatment. Circulating tissue factor (TF) activity levels and coagulation and endothelial activation (by ELISA) are measured. Medical charts are reviewed for sociodemographic and medical information. After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 months.</detailed_description>
