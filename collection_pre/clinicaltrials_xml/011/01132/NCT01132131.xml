	<brief_summary>The Emergency Ward Center in Oslo has the last two years used a questionnaire to identify patients who qualify for treatment of acute cystitis by the use of a delegation form. The aim of the study is to evaluate this practice, the primary objective being to evaluate if in a selected patient group the treatment outcome after identifying patients with probable acute cystitis by delegation form will be as good or better than the treatment received after a regular doctor's consultation. The planned study will also investigate which symptoms, signs and laboratory findings that coincide with significant bacteruria. The reference standard will be a microbiological culture of every patients urine.</brief_summary>
