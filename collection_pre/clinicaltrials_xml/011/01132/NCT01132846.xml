	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits and safety of intravenous administration of low dose nesiritide or low dose dopamine in patients with congestive heart failure and kidney dysfunction. There is a substudy in a subset of subjects that is being used to determine whether the Provocative Dyspnea Severity Score (pDSS) is a more sensitive index of variability in clinical status than the dyspnea VAS assessed without standardization of conditions at assessments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure and Reliable Evaluation of Dyspnea in the Heart Failure Network (ROSE) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute heart failure (AHF) is the most common cause of hospital admission in patients over age 65, accounting for 1,000,000 admissions, over 6 million hospital days, and $12 billion in costs annually. The prognosis of patients admitted with AHF is dismal, with a 20-30% readmission rate and a 20-30% mortality rate within six months after admission. Recent studies have established the prognostic importance of renal function in patients with heart failure. In patients who are hospitalized with decompensated congestive heart failure, worsening renal function is also associated with worse outcome, Various studies have estimated that 25-30% of patients hospitalized for decompensated CHF have worsening of renal function leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased morbidity and mortality. Although there are no FDA approved renal adjuvant therapies for AHF, several novel adjuvant therapies for use in AHF are being investigated in randomized clinical trials. Additionally, there are currently available strategies, with the potential for improving renal function in AHF such as low dose dopamine and low dose nesiritide. However, these strategies have not been investigated. Participation in this study will last 6 months. All potential participants will undergo initial screening, which wil include a medical history, physical exam, blood draws, measurements of fluid intake and output, and questionnaires. The same evaluations and procedures will be repeated at various points during the study. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive low dose nesiritide or placebo with optimal diuretic dosing or low dose dopamine or placebo with optimal diuretic dosing. Follow-up assessments will occur at Baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, day 7 or discharge, day 60 and 6 months. Follow-up assessments will include medical history, physical exam, blood draws, measurements of fluid intake and output, questionnaires and questions about medications and changes in health. The RED ROSE substudy involves a subset of ROSE patients in looking at the dyspnea assessment. The dyspnea visual analog scale (dyspnea VAS) has been suggested to be superior to other ordinal (Likert) scales in assessment of dyspnea in acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS)1. However, there is no standardization of conditions (oxygen supplementation, position, activity) at the time of VAS assessment and thus, it may not optimally reflect the variability in dyspnea severity in AHFS patients. This insensitivity to variability at baseline and subsequent assessment may limit the ability to reflect variation in response over time and with alternate treatment strategies. A standardized and sequentially provocative assessment of dyspnea (provocative dyspnea severity score, pDSS) may better reflect variation in dyspnea severity and variation in response over time and with alternate treatment strategies. Substudy subjects will be asked to complete a provocative dyspnea assessment at baseline, 24, 48 and 72 hours. The subjects will be asked to complete a 6 minute walk assessment at the 72 hour visit.</detailed_description>
