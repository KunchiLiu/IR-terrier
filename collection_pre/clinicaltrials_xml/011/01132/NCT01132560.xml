	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with ductal breast carcinoma in situ.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To validate the prognostic utility of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score® assay in tissue samples from patients with ductal breast carcinoma in situ enrolled on clinical trial ECOG-E5194. OUTLINE: RNA extracted from archived tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile by Oncotype DX Recurrence Score® assay (a reverse transcriptase-PCR-based assay).</detailed_description>
