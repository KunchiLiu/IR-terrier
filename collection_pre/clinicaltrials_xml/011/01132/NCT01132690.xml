	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, double-blind trial to assess the safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in untreated subjects (2 to &lt;18 years old) with Gaucher disease randomly assigned to treatment with one of two doses, 30 or 60 units/kg. Subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of taliglucerase alfa every two weeks. The total duration of treatment will be 12 months. At the end of the 12-month treatment period eligible subjects will be offered enrollment in an open-label extension study if taliglucerase alfa is not commercially available.</brief_summary>
