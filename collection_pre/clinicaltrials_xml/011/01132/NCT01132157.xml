	<brief_summary>Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is the major cause of early renal dysfunction and acute renal failure of the transplanted kidney after renal transplantation. In 1986, Murry et al. described the phenomenon "ischemic preconditioning". Also, it was reported that a few non-ischemic stimuli could provide cellular tolerance against major ischemia through a mechanism similar to ischemic preconditioning. In an animal study, 1 minimal alveolar concentration of volatile anesthetics - a clinically relevant concentration - was reported to have a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury, the effect being variable between types of anesthetics. Also, there were somm reports that intravenous anesthetics such as propofol could reduce IR injury by decreasing oxidative stress and apoptosis. By reducing the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the grafted kidney, the morbidity and mortality related to renal transplantation can be reduced as well. The objective of this study is to find out whether, according to the type of anesthetics (Desflurane vs. Propofol), there is a difference in the protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury of the grafted kidney in patients receiving renal transplantation.</brief_summary>
