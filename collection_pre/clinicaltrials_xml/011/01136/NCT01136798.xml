	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a pilot study to test the novel hypothesis that Exenatide treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes results in improved sleep duration and quality and to explore the relationship between improvements in sleep and measures of metabolic and circadian function. This project would be the first to probe the relationship between incretin hormone regulation, duration and intensity of sleep, glucose tolerance and circadian dysfunction in diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
