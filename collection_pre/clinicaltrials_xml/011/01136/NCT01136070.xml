	<brief_summary>The present study seeks to examine the course of body image, social avoidance and psychosocial aspects of depression and anxiety over time in burn patients. Gaining a better understanding of the effects of burn injury on body image in burn patients over time could help us to better understand the psychosocial sequelae of burns and to identify potential interventions which may serve to improve the quality of life in burn patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study of Body Image, Social Avoidance and Distress and Psychological Functioning in Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gaining a better understanding of the effects of burn injury on body image in burn patients over time could help us to better understand the psychosocial sequelae of burns and to identify potential interventions which may serve to improve the quality of life in burn patients. The original protocol has been modified to include more assessment times. The original protocol was set up to assess patients after patient discharge from the inpatient burn unit and at 6 and 12-months post discharge. The present protocol has been modified to capture assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months post-burn. Patients will be assessed at these time points or until they are discharged from the outpatient burn clinic. In addition, inclusion criteria have been modified to include patients who are anticipated to have a follow-up visit to the burn outpatient clinic at 3 months post-burn. The original protocol required an anticipated follow-up for 12 months post-hospital discharge.</detailed_description>
