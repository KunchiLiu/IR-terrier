	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in Children Undergoing Ostomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Revision or closure of ostomy is a common elective surgical procedure at The Hospital for Sick Children. A retrospective audit conducted at SickKids demonstrated significant intraoperative opioid use and significant requirements for rescue opioids in recovery. Concerns exist regarding the relative merits of opioid use in abdominal surgery. Opioids may decrease bowel motility leading to the increased incidence and duration of postoperative ileus. They may be associated with increased rates of post-operative nausea and vomiting and pruritus. Lastly children may under-report their pain or pain may not be recognized by medical staff leading to inadequate provision of analgesia. This suggests that the use of a regional technique may benefit children undergoing revision of ostomy.</detailed_description>
