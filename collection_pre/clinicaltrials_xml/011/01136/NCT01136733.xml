	<criteria>Select Histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Phase 2: Histological or cytological confirmation of predominant clear cell RCC (original tissue diagnosis of RCC is acceptable). Documented evidence of unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC. Phase 2: Radiographic evidence of disease progression according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Phase 2: One prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)targeted treatment (for example, but not limited to, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, bevacizumab, axitinib, vatalanib, AV951/tivozanib) for unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC. Phase 2: Measurable disease meeting the following criteria: a.) at least 1 lesion of greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in the longest diameter for a nonlymph node or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in the short axis diameter for a lymph node which is serially measurable according to Modified RECIST 1.1 using computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) or photography. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP less than or equal to 150/90 mmHg at screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to the Screening Visit. Select Phase 1b or Phase 2 specific per below: Phase 1b only: Subjects with untreated or unstable metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS) are excluded. Subjects who have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of steroids for this indication at least 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment and in whom stability has been proven by at least 2 CT or MRI scans obtained at least 4 weeks apart are eligible for Phase 1b only. Phase 2 only: Subjects with CNS (e.g., brain or leptomeningeal) metastasis are excluded. Phase 2 only: More than one prior VEGFtargeted treatment for unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC. Phase 1b or Phase 2 specific per below: Phase 1b only: Prior exposure to lenvatinib. Phase 2 only: Prior exposure to lenvatinib or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. Subjects should not have received any anticancer treatment within 21 days or any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and should have recovered from any toxicity related to previous anticancer treatment. Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects having greater than 1+ proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo 24hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24hour will be ineligible. Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose at 1.5 x ULN. Phase 2 only: Active malignancy (except for renal cell carcinoma, melanoma insitu, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma insitu of the cervix) within the past 24 months. Known intolerance to any of the study drugs (or any of the excipients) and/or known hypersensitivity to rapamycins (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus) or any of the excipients. Phase 1b only: Subjects who discontinued prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor due to toxicity will be ineligible.</criteria>
