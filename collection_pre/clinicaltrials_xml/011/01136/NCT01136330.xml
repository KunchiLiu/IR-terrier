	<brief_summary>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most frequent neuromuscular disease in adults. DM1 patients have an impaired prognosis (mean age of death &lt;60 years) due to cardiac and respiratory complications. Our primary objective was to identify cardiac and respiratory prognostic factors in DM1.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DM1 Heart Registry - DM1 Respiratory Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Patients with genetically proven DM1 who were admitted in Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital from 2000 and 2010 will be identified. These patients systematically underwent neurological, cardiac and respiratory investigations. 2. Baseline medical and genetic information will be entered in a dedicated database, including cardiac and respiratory investigations. 3. The occurence of severe cardiac and respiratory adverse events will also be collected. 4. Statistical analysis will be performed to look for correlations between baseline patient characteristics and cardiac or respiratory adverse events during follow up.</detailed_description>
