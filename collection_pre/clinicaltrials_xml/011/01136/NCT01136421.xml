	<brief_summary>Treatment with short acting β2 agonists for exacerbations of COPD results in clinical improvement. It has not been established whether combining short acting β2 agonists to other bronchodilators is more effective than β2 agonists alone. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of SABA and MgSO4 in comparison to SABA and ipratropium bromide (IB) in patients attending the emergency department for AECOPD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients presenting to the emergency department with exacerbation of COPD are randomized to receive nebulised ipratropuim bromide or combined nebulised and an intravenous bolus of magnesium sulfate during 1 hour.</detailed_description>
