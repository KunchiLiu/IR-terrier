	<brief_title>Randomized EsophyX Versus Sham / Placebo Controlled TIF Trial: The RESPECT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: A clinically significant reduction in GERD symptoms, specifically "Troublesome" regurgitation with or without heartburn assessed by the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ). Troublesome symptoms are those which occur a minimum of 2 days a week and are at least moderate in severity. Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint: The normalization of esophageal acid exposure at 6 months and a clinically significant reduction in PPI usage at 12 months.</detailed_description>
