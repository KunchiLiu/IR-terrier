	<brief_summary>In cell cultures, lens epithelial cells and trabecular meshwork cells will be exposed to aqueous humor from pediatric eyes undergoing cataract removal surgery. Cytokine analysis of candidate factors will be performed before and after exposure to lens epithelial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanism of Aphakic and Pseudophakic Glaucoma in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aqueous from the anterior chamber will be withdrawn before surgery. Then the lens capsule will be opened (capsulorhexis) and removed. The lens material will be removed. All 3 components will be sent to the lab. Lens epithelial cells will be isolated and will be used in a co-culture setup with trabecular cells to investigate the interactions between lens cells and trabecular cells. Understanding the interaction between young and adult lens cells on trabecular cell will shed light on mechanism of infantile aphakic glaucoma. Aqueous humor taken out before cataract surgery and before glaucoma operation of aphakic eyes will be used for analysis of growth factor and cytokines in the Aphakic eye using proteins membrane arrays. Eyes before cataract surgery will be used as controls. Such analysis will shed light on the possible factors affecting trabecular cells in aphakic eye.</detailed_description>
