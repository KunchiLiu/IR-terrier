	<brief_summary>The overall goal of the proposed protocol is to rigorously test the hypothesis that CPAP treatment has beneficial effects on glycemic control in patients with both type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If our hypothesis were to be proven, this would imply that CPAP treatment of OSA in patients with T2DM is an essential component of their glycemic control. The proposed work is thus expected to provide additional preventive and therapeutic approaches in the management of millions of patients with T2DM.</brief_summary>
