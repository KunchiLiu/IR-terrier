	<brief_summary>In Taiwan, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease ranked the second and third of ten leading causes of death in female in 2007; half of these deaths is due to coronary artery disease (CAD). Postmenopausal status is an independent risk factor for CAD. Early assessment and proper management of risk factors may reduce the prevalence rate of CAD. In the past decade, despite increased attention to CAD in women, most studies focused on certain menopausal status instead of all phases of menopause or on risk factors limited to related metabolic syndrome. Because the prevalence of risk factors related to CAD is influenced by various physiological and lifestyle status in different menopausal statuses, the purpose of this study, at the first stage, is to explore respectively the risk factors of CAD among middle-aged women in three menopausal statuses. At the second stage, the influence of a lifestyle management program on risk factors modification among pre-menopausal women is examined in this study.</brief_summary>
