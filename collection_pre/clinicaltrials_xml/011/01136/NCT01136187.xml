	<brief_summary>Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) from the femoral approach have more bleeding complications related to access site in comparison to the radial approach in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Major bleeding and access site complications have an important role in results of PCI for ACS and lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Primary PCIs in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are associated with more aggressive antithrombotic treatment than in elective or semi-urgent interventions. Currently, both radial and femoral approaches are routinely used for primary PCI in STEMI. However, only non-randomized studies and registries or small randomized single center studies comparing both approaches in primary PCI have been published until now. The aim of STEMI-RADIAL trial is to evaluate potential reduction of bleeding complications in the radial approach primary PCI compared to femoral approach in randomized, multicenter study.</brief_summary>
