	<brief_summary>The trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy and acceptability of twice- and once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (Kaletra) dosed by weight in HIV-1 infected children who are currently taking lopinavir/ritonavir as part of their combination antiretroviral therapy and who are currently achieving virological suppression (&lt;50 copies/ml). Specifically: - To confirm weight-based dosing recommendations by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir half strength formulation tablets dosed on body weight and comparing to historical adult and paediatric data of pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir soft gel capsules and oral solution respectively (1, 2). - To compare the pharmacokinetics of twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with once-daily dosing in the same children. - To evaluate whether once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir is comparable to twice-daily dosing in terms of virological suppression at 48 weeks. Adherence and acceptability will also be compared.</brief_summary>
