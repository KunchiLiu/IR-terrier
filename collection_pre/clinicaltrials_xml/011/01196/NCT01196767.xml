	<brief_summary>This is a prospective double-blinded and randomised study involving patients undergoing cardiac surgery with median sternotomy, the effects on postoperative analgesia of a 48-hr continuous infusion of ropivacaine 2 mg.mL-1, at the rate of 4 mL.hr-1 through two catheters inserted at the lateral edges of the sternum will be studied, versus a control group in which normal saline will be infused in the same conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ropivacaine Though Laterosternal Catheters After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diverse methods for infusion of local anaesthetics after cardiac surgery have been proposed, but none of them provided high-level evidence of efficacy. The catheters studied here are designed for a surgical insertion before closure of the sternotomy, with the aim of infusing the drug the closest possible of the terminations of intercostal nerves.</detailed_description>
