	<brief_title>A Treatment-Option Protocol to Provide Brentuximab Vedotin to Eligible Patients Completing Studies SGN35-005 or C25001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol was amended to reflect the change from a phase 2/3 to a study with an expanded access program (EAP) in the US that would include patients with ALCL and HL. A later amendment allowed patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to enroll. Enrollment may continue and patients may receive brentuximab vedotin treatment on study until the drug is commercially approved and available to patients in a geographic region.</detailed_description>
