	<detailed_description>Background. In cases with pleural effusion, tissue samples can be obtained through Abrams' needle pleural biopsy, thoracoscopy, or cutting-needle pleural biopsy under the guidance of computerized tomography or ultrasonography for histopathological analysis. This study aims to compare the diagnostic efficiency and reliability of Abrams' needle pleural biopsy under computerized tomography guidance with that of cutting-needle pleural biopsy under ultrasonography guidance in patients with pleural effusion. Methods. Patients with exudative pleural effusion, who could not be diagnosed by cytological analysis, will be included in the study. All patients were randomized following the thoracic computerized tomography with contrast enhancement. Patients either underwent Abrams' needle pleural biopsy under computerized tomography guidance or the cutting-needle pleural biopsy under ultrasonography. The two groups will be compared in terms of diagnostic efficiency and in terms of complications associated with the methods used.</detailed_description>
