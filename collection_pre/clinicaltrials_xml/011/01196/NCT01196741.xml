	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of the Src inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) to weekly paclitaxel improves efficacy, compared with paclitaxel plus placebo, in patients with relapsed platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The trial will also determine toxicity and ascertain whether the combination of paclitaxel plus saracatinib should proceed to a phase III trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saracatinib and Paclitaxel in Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial will be conducted. The overall aim of the trial is to investigate whether the addition of saracatinib to weekly paclitaxel improves efficacy, as measured by progression free survival, compared with paclitaxel plus placebo. The trial will also determine toxicity and ascertain whether the combination of paclitaxel plus saracatinib should proceed to a phase III trial. The toxicity data from Study NCT00610714 (D8180C00015) suggests that a small number of patients could experience febrile neutropaenia during their first chemotherapy cycle. To combat this, saracatinib (175 mg OD)/matched placebo will begin 1 week prior to commencement of chemotherapy, and be given continuously until progression. All patients will receive cycles of weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy. One cycle will consist of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest. If there is evidence of on-going response after 4 cycles, 3 further cycles of saracatinib/placebo plus weekly paclitaxel will be given, unless there is dose-limiting toxicity or the patient requests to discontinue treatment. If best response is stable disease after 4 cycles, treatment should be discontinued but may continue at the discretion of the Investigator.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Confirmed relapsed ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer AND relapse within the platinumresistant (progression must not be based on Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125) alone) timeframe, i.e. have progressed within 6 months of platinum therapy. Patients need not have received prior taxane; if patients have received prior taxane, the interval since treatment must be known. Patients will be stratified as &lt;6 months or 6+ months taxane interval/no prior taxane. Patients will generally have received at least 2 lines of prior chemotherapy, but may enter if they have relapsed within 6 months of first line therapy. Patients may have received prior liposomal doxorubicin, although this is NOT a requirement. The treatment immediately prior to study entry need not be platinumbased. Measurable or evaluable disease (if not measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, patients must be evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA125 criteria). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 02 Adequate haematological and biochemical function. Exclusion criteria Prior administration of weekly paclitaxel. Tumours of malignant mixed mesodermal (MMMT) or mucinous subtypes, or nonepithelial ovarian cancers (e.g. Brenner tumours, Sexcord tumours). Unresolved bowel obstruction. Chemotherapy within the preceding 3 weeks. Radiotherapy within the preceding 3 weeks. Treatment with any investigational agent within the preceding 4 weeks or within 5 halflives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer. Known leptomeningeal involvement or intracranial disease. Evidence of interstitial lung disease (bilateral, diffuse, parenchymal lung disease). Resting ECG with measurable QTc interval of &gt;480 msec at 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period. Pregnant or lactating females. Fertile women of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraception for the duration of trial treatment and for at least 6 months after the last administration of saracatinib +/ paclitaxel. Inability or unwillingness to give informed consent. Ongoing active infection or a documented history of HIV infection, Hepatitis B or C. Concurrent congestive heart failure or prior history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV cardiac disease. Concurrent autoimmune disorder, e.g. systemic lupus or any demyelinating disease. Use of immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids taken within the 4 weeks prior to study entry and during the treatment period.</criteria>
