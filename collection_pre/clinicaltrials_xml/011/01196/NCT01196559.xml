	<criteria>Participants must sign an approved informed consent form (ICF) Histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma Patients had to have received a frontline, platinum/taxane based chemotherapy regimen Patients who progressed or whose best response to their most recent platinumbased therapy was less than a partial response will be classified as having platinumrefractory/resistant ovarian cancer or progressed within six months of completing the most recent platinumbased chemotherapy Participants must have received prior platinumbased chemotherapy for management of primary disease but must not have received more than 3 prior systemic cytotoxic regimens. Patients had to have at least one bidimensionally measurable and/or evaluable (unidimensionally measurable) target lesion in a nonirradiated area and increased Ca 125 A &gt;= 4 weeks interval between their last chemotherapy regimen and the start of study treatment Age 2075 years old Performance status (WHO) 02 Life expectancy of at least three months Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm^3, platelet count &gt; 100000/mm^3, hemoglobin &gt; 9 gr/mm^3) Adequate liver (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal and SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal) and renal function (creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl) prior therapy with vinorelbine or gemcitabine treatment with &gt; 2 cytotoxic regimens (including primary platinum and taxane chemotherapy) Serious comorbidities (as determined by the investigator) such as, but not limited to, active congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or active infection. Concurrent malignancy requiring therapy (excluding noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ). Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Uncontrolled intestinal obstruction Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy that is considered to be investigational Pregnant or nursing.</criteria>
