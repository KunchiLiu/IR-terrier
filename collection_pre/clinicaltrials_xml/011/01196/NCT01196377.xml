	<brief_summary>Our overall objective is to model a pediatric Acute Asthma Clinical Decision Rule (ADR) for personalized medicine by identification of treatment-response phenotypes that are important determinants of outcome. The Specific Aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of this approach by enrolling a pilot cohort of 16 participants in this DBRCT of 4 different albuterol treatment regimens, 2 of which will use 10mg/hr and 2 of which will use 25mg/hr. Within these dosages there will be a pulsed-treatment regimen and a continuous regimen.</brief_summary>
