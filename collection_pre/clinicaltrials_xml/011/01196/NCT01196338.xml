	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the investigators randomized controlled trial is to determine if early protected weightbearing and ankle range of motion after surgical treatment (open reduction internal fixation - ORIF) for ankle fractures improves the rate of return to work and functional outcome compared to postoperative ankle immobilization in a non-weightbearing cast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Weightbearing and Mobilization Versus Non-Weightbearing and Mobilization in Unstable Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial comparing early weightbearing and mobilization VS immobilization and non-weightbearing after initial treatment of unstable ankle fractures. The primary objective of our randomized control trial is to determine if early protected weightbearing and ankle range of motion post open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for unstable ankle fractures improves the rate of return to work and functional outcome compared to postoperative ankle immobilization in a non-weightbearing cast. Our secondary objective is to determine the rate of adverse events (wound healing, infection, hardware failure) with early weightbearing and ROM comparable to rates with traditional post-op ankle immobilization.</detailed_description>
