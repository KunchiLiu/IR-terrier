	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as first-line therapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IV clear cell ovarian cancer. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving temsirolimus with combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III-IV Clear Cell Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the activity of the study regimen as measured by the proportion of patients who are alive and progression-free for at least 12 months after study entry in patients with newly diagnosed stage III or IV clear cell ovarian cancer in the following populations: patients in the United States (U.S.) and worldwide (outside of Japan) and patients in Japan. II. To compare progression-free survival in newly diagnosed stage III or IV clear cell ovarian cancer patients in patients in the U.S. and worldwide (outside of Japan) versus patients in Japan. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the duration of overall survival and progression-free survival in each population. II. To examine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 in each population. III. To estimate the rate of objective tumor response in patients with measurable disease. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore whether immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN], total and phosphorylated protein kinase B [Akt], as well as, ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C [CFTR/MRP], member 3 [ABCC3] [MRP3], ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal accessory protein 1 [AB CF2], cyclin E, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) are associated with outcome, nationality or clinical characteristics. II. To explore whether there is any differences in differential gene expression profiles between U.S. and worldwide (outside of Japan) versus Japanese patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel* intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and temsirolimus IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients then receive consolidation therapy comprising temsirolimus IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: * For circumstances in which docetaxel should be substituted for paclitaxel, docetaxel is given IV over 1 hour. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
