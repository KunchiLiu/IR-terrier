PURPOSE: This pilot trial studies electrical stimulation pain therapy in treating chronic pain and numbness caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation Pain Therapy in Treating Chronic Pain and Numbness Caused By Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of MC5-A on pain symptoms both immediately and over time. II. To evaluate the effect of Calmare therapy on other non-pain symptoms. III. To evaluate the effect of MC5-A on daily opioid and other pain medication use. OUTLINE: Patients undergo electric stimulation pain therapy comprising MC5-A Calmare therapy over 30 minutes once daily for 10 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>CIPN neuropathy: received, or currently receiving, neurotoxic chemotherapy (including taxanessuch as paclitaxel or docetaxel, or platinumbased compounds such as carboplatin or cisplatinum or oxaliplatin, or vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine, or vinorelbine, or proteosome inhibitors such as bortezomib) Pain or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy of &gt;= 1 months duration attributed to chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy OR pain of the other types including chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy, numbness predominant; post mastectomy pain; post surgical pain; post herpetic neuropathy; post radiation pain; other (vertebral compression, fracture, miscellaneous) The pain must have been stable for at least 2 weeks An average daily pain rating of &gt;= 5 out of 10, using the pain numerical rating scale (NRS: 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain possible); or numbness that bothers the patient at least "a little bit" on the CIPN20 Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2 Pregnant women, nursing women, women of childbearing potential or their sexual partners who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device [IUD], surgical sterilization, subcutaneous implants, abstinence, etc.) Use of an investigational agent for pain control concurrently or =&lt; 30 days History of an allergic reaction or previous intolerance to transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation Patients with implantable drug delivery systems, e.g., Medtronic Synchromed Patients with heart stents or metal implants such as pacemakers, automatic defibrillators, aneurysm clips, vena cava clips and skull plates (metal implants for orthopedic repair, e.g., pins, clips, plates, cages, joint replacements are allowed) Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within the past six months Patients with history of epilepsy, brain damage, use of anticonvulsants, symptomatic brain metastases Prior celiac plexus block, or other neurolytic pain control treatment within 4 weeks Other identified causes of painful paresthesias existing prior to chemotherapy (e.g., radiation or malignant plexopathy, lumbar or cervical radiculopathy, preexisting peripheral neuropathy of another etiology: B12 deficiency, AIDS, monoclonal gammopathy, diabetes, heavy metal poisoning amyloidosis, syphilis, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, inherited neuropathy) Skin conditions such as open sores that would prevent proper application of the electrodes Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigators might compromise the objectives of the study</criteria>
