	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to develop non-invasive MRI, and MRS approaches that will quantify the plaque composition and lipid content of plaques and will have the potential for repeated in vivo measurements. Simultaneously this study aims to develop US plaque imaging as a screening tool to select plaque phenotypes of interest for clinical trials (a large LRNC). For plaque composition imaging by MRI the researchers aim to increase scan resolution and decrease scan time. For quantifying plaque lipid content the researchers aim to develop an MRS protocol. Subsequently, the researchers intend to study the reproducibility of plaque composition and lipid content measurements by MRI, MRS and Ultrasound in subjects that have carotid artery plaques.</brief_summary>
