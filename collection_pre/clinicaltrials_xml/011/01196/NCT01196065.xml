	<brief_summary>This open-label, fixed sequence, two-period study will assess the effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of RO5313534 and the effect of RO5313534 on safety and tolerability of steady-state memantine. Healthy volunteers will receive a single oral dose of RO5313534 on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 (3 days). After a washout period of 5-21 days, oral memantine will be administered on Days 1-21 of Treatment Period 2 and a single dose of RO5313534 on Day 19. There will be a follow-up of 3-4 weeks after the last dose. Anticipated time on study for each volunteer is up to 14 weeks.</brief_summary>
