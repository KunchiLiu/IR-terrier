	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized study is to evaluate new generation of MicroPort's DES of its safety, efficacy and delivery system in treating CAD. The end point is to observe in-stent late lumen loss after 9 months of the stent implantation. The second end point is to study in-stent percent diameter stenosis. This study is based on non-inferior assumption (vs. Xience V DES), requiring both end points reach statistical significance. Prespecified OCT follow-up is planned at 3-Year after index PCI at 3 chosen hospitals.</brief_summary>
