	<brief_summary>Patients of cirrhosis will be enrolled who have large esophageal varices, which have never bled. After successful screening baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) will be measured. Tablet carvedilol 3.125 mg BD for 1 week will be started. It will be increased to 6.25 mg BD and continued for next 7 weeks. After completion of 8 weeks the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) will again be measured to find out responders (hepatic venous pressure gradient â‰¥20% reduction from baseline or absolute value of hepatic venous pressure gradient &lt;12 mm Hg) and non responders (hepatic venous pressure gradient &lt;20% reduction).The responders will be excluded from the study while the non responders will be randomize into carvedilol+VSL#3 versus Endoscopic Variceal Ligation.</brief_summary>
