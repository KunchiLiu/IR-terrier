	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the decrease of inflammation of adipose tissue in obese and non-obese patients having a sleep apnea syndrome and treated or not by continuous positive airway pressure (cPAP). An interim analysis will be performed when 40 patients will be included.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammation of adipose tissue will be evaluated by RT-PCR on mRNA of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, RANTES, TNFa, leptin, adiponectin, CD68).</detailed_description>
