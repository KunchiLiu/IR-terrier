	<criteria>Histologically/cytologically confirmed breast cancer Metastatic breast cancer, having at least one target lesion according to the RECIST criteria. Bone metastases, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic spread or cystic lesions are not acceptable as target lesions. Target lesions must be ≥ 10 mm longest diameter measured in one dimension using spiral CT, or ≥ 20 mm longest diameter measured in one dimension using conventional techniques. In addition to the definitions pertaining to the target lesion(s) from the RECIST criteria above, the target lesion(s) must not have been previously irradiated (newly arising lesions in previously irradiated areas are acceptable).
