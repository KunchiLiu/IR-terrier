	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequent airway disease characterized by both bronchial inflammation and remodelling. Bronchial mucosa is infiltrated by macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. In addition, the number of eosinophils can be also increased during exacerbation. Airway remodelling is an abnormal tissue repair following bronchial inflammation, which contributes to none reversible pathological features, such as bronchial and peri-bronchial fibrosis. It also influences the prognosis of COPD and its mechanisms remain largely unknown. The role of fibrocytes has been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of asthma, lung fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension. However, the recruitment of blood fibrocytes and their involvement in COPD airway remodelling remain unknown.</brief_summary>
