	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 when given together with cisplatin, vinblastine, and temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma. Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, vinblastine, and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of daily RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered orally daily in combination with CVT (starting dose: cisplatin 25 mg/m^2 intravenous [IV] daily x 3; vinblastine 1.2 mg/m^2 IV daily x 3, and temozolomide [TMZ] 150 mg/m^2 orally [PO] daily x 5) administered on an every 21 day schedule. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RO4929097 with CVT in patients with metastatic melanoma with correlative biomarkers for Notch pathway signaling and gamma secretase enzyme activity. (Phase Ib) III. Based on the MTD from the phase Ib study, to conduct a phase II trial and to determine the response rate and overall survival. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination of RO4929097 and temozolomide. (Phase Ib) II. To obtain tissue biopsy for correlative studies before the initiation of therapy and one week after treatment with RO4929097 and CVT. (Phase Ib and II) III. To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated at the phase II dose. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is phase I dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097, followed by a phase II study. Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and vinblastine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3, and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without progressive disease continue to receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and temozolomide as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) confirmed recurrent or metastatic melanoma All Patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt; 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt; 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patients may have had up to one prior systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, but cannot have previously been treated with cisplatin, vinblastine, temozolomide, dacarbazine, or a gammasecretase inhibitor; at least 3 weeks must have elapsed since the last dose of systemic therapy; for small molecule targeted therapy, at least 5 halflives must have elapsed; at least 6 weeks must have elapsed if the last regimen included carmustine (BCNU) or mitomycin C or an anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibody Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 1014 days and within 24 hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the 24hour period prior to the administration of RO4929097;
