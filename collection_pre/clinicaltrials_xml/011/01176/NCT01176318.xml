	<brief_summary>This is a parallel group, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-centre, randomised trial. 60 patients to be included who are adult patients admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Acute exacerbation of COPD will be defined as sustained worsening of the patient's condition with an increase in cough and one or more of dyspnoea, sputum volume or sputum purulence, necessitating a change in regular medication. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of standard care plus erdosteine in reducing hourly cough (24 hour cough recording using automated cough recorder) measured from baseline (Day 0) and at Day 5 of treatment, compared with standard care plus placebo.</brief_summary>
