	<detailed_description>Blood pressure was measured 10 weeks after starting treatment (visit 3). All patients who did not achieve the required blood pressure (&lt;140/90 mmHg) after 8 weeks of treatment at the maximum doses of study medication were given 5 mg of amlodipine in addition to the study medication in order to reach the required BP (&lt;140/90 mmHg). The patient's blood pressure was assessed at visit 4 (week 18) and if it was still not at the required level (&lt;140/90 mmHg), the dose of amlodipine was increased to 10 mg. Blood pressure was again assessed at visit 5 (week 26) and if the required values had not been reached (&lt;140/90 mmHg), a 12.5 mg dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was prescribed</detailed_description>
