	<brief_summary>The prevention of recurrent suicidal about people who have made a suicide attempt is a major strand in the prevention of suicide. It is estimated that 10-15 % of people who made a suicide attempt die by suicide. Recidivism rate of suicide increases even faster than the subject is close to the index suicide attempt. A one month recurrence rate is 5 %, 12-25 % at one year. Most people who made a suicide attempt receive ambulatory monitoring. On this population, there is a low adherence to care. The main objective of the study is to test the effectiveness of a prevention program of recurrent suicidal acts for people who made a suicide attempt. The secondary objectives of this study are the assessment of adherence to care; the identification of sub - populations benefiting most from this program; the evaluation of the possible generalization level of the program (eligibles persons rate) and its feasibility level.</brief_summary>
