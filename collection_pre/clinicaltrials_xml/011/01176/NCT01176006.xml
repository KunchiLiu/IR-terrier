	<brief_summary>Background: -DOCK8 deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system and can lead to severe recurrent infections and possible death from infections or certain types of cancers, including blood cancers. A stem cell transplant is a life-saving treatment for this condition. In this study we are evaluating the efficacy and safety of transplant from different donor sources for DOCK8 deficiency. The donors that we are using are matched siblings, matched unrelated donors, and half-matched donors, so called haploidentical related donors, such as as mothers or fathers or half-matched siblings. Objectives: -To determine whether transplant of bone marrow cells from different types of donors corrects DOCK8 deficiency. Eligibility: - Donors: Healthy individuals between 4 and 60 years of age who are matched with a recipient. - Recipient: Individuals between 5 and 40 years of age who have DOCK8 deficiency, have suffered one or more life-threatening infections, or have had certain viral related cancers of cancer and have a stem cell donor. Design: - All participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history. - DONORS: - Donors will donate bone marrow cells or blood stem cells. If donating blood stem cells, donors will receive injections of filgrastim to release stem cells into the blood. After 5 days of filgrastim injections, donors will have apheresis to donate stem cells and white blood cells that are present in the blood. - Donors who provide the stem cells through bone marrow donation will have their bone marrow cells harvested in the operating room. - RECIPIENTS: - Recipients receiving matched related or unrelated donors will receive 4 days of chemotherapy with busulfan and fludarabine to suppress their immune system and prepare them for the transplant. Donors receiving haploidentical related donors will receive two doses of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, 5 days of fludarabine, 3 days of busulfan, and one dose of radiation to suppress their immune system and prepare them for the transplant. - After the initial chemotherapy and radiation, recipients will receive the donated stem cells as a single infusion. Recipients may also receive white blood cells from their stem cell donor to encourage acceptance of the stem cells. - After the stem cell transplant, recipients will receive two days of a chemotherapy called cyclophosphamide on day's + 3 and + 4 followed by two drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate to prevent graft versus host disease where the donor cells attack the patient's body. All patients will remain in the hospital for approximately 1 month, and will be followed with regular visits for up to 3 years with periodic visits thereafter to evaluate the success of the transplant and any side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant of DOCK8 Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Mutations in the Dedicator of Cytokinesis-8 (DOCK8) gene are responsible for an immunodeficiency disease characterized by: severe cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections with bacterial organisms; extensive cutaneous viral infections with Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster, Molluscum contagiosum, and Human Papilloma Virus; a marked elevation in serum IgE levels and eosinophilia; homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) gene. Patients with DOCK8 deficiency die from severe infections, squamous cell carcinomas, or hematological malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents a potentially life-saving treatment for immunodeficiency diseases such as DOCK8 deficiency. In this study we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic HSCT for DOCK8 deficiency. We are particularly interested in determining whether allogeneic HSCT using different donor sources and conditioning regimens reverses the lethal disease phenotype in DOCK8 deficiency by reconstituting normal host defense. The development of lethal squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas arising from the immunodeficiency in DOCK8 deficiency supports therapeutic intervention before overt malignancy arises. Objectives - To determine whether allogeneic HSCT reconstitutes T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte cells and myeloid cells with normal donor cells at one year post-transplant and reverses the clinical phenotype of severe recurrent infections in patients with DOCK8 deficiency. - To determine the safety of this allogeneic transplant regimen in DOCK8 deficiency by assessing transplant related toxicity, the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, immune reconstitution, overall survival, and disease-free survival - To determine whether post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT/CY) results in a lower incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD compared to standard methotrexate and tacrolimus in 10/10 matched related and unrelated donor recipients. Eligibility Patients 5-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency who have suffered one or more life-threatening infections, or who have developed lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and have a 10/10 matched related donor, a 10/10 matched unrelated donor, a 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related donor. Design -DOCK8 deficiency patients with 10/10 matched related donors and unrelated donors will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, and -3, and busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV every day for 4 days on days -6, -5, -4, and -3. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen. Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0. Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 10/10 matched related and unrelated donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on days +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to approximately day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day +180. -DOCK8 deficiency patients with 9/10 matched related or 9/10 matched unrelated donors will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily for three days on-4, -3 and -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen. Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0. Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10 matched related or unrelated donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for two days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day+180. DOCK8 deficiency patients with a haploidentical related donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg IV once daily for 3 days on days -4, -3,and -2, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen. Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0. Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for two days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day+180.</detailed_description>

If the patient has radiological evidence of aortic, renal artery, or coronary artery vasculitis, a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;30% is acceptable. 5. Pulmonary Function Tests: FEV1 greater than or equal to 20% of expected value obtained within 28 days of enrollment. 6. Creatinine: Patients: less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl or creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 ml/min/1.73 m^2.

Written informed consent/assent obtained from patient/parent or legal guardian. 10. Disease status: Patients with malignancy are to be referred in remission for evaluation, except in the case of viral associated malignancies. Should a patient have progressive disease or a donor becomes unavailable after enrollment, the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologistoncologist for treatment. If this course of action is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study. If under either of these settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to transplant, then he/she must come off study. RecipientSubjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol. EXCLUSION CRITERIA RECIPIENT: 1. Patient age less than 5 years old or greater than 40 years old 2. HIV infection. 3. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For patients with a concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patients will require a hepatology consultation. The riskbenefit profile of transplant and hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient, and eligibility determined by the PI and the protocol chairperson 4. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent. 5. Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI). Except in the case of viral associated malignancies in which case the patient may benefit from the transplant to control the malignancy. 6. Pregnant or lactating. The effects on breastmilk are also unknown and may be harmful to the infant; therefore, women should not breast feed during the interval from study entry to one year posttransplant. 7. Sexually active individuals capable of becoming pregnant who are unable or unwilling to use effective form(s) of contraception during time enrolled on study and for 1 year posttransplant. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. Males on the protocol must use an effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year posttransplant. The effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used after transplant may be harmful to a fetus. 8. Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic system, except when driven by viruses in which case the immune reconstitution after transplant may control the malignancy. 9.

A donor who is lactating must be willing and able to interrupt breastfeeding or substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of filgrastim administration and for two days following the final dose. Filgrastim may be secreted in human milk, although its bioavailability from this source is not known. INCLUSION CRITERIA MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: 1. Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLAA, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing. 2. The evaluation of donors shall be in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and Procedures. General donor inclusion criteria specified in the NMDP Standards. INCLUSION CRITERIA HAPLOIDENTICAL RELATED DONOR: 1. A haploidentical donor that shares one haplotype in common with the recipient such that HLA compatibility will be a minimum of 5 out of 10 HLA loci matched. The HLA loci to be tested will be HLA A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. A minimum number of mismatches are desirable; however if several options are available the selection of a donor will be based on the loci where the mismatch occurs and the relative importance of its potential immunological function. Donorrecipient pairs will initially be typed molecularly to provide a low resolution typing (antigenlevel) to aid in the selection of the potential donor. Upon review of the familial inheritance pattern, a qualified HLA staff member will review haplotype inheritance. High resolution (allelelevel) typing will be performed. Final selection of a donor will be in consultation with NCI physicians and qualified HLA personnel. If more than one haploidentical related donor is available, we will evaluate each donor individually according to overall health, ABO matching, CMV, etc. to select the donor 2. Age 460 years and weight of greater than or equal to 15 kilograms. 3. At least one normal DOCK8 allele demonstrated by a CLIAcertified lab in a sibling donor. 4. No history of lifethreatening opportunistic infections 5. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central venous catheter for apheresis. 6. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to the recipient. 7. Haploidentical donors will undergo marrow harvest with general anesthesia. Subjects will undergo anesthesia consultation, and meet criteria for eligibility/enrollment. CD34+ fraction will be determined. 8. Subjects will also undergo the Donor Health History Screen to determine donor eligibility using standard DTM criteria in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic by skilled staff in the Blood Services Section for adult patients and ageappropriate questioning when indicated for pediatric subjects. 9. Adult related donors would be preferred over related donors who are minors. 10. Subjects will undergo followup evaluation within 1 week of donation. EXCLUSION CRITERIAMATCHED RELATED DONOR: 1.

The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient. 7. Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. 8.
