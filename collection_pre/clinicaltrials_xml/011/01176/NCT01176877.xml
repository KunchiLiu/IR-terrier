	<brief_title>Assessing and Improving Patient Knowledge About Keloid Scars (Keloids)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keloids scars differ from other scar types in that they grow beyond the borders of the injury that caused them. Patients with darker pigmented skin are more likely to develop keloids, and blacks are especially predisposed to keloid formation. Treatment options for keloids are limited in that new keloids often form at the treated location. The limited efficacy of professional treatment options and the harmless appearance of small keloid scars may lead a patient to try to manage their keloid scars on their own. One source of information that patients may turn to for self-treatment advice is the Internet.</detailed_description>
