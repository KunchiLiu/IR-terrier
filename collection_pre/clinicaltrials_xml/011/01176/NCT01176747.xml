	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the lung deposition and distribution pattern of Beclometasone and Formoterol using a gamma-scintigraphic technique after inhalation of a single dose of 99mTc-radiolabelled BDP/formoterol fixed combination administered Via the NEXT DPI in healthy volunteers, asthmatic and COPD patients. Additionally, the systemic exposures to formoterol, BDP and its monopropionate metabolite (B17MP) will be investigated.</brief_summary>
