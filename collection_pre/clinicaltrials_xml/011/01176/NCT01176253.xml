	<brief_summary>To investigate the use of methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays to detect human beta cell-specific gene methylation patterns in serial blood samples drawn from newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Human Beta Cell Death in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) by Methylation Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will follow 25 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients from the onset of symptoms to one year post-diagnosis. A total of 11 fasting blood draws will be taken, the first near the time of diabetes diagnosis, then 2 weeks later, monthly for the next 6 months, and every other month until 12 months. Each blood sample will be evaluated by the MSP assay, as well as for measurement of fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, c-peptide, and autoantibodies. The study will also need 25 healthy volunteers to help us match some DNA markers needed for this data. Healthy volunteers will be se=matched healthy individuals who have one blood sample drawn.</detailed_description>
