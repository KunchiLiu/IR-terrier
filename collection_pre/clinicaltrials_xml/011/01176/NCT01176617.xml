	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if continuous monitoring using an implantable loop recorder (ie. a device that is placed just underneath the skin of the chest and monitors the heart rate and rhythm) for a year long period after atrial fibrillation ablation may be superior to the current conventional monitoring strategy used by us for determination of atrial fibrillation recurrence (ie. return of the abnormal heart rhythm) and/or arrythmia burden (ie. how long the abnormal rhythm continues or how often the rhythm occurs). Some data suggests that continuous monitoring over longer periods may be better in identifying recurrence of atrial fibrillation after ablation and thus assist in its overall management. The device being used for this study is the Reveal XT, which, is currently FDA approved for monitoring all varieties of cardiac rhythm disorders including atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
