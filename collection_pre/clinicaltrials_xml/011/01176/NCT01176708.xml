	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the significance of intact nerve supply to the liver for the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) induced insulin secretion. The hypothesis is that the effects of GLP-1 is transmitted through the GLP-1 receptor and that these effects involve sensory afferent neurons, probably primarily parasympathetic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intact Liver Innervation and Glucose and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Induced Insulin Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GLP-1 is a potent enterogastron and incretin hormone. It is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV so only 10-15% enters the systemic circulation. This has led to the hypothesis that GLP-1 interact locally with afferent sensory nerve fibers. The aim of this study is to investigate the significance of intact liver innervation for the GLP-1 induced insulin secretion in liver transplanted patients; kidney transplanted control patients matched for immunosuppressive treatment, age, gender and body weight; and ten control persons matched for age, gender and body weight. The insulin secretion will be evaluated from blood samples that will be analyzed for insulin and c-peptide.</detailed_description>
