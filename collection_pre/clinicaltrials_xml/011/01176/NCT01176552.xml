	<brief_summary>This prospective study assesses toxicity and potential efficacy of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN) alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2) postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor, Interferon and Interleukin-2 as Adjuvant Treatment for Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with high-risk RCC have a dismal prognosis. To date, no effective adjuvant therapy exists for this patients category. We suggest that combination of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon alpha (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulate immune system from dendritic cells till cytotoxic T-lymphocytes step by step and eliminate residuary tumor cells. This prospective, non-randomized, phase II trial assessed low-dose GM-CSF, IFN and IL-2 postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
