	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may lessen side effects caused by palliative radiation therapy and improve the quality of life of patients with lung cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy works in reducing the side effects of palliative radiation in patients with lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that using technically sophisticated 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for the palliative treatment of lung cancer patients will result in equivalent degrees of symptom relief and a reduction in the primary endpoint of oesophagitis. Single arm therapeutic clinical study. RT Treatment Regimens: 17 Gy/2 fractions or 20Gy/5 fractions or 39Gy/13 fractions Primary Endpoint: -The occurrence of Grade 3 or higher oesophagitis in the interval between start and 1-month post completion of treatment as determined by CTCAE Version 4.02 Patients will be assessed pre treatment, during treatment, 2 weeks post completion of treatment, one month post completion of treatment, three months post completion of treatment, and three monthly thereafter -All patients who complete treatment (and whose on-treatment toxicity is documented) will be evaluable. Secondary Endpoint: - Quality of Life Assessment. All patients will be required to complete the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL (Version 1) and the Lung Specific Module (LC 13) - The occurrence of other AEs Safety Endpoint: -Radio-induced oesophagitis, acute and long term, using the CTCAE Version 4.02.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Karnofsky Performance Status of &gt; or equal to 40% Patients with locally advanced or metastatic small cell or nonsmall cell lung cancer The presence of intrathoracic symptoms requiring palliative treatment WBI (if required) is permitted The patient's condition must permit waiting for the 3dimensional design process to be implemented. This will be at the discretion of the Consultant Physician Patients presenting with pleural effusions provided the pleural effusion does not prevent the reasonably accurate delineation of the target volume Intrathoracic disease requiring palliation must be clearly evident on a diagnostic CT scan Life expectancy of at least 3 months (assessed by clinician) Provision of written informed consent in line with ICHGCP guidelines In the opinion of the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systematic disease (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal disease)</criteria>
