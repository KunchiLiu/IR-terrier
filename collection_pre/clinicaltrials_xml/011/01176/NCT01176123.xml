	<brief_summary>Understanding the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for trauma-related insomnia (CBT-I) is important because sleep difficulties often persist after traditional post-trauma treatments are completed and other trauma-related symptoms have resolved. The objective of this study is to examine whether CBT-I will equivocally reduce problems falling and staying asleep (insomnia) related to military-related PTSD when administered in person versus through telephone therapy to veterans living in rural areas. Rural populations are at a disadvantage in receiving treatment because of lack of access to healthcare services. Telemedicine uses technology (e.g., telephones) to provide distance counseling to the populations who lack access to health care. Thus, telephone-counseling strategies could provide broad access to interventions for management of trauma-related insomnia. Veterans who live more than 30 miles from Veterans Affairs (VA) PTSD specialty services will be offered participation in this study. All veterans receive 6 weeks of individual CBT-I for trauma-related insomnia. Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: (1) CBT-I in person or (2) CBT-I via telemedicine (defined as receiving treatment by telephone). No changes will be made to the CBT-I, other than mode of delivery, for the telemedicine group. Through this study the investigators hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of CBT-I for trauma-related insomnia can be delivered effectively to rural veterans in person and via telemedicine.</brief_summary>
