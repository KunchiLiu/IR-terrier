	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of immune and inflammatory markers among HIV-1, HSV-2 co-infected adults achieving plasma HIV RNA suppression to &lt;50 copies/mL, between those randomized to valacyclovir and placebo, over a twelve-week intervention period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Valacyclovir Attenuate Inflammation in Antiretroviral-Treated HIV-Infected Individuals With Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced HIV-1 infection (herein referred to as 'HIV') related morbidity and mortality, transforming an invariably fatal disease into a manageable, chronic condition. Yet even HAART-treated HIV infection is characterized by chronic systemic inflammation and immune activation. This systemic inflammatory response is composed of multiple components, and can be quantified by measuring markers of immune activation, inflammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants, endothelial activation markers, and markers of microbial translocation. This inflammation is clinically relevant, as it may contribute directly to HIV disease progression and non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Because this inflammation persists even in the context of suppressive HAART, albeit at modestly decreased levels, adjunctive therapeutic strategies to attenuate this persistent inflammatory response are therefore needed. Herpes simplex virus type 2 is a common, clinically important co-infection seen in individuals living with HIV infection, and may contribute to this ongoing inflammation. This pilot trial will investigate whether short-term valacyclovir for HSV-2 suppression can decrease systemic inflammation in HAART-treated, HIV-1, HSV-2 co-infected individuals.</detailed_description>
