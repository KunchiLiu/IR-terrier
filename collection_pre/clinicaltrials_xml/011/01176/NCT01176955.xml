	<brief_summary>This is an investigator-blinded, prospective study of 20 subjects aged 13 through 18 with mild to moderate acne. Study subjects will be randomized to an internet survey group, in which an email link for a survey ascertaining the status of the subject's acne is sent weekly, or to a control group. All study subjects will use benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, and adherence and clinical improvement will be monitored over 12 weeks. The investigators hypothesis is that subjects in the internet survey group will have improved adherence to the study medication and clinical outcomes, because the weekly survey will remind subjects to use their medication.</brief_summary>
