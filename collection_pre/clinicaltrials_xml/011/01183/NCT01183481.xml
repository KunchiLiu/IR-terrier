	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the efficacy of Aprepitant given in combination with Granisetron for the prevention of delayed-phase RINV in 84 patients receiving a single 8Gy of moderately emetogenic palliative RT in the RRRP at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre for painful bony metastases from any primary solid tumor. Patients will be given a single dose of Granisetron 2 mg orally and Aprepitant 125 mg on Day 0 (at least one hour before on the day of RT) followed by 80 mg of Aprepitant once daily in the mornings on Days 1 and 2 following the radiation treatment.. Secondary objectives include determining the complete RINV prophylaxis rate (acute and delayed phases), the partial emesis control rate, the safety of the combined regime, QOL issues, the time to the first emetic event and the time to the first use of rescue medication .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with bone metastases from any primary solid tumor site scheduled to receive a single 8 Gy fraction of palliative radiotherapy considered to be moderately emetogenic (an area of at least 80 cm2 in the anterior/posterior direction and located between the level of upper border of T11 and the lower border of L3) in the RRRP at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre will be considered eligible.
