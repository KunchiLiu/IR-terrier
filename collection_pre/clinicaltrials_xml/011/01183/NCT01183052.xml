	<brief_title>Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Training protocol used is based on recommendations (Nici et al., 2006) and was previously used in our group (Varray et al., 1991; Vallet et al., 1997). A minimum of 20 sessions in 4-6 weeks were proposed. The exercise intensity of exercise corresponds to target heart rate at ventilatory threshold measured during incremental exercise test. Training at this intensity allowed us to individualize effort for each patient.</detailed_description>
