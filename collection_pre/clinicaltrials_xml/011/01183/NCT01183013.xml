	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate superior glycaemic control (HbA1c reduction) after 30 weeks of linagliptin/pioglitazone (5/15, 5/30 and 5/45 mg) versus the respective individual monotherapies of pioglitazone (15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg, administered orally once daily), and linagliptin (5 mg, administered orally once daily). In addition, durability of treatment effect and safety under chronic treatment conditions will be investigated.</brief_summary>
