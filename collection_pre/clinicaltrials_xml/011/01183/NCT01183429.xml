	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of 3F8 and GM-CSF has on the patient and the cancer. Antibodies are made by the body to attack tumors and to fight infections. 3F8 is the name of one kind of antibody. It is made by mice, and it can attack neuroblastoma in people. 3F8 has been used safely in many patients, and it has killed cancer cells in some patients. One way it can kill cancer cells is by causing the patient's own white blood cells to attack the cancer. Granulocytes are one kind of white blood cell. GM-CSF increases the number of granulocytes in people, and it makes the granulocytes better able to kill the cancer cells.</brief_summary>
