	<brief_title>Corneal Biomechanics With Hydration in Normal and LASIK Eyes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research will utilize LASIK and non-LASIK populations to analyze the biomechanical differences between these corneas. Subjects' corneas will be swelled with warmed, humidified nitrogen using modified diving goggles to assess structural changes due to a two hour swelling period. Subjects will be examined prior to swelling by a registered ophthalmologist to ensure that the cornea is healthy enough to undergo the swelling procedure. Pre-swelling and post-swelling data will be compared for parameters such as elasticity, density, thickness, axial and tangential curvature, hydration, and intraocular pressure in the central, paracentral, and peripheral regions. Analysis of pre-swelling and post-swelling data will allow for a better understanding of the structural changes created by LASIK. In addition, this project will allow for a better understanding of how common fluctuations in hydration levels affect normal corneal parameters as given by common devices in both populations to allow for corrections for more accurate measurements.</detailed_description>
