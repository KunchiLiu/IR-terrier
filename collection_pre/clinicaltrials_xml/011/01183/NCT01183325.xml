	<brief_summary>For small (2-3cm) ventral and umbilical hernias the discussion for primary suture repair or the use of mesh continues. About 5 years ago the Ventralex patch was introduced, which combines a layer of PTFE mesh with a small polypropylene mesh and includes a circular memory ring. Despite the elegance of using this patch, recent experience showed several drawbacks both in design and efficacy (3). With the recent development of the Proceed Ventral Patch (PVP), new elements have been introduced to overcome some of these issues. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of clinical placement of the PVP in the intra-abdominal position in the treatment of small ventral hernias.</brief_summary>
