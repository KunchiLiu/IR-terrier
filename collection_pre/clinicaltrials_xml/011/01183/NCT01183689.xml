	<brief_summary>The Study of Novel Approaches for Prevention (SNAP) is randomized trial designed to test whether behavioral interventions based on self-regulation can prevent weight gain in young adults (18-35 years; body mass index (BMI) 21-30 kg/m2). Two different self-regulation interventions for weight gain prevention will be compared in this trial; one intervention will focus on making small, consistent, changes in eating and exercise behavior to prevent weight gain or reverse weight gain if it occurs, whereas the other will emphasize larger changes in eating and exercise that occur periodically, with a goal of producing weight loss and thereby providing a buffer against anticipated weight gains. The primary aim of the trial is to test whether the magnitude of weight gain from baseline across an average three-year follow-up differs across the three groups, with the hypotheses that weight gain will be greater in the Control group than in either intervention and greater in the Small Changes than Large Changes group. SNAP-E (Extension) will determine whether the effects of the intervention can be maintained over an additional 3 years (i.e. through a total of 6 years).</brief_summary>

Hospitalization for depression or other psychiatric disorder within the past 12 months. 11. Having lost and maintained a weight loss of 10 pounds or more within the past 6 months or are currently participating in a weight loss program, trying to gain weight, using steroids for muscle mass or weight gain, taking weight loss medication, or have had surgery for weight loss. 12. Participation in another weight loss or physical activity study that would interfere with this study. 13. Another member of the household (or roommate) is a participant or staff member on this trial. 14. Reason to suspect that the participant would not adhere to the study intervention or assessment schedule (i.e., can't come to group on a regular basis; will be away for more than two weeks during initial intervention phase or planning to move from the area within next year). 15.
