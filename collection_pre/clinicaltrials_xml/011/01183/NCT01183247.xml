	<brief_summary>An open, single center, randomised study to investigate three different immunosuppressive regimens for de novo renal transplant recipients: 1. st sirolimus / EC-MPS / tacrolimus regimen - After 3 months a protocol biopsy is performed. If no rejection is detected the calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus) is withdrawn. 2. nd everolimus / EC-MPS / tacrolimus regimen - After 3 months a protocol biopsy is performed. If no rejection is detected the calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus) is withdrawn. 3. rd tacrolimus / EC-MPS / prednisone regimen - After 3 months a protocol biopsy is performed. If no rejection is detected prednisone is withdrawn.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open, Single Centre, Randomised, Parallel Group Study to Investigate Three Different Immunosuppressive Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to show similar efficacy but a different adverse event profile between the three regimens. Its main purpose is to provide more information, if steroid free immunosuppressive treatment is a valuable alternative in the treatment of de novo kidney transplant recipients and that it is possible to withdraw calcineurin inhibitors after 3 months in this steroid free protocol. A secondary rationale of the study is to compare sirolimus with everolimus directly to better differentiate these two mTOR-inhibitors in terms of compound-specific effects and class-effects. This should allow for early conclusions on the usage of these two mTOR-inhibitors in CNI-free regimens. Basis for this study are the following hypotheses regarding the first 6 months of treatment following kidney transplantation: - Similar graft function in the three treatment groups after 6 months - No difference in graft and patient survival in the three groups - No differences in incidence of first, total number, type of acute rejections, and number of anti-rejection treatments in the three groups - No differences in number of patients successfully withdrawn from calcineurin inhibitor in the sirolimus and everolimus arm, respectively - A different adverse event profile with regard to the incidence of dyslipidemias, impaired fasting glucose, new onset diabetes mellitus, de novo post-transplant insulin dependency, histological signs of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and tubulointerstitial nephrotoxicity in the three groups. In addition to this the incidence of mTOR-inhibitor specific adverse events will be analysed. These hypotheses are the basis for the study objectives.</detailed_description>
