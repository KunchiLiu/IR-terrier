	<brief_summary>Women's evermore presence in professional and athletic sports has revealed sound evidence on the existence of female athlete triad among the world's elite female athletes. This triad consists of eating disorders, amenorrhea and osteoporosis. It has been stated that all female athletes are potentially at risk, but it is not clear to what extent those exercising at different levels are at risk of this syndrome/triad. Since the manifestation of this triad is often denied, or under-reported, appropriate screening methods are required to identify the symptoms. There is still no clear-cut information available on the incidence of this triad in Iran. And there are religious and cultural differences between Iran's elite female athletes and those in other countries. Therefore, in order to meet Iranian female athletes' needs, the investigators decided to determine the frequency of the female athlete triad in Iran.</brief_summary>
