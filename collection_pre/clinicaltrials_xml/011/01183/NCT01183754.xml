	<brief_summary>1. To evaluate the role of VerifyNow test as prognostic marker in routine clinical practice using drug-eluting stents. 2. To determine the add-on-effect of VerifyNow test beyond on conventional risk factors (clinical, lesions, or procedural factors). 3. To compare the prognostic utility of VerifyNow test with several biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of a Point-of-Care Platelet Function Assay for the Prediction of Atherothrombotic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Predictive role of a point-of-care assay (VerifyNow test) has not been well evaluated in large number of patients receiving drug-eluting stents as a routine practice. In addition, additional predictive effect of a point-of-care assay, as compared to conventional clinical factors or other biomarkers, might be clinically interesting and important.</detailed_description>
