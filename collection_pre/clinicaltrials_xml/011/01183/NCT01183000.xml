	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine the effect of non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during Cesarean section on the formation of adhesions. Study design: A prospective randomized trial of 533 women undergoing primary Cesarean section; 256 were randomized to non closure and 277 to closure of the peritoneum. At a subsequent cesarean,he presence of adhesions and their severity was evaluated at several sites: between the layers of the abdominal wall, between the bladder and the abdominal wall, between bladder and uterus, between the uterus and the abdominal wall, and between the bowels and the pelvic organs. A cumulative adhesion score was calculated.</brief_summary>
