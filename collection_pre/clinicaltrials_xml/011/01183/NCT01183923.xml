	<brief_summary>Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate that is a potent inducer of Phase II enzymes which play a critical role in preventing oxidative stress (via activation of Nrf2). Broccoli sprouts (BS) contain the richest source of SFN. The main objectives of this study are to test the effect of broccoli sprouts (BS) on biomarkers of oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, basophil activation, and clinical outcomes in mouse allergen-induced asthma by (1) determining if BS improves lung function and airways symptom responses in mouse-sensitized adults with asthma undergoing environmental mouse allergen challenge (EMAC), (2) examining the effect of BS on OS, inflammation, and basophil activation, and (3) examining the effect of BS on changes in OS, inflammation, and basophil activation after EMAC.</brief_summary>
