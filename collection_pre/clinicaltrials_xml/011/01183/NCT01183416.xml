	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if high-dose 3F8 combined with GM-CSF is better than standard dose 3F8 in treating neuroblastoma. Another purpose of the study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, 3F8 has on cancer. The investigators also want to see if the antibody works against a very small amount of neuroblastoma (minimal residual disease) that is left in the bone marrow.</brief_summary>
