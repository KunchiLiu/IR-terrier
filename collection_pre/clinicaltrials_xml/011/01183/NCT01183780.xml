	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer, excluding primary tumors of appendiceal origin (participants are eligible to enroll irrespective of KRAS mutation status) Confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer (Stage IV) The participant has received firstline combination therapy of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine for metastatic disease and, a) Experienced radiographic disease progression during firstline therapy, or b) Experienced radiographic disease progression ≤6 months after the last dose of firstline therapy, or c) Discontinued part or all of firstline therapy due to toxicity and experienced radiographic disease progression ≤6 months after the last dose of firstline therapy. Note that a participant must have received a minimum of 2 doses of bevacizumab as part of a firstline regimen containing chemotherapy; in addition, a participant must have received at least 1 cycle of firstline therapy that included bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine in the same cycle. Note that a participant must not have received more than 2 different fluoropyrimidines as part of a firstline regimen; disease progression is not an acceptable reason for discontinuing 1 fluoropyrimidine and starting a second fluoropyrimidine Receipt of no more than 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens in any setting (only 1 prior regimen for metastatic disease is permitted). For participants with rectal cancer, sequential neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy will count as a single systemic regimen. Note that rechallenge with oxaliplatin is permitted and will be considered part of the firstline regimen for metastatic disease, both initial oxaliplatin treatment and subsequent rechallenge are considered as 1 regimen Measurable or nonmeasurable disease based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function Adequate coagulation function [International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5 and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) or activated PTT (aPTT) ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)). Participants on fulldose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of anticoagulant therapy and if on oral anticoagulation, must have an INR ≤3 and have no clinically significant active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding Consent to provide a historical colorectal cancer tissue sample for assessment of biomarkers and the tumor tissue sample is available Ability to provide signed informed consent Receipt of bevacizumab ≤28 days prior to randomization Receipt of any investigational therapy for nononcology clinical indication ≤28 days prior to randomization Receipt of any previous systemic therapy, other than a combination of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine, for firstline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer Known leptomeningeal disease or brain metastases or uncontrolled spinal cord compression (currently or in the past) Experience of any arterial thrombotic or arterial thromboembolic events, including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or cerebrovascular accident, ≤12 months prior to randomization Pregnant (confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (ß HCG) test ≤7 days prior to randomization) or lactating History of inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease requiring medical intervention (immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications or surgery) ≤12 months prior to randomization Acute or subacute bowel obstruction or history of chronic diarrhea which is considered clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator Grade 3 or higher bleeding event ≤3 months prior to randomization Experience of any of the following during firstline therapy with a bevacizumabcontaining regimen: an arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic event, Grade 4 hypertension, Grade 3 proteinuria, a Grade 34 bleeding event, or bowel perforation Known history or clinical evidence of Gilbert's Syndrome, or is known to have any of the following genotypes: UGT1A1*6/*6, UGT1A1*28/*28, or UGT1A1*6/*28 Known allergy to any of the study treatment components, including any components used in the preparation of ramucirumab, or other contraindication to receive the study treatments Cirrhosis at a level of ChildPugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinical meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis; Clinically meaningful ascites is defined as ascites resulting from cirrhosis and requiring ongoing treatment with diuretics and/or paracentesis</criteria>
