	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying at biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with stage I or stage III endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients With Stage I or Stage III Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify microRNA expression patterns associated with lymph node metastasis in samples from patients with endometrial cancer. OUTLINE: Banked tumor tissue specimens are analyzed for microRNA expression profiling by microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR assays.</detailed_description>
