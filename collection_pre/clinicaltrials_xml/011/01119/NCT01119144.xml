	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Polycaprolactone / Tricalcium Phosphate Orbital (PCL / TCP) Implant is as effective in the reconstruction of the Orbital walls as Titanium Mesh implant. In this study we will be conducting a randomised trial to compare implants made of 2 materials for Orbital reconstruction - Polycaprolactone / Tricalcium Phosphate (PCL / TCP) - Titanium Patients to be recruited : - 80 randomised equally into the 2 groups - age range: 21 - 70 - includes orbital wall defects from trauma, after osteotomies - excludes patients with Diabetes Mellitus, known allergies to polycaprolactone &amp; its analogues, know allergies to Tricalcium Phosphate &amp; its analogues, infections generalised &amp; around the orbital region Trial Duration: April 2010 - March 2015 Follow up: - postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months - Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of Orbits immediate postoperative and at 12 months appointment</brief_summary>
