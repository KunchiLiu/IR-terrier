	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is the examine the effects of gentle movements applied to the ankle joint and stretching on self-reported function, ankle motion and stiffness in individuals who have suffered from an ankle sprain within the last year and have decreased ankle motion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Gentle Movements at the Ankle in Individuals With Diminished Range of Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is the examine the effects of a grade IV anterior to posterior joint mobilization and stretching on self-reported function, dorsiflexion range of motion, talar glide and stiffness in individuals who have suffered from an ankle sprain within the last year and have a 5° dorsiflexion range of motion deficit. We will quantify range of motion with standard goniometric measures, stiffness with the use of an instrumented ankle arthrometer, talar glide with the use of the posterior talar glide test and self-reported function using the foot and ankle ability measure (FAAM) and FAAM-sport.</detailed_description>
