	<brief_summary>This randomized, blinded, parallel arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (RoActemra/Actemra) versus adalimumab as monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are intolerant of methotrexate or where continued treatment with methotrexate was considered inappropriate. Patients were randomized to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously (iv) every 4 weeks plus placebo subcutaneously (sc) every 2 weeks, or adalimumab 40 mg sc every 2 weeks plus placebo iv every 4 weeks. Treatment was anticipated to last 24 weeks. With regard to the blind, the study nurse was unblinded due to the nature of the treatment administration, but the investigator and the patient remained blinded.</brief_summary>
