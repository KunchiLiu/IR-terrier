	<brief_summary>Light is the primary means by which the internal circadian clock remains aligned ("entrained") with the external world. Misalignment of this internal clock can occur during situations such as shift work and jet travel across multiple time zones (jet lag). The purpose of this study is to examine the parameters of light and how they affect entrainment of the clock.</brief_summary>
