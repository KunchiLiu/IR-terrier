	<brief_summary>This research trial studies the genes biomarkers in children with neuroblastoma. Studying the genes in a child's cancer cells may help doctors improve ways to diagnose and treat children with neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Biomarkers in Children With Neuroblastoma (Also Known as Neuroblastoma Epidemiology in North America [NENA])</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Case-only Time Perspective: Prospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Saliva and Tissue Study Population Description: Patients already registered in ACCRN07 Sampling Method: Probability Sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the independent association of common genetic polymorphisms involved in folate, vitamin A, and related metabolic and transport pathways and the risk of neuroblastoma (NB). II. Evaluate the joint effects of multiple genes on the risk of NB. III. Evaluate the effects of gene-exposure interactions on the risk of NB. IV. Evaluate genetic effects within NB subgroups defined by age at diagnosis and a Children's Oncology group classification schema based on age, MYCN oncogene status, histology, and DNA ploidy. V. Recontact mothers of participating NENA case children, conduct brief web-based screen to ascertain whether the pregnancy including the index NENA child was a multiple (twin, triplet, etc), whether the mother knew if the children were MZ or DZ, and obtain a complete pregnancy history. VI. Request a saliva sample from the other twin/multiple sibling of the NENA child. VII. Extract DNA from saliva samples and securely store. VIII. Clean new survey data and merge with main NENA study database. OUTLINE: The biologic mother of the patient is asked to complete a Diet History Questionnaire about diet during pregnancy, and information on demographics, lifestyle factors, medication used during pregnancy, history of breast feeding, and family history of cancer or birth defects. Parents are given ORAgene saliva collection kits for self-collection. Saliva bio-specimen samples are collected from both biologic parents and the patient. Tissue samples previously stored in a tissue bank are obtained for deceased patients, if available. DNA is extracted from samples, amplified and analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantitation assay, and genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphisms.</detailed_description>
