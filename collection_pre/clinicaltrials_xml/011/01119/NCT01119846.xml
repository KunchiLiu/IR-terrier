	<brief_title>A Study in Type 2 Diabetics of Single and Multiple Doses of Orally Administered GSK1292263 to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data from this study will be used to assess the potential of GSK1292263 as a treatment for T2DM, and will aid the design and dose selection of future studies of longer duration in T2DM subjects that will evaluate GSK1292263 alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs.</detailed_description>

A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential, defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

Except as noted elsewhere, subjects should have no significant known medical conditions other than T2DM, as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECGs. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters that meets exclusion criteria but is outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level &lt;= 220mg/dL at the Screening visit FPG level &lt;= 250mg/dL on Day 1 HbA1c between 7 and 11%, inclusive, at Screening visit Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities: Positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C, result within 3 months of screening. Positive test for HIV antibody. History of uncorrected thyroid dysfunction or an abnormal thyroid function test assessed by TSH at Screening. (NOTE: subjects with hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement therapy for at least 3 months prior to Screening and who have a screening thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within the normal range may participate.) ALT and/or AST &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal at screening. Fasting triglycerides &gt; 450mg/dL at screening. Total Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening. For females a haemoglobin &lt; 11.5 g/dL, and for males a hemoglobin &lt; 12.5 g/dL. Hemoglobin &lt; 11g/dL(A female subject with haemoglobin between 10g/dL and 11.5 g/dL, or a male subject with haemoglobin between 10g/dL and 12.5 g/dLmay be enrolled only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk to the subject and will not interfere with the study procedures). A positive prestudy drug/urine screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. A prestudy urine cotinine screen indicating use of tobacco/ nicotine containing products.
