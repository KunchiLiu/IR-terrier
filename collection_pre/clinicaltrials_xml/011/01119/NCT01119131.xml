	<brief_title>Effects of Vitamin D in Parkinson's Disease (PD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled intervention trial to measure the effects of vitamin D at (10,000IU/day) versus placebo on balance and falls in Parkinson's disease. The investigators will measure static, dynamic, and ambulatory balance, as well as strength, falls, and cognition before and after 16 weeks of therapy. Dynamic posturography will be used to measure static and ambulatory balance, a device called iMOBILITY will measure a timed up and go, and strength will be measured with the Biodex machine checking knee flexion and extension. Multiple quality of life and cognitive tests will also be performed.</detailed_description>
