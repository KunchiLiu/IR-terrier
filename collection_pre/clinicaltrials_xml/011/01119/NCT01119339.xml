No more than 3 points difference in total score (= sum of scores for scaling, erythema and induration; Range 012) of the chosen comparable psoriasis plaques 4. Enough psoriatic surface area to define 8 clearly distinguishable (minimum distance between test areas: 1cm) test areas of at least 1 cmÂ² plaque size Patient is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the clinical study protocol. In particular, patient must adhere to concomitant therapy prohibitions of the test areas and must agree to avoid intense UV exposure of the test areas during the study Written informed consent to participate in the study, prior to any study related procedures, indicating an understanding of the purpose of the study A patient of childbearing potential agrees to use one of the following contraceptive methods for the duration of the study: 1.

Intrauterine device (IUD) inserted for at least 1 month prior to study entrance Too few body surface area covered with psoriasis plaques that meet the specified inclusion criteria to be defined as 8 clearly distinguishable test areas Any condition that may interfere with the study assessments or sonographic measurements of the skin and/or may have an influence on skin immune response (incl. open wounds) Known adverse reactions of any severity or hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the test products No willingness to avoid induction of heavy sweating, e.g. due to sauna visits, excessive sports activities during the study course No willingness to avoid swimming, bathing or wetting of the designated test areas between visits Pregnant or breastfeeding women A medical condition that may put the patient at a general risk and therefore would prevent participation in the clinical trial (including but not limited to: serious infectious diseases, major surgery within the last 4 weeks, coronary artery disease, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, uncontrolled metabolic diseases, disorders of the calcium metabolism, autoimmune diseases) History or presence of malignant disease (other than surgically removed basal cell carcinoma) and/or auto immune diseases Current diagnosis of guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis Patients who did not respect the following washout periods prior or during the study</criteria>
