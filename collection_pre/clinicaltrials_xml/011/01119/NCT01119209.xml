	<brief_summary>Reducing pain is an essential factor for early mobilization after osteosynthesis of intertrochanteric fractures. Systemic opioids have side effects that might obstruct mobilization and induce delirium and nausea. The investigators hypothesized that wound infiltration results in reduction in systemic opioid usage and pain relief without side effects.</brief_summary>
