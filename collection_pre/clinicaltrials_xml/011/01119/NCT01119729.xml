	<brief_summary>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Even most industrialised countries exhibit a growing and aging population of HIV-infected patients in the majority treated with antiretroviral drugs, the investigators still do not know much about the impact of cardiovascular diseases in this group of patients. The present study is an ongoing trial that was conducted as a prospective and multicentre survey, being schemed to analyse the frequency and clinical course of cardiac disorders in HIV-infected patients.</brief_summary>
