	<brief_title>Small Particle Steroids in Refractory Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have identified a group of patients with refractory asthma who have ongoing eosinophilic airway inflammation despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Traditional inhaled steroids have a relatively proximal airway distribution which may lead to inadequate treatment of the distal airways. We aim to demonstrate that a steroid inhaler with a smaller particle size which targets the distal airways can be a useful additional treatment option in this group of patients.</detailed_description>
