	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that two investigational treatment regimens have the potential to result in a superior visual acuity improvement as compared to a ranibizumab pro re nata (PRN=as needed) treatment regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (according to American Diabetes Association or World Health Organization [WHO] guidelines) with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤ 12.0% at screening (Visit 1). Patients should be on diet, exercise, and/or pharmacological treatment for diabetes. Treatment for diabetes must have been stable for at least 3 month. Ocular Patients with visual impairment due to DME in at least one eye who are eligible for laser treatment in the opinion of the investigator. If both eyes are eligible, the one with the worse visual acuity, as assessed at Visit 1, will be selected by the investigator as the study eye. BCVA ≥ 39 and ≤78 letters in the study eye and, inclusively, using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/32 to 20/160) at screening. Concomitant conditions in the study eye are only permitted if, in the opinion of the investigator, they do not prevent improvement of visual acuity on study treatment. Patient Compliance/ Administrative Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Ocular medical history Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in either eye at enrollment. Any active infection (e.g. conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) in either eye at the time of enrollment. History of uveitis in either eye at any time. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the center of the macular in the study eye likely to preclude improvement in visual acuity following the resolution of macular edema. Uncontrolled glaucoma in either eye at screening. Prior Ocular treatments Panretinal laser photocoagulation in the study eye within 6 months prior to randomization. Focal/grid laser photocoagulation in the study eye within 3 months prior to randomization. Treatment with antiangiogenic drugs in either eye. Systemic conditions or treatments History of stroke within 6 months prior to enrollment. Renal failure requiring dialysis. Untreated diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure systolic &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
