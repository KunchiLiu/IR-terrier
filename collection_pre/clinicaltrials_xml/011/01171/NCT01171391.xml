	<brief_title>VA106483 Dose Response in Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturia, defined as waking to void at least once per night between periods of sleep, is a common complaint and shows an age-dependent increase in both prevalence and severity (number of nocturnal voids). The most common causes are detrusor over-activity, reduced nighttime functional bladder capacity, and nocturnal polyuria. VA106483 is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor agonist in development for nocturia. VA106483 is a non-peptide drug that displays much improved oral availability over desmopressin and low dependence on glomerular filtration for its elimination. VA106483 has been administered to 184 subjects (including healthy adult subjects [males and females], children [males and females] with nocturia and 48 elderly males [aged 65 years and over]). It has been administered as single doses both intravenously, up to doses of approximately 250 mg and orally up to 50 mg It is also being investigated in approximately 123 male subjects (two-thirds on active medication, one third on placebo) with nocturia in a current study with dosing for up to 8 weeks. This intra-subject dose escalation study has previously been conducted in 10 elderly male subjects to determine whether subjects demonstrated a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (urine osmolality and diuresis) response and whether the dose of VA106483 could be titrated within an individual patient to achieve optimal clinical response in clinical practice. Given that to date, only 8 females have been exposed to VA106483, the purpose of this study is to confirm that the described duration of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VA106483 in males is similar in females.</detailed_description>
