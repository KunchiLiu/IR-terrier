	<brief_title>SPIRIT V: A Clinical Evaluation of the XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System in the Treatment of Patients With de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions (Diabetic Sub-Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SPIRIT V Clinical Evaluation consists of two concurrent studies,the Diabetic sub-study and the Registry. The SPIRIT V Diabetic sub-study is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, single blind, parallel two-arm multi-center study comparing the XIENCE V® EECSS to the TAXUS® Liberté™ in the treatment of diabetic patients with coronary artery lesions who will fulfill the eligibility criteria. Approximately 300 patients will be randomized (2:1) against the TAXUS® Liberté™ coronary stent system. These patients will be recruited in up to 40 selected sites. The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years. In addition, these pre-approval studies have shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were observed to plateau or gradually decline after about 1 year and were consistently lower than the comparator arm of each study. This benefit in MACE is sustained for up to 5 years and is also independent of the first year results. The post approval SPIRIT V study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in complex lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and Target Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously mentioned pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion / exclusion criteria. Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to discontinue further follow up in the SPIRIT V Diabetic study after 1 year.</detailed_description>
