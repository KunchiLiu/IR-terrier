	<brief_summary>Research on the implications of orthopedic injury and surgery on automobile driving ability has been limited. Only a handful of orthopedic issues have been studied to date, especially the safe postoperative resumption of driving. However, effects of orthopedic immobilizations of the lower right limb on fitness to drive are largely unknown, and the physician is left with little guidance. Only one study (Tremblay et al. 2009) have looked at the impact of wearing such devices on braking performances. The results have shown a statistically significant increase of braking times while wearing a removable Aircast walker and a walking cast in healthy subjects under simulated driving conditions. Despite this, the study have not demonstrated that driving with orthopedic immobilization is dangerous since the increase in braking times were minimal. Limitations of this study include the important fact that driving simulation is not real-time driving. In order to assess the validity of the driving simulator used in this study, a similar experimental study during real-time driving was thus devised.</brief_summary>
