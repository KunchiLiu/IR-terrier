	<brief_summary>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) are major mediators of angiogenesis and are induced by tissue inflammation and hypoxia. While elevated serum VEGF levels have been reported in inflammatory lung diseases, especially with hemoptysis, there was no study to evaluate the Ang-2 levels in lung inflammatory diseases according to the presence of hemoptysis, inflammatory biomarker and hypoxia.</brief_summary>
