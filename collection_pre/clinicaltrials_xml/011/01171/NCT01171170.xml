	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the effects of adding nitroglycerin (NTG) patches, delivery 25 mg NTG per 24 h, to the standard first line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), i.e. 4 cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab, followed by bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Tumor hypoxia is a common phenomenon in lung cancer; it is a known poor prognostic marker, related to treatment resistance. Pre-clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating drugs may decrease hypoxia related drug resistance. NTG is a NO donating drug. NTG increases tumor blood flow and thereby augments antitumor drug delivery to the tumor. A randomized phase II has shown an increase in the response rate from 42% to 72%, when NTG patches (25 mg/day, day -2 to +3) were added to vinorelbine/cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, the time to progression increased from 185 to 327 days. The hypothesis of the present study is that adding NTG transdermal patches to bevacizumab containing chemotherapy improves progression free survival, response rate and overall survival in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of platinum-containing chemotherapy. It has been shown that the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. There is a need for improved PFS and OS and response rates to chemotherapy are only 25-35%. Tumor hypoxia is a common phenomenon in lung cancer; it is a known poor prognostic marker, related to treatment resistance. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) -1α is the major factor regulating the response to hypoxia. HIF directly activates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF-receptor. Bevacizumab interacts with this pathway by blocking VEGF. Pre-clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating drugs may decrease hypoxia related drug resistance. Nitroglycerin (NTG) is a NO donating drug. NTG increases tumor blood flow and thereby augments antitumor drug delivery to the tumor and inhibits HIF-1α. Interestingly, it has recently been shown in mouse models that the addition of HIF-1α inhibitors to bevacizumab significantly inhibits tumor growth by inducing apoptosis. A randomized phase II has shown an increase in the response rate from 42% to 72%, when NTG patches (25 mg/day, day -2 to +3) were added to vinorelbine/cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, the time to progression increased from 185 to 327 days. The hypothesis of the present study is that adding NTG transdermal patches to bevacizumab containing chemotherapy improves PFS, response rate and OS in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.</detailed_description>
