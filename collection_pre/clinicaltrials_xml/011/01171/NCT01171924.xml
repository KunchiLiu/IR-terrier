	<brief_summary>This is a phase Ib open label, expansion study of CUDC-101 in patients with advanced head and neck, gastric, breast, liver, and non-small cell lung cancer tumors. CUDC-101 is a multi-targeted agent designed to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor Type 2 (Her2) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The study is designed to compare the safety and tolerability of CUDC-101 when administered at the maximum tolerated dose on either a 5 days/week schedule or a 3 days/week schedule.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced breast, gastric, head and neck, liver and nonsmall cell lung cancer. For subjects with nonsmall cell lung cancer only: Most recent treatment must be erlotinib and subjects must have had a radiographic partial or complete response to treatment as defined by RECIST criteria and should be currently progressing after the documented response. A documented mutation in EGFR exons 19 or 21 Subjects must have no further standard of care options or have refused standard therapy Measurable or evaluable disease Age ≥ 18 years ECOG performance &lt; 2 Life expectancy ≥ 3 months If female, neither pregnant or lactating If of child bearing potential, must use adequate birth control Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/µL; platelets ≥ 100,000/µL; Creatinine ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m2 Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN; AST/ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN. In subjects with documented liver metastases, the AST/ALT may be ≤ 5x ULN Prothrombin time ≤1.5x ULN, unless receiving therapeutic anticoagulation Serum magnesium and potassium within normal limits (may use supplements to achieve normal values) Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if controlled on a stable dose ≤ 10mg prednisone/day or its equivalent dose of steroids Able to render informed consent and to follow protocol requirements. Anticancer therapy within 4 weeks of study entry. Use of investigational agent(s) within 30 days of study entry History of cardiac disease with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina in the past 6 months prior to Day 1 of treatment, serious arrhythmias requiring medication for treatment. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Subjects with liver cancer and hepatitis may be eligible.</criteria>
