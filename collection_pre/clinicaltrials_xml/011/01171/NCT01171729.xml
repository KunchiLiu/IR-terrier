	<brief_summary>This is an open label, Phase I/IIa trial of immunotherapy with CreaVax-PC as treatment in men with hormone-Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Dendritic Cell Therapy for Hormone-Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CreaVax-PC consisted of antigen (PSA, PAP and KLH) primed dendritic cell is an investigational product designed to activate a man's immune response, so they can detect prostate cancer cells and initiate an immune response against prostate cancer antigens. If patients decide to participate and are eligible, they will be enrolled in the study and will receive active product (CreaVax-PC). In detail, patients will receive CreaVax-PC injection at intervals of 3 weeks, maximum 6 times during 21 weeks. PSA increase rate is a primary evaluation variables and tumor suppression effect is secondary evaluation variables. We also evaluate time to progression, overall survival and immune response.</detailed_description>
