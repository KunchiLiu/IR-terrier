	<criteria>Histological confirmation or clinical/laboratory diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Cancer is not surgically resectable for cure Child Pugh A or B Performance Score: KPS score of ≥ 70 Platelet count ≥ 50,000 plts/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN AST, ALT &lt; 5.0 x ULN Acceptable coagulation status: INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN Acceptable kidney function: Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Sorafenib naive or refractory to sorafenib therapy Tumor Status: At least one intrahepatic tumor, and at least ≥50% of the total intrahepatic viable tumor mass, measurable by CT and injectable under imagingguidance (note: injected and/or viable tumors must be previously untreated or ≥20% increase in size since preceding localregional treatment). Known contraindications to sorafenib Pregnant or nursing an infant Significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness (e.g. hematological malignancies, congenital immunodeficiencies and/or HIV infection/AIDS) and/or medication (e.g. highdose systemic corticosteroids) History of exfoliative skin condition (e.g. severe eczema, ectopic dermatitis, or similar skin disorder) that at some stage has required systemic therapy Clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulating ascites, pericardial and/or pleural effusions Severe or unstable cardiac disease Current, known CNS malignancy Use of antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication Use of the following antiviral agents: ribavirin, adefovir, cidofovir (within 7 days prior to the first treatment), and PEGIFN (within 14 days prior to the first treatment). Patients with household contacts who meet any of these criteria unless alternate living arrangements can be made during the patient's active dosing period and for 7 days following the last dose of study medication: Pregnant or nursing an infant Children &lt; 12 months old History of exfoliative skin condition that at some stage has required systemic therapy Significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and/or medication</criteria>
