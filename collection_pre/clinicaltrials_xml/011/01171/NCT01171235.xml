	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to find for one or more serum or tissue markers of molecular biology in head and neck cancer patients used for early diagnosis, predicting prognosis and being sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Biomarker From Blood and Tissue of Head and Neck Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head and neck malignant tumors, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma in southern China with the high incidence, its incidence, treatment, prognosis or tumor markers in serum has been a hot research with little progress.In our study, we collect NPC-based collection including the blood samples of laryngeal, hypopharyngeal cancer, separating serum and white blood cells stored in -80 degrees，while tissues are frozen in liquid nitrogen and embedded in paraffin。 Patient treatment and prognosis are combined in order to find for markers of molecular biology used for early diagnosis, predicting prognosis and being sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
