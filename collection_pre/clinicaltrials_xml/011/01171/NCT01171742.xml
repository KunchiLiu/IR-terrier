	<brief_summary>Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO), also called Pringle maneuver, is a safe and effective procedure for major hepatectomy in patients with liver disease. In addition, ischemic preconditioning with IHIO has been reported to have protective effects in patients undergoing liver resection. The role of IHIO, however, has not been fully elucidated in donors and recipients during living donor liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Intermittent Hepatic Inflow Occlusion During Donor Hepatectomy In Living Donor Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO) by clamping of the portal triad, also called Pringle maneuver, is a safe and effective procedure in major hepatectomy in patients with liver disease. IHIO minimizes blood loss and operation time during liver resection. In addition, ischemic preconditioning with IHIO has been reported to have protective effects in patients undergoing liver resection. In the setting of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), one of the most important concerns is liver donor safety. Several studies have shown the safety of IHIO in donors for liver transplantation (LT). However, the effect of preconditioning with IHIO during donor hepatectomy on LDLT recipients remains unclear. Several small series have assessed the effects on recipients of ischemic preconditioning during whole liver transplantation from deceased donors. The role of IHIO, however, has not been fully elucidated in liver donors and recipients during LDLT. In this randomized, prospective study, we'll evaluate the efficacy of IHIO in the recipients and donors.</detailed_description>
