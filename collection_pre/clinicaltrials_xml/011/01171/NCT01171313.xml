	<criteria>1. Subjects must have predictable motor fluctuations of the wearing off type, defined by meeting the following criteria based on the on/off diaries recorded over 3 days in the Screening Period: Wearingoff in at least half (50%) of interdose intervals between the first and the last daily doses averaged over the 3 diary days, and An average daily "off" time of 2 hours after the first "on" of the day through awake time up to midnight. 2. Subjects must be on one of the following stable QID or 5 times daily regimens for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening: Sinemet® or carbidopalevodopa, with a total daily dose ranging from 400 mg to 1000 mg of levodopa 1. History, signs, or symptoms suggesting the diagnosis of secondary or atypical Parkinsonism. 2. Subject has moderately or severely disabling dyskinesias for greater than 25% of the waking day 3. Subjects who have significant neurological symptoms not accounted for by Parkinson's disease 4. Subjects who are taking Sinemet® CR, Parcopa®, concomitant COMT inhibitors (i.e., entacapone or tolcapone), Stalevo®, or benserazide containing levodopa preparations Madopar® or Prolopa®.</criteria>
