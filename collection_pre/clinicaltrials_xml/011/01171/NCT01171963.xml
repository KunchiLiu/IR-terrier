	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Efficacy, Immunogenicity and Safety of Liquid Human Rotavirus Vaccine, in Healthy Chinese Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects can receive routine childhood vaccination according to the expanded program of immunisation recommendations in China. There will be two treatment groups (liquid human rotavirus vaccine and placebo). The study will also have two immunogenicity subgroups comprising of few subjects from both the treatment groups. The immunogenicity subgroup 1 will assess the immunogenicity of the liquid human rotavirus vaccine and the immunogenicity subgroup 2 will assess the immunogenicity of liquid human rotavirus vaccine and also the immunogenicity of oral poliovirus vaccine and diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine given concomitantly with liquid human rotavirus vaccine or placebo. This protocol posting has been updated following the Protocol Amendment 2, dated 05 August 2011. The impacted section in the protocol posting is: Outcome Measures Section.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/Legally Acceptable Representatives can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female infant of Chinese origin between, and including, 6 and 16 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parents/Legally Acceptable Representatives of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 14 days before each dose of study vaccine(s) and ending 14 days after the first dose of the human rotavirus vaccine or placebo except for the routine childhood vaccinations. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Any clinically significant history of gastrointestinal disease including any uncorrected congenital malformation (such as Meckel's diverticulum) of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusception . Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Gastroenteritis within 7 days preceding the study vaccine or placebo administration. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period. In addition to the criteria mentioned above, the following criteria will be applicable to all subjects in the immunogenicity subgroup 2: History of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis disease. History of seizures or progressive neurological disease. Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis.</criteria>
