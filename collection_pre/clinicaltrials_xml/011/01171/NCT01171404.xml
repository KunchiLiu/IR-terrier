	<brief_summary>The aim of this international study is to describe the short- and long-term (i.e. up to 2 years following the index event) antithrombotic management patterns (AMPs) in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS)), and to document the impact of AMPs in clinical outcomes, economic variables and quality of life in a 'real-life' setting and to compare these between sites, countries and regions.</brief_summary>
