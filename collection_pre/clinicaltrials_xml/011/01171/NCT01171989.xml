Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. The following adverse event having occurred after previous administration of DTP vaccine: Encephalopathy. Temperature of &gt;= 40.5°C (rectal temperature) within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination. Persistent, inconsolable crying occurring within 48 hours of vaccination and lasting &gt;= 3 hours. Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days of vaccination. The following condition is temporary or selflimiting, and a subject may be vaccinated once the condition has resolved if no other exclusion criteria is met: • Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.
