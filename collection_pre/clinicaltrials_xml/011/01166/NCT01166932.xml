	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the clinical effectiveness and hospital costs, the initial empirical treatment, Oxacillin / Ceftriaxone and Amoxicillin / Clavulanate in children with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) severe. Methods: Clinical prospective randomized study in children aged two months to five years of age with a diagnosis of severe CAP, according to criteria of World Health Organization (WHO), admitted to the Pediatrics Ward of the Hospital of the Medical School of Botucatu- UNESP. We excluded children with comorbid disorders (primary and secondary immunodeficiency) with acute or chronic kidney disease, referred patients receiving antibiotics proposal and history of allergy to antibiotics proposed. We included 104 children who were randomized into two groups to receive: Oxacillin / Ceftriaxone IV (GCO, n = 48) and Amoxicillin / Clavulanate IV (GAA, n = 56). Patients of the GAA, after clinical improvement, has been receiving the same oral antibiotic, and maintaining clinical stability, were discharged from hospital, the GOC received any IV treatment. The outcomes analyzed were time to clinical improvement (fever and tachypnea), duration of oxygen therapy, hospitalization time, need to expand the antimicrobial spectrum progression to pleural effusion / empyema (DP / E) and hospital costs. Treatment failure was determined by the need to expand the antimicrobial spectrum after 48 hours of hospitalization.</brief_summary>
