	<brief_summary>Port wine stain, also called nevus flammeus, is a congenital, cutaneous vascular malformation involving post-capillary venules which produces a light pink to red to dark-red-violet discoloration of the skin. It is estimated that Port wine stain occurs in 3 children per 1,000 live births. Approximately 900,000 individuals in the United States and twenty million people worldwide have Port wine stain birthmarks .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study on the Use of the Matrix Radiofrequencyfor Treatment of Port Wine Stain Birthmarks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to improve port wine stain treatment after Matrix Radiofrequency device treatment. The Matrix Radiofrequency device energy generates fractional deep dermal heating in the region of the electrode matrix to induce skin injury, thus eliciting a wound healing response. Less affected tissue surrounding the matrix points may be stimulated by heat which helps accelerate the healing process, while at the same time minimizing adverse effects such as scarring or changes in the normal skin pigmentation. The researcher can determine Port wine stain areas treated with the Matrix Radiofrequency device will have improved Port wine stain blanching responses as compared to those areas treated by pulsed dye laser.</detailed_description>
