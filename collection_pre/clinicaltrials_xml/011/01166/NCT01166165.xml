	<brief_summary>High blood pressure is related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death, and accounts for approximately 8 mill deaths worldwide each year. Blood pressure exhibits a seasonal variation with a tendency to increase during winter months. Vitamin D deficiency is more common during months where UVB radiation from the sun is absent, and vitamin D has been associated with high blood pressure. This study will evaluate the effect of vitamin D replacement during winter months on blood pressure and vasoactive hormones in patients with high blood pressure.</brief_summary>
