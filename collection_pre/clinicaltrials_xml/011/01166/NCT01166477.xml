	<criteria>Patients infected with HIV1, documented with a positive HIV1 antibodies test and/or positive PCR confirmed for HIV1 RNA. Patients on triple antiretroviral therapy with any boosted protease inhibitor. Patients with an undetectable viral load, which will be defined as &lt;50 viral RNA copies/mL within the last six months. Men or women agedâ‰¥18. For women with childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test during the Screening visit. Patients who would have granted a written informed consent prior to any Studyspecific screening procedure. Patients with a written proof of resistance in the accumulated genotype, which would lead to a sensibility loss to lopinavir/ritonavir, or, in case of genotype absence, a documented failure to a protease inhibitor therapy. Patients with a CD4 cells nadir CD4 &lt;100 cell/microL. Patients who, for any reason, could not be treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Prior medical history of psychiatric disorders, such as depressive syndrome, schizophrenia or psychotic disease. Known previous medical history of drug abuse/addiction or alcohol chronic consumption, which in the Investigator's opinion, would be incompatible with his/her Study participation. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women of childbearing potential who do not use an appropriate contraceptive method, according to the Investigator's opinion. Documented past(within four weeks prior to screening) or active current opportunistic infection. Patients who, due to severe toxicities related to any of their current HAART compounds, there is a planned discontinuation or modification concerning any of the drugs from their triple therapy. Patients for which, according to the Investigator, will have to change their HAART, regardless of the reason, within the next six months. Renal disease with creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min. Concomitant use of Lopinavir/ritonavir contraindicated drugs, such as rifampicin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, cisapride, hypericum perforatum, lovastatin, simvastatin, pimozide, midazolam and triazolam. Concomitant use of nephrotoxic or immunosuppressor drugs. Patients currently treated with systemic corticosteroids, interleukine2 or chemotherapy. Patients treated with other Investigative Medical Product. Patients with acute hepatitis. Any disease or condition that, according to the Investigator, would be incompatible with the patient's participation in the Study.</criteria>
