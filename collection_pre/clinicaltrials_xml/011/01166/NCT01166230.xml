	<brief_summary>The study is intended to investigate whether the improved initial detection and resection of bladder cancer lesions in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with Hexvix (Cysview) fluorescence cystoscopy/TURB will lead to a longer-term reduction in recurrences compared to standard white light cystoscopy/TURB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longer-term Recurrence Rates in Patients With Bladder Cancer After Hexvix (Cysview)Fluorescence Cystoscopy/TURB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A previously completed pivotal clinical study PC B305/04 demonstrated reduced recurrence rates for patients with papillary bladder cancer who underwent Hexvix (Cysview) and white light cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TURB) of the bladder compared to patients who underwent white light cystoscopy and TURB alone. The present study is intended to investigate whether the improved initial detection and resection of bladder cancer lesions in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with Hexvix (Cysview) fluorescence cystoscopy/TURB will also lead to a longer-term reduction in recurrences compared to standard white light cystoscopy/TURB. No safety data was collected.</detailed_description>
