	<brief_summary>Study to collect post-market safety data for HUD IBV Valve System, a device to control prolonged air leaks of the lung, or significant air leaks that are likely to become prolonged air leaks following lobectomy, segmentectomy, or LVRS. An air leak present on post-operative day 7 is considered prolonged unless present only during forced exhalation or cough. An air leak present on day 5 should be considered for treatment if it is: 1)continuous, 2) present during normal inhalation phase of inspiration, or 3) present upon normal expiration and accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema or respiratory compromise.</brief_summary>
