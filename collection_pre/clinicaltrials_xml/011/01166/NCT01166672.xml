	<detailed_description>Breast cancer related lymphedema occurs in 20-30% of survivors. Weight loss could prevent onset. We seek to do a pilot study to establish feasibility of 1) recruiting survivors at risk for lymphedema to do a weight loss intervention, 2) achieving 10-15% weight loss over 26 weeks in this population, and 3) attendance at follow-up visits 6 months.</detailed_description>
