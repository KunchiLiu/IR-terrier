The current standard of care for partial thickness burns is two weeks of topical therapy and wound care. Burns that do not heal within two weeks undergo surgical excision and skin grafting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ability of Modulated Imaging and Laser Speckle Imaging to Determine Burn Wound Severity and Healing Potential</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researcher can use the combination of Modulated Imaging and Laser Speckle Imaging can be used as an adjuvant to standard clinical evaluation to gauge burn wound and severity of infection. Researcher can image the burn wounds of and compare with current standard of care, clinical exam, and can use the outcomes information in terms of time to healing and treatment Modulating Imaging is a noninvasive optical modality measure the metabolic functions of the burn wound. Laser Speckle Imaging is a noninvasive optical modality can measure blood flow of burn wound.</detailed_description>
