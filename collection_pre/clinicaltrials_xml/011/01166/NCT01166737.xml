	<brief_summary>It is still not clear whether a positive AGO-score just selects patients with less aggressive biologic tumor behavior who as well would have had a positive outcome by chemotherapy only, or , if it is a score selecting patients who really benefit from surgery. Nevertheless, the AGO-score was confirmed to select patients with a less than 30% risk of ending with residual tumor after surgery for recurrent disease. This could avoid including patients into the present surgical protocol who could not benefit from an operationThe goal of this third DESKTOP study is to evaluate in a prospectively randomized multicentre setting, whether maximum effort of cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum based combination chemotherapy can improve overall survival as compared to platinum based combination chemotherapy alone in AGO-score positive patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with first recurrence of platinum sensitive, invasive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer of any initial stage. Progressionfree interval of at least 6 months after end of last platinumcontaining therapy, or recurrence within 6 months or later after primary surgery if the patient has not received prior chemotherapy in patients with FIGO I. Non cytostatic maintenance therapy not containing platinum will not be considered for this calculation. A positive AGOscore. Obligatory requirements for a positive AGO recurrence score in platinumsensitive disease: 1. Performance status ECOG 0 2. No residual tumor after primary surgery (if unknown, alternatively primary FIGO stage I/II). If report from 1st surgery is not available contact study chairman who will decide whether inclusion is possible or not. 3. Absence of ascites (cut off &lt; 500 ml: radiological or ultrasound estimation) Complete resection of the tumor by median laparotomy seems possible Patients who have given their signed and written informed consent and their consent to data transmission and processing. Patients with nonepithelial tumors as well as borderline tumors. Patients without recurrence who are scheduled for diagnostic/secondlook surgery or debulking surgery after completion of chemotherapy More than one prior chemotherapy Patients with second, third, or later recurrence Patients with second malignancies who have been treated by laparotomy, as well as other neoplasms, if the treatment might interfere with the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer or if major impact on prognosis is expected. Patients with socalled platinumrefractory tumor, i.e. progression during chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months after end of former first platinumcontaining therapy Only palliative surgery planned Radiological signs suggesting metastases not accessible to surgical removal (i.e. complete resection is deemed impossible) Any concomitant disease not allowing surgery and/or chemotherapy Any medical history indicating excessive perioperative risk Any current medication inducing considerable surgical risk (e.g. bleeding: due to oral anticoagulating agents, bevacizumab)</criteria>
