	<brief_summary>Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may require invasive mechanical ventilation. However, invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with a variety of complications. Non-invasive ventilation has been presented as an alternative treatment but controversy remains. The investigators hypothesize that high-flow nasal cannula system is effective enough to prevent intubation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and not inferior to non-invasive ventilation.</brief_summary>
