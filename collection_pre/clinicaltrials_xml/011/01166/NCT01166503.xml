	<brief_title>Early Versus Delayed Surgery for Infantile Esotropia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While there is a uniform agreement among pediatric ophthalmologists that most infantile esotropia requires surgical correction, the proper timing of surgery is controversial. In North America, the typical age at surgery ranges from 11-18 months. Unfortunately, despite successful surgical realignment of the eyes, the sensory and eye movement deficits often persist. Recently, some pediatric ophthalmologists have advocated earlier surgery. The rationale for early surgery stems from animal and human research showing that early realignment of the eyes within an early critical period allows normal development of the sensory and eye movement systems.</detailed_description>
