	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 5 mg intravenous (i.v.) relative to placebo in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients with osteoporosis and to support the optimal use of zoledronic acid for this indication. Primary objective is the change of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at lumbar spine (L1-L4) and total hip region assessed by T-Score at month 12 relative to screening as measured by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). This double-blind period will be followed by a 52-week open-label treatment phase to assess long-term efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in these patients.</brief_summary>
