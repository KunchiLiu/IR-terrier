	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the one-time application of Paclitaxel from SeQuent Please (Paclitaxel-coated Balloon Catheter) after using the Coroflex Blue (Cobalt Chromium Stent) with the slow releasing of small dose of Paclitaxel from the Coroflex Please (Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent) stent system in a non-inferiority trial.</brief_summary>
