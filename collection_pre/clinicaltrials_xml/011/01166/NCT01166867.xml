	<brief_summary>The researcher want to use video signals to monitor heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation using Photo-plethysmography (PPG) as the underlying mechanism for the method: periodic changes in skin reflectance, induced by the cardio-vascular wave, are measured using light.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Using Photo-plethysmographic (PPG) Camera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Researcher want to use ambient light to monitor heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in infant patients in a hospital setting. The plethysmographic signal is typically strong on children. This provides a reliable heart rate monitor. However, to measure oxygen saturation, a quantitative value of the strength at two wavelength regions (green and red) is required. It is also not known if the normal ambient light is spectrally appropriate to analyze the video signals for oxygenation. With the current prototype of our system, we can monitor heart rate reliably and estimate oxygen saturation in adults, using normal artificial light or daylight, entering through a window.</detailed_description>
