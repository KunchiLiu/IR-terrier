	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease marked by progressive lung scarring leading to multiple life-altering sequelae. The over-arching goals of the principal investigator's research program are to more fully characterize these sequelae and to examine interventions that might improve them. The hypotheses of this particular study are that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is one such intervention, and that PR will improve the sequelae of dyspnea and impairments in functional capacity, cognition, mood and anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with IPF.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will come to our center to be enrolled. Baseline data collection (performance of a six-minute walk test and completion of questionnaires) and randomization to one of two groups--either Rehab or Wait--will take place at the same enrollment visit if time permits. Subjects in either group will complete pulmonary rehabilitation, just at slightly different times, depending on which group they are randomized to. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program run by respiratory and/or physical therapists and other health professionals that involves exercise, education, and support with the goals to improve functional capacity, symptom management, and well-being. It will last 6-8 weeks, during which time, subjects will complete 18 approximately hour-long sessions. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be completed at any local center that makes travel convenient. Data collection visits will take place at National Jewish Health at baseline, eight weeks (without intervening pulmonary rehabilitation in the Wait group), after completion of pulmonary rehabilitation (time varies, depending on the randomization group), and finally six months after completion of the pulmonary rehabilitation program.</detailed_description>
