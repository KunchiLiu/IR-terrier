Patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1. 3. Patients must have received prior anticancer therapy or not be eligible for any established conventional therapy whether surgical or pharmacologic. 4. Patients must have recovered from all acute adverse effects (excluding alopecia) of prior therapies to baseline or &lt;=grade 1 prior to study entry. 5. Patients must have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2. 6. Patients must be men and women &gt;=18 years of age. 7. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function, defined as an absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1.5 x 10^9/L and a platelet count &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L. 8. Patients must have adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine &lt;= 1.2 mg/dL (if &gt; 1.2 mg/dL, a calculated creatinine clearance [by the CockcroftGault method] must be &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73 m^2). 9. Patients must have adequate hepatic function, defined as plasma total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 mg, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;=2.5 X ULN. Patients with Gilbert's disease outside these limits are judged to be ineligible. 10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result at time of pretreatment screening. 11. Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use at least one form of barrier contraception prior to study entry and for up to 30 days beyond the last administration of study drug. 12. Patients must be judged to be capable by the Investigator of providing informed consent and must be willing to provide written informed consent prior to the start of any study specific procedures. 13. Patients should have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Exclusion Criteria (Treatment Arm A) 1. Patients may not have had prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy in the 4 weeks prior to study entry with the exception of mitomycin C or nitrosoureas, for which patients must be 6 weeks from prior treatment. For patients who have been treated with targeted therapy, 5 halflives of that therapy (or 28 days, whichever is shorter) must have passed prior to enrollment in the study. 2. Patients may not have any concomitant condition that could compromise the objectives of this study and the patients' compliance and ability to tolerate this therapy and complete at least 2 cycles of therapy, including, but not limited to the following: Congestive heart failure or uncontrolled angina pectoris, previous history of myocardial infarction within 1 year from study entry, uncontrolled hypertension, or dysrhythmias. Active infection. Unstable diabetes mellitus Psychiatric disorder that may interfere with consent and/or protocol compliance. 3. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 4. Patients with another malignancy in the past 3 years except: curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer; or carcinoma in situ, of either cervix or breast, that does not require further treatment. 5. Patients with known HIV, HBV, or HCV infection. 6. Patients with an underlying diagnosis or disease state associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 7. Patients with central nervous system metastases. Baseline CT or MRI scan of brain is required only in the case of clinical suspicion of central nervous system metastases. Patients with evidence of brain involvement, leptomeningeal disease, or seizure disorder are also excluded. 8. Patients may not be treated with known CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Combination CTO Plus Temodar® (Treatment Arm B): Inclusion Criteria (Treatment Arm B) In addition to the inclusion criteria for adequate organ function as defined for the patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, patients enrolled in Arm B (Combination Therapy CTO Plus TemodarR) must meet the following inclusion criteria: 1. Patients must have histologically proven malignant glioblastoma or other recurrent malignant gliomas. 2. Measurable tumor must be present on gadoliniumenhanced MRI. 3. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks. 4. Patients must have a Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 (ECOG scale). 5. Patients must be men and women &gt;=18 years of age. 6. Patients must have recovered from all acute adverse effects (excluding alopecia) of prior therapies to baseline or &lt;=grade 1 prior to study entry. 7. Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by MRI scan to be performed within 14 days prior to registration and must be on a steroid dose that has been stable for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI scan is required. 8. Patients who have undergone recent resection for recurrent or progressive malignant tumor will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: 1. They have recovered from the effects of surgery 2. The extent of residual disease is assessed postoperatively, with an MRI scan done no later than 96 hours in the immediate postoperative period or at least 4 weeks postoperatively, within 14 days prior to registration. If the 96hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. 9. Patients must have had prior radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy and must have progressed following radiation therapy and must have an interval of &gt;=12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to registration date to minimize the possibility of pseudoprogression. 10.
