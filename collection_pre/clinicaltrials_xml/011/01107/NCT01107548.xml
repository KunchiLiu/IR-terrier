	<brief_summary>In Western Countries, stroke and dementia are the main causes of long-term disability, dependency, and nursing home admission. Due to demographic trends a continuous increase of patient numbers can be expected. There is growing evidence that vascular risk factors which are implicated in the etiology of stroke also play important etiologic roles in both vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease. The present project is aimed at the reduction of stroke and dementia by means of a systematic detection and subsequent treatment of vascular risk factors by the family doctor based on established guidelines.</brief_summary>
