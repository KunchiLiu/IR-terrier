	<brief_title>Family Support Intervention in Intensive Care Units (The Four Supports Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One in four elderly Americans die in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit. An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and end-of-life care is poor in intensive care units. These deficiencies are associated with high rates of adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict, and life support decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences. There is a lack on information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively improve this important aspect of care for elderly patients and their families. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted communication intervention to improve psychological outcomes among family members of critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled trial design.</detailed_description>
