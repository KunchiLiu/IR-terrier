	<brief_title>A Study in Participants With Moderate to Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a Phase 2 study with 2 parts. Part A is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging design and Part B is an optional, open label extension design. Approximately 125 participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 ixekizumab groups or to placebo (approximately 25 participants per group) in Part A. Participants will be evaluated for treatment efficacy and the primary endpoint will be evaluated at week 12. Between week 20 and week 32, participants with a less than 75% improvement in their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score compared to baseline will be eligible to begin Part B. Participants in Part B will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of ixekizumab 120 milligrams (mg) every 4 weeks through week 236. Subsequent to an amendment on May 2012, administration changed to 80 mg every 4 weeks through Week 236. Participants who complete both Part A and B have a total study participation of up to approximately 240 to 264 weeks.</detailed_description>
