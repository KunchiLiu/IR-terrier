	<brief_summary>This study will enroll patients who present to Emergency Departments (EDs) and have an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) at discharged in 2 Edmonton EDs. Patients will all be provided with evidence-based discharge (prednisone and an antibiotic) and will be randomized to receive enhanced education to the primary care provider or standard care. The investigators' goal is to determine if an opinion leaders' advice will improve chronic care in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Opinion Leaders in Enhancing Evidence-based Care After Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Emergency Department (ED) Visits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is now seen as a disease that is both preventable and treatable. In order to better facilitate treatment for these patients, a number of consensus guidelines have been developed to help physicians in the diagnosis and chronic management of these patients. However, a number of studies have shown that implementation and adherence to the guidelines by physicians, both at the primary care and specialist level, remains poor. Patients who experience an Acute Exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) have an increased risk of mortality, and therefore, must have their management optimized to improve survival. These patients most often are evaluated and treated in their local emergency departments (EDs) for the acute episode; however, follow up care is often left to their primary care physician (PCP). The national rate of patient compliance for follow up with their PCP within the first month following an AECOPD is unknown, however, locally, it is only 30%. From this, it could be inferred that there is a poor rate for any adjustment in chronic management after an AECOPD and therefore an increased risk of future exacerbations. It is our belief that informing the PCP that their patient experienced an AECOPD, with a form that provides details of the acute management along with an update of the current guideline recommendations, will improve follow up, compliance with current guidelines and the quality of life for patients with COPD.</detailed_description>
