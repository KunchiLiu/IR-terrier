	<brief_summary>Published data by the Organizaci√≥n panamericana de la Salud shows that Peru's mortality rate from acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants less than one year of life is second only to Haiti (14,150/100,000). Government data reports shows a marked increase of RSV infections in Peru. "Instituto Nacional de Salud" (Peru's National Institute of Health) reports between January 1st to February 26th 2006, 62% of their positive samples corresponded to RSV. Epidemiological data from Lima-Peru, demonstrates that there is no specific season for RSV infection although some data suggest an increase in RSV activity during cold months (May to September; INS data). Clinical studies show that giving five doses of Synagis (palivizumab) resulted in serum concentrations &gt; 30 ug/mL for &gt;20 weeks. The aim of this post-marketing observational study is to determine the RSV hospitalization rate in high-risk infants who received Synagis (palivizumab) through the Social Security Hospitals in the context of routine clinical practice.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Receiving Synagis (palivizumab) immunoprophylaxis during respiratory syncytial virus season, according to the usual clinical practice: Infants born &lt; or = 32 weeks of gestation and are younger than 6 months of age at the beginning of the respiratory syncytial virus season. Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who have received medical treatment in the last 6 months, until the first year of life. Children 12 months or younger with hemodynamically significant acyanotic congenital heart disease (pulmonary hypertension or heart failure in treatment). Major congenital malformation aside from congenital heart disease Chronic pulmonary disease other than bronchopulmonary dysplasia Active infections Contraindication to Synagis Receipt of another immunoglobulin preparation including but not restricted to polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin, cytomegalovirus hyperimmunoglobulin (Cytogam), or respiratory syncytial virus hyperimmunoglobulin (Respigam). Any other condition that according deemed an obstacle for study conduction or representing an unacceptable risk by the participating investigator.</criteria>
