	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II single-arm, open-label, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy for subjects with unresectable Stage III and Stage IV melanoma. Previous cytokine therapy is permitted. Subjects must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Subjects who are not candidates for curative intent treatments are eligible for this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib and Paclitaxel as First-Line Treatment for Subjects With Unresectable Stage III and Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment on study will be administered in 4-week cycles. Paclitaxel will be administered intravenously at a starting dose of 80mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest. Pazopanib will be administered orally, in a continuous regimen, with a starting dose of 800mg daily. Approximately 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled over a 24 month period. 21 subjects will be entered into the first stage of a 2-stage Simon Minimax design. If there are 3 or more responses, 39 additional subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2. The minimum number of responses required to move to the second stage, &gt; 3, were noted after the first 9 patients on treatment, and the study then proceeded towards the goal of accruing 60 total patients. Subjects are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion of blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents, analgesics, erythropoietin, filgrastim (Neupogen), or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. Subjects should continue treatment on study until objective disease progression is documented according to RECIST or withdrawal from the study for other reasons. Subjects discontinuing treatment with paclitaxel prior to disease progression should continue treatment with pazopanib. Subjects discontinuing both agents prior to progressive disease (PD) will be followed for tumor assessment until PD, or until the initiation of a subsequent anti-cancer therapy in the absence of documented PD, or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects may continue treatment beyond the time of RECIST-defined progression at the discretion of the investigator if the subject is perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit. Overall survival will be assessed for 2 years from first study treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of studyspecific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up. Procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol. Note: It is not necessary that informed consent be obtained within the protocolspecified screening window. 2. Histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma with 1) unresectable Stage III disease, or 2) Stage IV disease by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria. 3. Must have measurable disease [i.e. with at least one measurable lesion, per RECIST]. A measurable lesion is defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter ≥20mm using conventional techniques or ≥10mm with spiral CT scan. Note: Subjects should be excluded if all baseline measurable lesions are within previously irradiated areas. Subjects participating in the exploratory analysis shall not have the biopsied lesion(s) as the only sites of measurable disease. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 5. Age 18 years old or older 6. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who has had: A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for ≥1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt;40 milliinternational unit (mIU)/mL and an estradiol value &lt;40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L). Subjects must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for inhibition of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. If a female subject is determined not to be postmenopausal, they must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately below. Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception. Acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow: An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year. Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of investigational product. Doublebarrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide). Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions. Female subjects who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug. A male with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he uses a barrier method of contraception or abstinence during the study. 7. Adequate organ system functions as defined below: System:Laboratory Values Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= .5 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL International normalized ratio (INR) &lt;= 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN) Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt;= 1.2 X ULN Hepatic Total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 X ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2.5 x ULN Renal Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 mL/min Note: Subjects may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment. Platelets &gt;= 100 X 10^9/L Urine Protein to Creatinine Ratio (UPC) &lt; 1 Note: If UPC is more than 1, then a 24hour urine protein must be assessed. Subjects must have a 24hour urine protein value &lt;1g to be eligible. 8. Corrected serum calcium concentration within normal range per local clinical laboratory standard. 9.
