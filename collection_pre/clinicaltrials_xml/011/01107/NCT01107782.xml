	<brief_title>Sildenafil and Uteroplacental Perfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fetal growth retardation affects up to 8% of all pregnancies and has massive short term (increased fetal morbidity and mortality) and long-term (increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders in adulthood) health implications. Doppler waveform analysis of these pregnancies suggests compromised uteroplacental circulation and placental hypoperfusion. Our aim is to assess if sildenafil citrate could improve vasodilatation in FGR pregnancies. Sildenafil citrate may offer a potential therapeutic strategy to improve uteroplacental perfusion in FGR. Animal studies suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil citrate, may improve uterine blood flow .</detailed_description>
