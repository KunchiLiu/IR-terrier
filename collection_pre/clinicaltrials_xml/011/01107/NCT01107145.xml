	<brief_summary>The current treatment recommendations for P. vivax in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals are to use chloroquine; in non-pregnant patients this is followed by primaquine to prevent relapse. As primaquine can not be used in pregnant women, these women remain at risk of relapse. As there is increasing concern about chloroquine resistant P. vivax in this region, there is a need to identify alternative treatment options. The artemisinin combination therapies are recommended for use against P. falciparum infections in pregnant women after the 1st trimester; additional data are needed to support the use of these drugs against P. vivax.</brief_summary>
