	<brief_summary>This study was designed to examine changes in capillary blood glucose and venous insulin levels after a 70 gram oral sucrose challenge with and without simultaneous consumption of a dietary supplement containing L-Arabinose and a patented version of chromium (LA-Cr).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Dietary Supplement Containing L-Arabinose and Trivalent Patented Food-source of Chromium on Blood Glucose and Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study concluded that consumption of the LA-Cr supplement in conjunction with a 70-gram sucrose challenge led to a significant reduction of capillary blood glucose and venous insulin as compared to the sucrose challenge without the LA-Cr supplement. This finding may provide an important tool to reduce the adverse effects associated with elevated glucose and insulin levels.</detailed_description>
