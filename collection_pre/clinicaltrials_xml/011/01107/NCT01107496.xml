Substance or alcohol abuse/dependence within previous 6 months, or a positive urine drug screen at screening or baseline prior to first dose of study medication (SM). 5. Any known or suspected significant medical or psychiatric illnesses that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may impair interpretation of study results or constitute a significant safety concern in the context of the clinical trial 6. ECG abnormalities (clinically significant according to Investigator's opinion) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;90 or &gt;140 millimeters of mercury [mmHg], diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &lt;40 or &gt;90mmHg, or heart rate [HR] &lt;40 or &gt;100 beats per minute [BPM]) at screening. 7. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities; including presence of potential hepatic function impairment as shown by, but not limited to alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) values &gt;2 times upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) &gt; 2 times ULN, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &gt;3 times ULN, or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN . 8.
