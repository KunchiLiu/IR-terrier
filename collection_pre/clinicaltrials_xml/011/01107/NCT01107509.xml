	<brief_summary>This study will gather data on potential biomarkers in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and investigate their use as indicators of disease response. The results could eventually enable doctors to match levels of therapy to levels of biomarker on an individual basis and to increase the chance of disease response in patients. This study will also test a new paradigm in the treatment approach of advanced kidney cancer by using the drug everolimus in a neo-adjuvant setting, with the overarching goal of decreasing cancer recurrence rates and improving patient outcomes and survival.</brief_summary>
