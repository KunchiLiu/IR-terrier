	<brief_summary>Recent studies indicate that remote ischemic conditioning can protect the heart and other organs during cardiac surgery. The investigators aim to investigate whether such a stimulus can reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation or other complications following coronary artery bypass surgery.</brief_summary>
