	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is a systemic metabolic disease with significant morbidity and mortality due to damaging blood vessels. Increased blood sugar level is a hallmark of diabetes and is an contributes to the development of many of its complications. Multiple defects, e.g. impaired insulin secretion and impaired insulin action, contribute to the development of the disease. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy and durability of combination of drugs which correct the defects that lead to the development of diabetes on achieving adequate and durable control of blood sugar levels. Achieving adequate and durable control of blood sugar will prevent many of diabetes complications.</brief_summary>
