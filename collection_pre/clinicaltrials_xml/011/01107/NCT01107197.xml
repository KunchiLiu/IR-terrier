	<brief_summary>Pressure ulcers are frequently associated with malnutrition. Previous studies have reported that nutritional support can improve the healing rate of pressure ulcers but no attention has been clearly given to the nutritional status of the patient treated. Moreover, other investigators have suggested the additional healing power of some nutrients. Unfortunately, previous results have been unpowered by small sample size, poor monitoring of compliance to treatments and the confounding effect of other nutrients. The investigators aimed to test the effect and additional benefits of several micronutrients delivered through oral nutritional support on the healing rate of pressure ulcers in malnourished patients.</brief_summary>
