	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the incidence and severity of neutropenia in patients being treated for solid tumours with a Taxotere® based regimen when Granocyte® 34 is being used as a primary prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Secondary Objectives: Haematological : To evaluate the incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (with or without antibiotics) and anaemia in patients being treated for solid tumors treated with a Taxotere based regimen when Granocyte is being used as a primary prophylaxis. Non-Haematological : To evaluate the incidence and severity of the following adverse events: asthenia, anorexia, myalgia, nail changes and oral mucositis in patients with solid tumours treated with a Taxotere based regimen; when Granocyte is being used as a primary prophylaxis.</brief_summary>
