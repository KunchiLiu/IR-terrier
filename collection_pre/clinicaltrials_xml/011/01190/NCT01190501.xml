	<brief_summary>Our main objective is to assess whether aortic stiffness is a predictor of blood pressure response after surgery in patients with an aldosterone producing adenoma or a unilateral adrenal hyperplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arterial Stiffness Index as a Predictor of Surgically Correctable Primary Aldosteronism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives are to investigate whether aortic stiffness predicts cardiovascular , operative and postoperative morbid-mortality at 1 year, to evaluate the benefit of adrenalectomy in patients with primary aldosteronism due to unilateral adrenal hyperplasia and in patients with aldosterone producing adenoma associated with controlateral adrenal morphological abnormalities, and to participate to a national DNA repository of patients with primary aldosteronism.</detailed_description>
