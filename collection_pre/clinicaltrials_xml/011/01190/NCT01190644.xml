	<brief_summary>What hematopoietic precursor compartments as well as hemoglobin subtypes are affected by dosing with Sotatercept (ACE-011)? Based upon a similar prior study with Procrit, Celgene has determined that all of these goals could be obtained by an intense 10 patient, Sotatercept (ACE-011) pharmacodynamic study, completed by two well known experts in the red cell production field.</brief_summary>
