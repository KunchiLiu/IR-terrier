	<criteria>Able and willing to provide written informed consent. Male or female subjects, ≥ 18 years and ≤ 55 years of age Diagnosis of moderate asthma and on regular inhaled corticosteroids with or without short or longacting Beta2agonists FEV1 ≥ 55 % predicted in the absence of medications for asthma Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG)) at Screening, and a negative pregnancy test immediately before the administration of the study drug for each of Periods 1, 2 and 3. Sexually active females with nonsterile partner must be willing to use adequate contraception. Male subjects must be willing to use a condom with a spermicide for the duration of their participation in the study, plus an additional 30 days following study drug administration and ensure that their partner is using a highly effective method of birth control such as combined oral contraceptives, implants, injectables or an intrauterine device (IUD). Male subjects must ensure that their female partner is willing to use adequate contraception. Demonstration of an increase in FEV1 by ≥ 10 % predicted between spirometry performed before and 1020 minutes after the administration of 2 puffs of 100 micrograms of salbutamol at Screening. Clinically significant conditions or illnesses other than moderate asthma or systemic diseases Pregnant or nursing women or women intending to conceive during the course of the study or have a positive serum pregnancy test at Screening or a positive urine pregnancy test during the study. Women of childbearing potential (unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or postmenopausal for at least two years) not using a highly effective method of birth control. Nonsurgically sterile males and males with partners of childbearing potential not willing to use a condom with spermicide for the duration of their participation in the study plus an additional 30 days following study drug administration and to ensure that their partner is using a highly effective method of birth control such as combined oral contraceptives, implants, injectables or an IUD. Respiratory tract infections or worsening of asthma or changes in asthma medications within 6 weeks before Screening/Baseline. Current cigarette smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years or who stopped smoking within 12 months preceding enrolment in the study. Positive urine cotinine test at Screening. History of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse within 12 months before Screening. Positive test for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at Screening. Any medication that are known to prolong QT / QTc interval. Any of the following concomitant medications preceding the administration of salbutamol during Screening and preceding the administration of the study drug: Oral or i.v. corticosteroids within 1 month; Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids within 48 hours; Long acting Beta2agonists within 24 hours; Short acting Beta2agonists within 8 hours; Anticholinergic aerosols within 24 hours; and Theophyllinecontaining products within 48 hours. Use of NSAIDs within 7 days preceding the administration of salbutamol during Screening and throughout the study. Use of antihistaminic drugs within 3 days preceding the administration of salbutamol during Screening. Use of an investigational product or participation in a clinical trial using an investigational product within 30 days before dosing or within 90 days in the case of longacting products (ex.: Depomedrol) or biologics with a longacting halflife (ex.: monoclonal antibodies).</criteria>
