	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the memory immune response and the yearly persistence of the immunity against Japanese Encephalitis (JE) after vaccination with a new Japanese Encephalitis Chimeric Virus (JE-CV) in participants previously vaccinated with JE-CV. Objectives: - To describe JE immune status before, and after a JE-CV booster dose in subjects previously vaccinated with JE-CV - To describe the immune status before, and immune response following JE-CV vaccination in JE-na√Øve control subjects. - To describe the safety (in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse events) of a single dose of JE-CV up to 6 months after the last vaccination. - To describe all related serious adverse events (SAEs) and related deaths from 6 months to 5 years after vaccination in JE-CV-primed subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Japanese Encephalitis Chimeric Virus Vaccine (JE-CV) in Children Previously Immunized With JE-CV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants who are previously immunized with Japanese Encephalitis Chimeric Virus (JE-CV) vaccine will receive a single dose of the new JE-CV and will be followed up for 5 years for immunogenicity. The control (JE-CV naive) participants will receive either one dose of JE-CV or one dose of varicella vaccine. All participants will be monitored for safety for 6 month post vaccination.</detailed_description>
