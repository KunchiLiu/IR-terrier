	<brief_title>Have Malaria Infections in Kenya Become Less Responsive to Artemisinin Treatment?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) are the treatment of choice for episodes of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in all endemic countries. Rapid clearance of pathogenic blood stage malaria parasites by artemisinins is associated with swift recovery from mild malaria and reduced mortality from severe forms of the disease. In Kenya, and most malaria endemic sub-saharan Africa, artemether-lumefantrine has been introduced as first-line treatment in the public health care sector in 2006. Alarmingly, despite the short time since the introduction of ACTs artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum malaria has already emerged in South-East Asia, an area that has historically been the cradle of global spreads of drug-resistant malaria parasites. In a previous study in Kilifi we have observed a significant drop in early response rates to treatment with two ACTs from 2005 to 2008. Conventional markers of potential changes in anti-parasitic host immunity, drug exposure, or baseline parasite biomass could not account for the observed time-dependent change in response rates. This protocol aims to establish with reasonable confidence whether P. falciparum infections in Kilifi District have developed tolerance to the artemisinin class of drugs. We propose to study treatment response rates to an established 7-day regimen of artesunate alone in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children aged 6 months to 10 years, at the KEMRI study site in Pingilikani, Kilifi District, Kenya. The study will also assess (i) pharmacokinetic parameters of artesunate; (ii) ex vivo and in vitro chemosensitivity of parasite isolates to DHA; (iii) genetic determinants of altered in vivo and in vitro responses to DHA; and (iv) ex vivo expression profiles in normally vs. slowly responding P. falciparum infections before and during treatment.</detailed_description>
