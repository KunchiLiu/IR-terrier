	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity (measured by the amount of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1/ALDH1+ cells before and after treatment) of pre-operative bevacizumab in combination with conventional chemotherapy in breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant treatment, compared to a control arm receiving chemotherapy alone.</brief_summary>
