	<criteria>12 years of age or older Having a diagnosis of keratoconus Presence of central or inferior steepening Topography consistent with keratoconus Presence of one or more slit lamp or retinoscopy findings associated with keratoconus Contact lens wearers only:Removal of contact lenses for the required period of time Signed written informed consent Willingness and ability to comply with schedule for followup visits For keratoconus, a history of previous corneal surgery or the insertion of Intacs in the eye to be treated Corneal pachymetry â‰¤ 400 microns Previous ocular condition that may predispose the eye for future complications or prevent the possibility of improved vision A history of chemical injury or delayed epithelial healing in the eye(s) to be treated. Pregnancy (including plan to become pregnant) or lactation during the course of the study A known sensitivity to study medications Nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during the crosslinking treatment or other diagnostic tests A condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with or prolong epithelial healing. Presence or history of any other condition or finding that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable as a candidate for crosslinking or study participation or may confound the outcome of the study.</criteria>
