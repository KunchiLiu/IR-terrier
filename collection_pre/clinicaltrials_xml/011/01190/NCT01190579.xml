	<brief_summary>The trial will investigate the accuracy of Dual Source CT coronary angiography to detect coronary artery stenoses in patients with chest pain who have, based on clinical criteria, an intermediate likelihood for the presence of coronary artery stenoses. No beta blockers will be used to lower the heart rate for the examination. The hypothesis is that Dual Source CT will allow the detection of vessels with at least one coronary artery stenosis with a sensitivity of more than 90%.</brief_summary>
