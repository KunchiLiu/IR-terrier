	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: To validate the efficacy of multiparametric MRI, FDG-PET, RGD-PET, and PET-MR fusion imaging in the prediction and monitoring response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of locally advanced breast cancer patients. To identify the optimal combination parameters of MR spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, FDG-PET, and RGD-PET in the prediction and monitoring response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of locally advanced breast cancer patients. To compare the performances of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using parametric response map analysis versus those of pharmacokinetic parameters (Ktrans, kep, or Ve) in the early prediction of pathological responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrolled women with breast cancers who had received an anthracycline-taxane regimen and subsequent surgery were prospectively enrolled. DCE-MRI and FDG-PET scan were performed before and after the 1st cycle of chemotherapy. MR imaging parameters and SUV on PET scan within a tumor were analyzed. Clinicopathologic (age, clinical tumor stage, hormonal receptor status, and surgery type) and imaging parameters were compared according to the pathological response.</detailed_description>
