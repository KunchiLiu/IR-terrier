	<brief_title>Neural and Behavioral Outcomes of Social Skills Groups in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the fact that social skills impairments are the most persistent and pervasive symptoms affecting individuals with ASD, treatments targeting social skills have been the subject of few controlled investigations. The available literature suggests that cognitive behavioral techniques are commonly used and may improve targeted social skills in individuals with ASD. However, drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of social skills treatment remains difficult, particularly with respect to maintenance of skills and generalization to natural settings, owing to methodological limitations of extant studies (e.g., small sample size, lack of manual-based curricula, minimal assessment of generalization or maintenance). Several neuroimaging studies have found that individuals with ASD underactivate key brain regions involved in social cognition. However, there is also evidence to suggest that factors that increase attention to or interest in social stimuli are associated with more normal brain activity. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the acute and sustained effects of social skills treatment on social cognition and the neural architecture that supports it. High-functioning children with ASD will be randomly assigned to a 12-week cognitive behavioral social skills group or a social play-based therapy group. For both types of groups, a parent session will be held concurrently. Functional MRI scans as well as behavioral assessments of social cognition, adaptive functioning, and symptom severity will be acquired at baseline, immediately following treatment, and at a 3-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
