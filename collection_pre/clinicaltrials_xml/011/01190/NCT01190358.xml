	<brief_title>Grape Seed Extract and Postprandial Oxidation and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether taking grape seed extract prior to eating a high fat meal will reduce the inflammatory response in people with the metabolic syndrome. If this extract is shown to mitigate the inflammatory response induced by a high fat meal, it could potentially aid in postponing of the diagnosis of diabetes or other chronic diseases associated with high levels of inflammation.</detailed_description>
