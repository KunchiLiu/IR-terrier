	<brief_summary>This study will find how weight affects the dosing of a drug called sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Currently, the amount of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim a patient receives is the same regardless of the patient's weight. The entire cohort was analyzed for the study outcomes. BMI groups were for recruitment purposes only and were not used for ordinal data analysis. All sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Trade name is Bactrim or Septra) medication that you will receive in this study will be referred to as study medication within this informed consent form. This drug is a combination of two antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, which belongs to a class of medication known as "sulfones" and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of a wide variety of bacterial infections such as ear infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, traveler's diarrhea, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given orally.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects, age &gt;18 years, of all racial and ethnic origins. We are recruiting 12 normal or underweight (BMI &lt;25kg/m2), 12 overweight or obese (BMI 2540 kg/m2), and 12 extremely obese (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2) for this study. This index is calculated using the volunteer's height and weight (Formula: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703). Half of each group will be male; the other half will be female. Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the study. The effects of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim on pregnancy are unknown. In addition, the metabolic changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the concentrationtime profile of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, so that the pregnancy and postpartum state would be a confounding variable. Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases&gt;10 times upper limit of normal, Alkaline phosphatase&gt;5 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin&gt;5 times upper limit of normal. History of allergies to sulfones, sulfonamides or trimethoprim. Sulfones, sulfonamides or trimethoprim are contraindicated for any reason. Volunteers unwilling to comply with study procedures. Current suspected or documented ear infection, urinary tract infection, bronchitis, traveler's diarrhea, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or any other bacterial infection. Volunteers with colon resection, gastric bypass, lap band, or any other conditions inhibiting gastric absorption of drug. Current or previous participation within 28 days of enrollment in another research study that involves the use of medication, contrast, or any other compound that may alter blood count and/or blood chemistry (liver function, kidney function or electrolyte balance), unless waved by PI. Donation of 450mL (one unit) of blood or more within 8 weeks (56 days) prior to study enrollment, unless waved by PI. Current use of medications contraindication with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim use: Bepridil, Cisapride, Dofetilide, Levomethadyl, Mesoridazine, Pimozide, Terfenadine, and Thioridazine. Other medications will be screened by study investigators to ensure the safety of research participants and maintain the quality of the study.</criteria>
