	<brief_title>Non Invasive Measurement of Coagulation in Term and Preterm Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coagulation abnormalities among neonates aren't common - but can be life threatening. Testing the coagulation system in small babies involves drawing significant amounts of blood (especially in premature babies). Non-invasive testing can help assess and treat term and preterm neonates at risk. Recently, a non-invasive device to assess the blood coagulation status was developed - The Thrombo-Monitor (ThM). The objective of this study is to assess the reliability of this new non-invasive device among term and preterm babies by comparing the result of the ThM reading to coagulation analysis from blood.</detailed_description>
