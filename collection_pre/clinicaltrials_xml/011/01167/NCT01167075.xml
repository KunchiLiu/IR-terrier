	<brief_title>A Study in Critically Ill Patients Investigating Tolerability and Efficacy of Low-volume Pharmaconutrition (Intestamin)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare early supplementation with antioxidants and glutamine using an enteral pharmaconutrition supplement (Intestamin®) to an energy adjusted standard elementary diet and to investigate its affect on clinical efficacy and tolerability in critically ill patients with sepsis/SIRS. Methods: This was a prospective controlled randomized study in 58 critically ill patients. They received either Intestamin or a diluted Fresubin solution. After 10 or 14 days inflammatory parameters, catecholamine need, and maximal enteral delivery were determined.</detailed_description>
