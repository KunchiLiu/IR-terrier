	<brief_summary>This phase III clinical trial studies two different dose schedules of paclitaxel to see how well they work in combination with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with stage II, III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody and blocks tumor growth by stopping the growth of blood vessels that tumors need to grow. It is not yet known whether giving paclitaxel with combination chemotherapy once every three weeks is more effective than giving paclitaxel once a week in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Carboplatin With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the weekly paclitaxel regimen increases the time until first progression or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) compared to the every-3-week paclitaxel regimen in women with primary stage II, III or IV epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who are receiving carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the weekly paclitaxel increases the duration of overall survival compared to the every-3-week paclitaxel when combined with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. II. To compare the weekly paclitaxel to the every-3-week paclitaxel with respect to the incidence of severe or serious adverse events when it is combined with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. III. To compare the weekly paclitaxel to the every-3-week paclitaxel with respect to patients' self-reported quality of life (QOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O)-Trial Outcome Index (TOI), when paclitaxel is combined with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. (As of 02/08/2012, the QOL portion of this study is complete; patients enrolled after this date will not have QOL assessments) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with progression-free survival and toxicity in advanced stage epithelial ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer using genome wide association studies (GWAS).* II. To evaluate genomic signatures in tumor tissues which are predictive for patient survival in advanced stage epithelial ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer.* III. To evaluate the association between serum and plasma biomarkers and response to anti-angiogenesis therapy in advanced stage epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.* NOTE: *As of 02/08/2012, the translational research (TR) portion of this study is complete; patients enrolled after this date will not have TR specimens collected. IMAGING PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether larger changes in the tumor perfusion parameters from baseline timepoint (T0) to early-therapy T2 are prognostic of higher progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months (PFS-6) from enrollment in patients treated with weekly or every-3-week paclitaxel regimens, who are receiving carboplatin with or without bevacizumab.*** IMAGING SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether larger changes in tumor perfusion parameters from baseline T0 to intermediate T1 and from T1 to T2 are prognostic of higher PFS-6 in patients treated with weekly or every-3-week paclitaxel regimens, who are receiving carboplatin with or without bevacizumab.*** II. To determine whether larger changes in tumor perfusion parameters values from T0 to T1, T0 to T2, and T1 to T2 are prognostic of better overall survival in all treatment arms.*** III. To assess the association between changes in tumor perfusion parameters before and after chemotherapy initiation (T0 to T1) and subsequent best tumor response according to standard anatomic Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).*** IV. To assess the association between tumor perfusion parameters before chemotherapy and subsequent best tumor response according to RECIST, PFS-6, and overall survival.*** V. To test the assumption that tumor perfusion parameters are reliable, user-independent, and reproducible parameters of tumor microvascular characteristics; a subgroup of 15 patients will have repeat computed tomography (CT) perfusion studies at the intermediate T1 time point.*** NOTE: ***Patients enrolled after February 8, 2012 must participate in the ACRIN 6695 component at ACRIN-qualified institutions. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (beginning on 04-30-2012, the trial is no longer randomized and the chemotherapy regimen is selected and declared prior to enrolling in the study). ARM I (adjuvant chemotherapy suboptimally debulked): Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. ARM II (neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval cytoreductive surgery): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Patients undergo interval cytoreductive surgery between courses 3 and 4. Patients in both arms may receive optional** bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 beginning in course 2. Courses of bevacizumab repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in Arm II receive bevacizumab during courses 2, 5, and 6 only. NOTE: **Before enrolling onto this study, each patient chooses whether the study treatment will include concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
