	<brief_title>Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Red blood cell transfusions are extremely common medical interventions, yet, it remains unclear when patients should be transfused. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a research protocol that will lead to a large scale clinical trial designed to evaluate the treatment effectiveness of two transfusion threshold strategies in patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
