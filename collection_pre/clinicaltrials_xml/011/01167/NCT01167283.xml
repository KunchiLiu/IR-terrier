	<brief_title>Effect of Electrostimulation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Muscle dysfunction is a major problem in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is characterized by muscle fiber-type redistribution and oxidative stress. Classical training does not improve these features. Objectives: To investigate whether electrostimulation program following exacerbation can modify muscle structure and function in COPD patients. Method: We propose to conduct a controlled and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of muscle electrostimulation training of the lower limbs to sham training in 15 patients with COPD. Patients are included in either 6 weeks of electrostimulation training (active treatment group) or 6 weeks of sham electrostimulation. Primary outcomes were changes in muscle structure, muscle oxidative stress and their relationship with quadriceps force and exercise tolerance.</detailed_description>
