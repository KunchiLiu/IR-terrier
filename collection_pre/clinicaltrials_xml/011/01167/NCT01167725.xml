	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Heating mitomycin C to several degrees above normal body temperature and infusing it into the area around the tumor may kill more tumor cells. Giving mitomycin C after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether standard therapy is more effective with or without surgery followed by mitomycin C. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying standard therapy with or without surgery and mitomycin C in treating patients with advanced limited peritoneal dissemination of colon cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Therapy With or Without Surgery and Mitomycin C in Treating Patients With Advanced Limited Peritoneal Dissemination of Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced limited peritoneal dissemination of colon adenocarcinoma treated with systemic therapy with vs without cytoreduction surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal mitomycin C. - To compare the relative OS at 1 year of patients treated with these regimens. Secondary - To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with these regimens. - To compare the relative PFS at 1 year of patients treated with these regimens. - To compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - To compare the toxicity burden of these regimens in these patients. - To compare the OS and PFS according to patients' peritoneal surface tumor genotype for the NAD(P)H (quinone oxidoreductase 1 [NQO1] 609C &gt;T polymorphism [wild type vs heterozygous/homozygous mutant]) in patients treated with these regimens. - To compare circulating tumor cells in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presentation (synchronous vs metachronous carcinomatosis), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), disease volume (measurable vs non-measurable), prior first-line therapy for advanced disease (chemo-naïve vs prior first-line therapy), planned chemotherapy (oxaliplatin vs irinotecan vs fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium vs capecitabine), and planned biologic therapy (bevacizumab vs cetuximab vs none). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive standard systemic therapy, at the discretion of patients' oncologist, comprising combinations of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and/or capecitabine (including FOLFOX4, mFOLFOX6, CapeOx, or FOLFIRI) with or without bevacizumab (beginning 4-6 weeks after major surgery) or cetuximab*. Treatment repeats in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may crossover to arm II. NOTE: *For patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. - Arm II: Patients undergo cytoreduction surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal mitomycin C over 45-90 minutes. Beginning 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive standard systemic therapy as in arm I. Treatment with systemic therapy repeats for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and tissue samples may be collected from patients for correlative studies. Patients complete SF-36 Health Survey; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C); Feeling Sad, Down, or Depressed (CES-D); and a Brief Pain Inventory quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and then periodically during study. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>
