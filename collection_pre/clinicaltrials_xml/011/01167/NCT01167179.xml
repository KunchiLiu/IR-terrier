	<brief_title>Nurse-led Follow-up Care for Head and Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: After treatment for cancer, follow-up surveillance is regarded important. In head and neck cancer patients however, increasing research evidence shows that at least the goal of detecting recurrence of cancer during routine control visits in an asymptomatic stage is not achieved. Other goals of follow-up such as management of treatment complications and helping patients and families cope and adjust remain important and ask for an accurate, effective but tailored and sensitive approach. Increasingly, nurses are mentioned as care providers best suited to perform this task. Aim: The purpose of this study is to conduct an early evaluation of a nurse-led follow up intervention added to the usual medically oriented follow up care. Besides evaluating the feasibility and acceptability to patients, the effect on psychosocial adjustment and quality of life of patients is determined. Methods and design: A quasi-experimental prospective design is used. Two groups of patients are enrolled consecutively (n=160) and patient data are collected at baseline (T0), at 6(T1) and at 12(T2) months respectively. The duration of the intervention is defined to the first year of follow up. Participating nurses are trained prior to the recruitment of the intervention group and receive supervision and individual coaching during the entire duration of the intervention phase. Outcome measures: Primary outcome, psychosocial adjustment to illness. Secondary outcomes, health related quality of life, psychosocial problems, and usage of care.</detailed_description>
