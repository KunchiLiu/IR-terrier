	<brief_summary>Multicenter clinical study to test a new qualitative in vitro nucleic acid amplification assay based on kPCR technology. The assay is intended for the diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-center Evaluation of the VERSANTÂ® CT/GC DNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR)in Detecting C. Trachomatis and N. Gonorrhoeae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was terminated This clinical trial protocol outlines the analytical and clinical performance characteristics that will be evaluated to demonstrate equivalency of the VERSANT CT/GC DNA 1.0 (kPCR) Assay for product registration. The Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 Assay will be used as the CE-marked comparative method. The studies conducted during the clinical trial are intended to provide data to support the safety and effectiveness, as well as the labeling claims for the VERSANT CT/GC Assay. The study objectives are as follows: - To demonstrate concordance with the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 Assay; - To estimate the positive and negative predictive values for each specimen type included in the study; - To estimate the indeterminate rate for each specimen type included in the study; - To estimate the equivocal rate for each specimen type; and - To assess reproducibility of the VERSANT CT/CG DNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) using the VERSANT kPCR Molecular System. Two (2) studies will be conducted to validate the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the CT/GC DNA 1.0 (kPCR) Assay. Table 1 provides an overview of these studies.</detailed_description>
