	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of azacitidine and gemcitabine in subjects with previously untreated and unresectable pancreatic cancer. Also to determine the effect of azacitidine therapy on DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells.</brief_summary>
