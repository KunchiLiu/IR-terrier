	<brief_summary>The effect of Antibacterial Nanoparticles, Incorporated in root canal sealer material and in provisional restoration is going to be examined. Two different tests are planned: (1) clinical and radiological evaluation of root canal sealer.(2) An evaluation in the laboratory the efficacy of provisional restoration during root canal treatment.We assume, based on our previous laboratory studies that show antibacterial properties, that the incorporation of the nanoparticels will improve the treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study: the Antibacterial Effect of Insoluble Antibacterial Nanoparticles (IABN) Incorporated in Dental Materials for Root Canal Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. patients with molar teeth diagnosed with healthy pulp or irreversible pulpitis, and need root canal treatment, will be asked to participate in the study. After cleaning the teeth following a standard protocol, a sterile cotton wool will be placed in the pulp chamber. provisional restoration with (test group-40 patients) and without (control group- 40 patients) nanoparticles will seal the teeth between apointments. After a month the cotton wool will be taken out and tansferred to the laboratory. The root canal treatment will continue following the standard protocol. 2. patients with single canal teeth diagnosed with infected pulp and periapical lesion, and need root canal treatment, will be asked to participate in the study. Two study group (40 patients on each group) will have their canal sealed with a two types of endodontic sealers each + the nanoparticles. The control group (40 patients) will have their canal sealed with the conventional sealer alone. The patients will be invited to 4 follow ups: 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year during which a clinical and radiological examinations will be performed.While preparing the post, a small example of the sealer will be taken to a test in the lab.</detailed_description>
