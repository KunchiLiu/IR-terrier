	<brief_summary>Systemic Pulse Glucocorticoids have been shown to be effective in widespread Alopecia areata but not the totalis, universalis or ophiasic type. Whether the failure is due to inadequate dosing, inadequate frequency or other factors is a matter of debate. The investigators decided to conduct this study using the oral pulse steroid, however with higher doses and more frequent pulses to patients with severe forms of Alopecia areata.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a single-center, prospective, randomized study conducted in King Khalid University Hospital. Patients diagnosed with either Alopecia universalis, Alopecia totalis or Ophiasic alopecia will be included in the study. Patients with contraindications such as diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer, hypertension, infection, psychosis, heart or kidney disease, endocrine disorders (apart from a subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis) will be excluded. Children less than 5 years of age and those who received systemic or topical treatment within the last 4 weeks before enrollment will be also excluded. Those of child bearing potential had to have a negative urine pregnancy test result at baseline visit and should practice a reliable method of contraception throughout the study. 42 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups. Enrolled patients must provide written informed consent. Institutional review board approval will be obtained.</detailed_description>
