Therefore it is essential to exclude those subjects who show abnormalities with respect to their health parameters. Subjects were excluded to participate in the study based on certain criteria. These criteria were made in order to safeguard the health of the subjects enrolled into the study. Subjects incapable of understanding the informed consent.
