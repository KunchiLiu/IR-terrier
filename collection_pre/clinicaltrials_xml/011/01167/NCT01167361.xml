	<brief_summary>This study aims to prospectively estimate the incidence of Respiratory virus (RV) infections in children with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) using the FilmArrayTM System, a novel highly sensitive and rapid assay for RV detection. An aliquot from the leftover sample remaining after clinical diagnostic testing will be used for FilmArrayTM analysis. Patients will be accrued on the study over a one year period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective of the study is: - Prospectively estimate the incidence of Respiratory virus (RV) infections in children with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital(SJCRH). The Secondary Objectives of the study are: - Study the association between RV infections and clinical variables. - Prospectively estimate the duration of RV infections in symptomatic children at SJCRH. - Compare the sensitivity and specificity of the current molecular method of analysis of respiratory viruses with the FilmArrayTM method.</detailed_description>
