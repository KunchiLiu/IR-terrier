	<brief_summary>Obesity is increasing in France, resulting in an increased demand for bariatric surgery. However obesity also alters physiopathological pathways and the pharmacokinetics of anesthestic agents. The investigators objective is to compare, among morbidly obese patients, the immediate and intermediary emergence kinetics after balanced anesthesia using remifentanil associated either with desflurane (reference arm) or with xenon (experimental arm).</brief_summary>
