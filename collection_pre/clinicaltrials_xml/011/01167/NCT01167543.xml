	<brief_summary>This study investigates the prevalence and pathophysiology of dental and periodontal involvement in pediatric patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Primary objectives are to compare the prevalence of oral disease in children with and without a diagnosis or symptoms/signs of GERD in a cross-sectional study. Secondary objectives are to examine factors that might lead to the pathogenesis of the dental and periodontal lesions observed in this group of subjects. The primary hypothesis is to prove that children aged 10-18 years diagnosed with or having symptoms or signs of GERD have a significantly higher amount of dental erosions in comparison to a matched control group. Secondary hypotheses are that children aged 10 - 18 years diagnosed with or having signs of GER have higher DMFS (Decayed, Missing, Filled permanent tooth Surfaces) rates, higher SBI (Sulcus Bleeding Index) rates, worse Periodontal status, and lower saliva buffering capacity.</brief_summary>
