	<brief_summary>The use of acarbose in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetic subjects has been associated with a significant reduction of cardiovascular events. Additionally, acarbose has been shown to have a beneficial influence on some of the other cardiovascular risk factors (metabolic syndrome components). Thus, prevention of postprandial hyperglycemia by acarbose may be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing the increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Further studies are needed to confirm the influence of acarbose on cardiovascular risk factors in the real life setting.</brief_summary>
