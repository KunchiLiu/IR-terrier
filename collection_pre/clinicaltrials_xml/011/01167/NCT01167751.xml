	<brief_summary>One of the important reasons for human dying is Ischemic heart disease (IHD). The most reason is coronary artery disease. Beside morbidity, IHD induce myocardial infarction and necrosis which due to congestive heart failure. One therapeutic method is cellular cardiomyoplasty, which is to produce and substitute the cardiac cells with stem cell transplantation. Cell therapy is a potential therapeutic method to prevent ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. Human and animal studies have shown that stem cell trans plantation to myocardial infarcted zone can improve heart contractile function. The aim of this study is to comparison the effects of BM-derived AC133 and MNC implantation in patients with myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
