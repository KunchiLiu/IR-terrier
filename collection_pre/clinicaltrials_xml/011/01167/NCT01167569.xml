	<brief_summary>It has been shown that the stress that occurs during cardiac surgery leads to early decrease of many of the body's resources such as Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) which may contribute to complications after surgery. This study will investigate the effects of high doses of intravenous (IV) Vitamin C on the outcome and complications after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of High Dose Vitamin C On Outcome in Cardiac Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at significant risk for multiple major complications beyond those associated with other major operations. Most patients survive these events, but up to 10% develop injury to organ systems including the kidneys, lungs, pancreas, brain, etc. It has been shown that the stress that occurs during this critical period (cardiac surgery) leads to early decrease of many of the body's resources such as Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) which seem to contribute to these complications. This study will investigate the effects of high doses of intravenous (IV) Vitamin C administered before, during and after the cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
