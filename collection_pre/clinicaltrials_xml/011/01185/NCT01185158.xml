	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) ZD1839 has on one's squamous cell head and neck cancer. The research is being done because currently no effective treatment exists for metastatic (spread of cancer cells from one area of the body to another) or recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. The purpose of this study is to find out if ZD1839 can shrink tumors or cause tumors to stop growing for a period of time.</brief_summary>
