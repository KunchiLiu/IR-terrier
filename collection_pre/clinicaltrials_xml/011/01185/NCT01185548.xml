	<criteria>1. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy or lymphoma that is advanced and/or metastatic disease which has not responded to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. 2. Have given written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures. 3. Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale and an estimated life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. 4. Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancerrelated hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy for at least 30 days (45 days for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Limited field radiotherapy is permitted (in consultation with the investigator). 5. Have adequate organ function. 6. Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and are willing to follow study procedures. 7. Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug. 8. Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test less than 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 1. Have received treatment within 30 days of the initial dose of study drug with an experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval for any indication. 2. Have known allergies to tasisulam or related compounds. 3. Have serious preexisting medical conditions. 4. Show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease or central nervous system (CNS) disease (for example, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease). Patients with active brain metastasis are excluded. 5. Have current acute or chronic leukemia. 6. Females who are pregnant or lactating. 7. Have known positive test results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb). 8. History of severe allergies or multiple adverse drug reactions. 9. Are persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating tasisulam. 10. Have an abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study. 11. Serious concomitant systemic disorder, including diabetes or active infection, incompatible with the study. 12. Clinically significant cardiac symptomology. 13. Patients being treated with warfarin. 14. Patients being treated with sulfonylureas 15. Regularly use drugs of abuse and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening that is not in accordance with known/acceptable concomitant medication. 16. Patients who have received medications that are known inducers or inhibitors of CYP2C9 within 30 days prior to enrollment. 17. Have donated or lost blood of more than 500 mL within the last month. 18. Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week (males up to age 65) and 14 units per week (males over 65 and females) (1 unit = 12 oz or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits). 19. Failure for any reason to satisfy the investigator for adequate fitness to participate in the study. 20. Screening albumin levels less than 30 g/L.</criteria>
