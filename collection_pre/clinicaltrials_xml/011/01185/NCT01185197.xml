	<brief_title>MyforticÂ® for Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS): a Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, randomized study in which patients who present for the first time with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic MCNS proven on renal biopsy will be assigned to either conventional standard-dose prednisolone monotherapy or myfortic combined with low-dose prednisolone treatment for 6 months. Clinical response and relapse rates within 6 months of treatment cessation will be the main outcome parameters.</detailed_description>
