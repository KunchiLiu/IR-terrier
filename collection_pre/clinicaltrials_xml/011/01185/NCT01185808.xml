	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation in Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introductory Statement: Our laboratory has found that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) have insufficient levels of vitamin D3. This is a proposal to conduct a placebo controlled trial on the use of vitamin D3 (5,000IU/day for 6 weeks) to determine clinical and immunologic outcomes in these patients. General Investigational Plan: We routinely examine vitamin D levels in all patients with CRSwNP. Those that are insufficient (less than 32 ng/ml) and have agreed to undergo sinus surgery will be randomized to placebo or vitamin D3 supplementation (5,000IU/day) for 6 weeks prior to surgery. Blood will be drawn pre- and post-supplementation to examine systemic immune parameters such as dendritic cell and T cell expression and cytokine levels. Sinus tissue will be collected at the time of surgery to analyze local immune parameters (dendritic cell, T cell and cytokine levels) between supplemented and placebo groups. Clinical outcomes will be analyzed using quality of life questionnaires, endoscopic grading and nasal peak inspiratory flow pre- and post- supplementation. IRB approval for this research project is pending.</detailed_description>
