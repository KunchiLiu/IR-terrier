	<brief_summary>This study will examine whether weekly vitamin D supplementation in women with significant depressive symptoms and diabetes will exhibit improved mood and metabolic control. If supplementation with Vitamin D is beneficial, it will be a simple and cost-effective method for treatment. Women will be targeted since they have greater depression and worse metabolic control than men with diabetes.</brief_summary>
