	<criteria>The patient has histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed malignant soft tissue sarcoma (STS), including uterine leiomyosarcoma The patient has advanced STS, not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is 02 The patient has available tumor tissue from either the primary or metastatic tumor for determination of PDGFRα expression The patient has adequate hematologic function as defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 μL, hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 100,000/μL obtained within 2 weeks prior to study entry The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) The patient has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × the institutional ULN. If creatinine is above the ULN, the patient's creatinine clearance is ≥ 45 mL/min The patient has urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is ≥ 2+, a 24hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1 g of protein in 24 hours to allow participation Because the teratogenicity of IMC3G3 is not known, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active males must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation The patient has histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed Kaposi's sarcoma The patient has untreated central nervous system metastases The patient received prior treatment with doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, and/or other anthracyclines and anthracenediones (ie, mitoxantrone) The patient received prior radiation therapy to the mediastinal/pericardial area The patient has a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of a) curatively resected nonmelanomatous skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor treated with curative intent, no known active disease present, and no treatment administered during the last 3 years prior to study entry The patient is receiving concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy, including other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization, targeted therapy, or an investigational agent The patient has an elective or a planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the study The patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, requiring parenteral antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe myocardial insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements The patient has unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac stenting, or myocardial infarction 6 months prior to study entry The patient has known immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection The patient, if female, is pregnant or lactating The patient has a known allergy to any of the treatment components</criteria>
