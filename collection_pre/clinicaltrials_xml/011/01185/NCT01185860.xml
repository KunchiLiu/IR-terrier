	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of danoprevir (RO5190591) plus ritonavir as compared to danoprevir alone or placebo plus ritonavir in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 receiving Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and ribavirin. Patients in cohorts will be randomized to receive either oral doses of danoprevir, or danoprevir plus ritonavir, or placebo plus ritonavir. All patients will receive Pegasys (180mcg sc once weekly) plus ribavirin (1000-1200mg/day po), with the option to continue this treatment after completion of study drug treatment. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
