	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a severe chronic and disabling mental disorder and is associated with a significant reduction in life expectancy. Atypical antipsychotic treatment compliance may be jeopardized because of drug induced weight gain and abnormalities in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Aim: to gain data on drug related effects on gene expression and regulation with special regard to glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
