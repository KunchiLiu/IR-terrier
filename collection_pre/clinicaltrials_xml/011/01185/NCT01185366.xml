	<brief_title>Everolimus Versus Sunitinib in Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs: Everolimus is designed to stop cells from multiplying. It may also stop the growth of new blood vessels that help tumor growth, which may cause the tumor cells to die. Sunitinib is designed to block pathways that control important events (such as the growth of blood vessels) that are essential for the growth of cancer. Study Groups and Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. - If you are assigned to Group 1, you will take 2 everolimus tablets by mouth once every day. - If you are assigned to Group 2, you will take sunitinib capsules by mouth every day for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off. If you have any side effects from any of the drugs, tell the study doctor right away. The study doctor may then lower the dose or keep the dose level the same. Every 6 weeks on this study is called a study "cycle." If the disease gets worse or you have intolerable side effects while you are on study, you will have the chance to receive the study drug that you did not receive at first. The dosing and follow-up will be the same as for all participants in that group. Study Visits: On Day 1 of every cycle: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and a fasting blood sugar test. Blood or urine will also be used for a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. If you are in Group 1, you will have an additional 1 teaspoon of blood drawn to test your cholesterol. On Day 15 and 29 of Cycle 1: - Your vital signs and weight will be measured. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are in Group 1, an additional 1 teaspoon of blood will be drawn to measure your cholesterol. The Day 15 and Day 29 tests may be done at your local doctor's office. On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, and every other cycle after that (Day 1 of Cycle 5, 7, 9 and so on): °You will have a CT scan of the chest and a CT scan or MRI of the abdomen to check the status of the disease. Every 4 cycles (24 weeks): °If you are in Group 2, you will have an echocardiogram or MUGA scan to check your heart's health. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as you are benefiting. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. End-of-Treatment Visit: If you have stopped taking the study drug because of intolerable side effects, the treating physician will make every effort to check the status of the disease before you are taken off of study. Long-Term Follow-up: Once you are no longer on this study, the research staff will check up on you about every 6 months. This update will consist of a phone call or a review of your medical and/or other records. You will not have any extra tests, procedures, or study visits. If contacted by phone, the call would only last about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. Sunitinib and everolimus are both FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer. Up to 108 patients will be enrolled in this multicenter trial. Up to 108 patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have advanced nonclear cell RCC, which may include but is not limited to the following subtypes: papillary I or II, chromophobe, collecting duct carcinoma (CDC), translocation or unclassified. Patients with conventionaltype renal cell carcinoma who have &gt;/= 20% sarcomatoid component in their primary tumor are eligible. Patients who have sarcomatoid features in FNA or core biopsy of any metastatic site are eligible, if they have an underlying renal cell carcinoma primary tumor. 2. Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease that has not been previously irradiated. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation 3. ECOG performance status 01 4. Age &gt;/= 18 years 5. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function within 14 days prior to study entry as defined below: a) Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dl (tx allowed); b) absolute neutrophil count &gt;/=1,500/microL; c) platelets &gt;/= 100,000/microL; d) total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dl; e) AST(SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) &lt;/=2.5 X institutional uln, except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be &lt;/= 5 x ULN; f) Serum Creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN (as long as patient does not require dialysis) 6. INR and PTT &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN within 14 days prior to study entry. Therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin is allowed if target INR &lt;/= 3 on a stable dose of warfarin or on a stable dose of LMW heparin for &gt; 2 weeks (14 days) at time of randomization. 7.
