	<brief_summary>A single center, open label, randomized, clinical trial comparing ApoB/ApoA ratio of Vytorin 10/20mg vs atorvastatin 20mg treatment. DM2 patients will be screened for inclusion criteria. Patients (n=66 in each arm) will be randomized to either Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20mg or atorvastatin 20mg after 4 week washout or TLC period. Primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed at week 12. Primary endpoint: 1) change of ApoB/ApoA ratio at week 12. Secondary endpoint: 1. Change of lipid parameters (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, apoB 48) at week 12. 2. Change of HbA1C at week 12. 3. Change of HOMA index at week 12 - HOMA =[Fasting insulin (mIU/L) Ã— Fasting glucose (mmol/L)] / 22.5 4. Change of hsCRP at week 12 5. Safety assessment Hypotheses: - Three months treatment of Vytorin 10/20mg will be superior to atorvastatin 20mg in ApoB/ApoA ratio. - In DM patients, Ezetimibe/Simvastatin Combination will be well-tolerated.</brief_summary>
