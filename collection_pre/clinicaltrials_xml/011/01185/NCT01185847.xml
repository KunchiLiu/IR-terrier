	<brief_summary>This open label, 2-part study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of RO5083945 in combination with standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy. In Part 1 patients will receive RO5083945 intravenously and standard chemotherapy (cisplatin plus either gemcitabine or pemetrexed) for up to 6 cycles of 3 weeks and then RO5083945 until disease progression. In Part 2 patients will be randomized to receive either RO5083945 in combination with standard chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone for up to 6 cycles. In the absence of disease progression, patients receiving RO503945 can continue treatment with RO5083945 as monotherapy.</brief_summary>
