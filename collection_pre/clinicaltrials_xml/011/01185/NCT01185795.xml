	<brief_summary>Background: Several studies have reported limited or no reduction in serum lipid concentrations in response to probiotic formulations. More recently, probiotics have shown promise in treating metabolic disease, due to improved strain selection and delivery technologies. Objective: To evaluate the lipid lowering efficacy of a yogurt formulation containing microencapsulated Bile Salt Hydrolase (BSH)-active Lactobacillus reuteri cardioviva, taken twice per day over 6 weeks, in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Design: This is a double-blinded, multi-centric, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm study. The study will last a total of 10 weeks including 2-week wash-out, 2-week run-in, and 6- week treatment period.</brief_summary>
