	<brief_summary>This is a randomized open-label study to compare between in-vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) outcomes of the two regimen of Cetrotide® (Cetrorelix acetate) which are 0.25 milligram (mg) used from Day 1 or Day 7 of the menstrual cycle (Day 0 or Day 6 of stimulation) in polycystic ovarian (PCO) women in assisted reproductive technology (ART).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovarian syndrome population is an androgenic syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as obesity, hirsutism, insulin resistance, diabetes and presence of specific ultrasonic features. Cetrotide®, cetrorelix acetate, is an antagonist of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). Cetrotide® is registered in 70 countries (including France) for the prevention of premature ovulation in subjects undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by oocyte pick-up and ARTs. Ovitrelle®, active ingredient human chorionic-gonadotropin alfa, is administered to trigger final follicular maturation and luteinization after stimulation of follicular growth. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: - To compare the hormonal level of plasmatic estradiol on the releasing day (day of r-hCG administration) induced by Cetrotide® 0.25 mg/day started on Day 1 (Group A: Day 1) or on Day 7 (Group B: Day 7) of the menstrual cycle (Day 0 (S0) or Day 6 (S6) of stimulation) in PCO subjects undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures. Secondary objectives: - To compare the hormonal changes during the stimulation induced by Cetrotide® in A and B Groups - To assess by ultrasound scans (US) the follicular development induced by Cetrotide® in A and B Groups - To assess biological and clinical outcomes induced by Cetrotide® in A and B Groups - To monitor safety of Cetrotide in A and B Groups The trial will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Once each subject has met all eligibility criteria, they will be randomly assigned in one of the two treatment groups.</detailed_description>
