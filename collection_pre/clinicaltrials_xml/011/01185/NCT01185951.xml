	<brief_summary>Athletic tendinopathies of the upper and lower extremity are often therapeutically challenging. Colour and Power-Doppler-ultrasound visualizes pathological neovessels in painful tendons, which are associated with pain-mediating nerve fibres in such tendinopathies. These neovessels are represented by an increased capillary blood flow at the point of pain. Painful eccentric training reduces pain and improves function in Achilles tendinopathy substantially (evidence level Ib). Shock wave therapy in combination with eccentric training is superior to eccentric training alone (evidence level Ib). Long-term results suggest a collagen induction and reduced pain following topical glyceryl trinitrate (NO) (evidence level Ib). Colour- and Power-Doppler-guided sclerosing therapy using polidocanol reduces pain, improves function and may lead to tendon remodelling (evidence level Ib). Pain-restricted sport beyond pain level 5/10 during therapy is recommended (evidence level Ib). 3x10min of cryotherapy reduce pain and capillary blood flow (evidence level Ib). The role of proprioceptive training in tendinopathy has to be determined in future randomized-controlled trials (evidence level II). The investigators thought to evaluate the combination of the aforementioned individually successfully therapeutic options in athletes to shorten the recovery period and return to play interval.</brief_summary>
