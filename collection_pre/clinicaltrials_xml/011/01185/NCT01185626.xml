	<brief_summary>Earlier diagnoses and improved treatments have contributed to the growing cohort of cancer survivors. Nevertheless, these patients remain at risk for adverse long-term or late physical or psychosocial effects of cancer and its treatment. There is increasing recognition to improve information disclosure and cancer survivorship care. The American Institute of Medicine (IOM) and Health Council of the Netherlands both recommend that cancer survivors receive a summary of their course of treatment as a formal document, that also includes recommendations for subsequent cancer surveillance, management of late effects, and strategies for health promotion, the Survivorship Care Plan (SCP). However, no evidence exists concerning the positive and negative effects of the implementation of the SCP in daily clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of SCP care in routine clinical practice on cancer survivors' satisfaction with information disclosure and care, quality of life, illness perception, and health care use.</brief_summary>
