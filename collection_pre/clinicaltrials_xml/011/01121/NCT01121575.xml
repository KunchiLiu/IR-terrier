	<brief_summary>Lung cancer tumors become resistant to the first generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors erlotinib or gefitinib by changing and increasing the activity of two cell signaling pathways: the cMET pathway and the EGFR pathway. Both resistance mechanisms can occur at the same time, in the same patient and even in the same tumor. This study combines a second generation EGFR inhibitor and a cMET inhibitor to block both these pathways in order to overcome resistance and treat this disease.</brief_summary>
