	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase II trial will be to define the activity of a VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab, HER1/HER2 inhibitor pertuzumab, and sandostatin for patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers. In particular, the efficacy of bevacizumab and pertuzumab treatment is of great interest. The primary endpoint of this trial will be response rate. Toxicity and progression-free survival will be obtained and evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination of Bevacizumab, Pertuzumab, and Sandostatin for Adv. Neuroendocrine Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To determine overall response rate of patients with low grade neuroendocrine cancer when treated with the combination of bevacizumab, pertuzumab and sandostatin LAR®. - To determine the disease control rate (objective response + stable disease), time to treatment progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients with advanced low grade neuroendocrine cancer when treated with bevacizumab, pertuzumab and Sandostatin LAR® treatment. - To define the toxicity and safety of the combination of bevacizumab, pertuzumab and Sandostatin LAR® when used in patients with advanced low grade neuroendocrine cancer.</detailed_description>

Patients &gt;=18 years of age. 9. Patients must have a life expectancy &gt;12 weeks. 10. Patient must be accessible for treatment and followup. 11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed &lt;=7 days prior to start of treatment. Women of childbearing potential must use effective birth control measures during treatment. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must agree to inform her treating physician immediately. 12. Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study and give written informed consent, and comply with study requirements 1. Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, highgrade neuroendocrine carcinoma, adenocarcinoid, goblet cell carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, anaplastic carcinoid, and small cell carcinoma are not eligible. 2. Previous treatment with VEGF or EGFR inhibitors. 3. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy &lt;=4 weeks prior to study entry. 4. History or known presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases. 5. Patients who have had a major surgical procedure (not including mediastinoscopy), open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury &lt;=4 weeks prior to beginning treatment. 6. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating. 7. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of any component of treatment (bevacizumab, sandostatin, and/or pertuzumab). 8. Patients with proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;=2+ (patients discovered to have &gt;=2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24hour urine collection, and must demonstrate &lt;=1 g of protein/24 hours to be eligible). 9. Patients with a serious nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture. 10. Patients with evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation). 11. Patients with history of hematemesis or hemoptysis (defined as having bright red blood of ½ teaspoon or more per episode) &lt;=1 month prior to study enrollment. 12. History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina &lt;=6 months prior to beginning treatment. 13. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg and /or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg while on antihypertensive medications). Initiation of antihypertensive agents is permitted provided adequate control is documented at least 1 week prior to Day of study treatment. 14. New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart failure (CHF). 15. Serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. 16. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair, or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) &lt;=6 months prior to Day 1 of treatment. 17. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack &lt;=6 months prior to beginning treatment. 18. Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 19. History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation &lt;=6 months prior to Day 1 of beginning treatment. 20. Concurrent severe, intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 21. Any known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus or acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. 22. Mental condition that would prevent patient comprehension of the nature of, and risk associated with, the study. 23. Use of any nonapproved or investigational agent &lt;=28 days prior to administration of the first dose of study drug. Patients may not receive any other investigational or anticancer treatments while participating in this study. 24. Past or current history of neoplasm other than the entry diagnosis with the exception of treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other cancers cured by local therapy alone and a DFS &gt;=5 years. 25.
