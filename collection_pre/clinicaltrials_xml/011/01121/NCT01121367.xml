	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the expression of biological markers in induced sputum and peripheral blood T lymphocytes of patients with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). The features of CPFE would be observed, including pulmonary function tests and fractional exhaled nitric oxide （FENO）.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Phenotypic Characterization of Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new disease including concomitant upper-lobe emphysema and lower-lobe fibrosis in radiology has been defined as (combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, CPFE). CPFE has distinct clinical characteristics with the emphysema and the pulmonary fibrosis, including gender, age, clinical manifestation, pulmonary function tests and prognosis. Normally Th1/Th2 is balanced. However, patients with emphysema had a significantly higher expression of Th1. On the other hand, higher expression of Th2 is involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The expressions of Th1 and Th2 were proved to play a central role in pathogenesis of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, while are still unknown in patients of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. The study would observe the Th1/Th2 expression, pulmonary function tests , fractional exhaled nitric oxide （FENO）and other features in CPFE patients.</detailed_description>
