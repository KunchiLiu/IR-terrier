	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a human monoclonal antibody against Hepatitis C (MBL-HCV1) is effective in preventing detectable levels of Hepatitis C virus in patients undergoing liver transplantation due to chronic HCV infection. The study will also determine if MBL-HCV1 is effective in delaying or reducing the amount of detectable HCV in patients after transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infected Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation to Evaluate a Human Monoclonal Antibody Against Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study in Hepatitis C (HCV) infected patients undergoing liver transplantation. Chronically infected patients with HCV genotype 1a scheduled to receive a liver transplant from either a deceased or living donor who satisfy all study inclusion or exclusion criteria will be approached to participate. The study will be conducted in two parts to test a human monoclonal antibody against Hepatitis C (MBL-HCV1). In Part 1, sixteen eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive 50 mg/kg MBL-HCV1 or 0.9% sodium chloride placebo intravenously. Eleven doses will be given during the first 14 days post transplantation. Patients will be evaluated through day 56 for safety and clinical outcomes that include measurement of anti-HCV antibodies, anti-drug antibody and HCV viral load. On study visit day 42, a liver biopsy will be performed for evaluation of hepatitis. Physical examination, vital sign measurements, emergence of adverse events and concomitant medication usage will be assessed at scheduled visits and as needed during the 56 day study period. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board will perform a futility analysis after the first 16 patients have been enrolled and completed study follow-up through study visit day 42 post transplant. Based on the results of the interim analysis, the dose of MBL-HCV1 for part 2 of the study will be determined. Part 2 of the study will be conducted in the same manner as Part 1.</detailed_description>

Positive serology for Hepatitis B surface Antigen Positive serology for HIV Pregnancy or breastfeeding Previous history of any organ transplant Planned receipt of combined organ transplant (e.g. liver and kidney) Receipt or planned receipt of immune globulin (IVIG) within 90 days of enrollment History of extrahepatic malignancy and/or receiving chemotherapy within 90 days prior to enrollment with the exception of chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor burden outside of the Milan criteria History of chronic renal insufficiency or creatinine &gt; 2.5 for ≥ six months Personal or family history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism Receipt of liver allograft from HCV positive donor or Hepatitis B core antibody positive donor Receipt of liver allograft donated after cardiac death of donor Receipt of any antiviral agents, licensed or investigational for hepatitis C virus within 90 days prior to enrollment Receipt of any other investigational study product within 30 days prior to enrollment Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of the patient participating in the study or make it unlikely that the patient could complete the study</criteria>
