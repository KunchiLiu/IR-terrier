	<brief_summary>The general aim of this study is to determine if 3 MIU of IFN-α5 in monotherapy, and 1,5 MIU of IFN-α5 combined with 1,5 MIU of IFN- α2b, are safe dose levels as well as to investigate the antiviral efficacy and pharmacodynamics (PD) of such doses and drugs in treatment-experienced HCV patients with genotype 1 chronic infection, after 29 days of treatment. It is also intended to determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of the safe dose achieved of IFN-α5 in monotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients aged ≥18 years old, 2.

Patients with CHC infection of genotype 1 (1a, 1b or mixed 1a/1b) 4. Defined as relapsers: those CHC patients who had achieved virologic response (HCVRNA non detectable) at any time during the standard care of treatment for CHC with IFNα2 or PegIFNα2 + ribavirin, and maintained it trough the end of treatment at week 48 weeks, but HCVRNA detection occurs before 6 months posttreatment. 5. In whom liver cirrhosis has been ruled out through fibroscan or liver biopsy within 24 months prior to study enrolment. 6. With a serum HCV viral load ≥ 100.000 IU/mL at screening 7. With alanineaminotransferase (ALT) and aspartateaminotransferase (AST) serum measurements at screening less than 5 times of their upper limits of normal (ULN) 8. With a body mass index (BMI) of at least 18 kg/m2, but not exceeding 36 kg/m2. 9. For female subjects with childbearing potential: use of a known highly effective method of birth control 10. For male subjects with partners of child bearing potential: use of appropriate contraceptive methods. 11. Is able to effectively communicate with the investigator and other testing center personnel. 12. Is able to participate and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the study restrictions. Exclusion Criteria(principal): 1. Hepatitis C infection of genotype 2, 3 or 4 or any mixed genotype (1/2, 1/3 and 1/4). 2. A positive ELISA for HIV1 or HIV2. 3. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on the presence of HBsAg. 4. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection based on the presence of antiHAVIgM. (AM 4)Criteria deleted 5. Decompensated liver disease, or history of decompensated liver disease. 6. History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with decompensated renal, immunologically mediated, chronic pulmonary, cardiac, thyroid, severe retinopathy, severe psychiatric, organ transplantation, cancer, seizure disorder or pancreatitis diseases. 7. An active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within the last five years. 8. Patients with a documented drug and alcohol addiction free history of at least 12 months who are, in the opinion of the investigator unlikely to relapse, may be enrolled in the study. 9. Positive results for drug abuse at screening.Occasional use of cannabis previously to randomization is not an exclusion criteria under investigator team criteria. The patient should be advised of abstinence during the trial (AM 6) 10. Haemoglobin &lt;12.0g/dL for women, and &lt;13.0g/dL for men at screening. 11. White blood cell count &lt;2000 cells/mm3 at screening. 12. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm3 at screening. 13. Platelet count &lt;100.000 cells/mm3 at screening. 14. ALT and AST levels ≥ 5 xULN at screening. 15. Prothrombin time INR prolonged to 1.5xULN at screening. 16. TSH an T4 outside normal limits and not adequately controlled thyroid function at screening. 17. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus as evidenced by HbA1c &gt;7.5% at screening. 18. Alfafetoprotein value &gt;100ng/mL at screening. 19. Total bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN with ratio of direct/indirect &gt;1, at screening unless predominantly conjugated and reflecting Gilbert's disease 20. Estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/minute or less at screening. 21. Women who are confirmed to be pregnant 22. People with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the investigational agents 23. Patients who are at risk of bleeding. 24. Haemoglobinopathy 25. Screening ECG QTc value ≥ 450ms and/or clinically significant ECG findings. 26. History of clinically significant drug allergies. 27. Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug, biologic, or device within 3 months prior to anticipated dose administration. 28. Any chronic viral (including HSV), bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, parasitic, or protozoal infection. 29. Requirement for chronic systemic corticosteroids. 30. Receiving systemic antivirals, hematopoietic growth factor, or immunomodulatory treatment within 30 days prior to enrollment.</criteria>
