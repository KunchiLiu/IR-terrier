	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: the intracellular concentrations of raltegravir (RAL) and etravirine (ETV) administrated as 800 and 400 mg once a day, respectively, are similar to those obtained with the standard doses of 400 and 200 mg/12h, respectively. Objective: To analyze the plasma and intracellular concentrations of RAL and ETV administrated as 800 and 400 mg once daily respectively compared with standard doses of 400 and 200 mg/12h, respectively, and if they support its once daily administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To analyze the plasma and intracellular concentrations of RAL and ETV administrated as 800 and 400 mg once daily respectively compared with standard doses of 400 and 200 mg/12h, respectively, and if they support its once daily administration. Method: Phase IV, prospective, open labelled clinical trial with a planned duration of 24 weeks in which 16 patients from Hospitales Universitarios Virgen del Roc√≠o will be enrolled. A 12 hours pharmacokinetic profile (immediately before and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h) will be obtained after a supervised drug intake while taking RAL or ETV bid. Afterwards,the patients will take RAL or ETV once a day for 7 - 10 days. Subsequently, a new pharmacokinetic profile (predose and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h after a supervised drug intake) will be obtained.</detailed_description>
