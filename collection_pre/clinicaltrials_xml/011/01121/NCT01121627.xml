	<brief_summary>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, progressive illness. It is a multi-system disease that influences not only the motor but also the cognitive and autonomic systems. The main cognitive impairment in individuals with PD is found in executive function (EF). EF is defined as a set of cognitive skills necessary for planning, monitoring and executing sequences of complex activities. The primary study hypothesis is that computer-based training aimed at improving executive function will have a beneficial effect on gait functions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, progressive illness. It is a multi-system disease that influences not only the motor but also the cognitive and autonomic systems. The main cognitive impairment in individuals with PD is found in executive function (EF). EF is defined as a set of cognitive skills necessary for planning, monitoring and executing sequences of complex activities. Previous studies have revealed some relation between cognitive states and physical functions in healthy adults. Few studies have examined the effect of computer-based cognitive training on various populations. These studies showed a positive emotional-cognitive effect in those populations. This type of intervention plan was also applied to PD patients. However, there are no reports on the effect of intentional cognitive training on gait functions. The purpose of the study is to assess whether cognitive training, designed to improve EF ability, can also improve gait function in PD patients.</detailed_description>
