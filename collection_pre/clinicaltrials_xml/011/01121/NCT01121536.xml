During the previous doubleblind study, the patient must have been taking 1 (or 2) of the following protocolallowed mood stabilizers: lithium; valproic acid; olanzapine; quetiapine; aripiprazole; lamotrigine; risperidone; ziprasidone, (only if taken in combination with lithium, valproic acid, or lamotrigine). The following criteria must also be met: 1. The mood stabilizers must be taken in an oral formulation, with the exception of risperidone, which can be either in an oral or longacting injection formulation. 2. The patient may be taking 2 protocolallowed mood stabilizers only if 1 of the drugs is lithium, valproic acid, or lamotrigine. 3. The patient must be judged by the investigator to be compliant with treatment with the mood stabilizer(s). 4. The patient must be willing to continue treatment with the same protocolallowed mood stabilizer(s) at dosages considered appropriate by the investigator. The patient has a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score of 14 or less at the enrollment visit. Patients who have a YMRS score of 12 through 14 must be discussed with the medical monitor to determine their suitability for enrollment.

The patient has psychotic symptoms or had psychosis during the doubleblind study. The patient has current active suicidal ideation, is at imminent risk of self harm, or has a history of significant suicidal ideation or suicide attempt at any time in the past that causes concern at present.
