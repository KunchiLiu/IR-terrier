	<criteria>Male or female adults (age &gt; 18 years). On chronic haemodialysis due to endstage renal disease (CKD5) of original or grafted kidneys for any duration. Diagnosed with renal anaemia; i.e., anaemia due to impaired production of endogenous erythropoietin secondary to kidney failure. Treated with commercially available intravenous EPOETIN ALFA HEXAL® per physician's best clinical judgment and under consideration of available guidance and evidence. Female patients must be either postmenopausal for one year or surgically sterile or using effective contraceptive methods such as barrier method with spermicide or an intrauterine device. Oral contraceptive use is allowed. Informed written consent to participate in the study by patients or their legal guardian. Known sensitivity to EPOETIN ALFA HEXAL® or any other ESA. Solid or hematological neoplasia being treated with chemotherapy. Treatment with any myelosuppressant medications. Blood transfusion dependency. History of pure red cell aplasia. Bleeding episode in 30 days prior to enrollment. Orthopaedic surgery in 30 days prior to enrollment. Patients with several medical condition(s) that in view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study. Patients with willfully negligent nonadherence to their haemodialysis, medication, nutrition, and/or other recommended treatment regimens.
