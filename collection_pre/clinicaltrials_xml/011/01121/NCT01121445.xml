	<brief_summary>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most commonly used treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal symptoms such as dryness, itching and congestion are common in CPAP users. Nasal and sinus saline irrigation has been shown to improve these symptoms in individuals with chronic nasal congestion and sinusitis. This is an 8 week study that investigates whether daily saline nasal and sinus irrigation reduces nasal symptoms in patients using CPAP, improves quality of life and CPAP compliance.</brief_summary>
