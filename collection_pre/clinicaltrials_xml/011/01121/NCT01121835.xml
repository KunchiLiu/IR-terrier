	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of a strategy with insulin glargine in comparison with a strategy including the premixed insulin in term of percentage of patients reaching HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) below 7% at the end of treatment and who do not experience documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (confirmed by a Plasma Glucose (PG) below 56 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L)) over a 24-week treatment period, in Type 2 diabetes patients failing lifestyle management and oral agents. Secondary Objectives: To assess the effect of insulin glargine in comparison with premixed insulin on : - Evolution of HbA1c level during the treatment period Percentage of patients who reach the target of HbA1c &lt; 7 % and who do not experience documented symptomatic hypoglycemia confirmed by a Plasma Glucose (PG) below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) - Percentage of patients who reach the target of HbA1c &lt; 6.5% and who do not experience documented symptomatic hypoglycemia confirmed by a PG below 56 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) &gt;Percentage of patients who reach the target of HbA1c &lt; 6.5% and who do not experience documented symptomatic hypoglycemia confirmed by a PG below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) &gt;Evolution of Fasting Plasma Glucose Evolution of 7-point plasma glucose profiles - Evolution of weight - Hypoglycemia occurrence - Dose of insulins - Evolution of liver function - Overall safety</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Type 2 diabetes diagnosed for more than 1 year Insulin naïve Treated with lifestyle interventions and oral antidiabetic drugs, at least metformin at the maximum tolerated dose (with a minimum dose of 1g/day), for at least 3 months HbA1c ≥ 7.0 % and ≤ 10.5% Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 40 kg/m2 Ability and willingness to perform plasma glucose (PG) monitoring using the sponsorprovided glucose meter and to complete the patient diary Willingness and ability to comply with the study protocol Signed informed consent obtained prior any study procedure Exclusion criteria: Treatment with glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) agonists in the 3 months prior to study entry Previous treatment with insulin (except for treatment of gestational diabetes or brief treatment with insulin for less than 1 week) Diabetes other than type 2 diabetes (e.g. type 1 diabetes, diabetes secondary to pancreatic disorders, drug or chemical agent intake) Pregnant or lactating women (women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at study entry and a medically approved contraception method) Hospitalized patient (except for routine diabetes checkup) Active proliferative retinopathy, as defined by a photocoagulation or vitrectomy occurrence in the 6 months prior to study entry, or any other unstable (rapidly progressing) retinopathy that may require photocoagulation or surgical treatment during the study, documented by retina examination, in the 2 years prior to study entry History of sensitivity to the study drugs or to drugs with a similar chemical structure Impaired renal function: creatinine clearance &lt; 60ml/min Impaired liver function (ALT, AST &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal range) Severe gastrointestinal disease Treatment with corticosteroids with potential systemic action within the 3 months prior to study entry Likelihood of requiring treatments during the study which are not permitted Treatment with an investigational product in the 30 days prior to study entry Alcohol or drug abuse within the last 5 years The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
