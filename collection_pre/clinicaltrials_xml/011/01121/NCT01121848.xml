	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate that the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin (LV) will improve the Progression-Free Survival (PFS). Progression is based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria or death Secondary Objective: To evaluate other measures of tumor responses, safety, quality of life (QoL), and health utility assessment.</brief_summary>
