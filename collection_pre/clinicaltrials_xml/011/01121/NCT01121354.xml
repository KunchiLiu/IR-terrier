	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Cefazolin 2g for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in the DUPLEXÂ® Drug Delivery System to Cefazolin 1.5g for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in daily doses of 6g in healthy adult subjects for 11 days of administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>B. Braun Medical Inc. intends to conduct human PK studies and obtain marketing approval for Cefazolin 2g in the United States with identical indications of those already approved for the 1g strength. A pharmacokinetic study will be conducted with the Cefazolin 2g product manufactured by B. Braun Medical Inc. Cefazolin 1.5g dose will be prepared using 10g Cefazolin pharmacy bulk with 5% Dextrose. The clinical study proposed in this protocol is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 2g and 1.5g Cefazolin in Dextrose in healthy subjects at the maximum recommended infusion dose of 6g per day per FDA's recommendation. The study is designed to simulate clinical practice and overall experience with cephalosporin administration. Cefazolin may be reconstituted with dextrose (or a number of other diluents as recommended in the innovator's package insert) in order to achieve an osmolality appropriate for intravenous infusion. According to B. Braun's approved package insert for Cefazolin 1g, the maximum dose of 1.5g Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is 1.5 grams every 6 hours for severe, life-threatening infections. In rare instances, doses of up to 12 grams of Cefazolin per day have been used. Lower doses are stated in the B. Braun package insert.</detailed_description>

Use of any medication on a chronic basis. Takes any medication which interferes with the study drug or study procedures including aminoglycosides, anticoagulants, and probenecids. Use of over the counter (OTC) medications (including vitamins), prescription medications, or herbal remedies from 14 days prior to Day 1 until end of study. By exception, acetaminophen &lt;= 1 gram per day is permitted. Tobacco use during the last 2 months prior to enrollment. Positive screening test for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Positive urine drug test (cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, etc.) at Screening or Day 1 Positive blood test for ethanol at screening or Day 1. At screening, the subject has a clinically relevant ECG change, as assessed by the PI or designee. Concurrent acute or chronic infections (e.g. viral infections, except chronic recurrent herpes infections) History of or ongoing alcohol abuse or drug abuse (within last 2 years). Received an Investigational drug or device within 30 days of first dose of study drug Clinically relevant medical conditions which are likely to interfere with the evaluation of the trial drug, e.g. COPD, metabolic disorders (such as clinical and subclinical diabetes mellitus), history of malignant diseases (within last 5 years), autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular disease Any planned medical intervention or personal event that might interfere with the ability to comply with the study requirements Any condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data Unable or unwilling to adhere to the studyspecified procedures and restrictions</criteria>
