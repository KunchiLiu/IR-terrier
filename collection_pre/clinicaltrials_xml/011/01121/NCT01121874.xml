	<brief_summary>Thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) arthritis affect 1 in 4 females and 1 in 12 males. Patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment may benefit from surgery; however, controversy exists over the most effective surgical technique. A popular technique, ligament reconstruction with tendon interposition (LRTI) involves a trapeziectomy, followed by reconstruction of the palmar oblique ligament using a harvested flexor tendon from the wrist. We believe that use of a suture fixation system to reconstruct the palmar oblique ligament, instead of harvesting a wrist tendon, may provide a superior repair. The objective of this study is to compare functional outcome measurements among patients who receive CMC arthroplasty using a suture fixation system (investigational group) to those who receive LRTI surgery (control group). We hypothesize that patients in the investigational group will demonstrate superior functionality, compared to patients in the control group.</brief_summary>
