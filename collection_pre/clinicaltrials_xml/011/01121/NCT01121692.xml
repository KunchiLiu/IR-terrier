	<brief_summary>Couples who use alcohol and other drugs (AOD) in South Africa are at high risk for engaging in risky sex behavior within their relationships and with other sexual partners. In addition, high levels of gender-based violence (GBV) in the Cape Town area intersect with AOD abuse and sex behavior. All of these interconnections raise concern for the importance of HIV prevention strategies within or surrounding drinking venues, where many of these behaviors occur. The specific aims of this study are as follows: Aim 1. To characterize the types of drinking venues (e.g., licensure status, size, plumbing, type of alcohol provided), their immediate context (e.g., observed availability and use of other drugs, observable violence and sexual activity), and surrounding neighborhood characteristics (e.g., quality of streets, building structures, and availability of electricity and plumbing) in the sampled neighborhood blocks in several large Black/African and Coloured communities in Cape Town, South Africa. Aim 2. To refine through qualitative methods the proposed interventions in relation to skills-building to address gender-role expectations, sexual partnering, gender and power, violence, and environments where drinking and sexual risk behaviors occur. Aim 3. To conduct a randomized group trial to compare the relative efficacy of a comprehensive intervention (Condition 3: Enhanced Couples) to the gender-focused intervention (Condition 2: Gender) and to (Condition 1: Men's Control and Women's CoOp) on reducing alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, sexual risk behavior, and gender-based violence at 6 month follow-ups. Aim 4. To assess the mechanisms through which the intervention effects may occur (e.g., mediators involving self-efficacy and condom mastery, negotiation, and communication skills) and to identify groups for whom the interventions have the greatest effect (e.g., partner characteristics such as race, gender, and age and neighborhood factors such as poverty) on study outcomes of AOD use, sexual risk, and gender-based violence.</brief_summary>
