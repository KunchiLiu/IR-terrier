	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety associated with Supralimus-Core™ Sirolimus Eluting Coronary Stent system in the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries between 2.5 to 3.5 mm in diameter.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supralimus-Core™ Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centric, interventional, non-randomized, open label, Uncontrolled, single group assignment, Pharmacokinetics study. Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be followed for 48 days post-procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions located in epicardial vessel who qualify for percutaneous coronary intervention will be included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified below: 1. Age ≥18 years. 2. Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 3. Acceptable candidate for CABG 4. Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive territorial functional study. Documented stable angina pectoris ((Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification 1, 2, 3 or 4) or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (Braunwald Class IBC, IIBC or IIIBC), or documented silent ischemia. 5. The target lesion is a single de novo coronary artery lesion with ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% stenosis in one of the major epicardial territories (LAD, LCX or RCA). A second target lesion in another major epicardial vessel could be treated and this second lesion should fit with the inclusion/exclusion criteria and will receive the same type of stent. 6. The target lesion must be covered by one study stent, preferably with a margin of 3 mm on each side of the lesion. 7. The target lesion must be ≤ 34 mm in length by visual estimate. 8. The target reference vessel diameter must be ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm. 9. Patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as notified / approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the clinical site. 1. Female of childbearing potential 2. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 25% 3. Evidence of an acute Qwave or nonQwave myocardial infarction within 72 hours preceding the index procedure 4. Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®, Ceruvin) or ticlopidine (Ticlid®), heparin, sirolimus, cobalt chromium, contrast agent (that cannot be adequately premedicated) 5. A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm3 6. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dl or &gt;150µmol/L) 7. Target vessel has evidence of thrombus 8. Target vessel is excessively tortuous which makes it unsuitable for proper stent delivery and deployment 9. Previous bare metal stenting (less than 1 year) anywhere within the target vessel 10. Previous drugeluting stenting anywhere within any epicardial vessel 11. The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent placement (e.g. but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, etc.) 12. Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require revascularization or impede runoff 13. Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion which cannot be successfully predilated 14. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft 15. Ostial target lesion 16. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study, including its followup period 17. Within 30 days prior to procedure, patient has undergone a previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind 18. Within 48 days postprocedure, patient requires planned interventional treatment of any nontarget vessel. Planned intervention of the target vessel after the index procedure is not allowed. 19. CVA within previous 6 months 20. Unprotected Left Main (LM) coronary artery disease (stenosis &gt;50%) 21. In the investigator's opinion, patient has a comorbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the study, compliance with followup requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study 22. Planned surgery within 48 days after the index procedure 23. Life expectancy less than 1 year 24. Any contraindication to blood sampling</criteria>
