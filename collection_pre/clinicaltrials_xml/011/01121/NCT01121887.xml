	<brief_summary>Aim: to assess the effect of adding Motivational Interviewing (MI) to the existing smoking cessation treatment protocol at the Swedish National Tobacco Quitline (SNTQ). Methods: Experienced counsellors at SNTQ either received further training in the standard treatment (ST) protocol (including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)) or a comprehensive regime of training in MI. 1309 clients were randomized to either the ST group or the group with MI added to the treatment protocol. In order to ensure treatment integrity among counsellors, MI skill was assessed using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code (MITI).</brief_summary>
