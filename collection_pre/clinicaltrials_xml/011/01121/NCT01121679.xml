	<brief_summary>Because of increased life expectancy and improved therapeutic methods in cardiology, the proportion of very old patients with cardiovascular disease increases. However, clinical practice "in real life" are still insufficiently known in this population. The recommendations still lack of studies specifically devoted to elderly or very elderly, an extrapolation of data based on evidence obtained in younger populations. This is a multicenter observational study during a day. On this day, all participating centers fill a questionnaire for each patient 80 years or older hospitalized in their service.</brief_summary>
