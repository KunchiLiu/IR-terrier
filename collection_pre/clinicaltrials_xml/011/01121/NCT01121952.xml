	<brief_title>The Effect of Manipulation on Dysfunction of the Talo-crural Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle sprains is one of the most common problems in clinical practice, mostly due to loss of mobility. Factors affecting the mobility of the joints may be due to muscle tension, ligamentous or anatomical anomalies. Research over the last years have reported a scarce of trials investigating chiropractic treatment of the ankle joint. Previous studies have focused on investigating ROM and proprioception. This study aimed to determine whether a single high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust manipulation to the talo-crural joint altered ankle function in subjects with dysfunction of the talo-crural joint.</detailed_description>
