Free T below the median for healthy women of reproductive age All participants will be required to have a treatment team in place that consists of (at least) a primary care physician and a psychotherapist. Participants will need to have had regular contact with a primary care physician and be in an individual psychotherapy program. Participants will agree to continue with this treatment team and therapy throughout the active course of the study. If participants are taking psychotropic medications, the dose must be stable for 3 months before study entry Pregnant women or women of child bearing potential who are not using medically accepted means of contraception (to include oral contraceptive, patch or implant, condom, diaphragm, spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or partner with vasectomy).

A study psychiatrist will assess whether PRN medications and dose changes are clinically significant enough to defer enrollment of specific potential study subjects. Untreated hypothyroidism If receiving estrogen therapy, including oral contraceptives or transdermal estrogen therapy, significant change in dose in the prior 3 months Use of androgens or androgen precursors, including T, DHEA and methyl T, within 3 months Any investigational psychotropic drug within the last 3 months In the judgment of the study clinician, unlikely to be able to participate safely throughout the study period Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2x upper limit of normal Creatinine &gt;1.5x upper limit Serum potassium &lt; lower limit of normal If participating in the sub study, unable to tolerate 1 hour in MRI; contraindication to MRI (such as implanted pacemaker, cerebral aneurysm clips, extensive orthopedic hardware instrumentation); gastrointestinal tract surgery (including gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery, and small or large bowel resection); history of psychosis by SCID</criteria>
