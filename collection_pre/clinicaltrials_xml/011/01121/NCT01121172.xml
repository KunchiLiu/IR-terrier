	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate serum apelin levels as well as their possible association with G212A polymorphism of the apelin receptor in obese children and adolescents. So far apelin has been reported to be involved in the pathophysiology of various heart diseases such as cardiomyopathies and heart failure. According to recent reports in adults apelin seems to be associated with impaired glucose metabolism, particularly in newly diagnosed diabetes type 2 patients. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia leading to diabetes mellitus type 2 even in youngsters. The researchers will try to investigate the role of this new adipokine in order to early detect and to prevent similar entities in childhood obesity.</brief_summary>
