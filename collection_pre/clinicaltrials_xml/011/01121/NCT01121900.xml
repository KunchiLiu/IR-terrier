	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of the test product, 300 mg trazodone hydrochloride (HCl) extended-release caplets (containing Contramid®), when administered as a single dose, and the reference product, 100 mg trazodone HCl immediate-release tablets (Apotex Corp), when administered three times daily. For this purpose the rate and extent of absorption of trazodone and formation of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) after administration of the two formulations, were compared under fasting conditions.</brief_summary>

Body mass not less than 53 kg. Findings within the range of clinical acceptability in medical history and physical examination, and laboratory results within the laboratory reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests (unless the investigator considered the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study). Normal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs, or abnormalities, which the investigator did not consider a disqualification for participation in the study. Willingness to undergo a pre and poststudy physical examination and laboratory investigations. Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign both statements of informed consent (for screening and periodrelated procedures). Nonsmoker or past smoker who stopped the use of any form of tobacco, including snuff or similar products, at least 3 months before entering the study. For females, the following conditions had to be met: 1. Had been surgically sterilized or undergone a hysterectomy, or 2.

In the rare circumstance that a pregnancy was discovered after the subjects received the study medication, every attempt was to be made to follow such subjects to term. 2. Had to agree to use an accepted method of contraception (i.e., spermicide and barrier methods or spermicide and nonhormonal intrauterine contraceptive device). The subject had to agree to continue with the same method throughout the study. Hormonal contraceptives were not allowed. 3. Females not of childbearing potential could also have been included if they had no menstrual period for one year and were considered as postmenopausal. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, emotional or intellectual problems likely to have limited the validity of consent to participate in the study or to have limited the ability to comply with protocol requirements. History of, or current compulsive alcohol abuse (&gt; 10 drinks weekly), or regular exposure to other substances of abuse. Use of any medication, prescribed or overthecounter, within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of study medication except if this would not have affected the outcome of the study in the opinion of the investigator. Hormonal contraceptive agents were not allowed. Participation in another study with an experimental drug, where the last administration (of previous study medication) was within 8 weeks before the first administration of study medication. Treatment within the previous 3 months with any drug with a welldefined potential for adversely affecting a major organ or system. A major illness during the 3 months before commencement of the screening period. History of hypersensitivity to the study medication or any related medication. History of bronchial asthma. History of epilepsy. History of porphyria. Relevant history or laboratory or clinical findings indicative of acute or chronic disease, likely to have influenced the study outcome. Donation or loss of blood equal to or exceeding 500 mL during the 8 weeks before the first administration of study medication. Diagnosis of hypotension made during the screening period. Diagnosis of hypertension made during the screening period or current diagnosis of hypertension. Resting pulse of &gt; 100 beats per minute or &lt; 40 beats per minute during the screening period, either supine or standing. Positive testing for HIV and/or Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C.
