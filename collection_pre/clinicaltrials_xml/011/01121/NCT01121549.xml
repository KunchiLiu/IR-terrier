	<brief_summary>The IES study (A5991012) investigated 4742 patients treated for 2 to 3 years with tamoxifen, who either continued the same treatment or switched to Aromasin速 for a total treatment period of 5 years. Only 65 Romanian patients were enrolled in the IES study. It would therefore appear to be essential to evaluate and confirm the tolerability of Aromasin速 and the ways in which it is used on a broader sample of patients and under the standard conditions of use as stipulated in the MA. This Non-Interventional study was designed to address these issues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Non-Interventional Study With Aromasin速 As Adjuvant Treatment Of Invasive Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-comparative, non interventional study (NIS) in four hundred (400) postmenopausal women hormone-receptor positive invasive with early breast cancer, following 2-3 years of initial adjuvant tamoxifen therapy conducted in 60 sites from Romania according to protocol A5991091.The selection of patients based on diagnosis, the attribution of medicinal products and the follow-up of the subjects fall within the current medical practice. A Non-Interventional study is primarily observational in nature. The present Non-interventional Study is performed by medical oncologist and medical oncologist /radiation oncologist who agree to take part in this project. n/a The study was prematurely terminated on August 31th 2012 due to unexpected high rate of patient withdrawal caused by Aromasin reimbursement policy change in Romania; There were no safety issues related to study termination.</detailed_description>
