	<brief_summary>Plantar Fasciitis (PF) is the most common foot condition treated by healthcare providers, striking approximately 2 million Americans each year. Nevertheless its causes are still not known. The risk factors for PF are known and the diagnosis, which is based on clinical assessment, is relatively simple. Still most of the treatments for PF focus on short term symptoms relief instead of prevention or reduction of recurrence. Physical therapy treatment that focuses on reducing the symptoms for the long run and prevention, should include outcome measures, which if found to be reliable, will make the diagnosis clearer. Diagnosis based on reliable clinical and functional measures will assist the physical therapist to understand the major deficiencies of the patient, and accordingly to help him to make the right decision in choosing treatment. Also comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics of PF may enable selection of appropriate preventive measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability of Functional Outcome Measures in Plantar Fascitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Characterize the unilateral PF syndrome using functional outcome measures, while comparing them to the healthy foot of the same patient. In addition the study will investigate the reliability of these functional outcome measures in PF patients. Methodology: Individuals referred to physiotherapy for PF will be assessed for eligibility and consent for the study. They will undergo two evaluations on the same week to evaluate the test- retest reliability of the functional measurements.</detailed_description>
