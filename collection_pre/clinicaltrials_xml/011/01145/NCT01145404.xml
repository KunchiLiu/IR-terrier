	<brief_summary>Combining Erb inhibitors, such lapatinib, and TS inhibitors, such as capecitabine, may be a beneficial contribution to current treatment paradigms since preclinical data suggest that lapatinib alone can decrease TS mRNA and is synergistic with capecitabine in some cell lines, which may contribute to clinical benefit. The study described in this protocol has been designed to establish the anti-tumor activity of Lapatinib with or without capecitabine in the treatment of Her2 overexpressing metastatic gastric- and gastro-esophageal cancer, and to search for molecular correlates that may be associated with response to this compound. The majority of patients with metastatic gastric and gastro-esophageal cancer undergo first-line combined chemotherapy (e.g. platin derivates and fluoropyrimidines, sometimes combined to a taxane), but the role of second-line chemotherapy has not yet been defined. Therefore, progression during or shortly after first-line chemotherapy is a medical condition no standard medical approach exists. The overexpression of EGFR and Her2 in gastric and gastroesophageal cancer make these indications prime candidate for treatment with the dual ErbB1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Lapatinib.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction and esophagus Metastatic disease Measurable disease (according to RECIST criteria) At least one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease with progression during or no later than 6 months after last administration of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy must have contained a platinum compound (cisplatin or oxaliplatin) Her2 overexpression measured by FISH (amplification or increased gene copy number). Immunohistochemistry (ICH) 3+ can be included in case of an uncertain FISH test. Patient willing to allow for biomarker analyses on his tumor tissue.

Renal function: The calculated creatinine clearance should be .60 mL/min Eligibility of patients receiving medications or substances known to affect, or with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of lapatinib will be determined following review of their use by the local Principal Investigator.
