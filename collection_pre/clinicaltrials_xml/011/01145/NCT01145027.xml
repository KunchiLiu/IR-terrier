	<brief_summary>Forty healthy volunteers will undergo two nailfold-videocapillaroscopy exams with a 10-minute interval between them, after an 10-h overnight fast in a temperature controlled room. The subjects will be randomized in two groups: one will receive a sensorial stimulus during the interval (stimulus group - SG) and the other will receive no stimulus (control group - CG). The sensorial stimulus will be a breakfast meal, with excellent presentation and aroma, composed by favorite food items previously related by the individual for this meal. The meal will not be offered for immediate intake, it will be placed in front of the volunteer for perception of the smell and taste. Baseline microvascular parameters will be compared to the results after the interval. The investigators hypothesize that the SG will have greater capillary recruitment due to a possible effect of physiologically secreted insulin provoked by the sensorial stimulation (cephalic phase of insulin secretion).</brief_summary>
