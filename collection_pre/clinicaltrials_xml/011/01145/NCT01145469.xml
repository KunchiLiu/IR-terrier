	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of DNA in the laboratory from patients who received fludarabine-based treatment may help doctors learn more about the effects of fludarabine on cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is studying DNA samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia previously treated with fludarabine-based therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in DNA Samples From Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Previously Treated With Fludarabine-Based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify genetic characteristics associated with the efficacy and toxicity of fludarabine-based treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who participated on E2997. - To validate these genetic characteristics with a cancer cell model system to confirm association and dissect the mechanism of effect. OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for genetic characteristics associated with the efficacy and toxicity to fludarabine-based treatment using Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The results are then compared with data of genes identified in a cancer cell model system, and with clinical data (response, toxicity, overall survival, and progression-free survival) associated with each patient sample.</detailed_description>
