	<brief_summary>Life style intervention including diet and exercise is the recommended strategy for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). First-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of insulin resistance and a lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes of 40%- 80%. Poor physical fitness is a strong indicator of an increased risk of developing diabetes. Long-term endurance exercise training has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in sedentary young and elderly individuals, first degree relatives of patients with Type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerant obese, or Type 2 diabetic humans. In type 2 diabetic patients, non-diabetic individuals with IGT and sedentary adults after exercise training of different intensity, different duration and different frequency an increase of insulin sensitivity was found. However, despite the vast knowledge concerning beneficial effects physical activity for the prevention of T2DM (and many other chronic metabolic disorders) to date wide ranging strategies have not been realized satisfactory. Regardless of age, ethnicity, sex or health status the lack of time is the primary reason for the failure to exercise on a regular basis (or is stated as primary reason). Therefore the investigators aimed at investigating whether a controlled endurance/resistance training twice a week over 6 month might be beneficial for healthy, non obese, first degree relatives with T2DM. Therefore the investigators measure parameters associated with the prevention of T2DM like insulin sensitivity, flux through fATPase and fCK, intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipids.</brief_summary>
