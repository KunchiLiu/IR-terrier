	<brief_title>Study to Look at Benefit of Surgical Drainage Before Beginning Medical Therapy for Crohns Perianal Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently the importance of surgically established drainage of Crohn's perianal fistulas prior to medical therapy is controversial. Several retrospective studies have suggested a benefit to this approach. (1, 2) However, there have been no prospective studies performed to answer this important question. This study aims to definitively answer this question. Our hypothesis is that by establishing surgical drainage of all perianal fistulas and abscesses prior to initiation of medical therapy, further abscess formation will be prevented and the rate of durable fistula healing will improve.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and Female aged 18 years or older; A confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease and one or more identifiable perianal fistulas; Patient's standard of care treatment plan includes the following options: a) surgical intervention with an exam under anesthesia (EUA) by colorectal surgeon, seton placement and drainage of fistula prior to initiating Certolizumab or b) initiating Certolizumab without surgical intervention; Patient has had recent colonoscopy to determine disease activity and extent; and Patient has had either rectal EUS or pelvic MRI (type of test based on investigator site preference) which has identified one or more perianal fistulas. Any of Inclusion Criteria is not met; Females who are pregnant or breast feeding; AntiTNF use within 6 weeks prior to study entry; Patients who cannot take, or refuse to take concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with either azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine, or methotrexate; Unless patient has been intolerant of these therapies in the past or is contraindicated as determined by the investigator. Patients who cannot take, or refuse to take concomitant antibiotic therapy; Patients with severe anal stenosis or tenderness which would preclude colonoscopy and / or rectal EUS; Patients who cannot take or refuse to take certolizumab; Patients with active or latent tuberculosis; Patients who have had systemic antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal treatment(s) within 3 weeks prior to Screening for all nonCrohn's related infections; Patients concurrently taking anakinra (Kineret); Patients with a history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease other than a successfully and completely treated cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma or carcinomainsitu of the cervix; Patients with chronic hematologic problems such as bleeding dyscrasias; Patients with a history of demyelinating disease (i.e. multiple sclerosis); and Patients with congestive heart failure</criteria>
