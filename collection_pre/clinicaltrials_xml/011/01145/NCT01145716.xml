	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe and stage lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in association with distal radius fractures. 20 patients with dorsally dislocated AO type A fractures of the distal radius with sufficient displacement (based of cadaveric data) will be included. After stability testing and wrist arthroscopy. The TFCC is explored through a volar incision and injuries were documented and repaired from this approach.</brief_summary>
