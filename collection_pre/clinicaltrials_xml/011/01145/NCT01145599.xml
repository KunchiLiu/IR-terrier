	<brief_title>Identifying Progression of Retinal Disease in Eyes With NPDR in Diabetes Type 2 Using Non-invasive Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To identify "progressors" in retinal vascular disease and central retinal edema in type 2 diabetic patients with early NPDR, based on retinal disease progression from baseline to the 12-month visit, assessed by the following biomarkers: - Microaneurysms turnover (MA formation rate over or equal to 2, i.e. number of new MA from baseline to the 12-month visit) computed from color fundus photographs using the RetmarkerDR software; and - Retinal thickness increase in eyes with retinal thickening (Increase in retinal thickness above normal range) in the central subfield, the inner ring and/or the outer ring Constantly Present, Present or Absent (as measured by OCT and considering the macula thickness normative data.</detailed_description>
