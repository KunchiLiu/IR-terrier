	<brief_summary>Cholangiocarcinomas (CCCs) are malignant tumors arising from the biliary epithelium. CCCs are characterised by a high mortality and the only curable therapy is complete tumor resection, if feasible, or in some cases liver transplantation. Since surgery for CCC is a procedure associated with a high mortality itself it needs to be ascertained that an accurate preoperative diagnosis has been established. However, it often appears to be difficult to get a preoperative pathological diagnosis, since it is difficult to obtain tumor specimens using cytologic brushings, biopsy forceps, bile aspiration or endoscopic ultrasonography guided-fine needle aspiration. This is reflected by a nearly 100% specificity but low sensitivity rates. The aim of this study is to compare a new method of biliary biopsy using a double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) forceps to enable a safe and reliable tissue specimen collection within the proximal biliary tract with cytology brushings in patients with suspected malignant proximal biliary strictures.</brief_summary>
