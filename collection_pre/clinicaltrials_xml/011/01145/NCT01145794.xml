	<brief_summary>The high prevalence of smoking in adults in many developing countries (e.g. in China, 61% among men and 7% among women) results in many children being exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS). Although in 2001 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the promotion of proper smoking hygiene, (i.e. smoking away from the immediate environment of infants and children), similar recommendations in many developing countries are either scarce or non-existent. We hypothesize that implementation of a package of smoking hygiene intervention measures delivered by community health workers (CHWs) will reduce Chinese children's exposure to SHS and improve their respiratory health.</brief_summary>
