	<brief_summary>Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds to pasta containing different amounts of protein and fiber. In this research study, subjects will be asked to eat as much as they want of pasta containing different amounts of protein and fiber mixtures, thereafter subjects will describe their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat for 3 hours afterwards. Subjects will be asked to do this on three separate occasions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pasta Formulations and Their Effect on Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized, 3-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 3-hour postprandial crossover study to evaluate the satiation effects of pasta formulations on lunch intake in healthy weight women. The study design will test 3 varying pasta formulations (2 experimental and 1 standard control) in a lunch setting in relatively healthy unrestrained women. This study will require one initial screening visit (approximately 1 hour) and three study visits each lasting approximately 4 hours. All visits should be done in 1 month. We are looking for healthy, non-smoking women older than 18 years of age with no significant medical history. The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and waist circumference measurements, blood glucose test (finger prick) and eating, health, exercise and mood surveys. If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have 3 study visits. At each visits, subjects will be asked to consume as much as they would like of the pasta meal and beverage in a lunch setting and thereafter will be followed for 3 hours assessing subjective feelings of satiety. The lunch meal will be provided 5 hours after a standardized breakfast (usual breakfast for each subject at the same time of day on each study visit day). During the course of the study, subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual level of activity and diet. Four day food records will be maintained throughout the course of the study.</detailed_description>
