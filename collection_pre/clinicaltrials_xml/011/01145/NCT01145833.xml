	<brief_title>Guided Self-help for Families With an Overweight Child</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 4-5 million children between the ages of 6-17 in the United States are obese. Children who are obese are at an increased risk for many negative health consequences in childhood and in adulthood. In addition, these children are at an increased risk for psychosocial consequences in childhood and adolescence, including poor self-esteem, teasing, verbal abuse and social isolation. Guided self-help offers an opportunity to provide empirically based programs to a larger amount of the target population. Once such treatment methods are available, it is possible that the guided self-help treatment for childhood obesity can be disseminated to primary care practitioners, psychologists, nurses, and health educators. Ultimately, the goal of this application is to develop a treatment protocol that can be used by clinics and lay health professionals to intervene with children who are overweight and their parents.</detailed_description>
