	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the the efficacy of adjunctive nicotine replacement therapy when used in combination with the contingency management (CM) + cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a nicotine transdermal patch or a placebo patch as well as being randomly assigned to receive either CM or no CM; all subjects will receive cognitive behavioral therapy. We hypothesize that that subjects receiving both active nicotine patch and CM will have higher rates of abstinence from tobacco than subjects in the other groups.</brief_summary>
