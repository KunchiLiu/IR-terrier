	<brief_title>Evaluation of Cissus Verticillata L. Infusion in Controlling Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is regarded as one of the most prevalent disease of the adult population. In many developing countries, this condition is regarded as major public health problem. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose related with a condition of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. As Diabetes progresses, medications are necessary to control glucose levels. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the infusion of a medicinal plant (Cissus verticillata L.) would be as effective as a regular drug (glibenclamide) in reducing glucose levels in blood and saliva of type 2 Diabetes patients. Several medicinal plants have been used as potential medication for controlling glucose levels in Diabetes patients. Few studies have explored this effect related to Cissus verticillata L.infusion, though it has been indicated by folk medicine of some Latin American countries.</detailed_description>
