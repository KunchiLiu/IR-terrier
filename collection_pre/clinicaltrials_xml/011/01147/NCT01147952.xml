	<brief_summary>Regular exercise is known to produce significant health benefits and to reduce the risk of heart diseases, although how this benefit occurs is not well understood. White blood cells are known to be involved in triggering heart attacks, and which genes are switched on or off in white blood cells determines whether they have beneficial or harmful effects. Previous studies, and studies ongoing in our group, have demonstrated measurement of peripheral blood gene expression (which reflects white blood cell gene expression) is able to distinguish between patients with and without coronary artery disease, or patients who are able to develop good compared with poor coronary collateral arteries. Therefore, the gene expression signature in peripheral blood may provide novel diagnostic or prognostic information, and insight into the pathogenesis of heart disease. We therefore hypothesise that exercise alters peripheral blood gene expression in patients with coronary artery disease and angina. This will identify possible ways that exercise improves angina and reduces the risk of heart disease.</brief_summary>
