	<brief_title>Pazopanib Versus Sunitinib in the Treatment of Asian Subjects With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of pazopanib versus sunitinib for the treatment of Asian subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) enrolled from selected Far-East Asian countries. The primary objective is to evaluate the primary endpoint progression free survival in the enrolled Asian subjects treated with pazopanib versus those treated with sunitinib. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the following secondary endpoints in each treatment arm: objective response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall survival and safety. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800mg pazopanib to be administered once daily orally continuous dosing or 50mg sunitinib to be administered in 6-week cycles: 50mg orally daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment. Subjects are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion of blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents, analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. The study treatment will continue until subjects experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or death.</detailed_description>
