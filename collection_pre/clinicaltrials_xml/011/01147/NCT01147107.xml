	<brief_summary>The main objective is to evaluate the hepatic safety of raltegravir when compared to efavirenz, both in combination with tenofovir and emtricitabine as first-line HIV treatment in patients with HIV and hepatitis C coinfection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatic Safety of Raltegravir Versus Efavirenz as HIV Therapy for Patients With HIV and HCV Coinfection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will recruit 80 treatment-naive HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C coinfection from two HIV treatment centers in Vietnam. Patients will be randomized to receive either raltegravir or efavirenz, both in combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine, as first-line HIV therapy over a period of 72 weeks. The primary endpoint is the rate of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation during the 72 week study period. Secondary endpoints include rates of virological suppression, CD4 count change, numbers of AIDS events and death, rates of fasting glucose and cholesterol measures, neurocognitive function and levels of immune activation. Patients will be followed monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. At the end of the trial period, patients will be transferred to the National HIV treatment program for continuation of HIV therapy.</detailed_description>
