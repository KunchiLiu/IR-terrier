	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy, dose response and safety of four doses of GSK2190915 in tablet form (10mg, 30mg, 100mg and 300mg) administered once daily, over 8 weeks compared with placebo in adolescent and adult subjects (12 years of age and older) with persistent asthma. These data will form the basis for the selection of the optimal daily dose of GSK2190915 to be carried forward in Phase III asthma studies. The study also includes Fluticasone Propionate Inhalation Powder (100 mcg, twice daily) and Montelukast (10mg, once daily) to allow for an exploratory analysis of the efficacy of GSK2190915 versus a low dose inhaled corticosteroid and a leukotriene receptor antagonist.</brief_summary>
