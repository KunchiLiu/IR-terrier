	<brief_summary>Since 2001, Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) are widely used to treat severe malnutrition. Their efficacy and effectiveness were proven in community therapeutic care programs. Recently, the question rose if RUTF would be more effective than enriched flours to treat moderate malnutrition. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Ready to Use Food Supplementary-plumpyÂ® and Premix Corn Soy Blend with oil in term of cure rate, weight gain, duration of treatment, morbidity and mortality in the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition. Compare the longer term effect on nutritional status and morbidity (relapse?).</brief_summary>
