	<brief_title>Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Pediatric Anxiety and Depression in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mood and anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are disabling, distressing, and prevalent and produce added costs to health systems. This two-site randomized controlled trial will test the effects of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) protocol (8-12 sessions) in a large sample (N=210) of children and adolescents (age 8-16) presenting with anxiety and/or depression in primary care. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of BCBT will be compared to a plausible public health alternative - enhanced referral to specialty mental health care (SMHC). This investigation is noteworthy in adopting a deployment-focused model and testing this intervention early in its development within a real world context (primary care) and against a plausible public health comparison condition (SMHC) relevant for future treatment dissemination.</detailed_description>
