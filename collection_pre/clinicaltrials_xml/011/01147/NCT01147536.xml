	<brief_title>Immune Response Following Treatment of Resectable Renal Cell Carcinoma at Intermediate Risk of Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter, randomized, single-blind study to assess patients' immune response following treatment with HSPPC-96 (vitespen, OncophageÂ®)for resectable renal cell carcinoma (RCC), considered to be at intermediate risk for recurrence given the pathologic tumor stage at time of resection. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients exhibit a measurable and durable immune response after multiple administrations of HSPPC-96 during a maximum 15-month time period. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 with Part 1a (Assessment of Immune Variation)and Part 1b (Assay Standardization), and Part 2 (Immune Monitoring Study). The study was terminated early with 12 patients enrolled only in Part 1a and Part 1b. Part 2 of the study involved randomization after 8 doses of HSSPC-96. After the 8 doses of HSSPC-96 administered in Part 2, the patients were to be randomized to the Treatment Extension Arm or the Placebo Extension Arm. There were no patients enrolled in Part 2 since the study was terminated early. Therefore, no randomization occurred in the conduct of this study and only a single arm was enrolled.</detailed_description>
