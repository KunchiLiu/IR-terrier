	<brief_title>Study of FG-4592 in Subjects With End-Stage Renal Disease Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose ranging study with consecutive cohorts in two subject populations: patients normally responding to current anemia treatment (epoetin alfa) ("normoresponders") and patients not responding well to current treatment ("hyporesponders"). Normoresponders are randomized to study drug FG-4592 or epoetin alfa; hyporesponders are randomized to study drug FG-4592 or epoetin alfa or placebo. The study objectives are to demonstrate that FG-4592 is effective in maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels when converting from epoetin alfa and to establish optimum starting doses and dose adjustment regimens for Hb maintenance.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key 1. Age 18 to 75 years 2. Endstage renal disease (ESRD) and receiving maintenance hemodialysis 3. Two most recent hemoglobin values obtained during screening period must be within the ranges set below: Croup A. Normoresponder Criteria: Hb range in the 8 weeks prior to randomization within 9.0 to 13.5 g/dL Group B. Hyporesponder Criteria: Hb range in the 8 weeks prior to randomization within 8.5 to 13.5 g/dL 4. Epoetin alfa, dose requirements: Group A. Normoresponder Criteria Cohorts A1 to A12: Stable IV epoetin alfa dose at baseline (i.e., no more than a 30% fluctuation in the weekly dose) during the 4 weeks prior to study Day 3 Cohorts A1 to A4: Current and previous (past 4 weeks) epoetin alfa dose range 25 to 85 IU/kg/dose, three times a week (TIW); weekly dose between 75 and 255 IU/kg/week Cohort A5: Current and previous (past 4 weeks) epoetin alfa dose range =/&gt;85 to 115 IU/kg/dose, TIW; total weekly dose between 255 and 335 IU/kg/week Cohort A9: Current and previous (past 4 weeks) epoetin alfa dose range =/&gt;85 to 150 IU/kg/dose, TIW; total weekly dose between 255 and 450 IU/kg/week Cohorts A6 to A8: Current and previous (past 4 weeks) epoetin alfa dose range 25 to 115 IU/kg/dose, TIW, and two times a week (BIW); total weekly dose between 75 and 345 IU/kg/week Cohorts A10 to A12: Optional cohorts TBD, dosing frequency and dose range to be determined by sponsor Group B. Hyporesponder Criteria: Cohort B1 (completed): Current and previous (past 4 weeks) epoetin alfa dose range 125 to 400 IU/kg/dose, TIW; weekly dose between 375 and 1200 IU/kg/week Cohort B2 to B4: Current and previous (past 4 weeks) epoetin alfa dose range &gt;115 IU/kg/dose, TIW; total weekly dose &gt;345 IU/kg/week no requirement for stability of epoetin alfa doses 5. Complete Blood Count (CBC), Hematology, liver function blood tests, serum folate and vitamin B12 within acceptable limits 6. Absence of active or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding 7. hsCRP &lt;60 mg/L for normoresponders Cohorts A8 through A12 enrolled under Amendment 3; no hsCRP criteria for hyporesponders 8. Body weight: 40 to 140 kg (dry weight) 9. Body mass index (BMI): 18 to 45 kg/m2 10. Dialysis vascular access via native arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft, or permanent (tunneled) catheter (not via temporary catheter); permanent and temporary catheters, however, are still prohibited in Cohort A5 Key 1. Anticipated change in hemodialysis prescription 2. Any clinically significant infection or evidence of an underlying infection 3. Positive for any of the following: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); or antihepatitis C virus antibody (antiHCV Ab) 4. History of chronic liver disease 5. New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure 6. Chronic inflammatory disease that could impact erythropoiesis (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease) even if it is currently in remission 7. History of myelodysplastic syndrome 8. History of hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, polycystic kidney disease, or anephric 9. Active hemolysis or diagnosis of hemolytic syndrome 10. Known bone marrow fibrosis 11. Uncontrolled or symptomatic secondary hyperparathyroidism 12. Any prior organ transplantation 13. Drugtreated gastroparesis or shortbowel syndrome 14. History of alcohol or drug abuse; or a positive drug screen for a substance that has not been prescribed for the subject 15. Prior treatment with FG4592 16. Diagnosis or suspicion of renal cell carcinoma 17. RBC transfusion within 12 weeks prior to Day 1, or anticipated need for RBC transfusion during the dosing period 18. IV iron supplement within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and/or unwilling to withhold IV iron during the dosing/Treatment period</criteria>
