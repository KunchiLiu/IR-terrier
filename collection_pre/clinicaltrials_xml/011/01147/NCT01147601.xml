	<brief_title>Topical Timolol 0.5% Solution for Proliferating Infantile Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the first visit, subjects will fill out a questionnaire that asks about the child's history and the hemangioma. Photographs and measurements will be taken at this and each subsequent visit. At the first visit, subjects will have a physical exam, including vital signs, height and weight. An EKG will also be done. Study drug will be dispensed and instructions given. Half of the subjects will receive a placebo. This is a blinded randomized study. Follow-up visits will be weekly for the first two weeks (three visits total including the first visit), then monthly until the study is over. Photographs and measurements will again be taken at each visit. Subjects will be asked to evaluate the size and the color of the hemangioma against the first photographs and fill out forms regarding any changes in behavior and asked about any side effects.</detailed_description>
