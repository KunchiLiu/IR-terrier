	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study of Albiglutide and Digoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I, open-label, sequential, single-center study evaluates the pharmacokinetics of digoxin when coadministered with albiglutide in healthy adult subjects. Subjects will receive a single dose of digoxin on Day 1 followed by 5 weekly subcutaneously injected doses of albiglutide and a second single dose of digoxin on Day 38. To determine the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin after drug administration alone and after multiple doses of albiglutide, blood samples will be collected after each dose of digoxin.</detailed_description>
