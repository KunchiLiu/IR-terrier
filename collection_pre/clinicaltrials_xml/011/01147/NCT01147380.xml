	<brief_title>Safety Study of Liver Natural Killer Cell Therapy for Hepatoma Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate whether adoptive transfer of IL-2 stimulated NKcells extracted from cadaveric donor liver graft exudates into recipient with HCC will lead to prevent recurrence of HCC after liver transplantation. The method we plan to use is to collect NK cells from the cadaveric donor liver perfusate at the time of organ recovery. The perfusate will be condensed by centrifuging and liver mononuclear cells (LMNC) were isolated by gradient centrifugation. LMNC will be cultured with anti-CD3 antibody. LMNC will be separted into a CD3-/CD56+ NK cell fraction and a non-NK cell fraction. The purity of isolated fractions will be assessed by Flow cytometric analyses. NK cells will be cultured with human recombinant IL-2 in 10% RPMI at 37 ÂºC in a 5% CO2 incubator. NK cells will be infused intravenously to the recipient with HCC who have liver transplant from the same cadaveric donor at post operative day 4 in attempt to prevent the metastasis and recurrence of HCC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary liver transplant recipient with HCC Patients need to meet the liver transplant eligibility criteria Cardiac function; cardiac echo will indicate that ejection fraction (EF) &gt; 35% or right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) &lt; 50mmHg. Stress echo will show no ischemic lesion (if applicable). Pulmonary function; SpO2 &gt;90% or PaO2 &gt; 60 mmHg, or CT will show no active pulmonary lesion. Complete blood count; Platelet &gt; 20,000 /mm^3, Hematocrit &gt; 20%, WBC &gt; 1,000 /mm^3 Eighteen years of age or older Ability to provide informed consent If female of childbearing potential: Must not be lactating, must have a negative serum Bhuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test within 7 days prior to Day of Transplant, and must agree to practice an acceptable and reliable form of contraception during the study Ability to provide informed consent Living donor liver transplant; a healthy person donates part of his or her liver to the recipient Multiple organ transplants Prior solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients Fluminant hepatic failure The patients regularly receive the hemodialysis more than twice a week before liver transplant Status 1 transplants; acute severe disease and defined as a patient with only recent development of liver disease who is in the intensive care unit of the hospital with a life expectancy without a liver transplant of fewer than 7 days ABO incompatible transplants Transplants utilizing livers from nonheart beating donors; the cardiac death donor Recipients of investigational therapy within 90 days prior to transplant procedure Acute viral illness History of malignancy within 5 years, with exception of: Adequately treated localized squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin without evidence or recurrence, and/or Hepatocellular carcinoma Illness other than primary liver disease (e.g., severe ischemic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction, or pulmonary disease), which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly increase the risk of the transplantation procedure Current drug or alcohol abuse or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at risk for poor compliance (no drug testing required) Serology positive donor (HCV, HBsAg, HBcAb, HTLV1, HTLV3, EBVIgM) Poor liver function donor (Total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/dl, Prothrombin time &gt; 35 sec), Patients who receive intercurrent chemotherapy at the time of enrollment</criteria>
