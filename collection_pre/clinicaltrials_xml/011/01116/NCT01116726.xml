	<brief_title>Promoting Behavioral Change for Oral Health in American Indian Mothers and Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six hundred mothers and their children will be randomized over a 2-year period to motivational interviewing (MI) plus enhanced community services vs. enhanced community services alone in equal numbers in the 2 groups. The MI sessions will involve home visits concentrating on the mitigation of behavioral risk factors for early childhood caries (ECC), shortly after childbirth and at 6, 12, and 18 months. The enhanced community services will involve development of culturally appropriate messages related to the mitigation of risk factors for ECC through public announcements and simple brochures. The primary outcome measure will be decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) of the children at ages 1, 2, and 3. Secondary outcomes will include children's ds, % with dmfs and ds &gt;0, mother's dental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, caries patterns, and costs.</detailed_description>
