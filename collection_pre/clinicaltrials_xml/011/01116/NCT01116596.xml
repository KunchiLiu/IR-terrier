	<brief_summary>Paracetamol is one of the most widely used analgesics in the world especially for chronic pain in the elderly. The metabolism of paracetamol occurs in the liver and involves the use of glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine (Glutathione (GSH)). Medications such as paracetamol, may reduce the reserves of GSH because it is used for detoxification and elimination. It is well known that the concentration of GSH decrease after administration of paracetamol in humans and animals. Aging is associated with decreased concentration of GSH in cells and tissues. In the elderly, a decrease of GSH concentration in plasma or red blood cells is associated with decreased physical and mental health. We wish here to determine, in subjects aged over 70 years, the blood concentration of glutathione (GSH) and urinary loss of cysteine in the detoxification of paracetamol, when taking paracetamol treatment repeated.</brief_summary>
