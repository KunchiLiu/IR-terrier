	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving vorinostat together with lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together with lenalidomide in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat and Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide and vorinostat. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of vorinostat and lenalidomide when given in combination in this patient population. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain preliminary data for response rate, time to response, response duration and time to progression (TTP) for vorinostat and lenalidomide when used in combination. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-14 and oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>
