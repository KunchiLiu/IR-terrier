	<brief_summary>The fracture of the humeral diaphysis is a condition that represents 2% of all fractures. The conservative treatment of diaphyseal fractures of the humerus has long been considered the only option and the surgical treatment was primarily reserved for displaced fractures with no contact of bone ends. However, for a few years there has been an upsurge of indications for the surgical treatment of diaphyseal fractures. The purpose of this study is to compare the functional outcomes and the quality of life of surgically treated patients versus those who undergo a conservative treatment.</brief_summary>
