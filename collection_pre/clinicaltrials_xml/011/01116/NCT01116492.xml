	<brief_summary>This is a study of the inflammatory reaction in standard 4 port laparoscopic cholecystectomy vs Single Port Laparoscopic (SIL) cholecystectomy. It is assumed that the reduced trauma in SIL Cholecystectomy causes reduced inflammatory reaction compared to the 4 port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
