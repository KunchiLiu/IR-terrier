	<brief_summary>Clinically demonstrated efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone in MM subjects as well as the confirmed inhibitory effect of dasatinib on several tyrosine kinase receptors and pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of MM. Additionally, as a SRC inhibitor, dasatinib plays an important role on bone metabolism through inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vitro. Dasatinib could, thus, be beneficial on bone density of patients on study, through blockage of osteolysis and control of bone lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Combination With Melphalan and Prednisone to Treat Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To determine whether the combination of dasatinib with melphalan and prednisone provides therapeutic benefits and is safe in patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma. Study design, dose and mode of administration, and duration of treatment: Multicenter, open-label, single arm, two-stage, Phase II study of dasatinib in combination with melphalan and prednisone (D-MP) in advanced, refractory MM patients. The three drugs will be concurrently administered through 6 cycles; each cycle will be 28 days long (1 cycle = 4 weeks), for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment schedule will be the following: - Melphalan 0,18 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles; - Prednisone 1,5 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles; - Dasatinib 100 mg QD continuously (from day 1 to day 28). After the 6 cycles of D-MP treatment, Dasatinib will be continuously administered alone as maintenance, until occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal. This is a two-stage Phase II trial according to Simon with a bivariate endpoint design, by which treatment efficacy and safety are jointly evaluated. This design allows the trial to be early stopped after the first stage if the number of observed partial responses (PR) is inadequate and the number of observed toxicities is too high. In the first stage of the protocol 17 patients are required.</detailed_description>

Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. 5. Patient of reproductive potential must agree to use and utilize an adequate method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study drug is stopped. 6. Patient was previously diagnosed with symptomatic MM based on standard criteria, and has measurable disease, defined as follows: Secretory myeloma: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, greater than 1 g/dL of IgG MProtein and greater than 0.5 g/dL of IgA MProtein) and, where applicable, urine lightchain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours; Nonsecretory myeloma: &gt; 30% plasma cells in the bone marrow and at least one plasmocytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e., MRI or CT scan). 7. Patient is relapsed or refractory and has received previous regimen containing Thalidomide or Lenalidomide and Bortezomib or even MP (patient is refractory if there is a progression during the last therapy or within 2 months after its completion). 8. Patient has a lifeexpectancy &gt; 3 months 9. Patient has ≤ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 28 days before enrollment and all acute toxicities from any prior therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures) must have resolved to grade ≤ 2, according to the NCI CTCAE version 3.0 at study entry. 10. Patient has the ability to take oral medication (dasatinib must be swallowed whole) 11. Concomitant Medications: Patient agrees that IV bisphophonates will be withheld for the first 8 weeks of Dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia. 12. Patient has the following laboratory values within 28 days before Baseline day 1 of the Cycle 1: Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 times the institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) Hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT ) ≤ 2.5 times the institutional ULN Serum Na, K+, Mg2+, Phosphate and Calcium &gt; Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) Calculated or measured creatinine clearance: ≥ 20 mL/minute Hemoglobin, Neutrophil count, Platelets, PT, PTT, Fibrinogen all Grade 01 Corrected serum calcium ≤ 14 mg/dL ( ≤ 3.5 mmol/L). 1. Patients with &gt; 2 previous treatment regimens. 2. Multiple myeloma treatment (ie, chemotherapy, biological, immunotherapy or investigational agent [therapeutic or diagnostic]) administered within 21 days prior to treatment initiation. 3. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. 4. Pregnant or breast feeding females. 5. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 6. Use of any other concomitant standard/experimental antimyeloma drug or therapy 7. Concurrent anticoagulation treatment or medications that directly or durably inhibit platelet function. 8. Malignancy [other than the one treated in this study] which required radiotherapy or systemic treatment within the past 5 year. Exceptions: basal cell or non metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ or FIGO Stage 1 carcinoma of the cervix. 9. Concurrent medical condition which may increase the risk of toxicity, including: Pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade 10.
