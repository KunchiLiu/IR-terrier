	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to identify the best smoking cessation intervention components to be combined into a state-on-the-art, comprehensive smoking cessation intervention. This research examines the ability of different interventions, provided both prior to and after the quit attempt, to maximize the ability to initially quit and then stay quit. The investigators will be examining six different treatment interventions: pre-quit nicotine patch, pre-quit nicotine gum, pre-quit counseling, post-quit in-person counseling, post-quit phone counseling and duration of post-quit nicotine replacement therapy.</brief_summary>
