	<brief_title>Study to Assess Biomarkers in Patients With Resectable Oral Cavity Cancer Randomized to Receive Preoperative Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, biomarker driven, preoperative window of opportunity study with a pharmacodynamic primary endpoint. Patients with resectable, histologically confirmed OCC for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management, will be randomized 2:1 to receive PF-00299804 pre-operatively at a dose of 45 mg once daily orally for 7-11 days or to Matching Placebo for 7-11 days depending on surgery schedule. The target is a total of 8 days of treatment but with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 11 dosing days. All patients will receive surgery as per standard of care without delay. Biomarkers from the surgical specimen and baseline tumor biopsy or consent to provide a tumor block from existing primary diagnostic tumor biopsy completed within 90 days will be evaluated for primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed, voluntary informed consent provided Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, tests, other study procedures Patient must be diagnosed with histologically confirmed oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCC) (lip, floor of mouth, anterior 2/3 tongue, buccal mucosa, upper and lower gingiva, hard palate and retromolar trigone) considered resectable (T14a, N02, M0; (without distant metastases)) for whom surgical resection of tumor is planned. Patients with distant metastatic disease or diagnosis of SCCHN may not be enrolled Must be able to provide a fresh tumor biopsy prior to randomization for histopathological and biomarker evaluation. No antineoplastic treatment allowed between obtaining baseline tumor specimen and randomization. Patients who decline an inhouse fresh pretreatment tumor biopsy must give consent to provide a tumor block from an existing diagnostic primary tumor biopsy completed within 90 days of enrolment Prior treatment with agents targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor is not allowed. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy (to primary site/nodes). Patient must not have received prior antineoplastic treatment within past 2 years Any treatmentrelated acute toxicity, including laboratory abnormalities, must have recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 (v.4.0) or baseline, except toxicity not considered a safety risk. ECOG performance status of 02. Patient must have adequate organ function as determined by the following criteria: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN or a calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Leukocytes &gt; 3.0 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; 80 g/L Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L Total bilirubin &lt; ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN 12Lead ECG with normal tracing, or clinically nonsignificant changes that do not require medical intervention QTc interval &lt; 470 msec, and without history of Torsades de Pointes or other symptomatic QTc abnormality A normal LVEF of &gt;50% as measured by ECHO or MUGA within 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment will be required for all patients Patients who require segmental mandibulectomy for surgical resection of oral cavity tumor will not be enrolled Primary site of head and neck carcinoma in nasopharynx, skin, or unknown Prior or concurrent radiation therapy to tumor at site of planned resection Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, which may impair intake, transit or absorption of PF00299804 Requirement for treatment with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism since PF00299804 is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor in in vitro assays Patients currently taking drugs that have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes Any acute or chronic medical, psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that could increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration or could interfere with interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry in the trial Other serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair the ability to receive study treatment as determined by investigator Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would limit the ability to obtain informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this protocol Patients breastfeeding or pregnant are excluded. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to treatment. Patients of reproductive potential or their partners must agree to use effective contraception while receiving trial treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter. Current enrollment in another therapeutic clinical trial Inability/lack of willingness to comply with visits, treatment plans, protocol assessments or laboratory tests</criteria>
