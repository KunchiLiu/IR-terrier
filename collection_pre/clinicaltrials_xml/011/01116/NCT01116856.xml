	<brief_summary>At the present time, scientific consensus exists on obesity multifactorial etiopatogenia. As well, professionals and researchers agree that the treatment must approach several scopes, such as dietetic, physical activity, pharmacologic and surgical. These two last ones should not be the first election and must be reserved for those cases of morbid obesities or in case the previous ones have failed. The combination of diet and exercise is still not sufficiently studied, in special, the addition of strength training, as we propose in this project, for which established intervention protocols do not exist, and that could suppose an additional benefit in the reduction of risk factors. Therefore, the objectives that we aim in this project are enumerated below: - To discover which are the most effective training protocols and to determine what type of exercise combined with nutrition is more appropriate for obesity intervention programs. - To establish the relationship between markers related with cardiovascular risk (adopokines and lipid profile) and the different intervention protocols proposed. - To describe the influence of nine genetic polymorphisms (selected by their relationship with the energy expense and the physical yield) on the effect of different training protocols. - To determine how important is body composition (fat mass and muscle mass mainly) in total daily energy expenditure. - To establish rules of nutritional and exercise intervention that can be applied in public and private training centers. If the proposed objectives are fulfilled, this would contribute to an improvement in patients health in long term, along with an enormous saving in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to propose new lines of intervention in overweight and obese adults that, until now, little have been investigated. This way, resistance training is proposed in combination with cardiovascular training and endocrinologic treatment. It fits to emphasize that, as far as we know, it is the first project of these characteristics, that puts in touch the public and private sector (hospitals, universities and fitness area), to establish standardized relations protocols to allow a close pursuit of obese patients.</brief_summary>
