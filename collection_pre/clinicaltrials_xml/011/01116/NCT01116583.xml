	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of gabapentin on thoracic epidural analgesia following thoracotomy, including assessment of both analgesia, pain intensity, pain quality and whether or not gabapentin prevents the development of chronic pain conditions following thoracotomy. The main hypothesis is that gabapentin reduces the proportion of patients who develop a persistent pain condition following thoracotomy from 50% to 20%. Furthermore gabapentin is expected to reduce both pain intensity measured on a 11-point numerical rating scale, usage of epidural infusions of local and/or opioid analgesics, morbidity, hospital length of stay, consumption of opioid analgesics and analgesia-related side-effects. In addition gabapentin is expected to improve postoperative recovery by means of postoperative lung function, walking ability, health related quality of life and patient satisfaction</brief_summary>
