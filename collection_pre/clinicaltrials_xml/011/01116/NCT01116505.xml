	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the natural history of celiac disease in asymptomatic, screen-detected subjects having positive endomysial antibodies and the effects of an intervention with a gluten-free diet. The investigators hypothesize that these subjects may have decreased general health and benefit of the dietary treatment regardless of the small-bowel mucosal structure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asymptomatic, endomysial-antibody positive adults will be randomized to either continue with a normal, gluten-containing diet or start an intervention with a gluten-free diet irrespective of the small-bowel mucosal morphology. Several celiac-disease associated histological, serological and clinical markers will be evaluated both at baseline and after one year on trial.</detailed_description>
