	<brief_title>How do Attitude About Pay for Performance Differ Among Different Anesthesia Care Provider and Over Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We seek to establish baseline attitudes about Pay for Performance (P4P) in the OUHSC Dept of Anesthesiology and determine what differences exist between faculty, CRNAs and residents. We plan to resurvey annually to determine if attitudes change as the department implements a P4P program. We hope that by understanding the attitudes of anesthesia care providers, we can alleviate their concerns. We hope to account for their concerns as we develop and modify our P4P program. We believe that acceptance of the general idea of P4P is important if individuals are to maintain job satisfaction.</detailed_description>
