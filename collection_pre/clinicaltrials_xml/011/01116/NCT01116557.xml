	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and efficiency of CARTO® 3 system guided THERMOCOOL® catheter ablation and fluoroscopy guided Pulmonary Vein Ablation Catheter® (PVAC®) guided ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Efficiency Study of CARTO® 3 System Guided THERMOCOOL® Catheter Ablation Versus Fluoroscopy Guided Ablation With the Pulmonary Vein Ablation Catheter® (PVAC®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized (2:1), controlled, two-arm, unblinded, clinical study, which will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and efficiency of CARTO® 3 System-guided RF ablation (using the THERMOCOOL® Catheter and LASSO® Circular Mapping Catheter) compared to fluoroscopy-guided RF ablation (using the PVAC®). Patients with symptomatic PAF who meet the inclusion criteria will be considered for study participation and may be enrolled if no exclusion criteria apply. Eligible subjects who signed the study informed consent form will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: - THERMOCOOL® Group: RF ablation to achieve PVI using the CARTO® 3 System, THERMOCOOL® Catheter and LASSO® Circular Mapping Catheter - PVAC® Group: RF ablation to achieve PVI using fluoroscopy and the PVAC®</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with PAF who have had two (2) symptomatic PAF episodes in the six (6) months prior to randomization, and who are selected for catheter ablation for the treatment of their AF. Additionally patients with recurrent AF with episodes up to 30 days with sinus rhythm maintained for more than one week following cardioversion and who require PVI only for the treatment of their AF (supported by the consensus statement2). At least one AF episode should be documented either on ECG, TTM, HM or telemetry strip. Failure of at least one AAD for PAF [class I or III] as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic PAF, or intolerable side effects due to the AAD. Signed Patient Informed Consent Form. Age 18 years or older. Able and willing to comply with all pre and followup testing and requirements. Longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation Patients with a history of any atrial flutter requiring ablation in the right atrium during the study procedure Patients in whom sinus rhythm was maintained for less than 1 week after electrical cardioversion Previous ablation for AF LA size &gt; 55 mm LVEF &lt; 40% (ejection fraction) AF secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or reversible or noncardiac cause CABG procedure within the last six (6) months Awaiting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery Documented left atrial thrombus on imaging (eg, TEE) Diagnosed atrial myxoma Women who are pregnant (by history of menstrual period or pregnancy test if the history is considered unreliable) or breastfeeding Acute illness or active systemic infection or sepsis Unstable angina Uncontrolled heart failure Myocardial infarction within the previous two (2) months History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities Contraindication to anticoagulation therapy (ie. heparin or warfarin) Life expectancy less than 12 months Enrollment in any other study evaluating another device or drug Presence of intramural thrombus, tumor or other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation</criteria>
