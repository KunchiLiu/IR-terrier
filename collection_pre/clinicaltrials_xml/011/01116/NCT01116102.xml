	<brief_summary>The purpose is to characterize the in-line pressure profiles associated with several infusion technique factors during subcutaneous (SC) infusion of Lactated Ringer's solution, preceded by recombinant human hyaluronidase (hylenex). The safety and tolerability of hylenex-augmented SC infusion of Lactated Ringer's solution fluid is also being evaluated.</brief_summary>
