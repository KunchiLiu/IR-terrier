	<brief_summary>The study is designed to determine whether loading doxorubicin (a type of chemotherapy), when loaded onto a drug eluting microsphere will result in increased destruction of a tumor. The study will treat patients with surgically resectable liver cancers with varying doses of doxorubicin loaded into microspheres, with a close review of any side effects and chemotherapy concentrations in the bloodstream. The tumors will be surgically removed after at least 1 month, to determine how much the tumor has shrunk, and the amount of tumor destroyed. It is hoped that the study results will determine if this treatment has a role in controlling tumor growth prior to surgical removal.</brief_summary>
