	<brief_summary>Gabapentin is a first line medication and fentanyl is second line medication in neuropathic pain. But, there is no head to head study on the efficacy of those medication in neuropathic pain. The hypothesis of this study is that the efficacy of the transdermal fentanyl matrix is not inferior to the gabapentin in neuropathic pain.</brief_summary>
