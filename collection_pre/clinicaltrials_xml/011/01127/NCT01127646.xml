	<brief_title>A Study in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is designed to assess the effect of missed doses of daily medication (off-days). On the off-days the patient will take a placebo (sugar pill). Over the 4 weeks of the actual study there will be 6 random off-days of study medicine and neither the caregiver, patient nor study doctor will know which days are the missing days. To cover all aspects of the patients' lives and notably their school time, aside from investigator's assessments, evaluations will also be performed on a daily basis by those involved in their day-to-day life: parents, teachers (on school days) and the patients themselves, using an electronic diary.</detailed_description>
