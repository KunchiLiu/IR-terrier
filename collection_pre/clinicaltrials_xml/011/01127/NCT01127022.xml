	<brief_title>Effect of Maternal Choline Intake on Choline Status and Health Biomarkers During Pregnancy and Lactation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Choline is a micronutrient used for the structural integrity of cell membranes, lipid transport/metabolism, methylation reactions and cholinergic neurotransmission. Prenatal and early postnatal choline exposure plays a critical role in brain development and cognition based on animal data. Although it is recognized that choline use is particularly high during pregnancy and lactation, the level of choline intake needed to optimize maternal and fetal health outcomes is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic and genomic effects of two doses of choline intake, 450 mg/d (the adequate intake level for pregnant women) and 900 mg/d in pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant control women. A secondary objective was to examine the effect of extra maternal choline intake on the child's cognitive performance (i.e, learning, memory and attention). To accomplish these objectives, pregnant women (wk 27 gestation), nonpregnant control women, and lactating women consumed controlled choline intakes of 480 or 930 mg/d for 10 to 12 weeks. The basal diet provided 380 mg/d; supplemental choline chloride, 100 or 550 mg/d, was used to achieve the target intake levels. During the last half of the study, a small portion (~ 20%) of the total choline intake was derived from deuterium labeled choline, a stable isotope. Blood, urine and/or breast milk were collected at baseline and at select timepoints throughout the study duration. For pregnant women, a maternal blood sample was obtained at the time of delivery along with a cord blood sample and the placental tissue. Genomic and metabolomic profiling were performed on the collected biological samples along with specific measurements of choline status. Non-invasive tests assessing cognitive function were performed on the children of the pregnant and lactating study participants. This controlled feeding study has also been extended to investigate dose-response relationships for other micronutrients including folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and biotin.</detailed_description>
