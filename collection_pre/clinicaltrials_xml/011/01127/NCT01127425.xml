	<brief_title>Length of Hospital Stay, Nursing Hours and Recovery After Laparoscopic Versus Open Colon Resection Without Fast Track</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CONTEXT: Our preliminary experience (unpublished) indicate that less nursing hours are needed after laparoscopic colon resection without fast track. Length of hospital stay and recovery seems to be reduced as well. OBJEKTIVE: To compare laparoscopic and open colonic resection concerning nursing hours, length of hospital stay and recovery. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: triple blinded study (Patient, nursing staff and data collector) including 2 x 12 patients needing sigmoid resection due to cancer. Nursing hours, length of hospital stay and recovery (postoperative pain, questionnaire, actigraph ect.)</detailed_description>
