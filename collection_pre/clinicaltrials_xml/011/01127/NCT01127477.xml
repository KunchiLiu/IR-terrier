	<brief_summary>The study shall evaluate the volume effect and safety of 6 % hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 for restoration and maintenance of hemodynamics during the investigational period in patients undergoing major elective surgery. Up to 50 mL 6% hydroxyethyl starch/kg body weight will be administered from start of surgery until two hours after end of surgery. The study hypothesis is that 6 % hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 will have a reliable volume effect and can be safely administered up to the dose limit.</brief_summary>
