	<brief_summary>The fixed combination of verapamil SR/trandolapril (Tarka®) is an effective, well-tolerated therapy for the treatment of essential hypertension in those who require more than one agent to achieve optimal blood pressure (BP) control. The endpoint is compliance with Tarka® treatment by number/percentage of patients continued on fixed combination Tarka therapy after six months. This Post Marketing Observational Study will be conducted in a prospective, single-arm, single-country, multicenter format. The investigational sites will be the cardiologists, the doctors of internal medicine and general practicians. Since this will be a Post Marketing Observational Study, Tarka® will be prescribed in usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local market authorization with regards to dose, population and indication as well as the local guidelines.</brief_summary>
