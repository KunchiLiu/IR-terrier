	<brief_summary>The prevalence of obesity and asthma has significantly increased over the past two decades. The purpose of this study is to try and understand the mechanism by which obesity leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), one of the defining features of asthma. This research is being done to determine how weight or body size affects airway size and airway smooth muscle (ASM) tone and function. The goal of the study will be to look at if and how, weight might affect lung functioning. The investigators hypothesize that low lung volumes in obesity lead to AHR by reducing airway caliber causing increased ASM tone with impairment in deep inspiration (DI) response similar to what is seen in asthma.</brief_summary>
