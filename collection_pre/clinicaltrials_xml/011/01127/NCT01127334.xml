	<brief_summary>Out of all the patients that receive a CRT-D ( a dual chamber pacemaker with defibrillator ) for cardiac resynchronization therapy there is approximately one-third that do not respond. We believe that by using a simple technique that includes routine echocardiography that are normally performed in these patients could help us better understand how to program their device to reach better optimization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Adults age 18110 years 2. Must have a CRTD (A biventricular pacemaker with defibrillator) 3. Last optimization of their device (CRTD) must not have been done in the past 3 months 4. Must be optimal heart failure medical regimen. This includes target dose of betablocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (or equivalent; i.e angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); or balanced preload and afterload reducers with hydralazine and nitrates.) 1. Less than 18 years of age or greater than 110 years old. 2. Does not have a CRTD 3. Optimization of their device has occurred in the past 3 months 4. Not on optimal medical therapy for heart failure as listed in the inclusion criteria.</criteria>
