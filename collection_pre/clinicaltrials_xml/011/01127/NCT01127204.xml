	<brief_summary>The MONOD trial aim to evaluate the implementation of early antiretroviral treatment strategies in HIV-infected infants and assess the feasibility and efficacy of simplifying the initial proposed regimen after a successful one year treatment. The initial treatment is AZT-3TC-LPV/r twice a day. After one year, the children will be randomized in one of the following : arm 1-reference AZT-3TC-LPV/r twice daily; arm 2-simplified ABC-3TC-EFV once daily. The perspective of this project is to identify antiretroviral strategies to improve treatment access and adherence for children in sub-saharian Africa.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for antiretroviral treatment initiation: infant followup in one of the trial site HIV1 infection diagnose by RT PCR after 6 weeks of life age between 3 and 12 month at the antiretroviral treatment initiation naive of antiretrovirals except if received for the prevention of mother to child HIV transmission HB&gt;=7 g/dl, neutrophiles&gt;750/mm3, creatinin&lt;3xULN, TGO and TGP&lt;3xULN signed informed consent Exclusion Criteria for antiretroviral treatment initiation: HIV2 infection or HIV1/HIV2 coinfection Known intolerance to one of the trial treatment HB&lt;7 g/dl, neutrophiles&lt;750/mm3, creatinin&gt;3xULN, TGO or TGP&gt;3xULN Inclusion Criteria for randomisation at 12 months in the simplification phase: age 24 months at most virological success define as 2 consecutive indetectable HIV RNA measured by RT PCR at least 3 months apart. Exclusion Criteria for randomisation at 12 months in the simplification phase: virological failure after the first 12 months of antiretroviral treatment</criteria>
