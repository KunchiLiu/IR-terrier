	<brief_title>Weight-bearing Measuring Device Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthopedic surgeons and rehabilitation physicians frequently request limited weight-bearing for prolonged periods following certain bony or soft tissue pathologies as well as certain lower - limb surgical procedures. Walking, stair climbing, jogging, elliptical training and running on treadmill are a common activity that the injured athlete will seek to return to as soon as possible following injury or surgery. In order for the physician to be able to advise regarding weight-bearing, the Percentage Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing (PBW/WB) values in increasing walking, jogging speeds, elliptical training must be known. These parameters as well as the gait distribution changes have eluded the rehabilitation community, mainly due to the technical inability to measure these paradigms. There are no short-term studies quantifying weight-bearing deficits as well as weight-bearing gait distribution characteristics following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR). Furthermore, there are no published studies that have investigated whether differences exist between various surgical procedures and replacement graft choices in the acute- phase (0-3 weeks) post surgery Descriptive clinical trial. During their regular training the participants will use the flexible, light weight, force-sensing insole for few minutes to receive the parameters 30 subjects. The test subjects will be instructed to walk at their normal speed on a solid ground surface over a distance of 16 meters. The results will be analyzed and a table of normal values will be established including average PBW/WB values for the entire, hind and fore-foot as well as gait distribution changes.</detailed_description>
