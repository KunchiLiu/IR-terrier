	<brief_title>DARE-trial: A Trial Studying the Effect of the SeQuent Please Drug-eluting Balloon Compared to the Xience Prime Drug-eluting Stent for the Treatment of Stenosis of an Earlier Implanted Stent.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background of the study: Coronary in-stent restenosis is commonly treated by using a drug eluting stent (DES). There are, however, some concerns about the safety of drug eluting stents, in particular with respect to delayed healing, chronic inflammatory reaction, and late or very late stent thrombosis. It is unknown whether the current treatment with another layer of stents may add to the risk of stent thrombosis or reoccurrence of restenosis. Therefore, the relatively new drug-eluting balloons may provide an alternative for treatment of in-stent restenosis, avoiding a double stent layer. The expected advantages of such drug-eluting balloons over stents are the ease of access of the lesion, the absence of a multiple stent layer, and the shorter necessity of the use of dual antiplatelet therapy. Several studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy of the Sequent Please drug-eluting balloon (DEB). Whether the drug eluting balloon is as effective as a drug eluting stent in preventing re-restenosis is not known. Study design: The study is designed as an multi-center, randomized, prospective two-arm trial with either PCI with a drug eluting balloon or a drug eluting stent for in-stent restenosis. Blinded evaluation of endpoints by independent core laboratory. Study population: The study population consists of 270 patients ( ≥ 18 years of age) with indication for PCI for in-stent restenosis of whom 135 are randomised to a drug eluting balloon and 135 are randomised to a drug eluting stent. Individuals have signed an informed consent for study measurements. Intervention: PCI with a drug-eluting stent, or PCI with a drug-eluting balloon.</detailed_description>
