	<brief_summary>This is a biomedical study of interventional type, multicenter, inter-regional. Patients with hormono-depending breast cancer, for which an indication of adjuvant hormonotherapy treatment (according to the current treatments) was retained, will be enrolled in this study. The main objective is to estimate the correlations between pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic parameters of adjuvant hormonal breast cancer treatment, during the first 3 years.</brief_summary>
