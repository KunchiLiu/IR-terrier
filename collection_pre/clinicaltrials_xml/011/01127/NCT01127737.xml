	<brief_summary>Using focus group and cognitive interviews with organ transplant recipients, the investigators developed interactive workbooks: a) prevention by sun protection b) early detection by skin self-examination (SSE). The investigators hypothesis is if the patient learns by acquiring skills in a favorable environment, then the patient may reduce their anxiety, enhance self-efficacy and perform self-management by SSE and sun protection. The investigators also evaluate existing internet sources of primary and secondary prevention of skin cancer for organ transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
