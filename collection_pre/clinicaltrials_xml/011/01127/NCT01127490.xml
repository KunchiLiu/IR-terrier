	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of the nerves and the small veins in the skin of people with fibromyalgia. The investigators will then use this information to identify possible processes in the skin that may help explain why some people feel pain relief with the study drug (duloxetine) and others do not. Duloxetine affects certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. An abnormality in these chemicals is thought to be related to fibromyalgia. Duloxetine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression. Duloxetine is approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of fibromyalgia.</brief_summary>
