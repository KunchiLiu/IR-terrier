	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to clinically evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment for plantar fasciitis. This treatment consists of a platelet rich plasma injection into the origin of the plantar fascia. It is thought that plasma rich plasma injection will dramatically improve outcomes for patients suffering from plantar fasciitis. Subjects will be randomized by choosing a slip of paper from an envelope. This process will randomize 25 patients to the experimental group, and 25 patients to the control. The experimental group will undergo a blood draw, allowing for an injection of platelet rich plasma into the origin of the plantar fascia. The control group will undergo a corticosteroid injection into the plantar fascia as the sole treatment. Patients will be followed for three months for pain, and will fill out questionnaires at the initial visit prior to receiving the injection, as well as six and twelve weeks post injection. These questionnaires will give insight into functionality and pain changes that the plantar fascia is experiencing due to treatment. Subjects will be outpatients. Subjects may include employees, students, minorities, and elderly, although no subsets of these will be formed. Subjects will be between 18 and 89 years of age. In total, subject participation will last approximately 3 months.</brief_summary>
