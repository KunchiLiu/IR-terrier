	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether persons treated with a low-intensity, noninvasive form of cortical electrical stimulation experience a reduction in symptoms of fibromyalgia different than persons receiving a sham treatment. Outcome measures include reduction in patient pain levels and improvement in sleep measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Effect of Low-Intensity Electromagnetic Field Neurostimulation in Fibromyalgia Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is increasing acceptance that pain in fibromyalgia is a result of dysfunctional sensory processing in the spinal cord and brain. Electrical cortical stimulation is a device-based form of therapy that is increasingly being considered as an adjuvant to current medical modalities for the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. The investigators propose that stimulation of cortical areas believed to be involved in dysfunctional sensory processing may have a beneficial influence on fibromyalgia symptoms. The aim of this randomized double blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of noninvasive cortical stimulation in the management of fibromyalgia symptoms. More specifically, an active treatment group of subjects will receive the study's cortical stimulation protocol twice a week for 11 weeks and will be evaluated within 14 days following end of treatment, for a total timeframe of 13 weeks. In comparison, a similar group of subjects will receive the same treatment protocol without the actual stimulation signal being applied. The signal utilized is a modulated form that permits very low-intensity signals to pass through outer tissues with less attenuation due to tissue impedance. The signals are of a sufficiently low strength that they are below the level of perception. Hence subjects cannot feel the signal, and are therefore blinded to treatment arm. Investigators and clinical staff are also blinded. Outcome measures include post-treatment to baseline changes in tender points, sleep characteristics as measured by visual analog scales, and outcomes instruments including the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.</detailed_description>
