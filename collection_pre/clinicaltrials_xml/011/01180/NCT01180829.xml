	<brief_summary>This study will provide a pilot test of two different text message interventions for problem drinkers. Participants will be recruited using a general population telephone survey. Participants in a control group (who will not receive text messages) will be compared to participants who receive one of two different types of text message packages (12 text messages sent once per week in each) - a series of personalized feedback text messages or a series of consciousness raising test messages (i.e., messages that keep the thought of cutting down on their drinking in the participants' mind). Participants in the three different conditions will be followed-up in three months time to assess changes in drinking. It is predicted that participants who receive either of the text message packages will report reduced drinking as compared to those participants in the control condition who do not receive any text messages.</brief_summary>
