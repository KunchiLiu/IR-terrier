	<brief_summary>Purpose To investigate the relationship between lingual frenum and possible alterations in the articulation of phonemes. Methods This is a quantitative observational study, the individual operative kind with transversal time reference. The population sample consisted of 16 individuals, each one with their phonological system complete. The data were captured through an application form that contained relevant aspects as to the qualitative-classification of the lingual frenum, quantitative-relation of mouth opening, with and without the tongue in the papillae, tongue mobility and ERT - 78 phonologically balanced words.</brief_summary>
