	<brief_summary>The intention of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) application (SeQuent Please) to the side branch in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of Medina 0,0,1 coronary bifurcation lesions. Patients will be randomized to treatment with Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty (POBA)or treatment with DEB.</brief_summary>
