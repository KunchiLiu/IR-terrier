	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subject is a current spherical soft contact lens wearer and willing to wear the study lenses on a daily wear basis for the duration of the study. The subject's optimal vertexed spherical equivalent distance correction must be between 1.00 and 5.00D. Any cylinder power must be â‰¤ 0.75D. The subject must have visual acuity best correctable to 20/25+3 or better for each eye. The subject must read and sign the Statement of Informed Consent. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in the clinical protocol. Ocular or systemic allergies or disease which might interfere with contact lens wear. Systemic disease or use of medication which might interfere with contact lens wear. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact lens wear. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which might interfere with contact lens wear. Any ocular infection. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. Pregnancy or lactation. Diabetes. Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV). Habitual contact lens type is toric, multifocal, or is worn as extended wear.</criteria>
