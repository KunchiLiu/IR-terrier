	<brief_title>The Importance of Periostin in Periodontal Health and Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is hypothesized that Periostin levels are decreased during periodontal diseases, thereby, elevating the hosts' susceptibility to periodontal breakdown. The specific aims are the following; To determine if Periostin is a biomarker of periodontal disease, and To evaluate Periostin in periodontal tissue healing and homeostasis by harvesting healthy or diseased tissue from 22 patients requiring periodontal surgery.</detailed_description>
