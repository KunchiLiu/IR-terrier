	<brief_summary>The prognosis of patients with inoperable locally advanced or residual/relapsed gastric cancer is rather poor. Concurrent capecitabine chemoradiotherapy is safe and recommended. Nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) monoclonal antibody, has shown its antitumor safety and efficiency in many phase I/II studies. Efficiency of combination of these treatment need to be further analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination of Nimotuzumab,Capecitabine and Radiotherapy for Inoperable or Recurrent Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no standard treatment for patients with inoperable locally advanced or residual/relapsed gastric cancer. For the former ones, 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a recommended treatment regimen. Concurrent capecitabine chemoradiotherapy showed similar results. So far, more and more studies have shown that drugs targeting at EGFRs play an important role in antitumor treatment. Nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, has shown its safety and efficiency in many phase I/II studies. Because of poor survival of patients with inoperable locally advanced or residual/relapsed gastric cancer, the efficiency of nimotuzumab plus concurrent capecitabine chemoradiotherapy need to be further analyzed.</detailed_description>
