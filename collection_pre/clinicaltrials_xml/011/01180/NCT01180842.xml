	<brief_summary>The investigators research question is whether or not yoga effectively alleviates symptoms of pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression in children with cystic fibrosis. If yoga does prove to be effective, the investigators will educate our CF population about the benefits they may experience if they choose to incorporate yoga into their CF therapy. The investigators will also go on to do further research of other complementary alternative medicine therapies. This is a pre/post-test study with 20 subjects. The subjects will serve as their own controls. Each subject will participate in six yoga sessions over a ten week period. Subjects' symptoms will be evaluated with the use of questionnaires. The investigators will also test cortisol levels on weeks -2, -1, 1, 6, 7, 8. Cortisol is a hormone that is affected by stress. Testing of cortisol throughout the study will help us determine the subjects' stress level throughout the study.</brief_summary>
