	<brief_summary>Obesity is an established risk factor for development and progression of kidney disease. Intentional weight loss in people without kidney disease results in an improvement in diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and overall death rates. The investigators do not know whether this holds true in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the proposed pilot study, the investigators will analyze if kidney function stabilizes after weight loss interventions in obese kidney disease patients and the mechanisms that might mediate this beneficial effect. If weight loss in kidney disease patients results in stabilization of kidney function, this would provide an opportunity to conduct a long-term prospective study to analyze the sustained benefits of weight loss in kidney disease patients. Specific aim 1: To ascertain the effects of lifestyle modification or bariatric surgery on urinary protein excretion and renal function among obese CKD patients. Hypothesis: Weight loss attained through either lifestyle modification or surgical intervention will result in lowering of urinary protein excretion and stabilization of renal function among obese CKD patients. Specific aim 2: To identify the mechanism that mediates the change in urinary protein excretion and renal function among obese CKD patients undergoing lifestyle modification or bariatric surgery. Hypothesis: Weight loss attained through either lifestyle modification or surgical intervention will result in amelioration of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, insulin resistance and an increase in High Molecular Weight (HMW) adiponectin levels that then mediate the improvement in urinary protein excretion and renal function among obese CKD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Intentional Weight Loss Interventions in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this non-randomized prospective study, three different groups of patients will be enrolled. Group 1 will include obese chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing lifestyle modifications, Group 2 will include obese CKD patients undergoing bariatric surgery and Group 3 will include obese CKD patients undergoing no specific weight loss interventions (control group). The lifestyle group will undergo supervised exercise training 5 days per week and follow hypocaloric diet based on the recommendations by a dietitian for 12 weeks. The exercise training will consist of walking, running on a treadmill and stationary cycling on a cycle ergometer. Patients will undergo adipokines, markers of inflammation,insulin resistance, renal function, bioimpedance analysis,DEXA measurement at baseline, 3- and 6-month intervals. CKD patients who undergo bariatric surgery and the control group will also undergo same blood tests, renal function studies and body composition studies at baseline, 3- and 6-month intervals.</detailed_description>
