	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of oxygen therapy delivered by systems using oxygen-saving valves or not (continuous oxygen). We aim to determine if systems using oxygen-saving valves are equally effective as continuous oxygen delivery systems in reducing exercise-induced hypoxemia in patients with COPD.</brief_summary>
