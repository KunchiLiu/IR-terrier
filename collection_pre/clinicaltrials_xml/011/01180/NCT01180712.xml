	<brief_summary>Dietary strategies for alleviating the metabolic complications such as diabetes associated with obesity are actively being pursued as alternatives to pharmaceutical interventions The genus Vaccinium (e.g. blueberry, blaeberry, cranberry) has been used traditionally as a source of folk remedies for established diabetic symptoms, primarily as leaf or stem infusions or decoctions. Berries from this family such as blaeberry (BL) and blueberry (BB) are enriched in anthocyanins, polyphenolics recognized for their ability to provide and activate cellular antioxidant protection, inhibit inflammatory gene expression, and consequently protect against oxidant-induced and inflammatory cell damage and cytotoxicity. The association of obesity with adipose tissue stress, macrophage recruitment, and inflammatory gene expression suggests that eating edible berries from this genus might provide an effective alternative or supplementary intervention to attenuate obesity- associated inflammation and the associated insulin resistance. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of anthocyanin supplementation in the form of a concentrated blaeberry extract on insulin resistance and inflammation particularly in the adipose tissue following a three week supplementation period.</brief_summary>
