	<brief_title>Standard Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Genomic Driven Chemotherapy in Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a core biopsy, each tumor is profiled using Affymetrix U133plus2 gene expression array. DLD30 score (Hess, JCO, 2006) and TOP2A expression are quantified. Patients are then either treated with 4FEC followed by 4 docetaxel (standard arm) or by a genomic-driven regimen (experiemental arm). In the experimental arm, patients with high DLD30 receive 3 months weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 FEC, patients with high TOP2A receive 4FEC then 4 docetaxel, patients with low DLD30 and low TOP2A are treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel-capecitabine.</detailed_description>
