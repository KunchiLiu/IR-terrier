	<brief_summary>This research study is being done because patients with a history of chest radiation treatment for Hodgkin's disease have been shown to be at increased risk for developing lung cancer a number of years out from treatment. The risk appears to be further increased among patients with a smoking history. In this study, the CT scans will be read and interpreted by the study radiologist, and the results recorded in a consistent manner. Depending on the findings of the initial CT scan, we will then either repeat the scan in 1 year, or if indicated, send you for further scans or a biopsy. The information collected in this study will help researchers and clinicians in providing more concrete recommendations and screening guidelines for future survivors of Hodgkin's disease who have had similar exposures to radiation and/or chemotherapy and smoking.</brief_summary>

Smoking history of 10pack years or more, or current smoker 1. Patients with a history of lung cancer 2. Patients currently receiving treatment for another cancer diagnosis (patients with another cancer, but currently diseasefree and not receiving treatment are eligible) 3. Patients with known diagnosis of any metastatic cancer 4. Pregnant women.
