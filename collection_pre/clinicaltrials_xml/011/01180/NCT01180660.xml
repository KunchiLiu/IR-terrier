	<brief_summary>Can Intraoperative systemic lidocaine decrease postoperative opioid consumption and improve quality of recovery after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery? The hypotheses:does the use of intraoperative systemic lidocaine decrease postoperative opioid consumption and improve quality of recovery after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. This study has the potential to confirm an opioid sparing strategy for morbid obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. The high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea and the increased risk of postoperative hypoxemia make the development of opioid sparing techniques in this patient population warranted.</brief_summary>
