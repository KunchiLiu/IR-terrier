	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Lovaza (purified prescription fish oil) is likely to help HDL (the "good cholesterol") work better. Study summary: We are testing effects of Lovaza versus placebo, on various aspects of HDL and other lipoproteins, in patients with high triglyceride levels. Study funding: This study is being funded by an investigator-initiated research grant from Glaxo Smith Kline.</brief_summary>
