	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Routine Application Of Anterior Approach During Right Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mobilization of the liver during right hepatectomy with classic approach is performed before parenchymal transection. In this phase severe bleeding may occur due to laceration of the inferior vena cava (IVC) wall, rupture or ligation falling off the hepatic short vein (HSV) or bleeding from the right liver attachments. Besides, the twisting of the portal pedicle during mobilization can render the left hepatic lobe ischemic for transient interruption of the hepatopetal flow. These events are more frequent in case of large hepatic lesions (mainly HCC) that involves surrounding structures (such as diaphragm). Two of the most important factors that affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing liver resections are indeed intraoperative bleeding and postoperative liver dysfunction. For these reasons Lai et al proposed anterior approach as alternative to classic right hepatectomy. In this case liver mobilization is performed only at the end of parenchymal transection, when all vascular connections are already interrupted. Liu et al published the results of a retrospective study in which 54 patients with, right sided HCC greater than 5 cm underwent right hepatectomy using the anterior approach technique. The anterior approach group had significantly less intraoperative blood loss, less need of blood transfusion and a lower hospital mortality rate. The same group reported results of a prospective randomized controlled study analyzing 120 patients with large (&gt;5 cm) right liver HCC. The overall operative blood loss, morbidity, and duration of hospital stay were comparable in both groups. However, a higher number of patients in classic approach group experienced mayor operative blood loss (&gt; 2000 cc) and required blood transfusions (8.3% vs. 28.3%).</detailed_description>
