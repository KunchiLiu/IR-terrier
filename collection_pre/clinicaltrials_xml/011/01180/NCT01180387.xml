	<brief_summary>The Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN) is a nationwide cooperative network of 7 clinical sites and a data coordination center, and is sponsored in 5 year increments by The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The RMN is charged with designing, implementing and publishing high quality clinical research in reproductive medicine. It has been in existence for over 15 years and has performed several seminal clinical trials that have fundamentally changed clinical practice in this field. In addition, many worthy ancillary protocols have been generated and published. It is this latter fact, as well as the continued interest by investigators both inside and outside the RMN for access to DNA or serum samples from the previously performed trials, that has motivated the present investigators to proactively begin a biologic samples repository from the ongoing and pending RMN clinical trials. Ideally, this repository would allow investigators to seamlessly access trial samples for many years into the future, and thus greatly amplify the use of resources and the impact of the RMN.</brief_summary>
