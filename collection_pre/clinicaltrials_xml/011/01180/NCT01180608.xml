	<brief_summary>Functional Imaging of the therapeutic effect of Pregabalin in treatment for neuropathic pain in patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS): The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of Pregabalin as a treatment for neuropathic pain in a homogeneous study population, using proton MRS (1H MRS) focusing on four regions of interest (bilateral thalami, rostral anterior cingulated cortex (rACC) and dominant dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC).</brief_summary>
