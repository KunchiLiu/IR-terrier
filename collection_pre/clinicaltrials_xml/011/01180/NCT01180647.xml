	<brief_summary>This pilot study's primary aim is to compare rates of sustained opioid relapse, defined as self-reported opioid use &gt;50% (&gt;15 of 30) of days during the first 30 days following release from jail, among persons treated with XR-NTX pre-release vs. controls not receiving XR-NTX.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended-Release Naltrexone for Opioid Relapse Prevention Following Release From Jail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol randomizes persons soon-to-be-released from a large urban jail to treatment with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), a full opioid antagonist that prevents the activity of heroin and other opioids. Investigators at NYUSOM and NYC DOHMH will recruit heroin dependent persons from NYC jails who are soon-to-be-released, not accessing opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, with lowered tolerance due to incarceration, and extremely likely to relapse and risk accidental overdose at release. All N=40 participants receive a two-session, individual psychosocial intervention, Motivational Interviewing. Half (n=20) will be randomized to pre-release treatment with XR-NTX. Immediately and one month following release, participants will be offered continued psychosocial and medication-assisted treatment (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) at Bellevue Hospital, including a second XR-NTX dose among XR-NTX arm participants. The primary outcome is relapse to sustained opioid use during the first 30 days post-release. We hypothesize an XR-NTX arm will report significantly lower rates of sustained opioid relapse following release.</detailed_description>
