	<brief_title>Comparison Study of Narrow Band Imaging Versus White Light Resection in Patients With Bladder Tumors/Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently bladder tumors are diagnosed visually with standard cystoscopy that uses white light, or light that is generated encompassing the entire visual spectrum. Some tumors such as carcinoma in situ may not be visible using white light and require patients to undergo random bladder biopsies in order to find the cancer. Recently the development of photodynamic agents have been shown to enhance these procedures to accomplish better resection and identify over-looked tumors. However, these methods often require the instillation of dyes into the bladder as well as specialized cystoscopes. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is now available which uses a special filter to limit the light to only certain wavelengths which allows the identification of areas of increased vascularity or abnormalities without the need for dyes. NBI has been investigated in gastro-intestinal disease and found to be beneficial. Early reports in urology suggest that this technology may reduce the number of tumors that are missed which could impact the recurrence rate of bladder tumors, but this is not known at this time.</detailed_description>
