	<brief_title>Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training vs. Overground Walking Training in Persons With Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and overground walking training (OWT) are two interventions commonly applied for enhancing gait and balance in patients with chronic stroke. BWSTT and OWT are often used by clinicians separately or in tandem. While various aspects of the two interventions have been investigated in the past, limited research has been conducted to compare the effects of the two interventions in patients with chronic stroke. Longer training durations may not always be feasible due to limited reimbursement options, lack of clinic accessibility, or transportation restrictions for patients with chronic deficits following stroke. A short burst of training consisting of a ''booster''-like protocol may provide a convenient option for some patients with chronic stroke to improve necessary functional skills in a short period of time. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to compare walking speed immediately and 3-months after a short-burst of body-weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) or overground walking training (OWT) for adults with chronic stroke. Twenty participants with chronic stroke will be recruited and screened to determine eligibility for the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either BWSTT or OWT for 30 minutes, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Outcome measures will include assessments of gait speed, endurance, walking pattern, fear of falling, balance confidence, anxiety, and activity and participation in daily life. Outcomes will be tested prior to (pre-test) and immediately after (post-test) the assigned intervention and again 3-months after completing the intervention (retention).</detailed_description>
