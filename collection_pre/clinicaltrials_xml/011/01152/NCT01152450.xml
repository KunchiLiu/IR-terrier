	<brief_summary>Rationale for the current trial is to demonstrate 24 hour bronchodilator efficacy and safety of tiotropium 5 µg administered once daily (in the evening) which is regarded beneficial for the compliance and convenience of the patient in comparison to placebo. Further the rationale is to evaluate efficacy and safety of tiotropium 2.5 µg administered twice daily delivered by the Respimat® inhaler in comparison to placebo and tiotropium 5 µg administered once daily (in the evening) delivered by the Respimat® inhaler in patients with moderate persistent asthma. Rationale for the pharmacokinetic subinvestigation is to evaluate the 24 hours exposure to tiotropium in patients with moderate persistent asthma when administered 5 µg tiotropium once daily (in the evening) or 2.5 µg tiotropium twice daily.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. All patients must sign and date an Informed Consent Form consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice ( ICHGCP) guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in the trial (i.e. prior to any trial procedures, including any pretrial washout of medications and medication restrictions for pulmonary function test at Visit 1). 2. Male or female patients aged at least 18 years but not more than 75 years. 3. All patients must have at least a 3 months history of asthma at the time of enrolment into the trial. The diagnosis of asthma has to be confirmed at Visit 1 with a bronchodilator reversibility resulting in a Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) increase of equal above 12% and equal above 200mL. 4. The initial diagnosis of asthma must have been made before the patient's age of 40. 5. All patients must have a diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma and must be symptomatic despite their current maintenance treatment with medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids. 6. All patients must have been on maintenance treatment with a medium, stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids (alone or in a fixed combination with a Long Acting Betaadrenergic (LABA) or Short Acting Betaadrenergic (SABA)) for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 7. All patients must be symptomatic at Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 as defined by an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score 8. All patients must have a prebronchodilator FEV1 above equal 60% predicted and below equal 90% of predicted normal at Visit 1. Predicted normal values will be calculated according to the European Coal and Steel Community Guidelines (ECSC). 9. All patients must have an increase in FEV1 of equal above 12% and equal above 200 mL 15 minutes after 400 µg salbutamol at Visit 1. 10. Variation of absolute FEV1 values of Visit 1 (prebronchodilator) as compared to Visit 2 (predose) must be within ± 30% . 11. Patients must be neversmokers or exsmokers who stopped smoking at least one year prior to enrolment and who have a smoking history of less than 10 pack years. 12. Patients must be able to use the Respimat® inhaler correctly. 13. Patients must be able to perform all trial related procedures including technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and use of the eDiary/peak flow meter. 14. Patients taking a chronic pulmonary medication allowed by the study protocol must be willing to continue this therapy for the entire duration of the study (exception: times of acute disease deterioration). Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with a significant disease other than asthma.A significant disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may (i) put the patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the results of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the trial. 2. Patients with a clinically relevant abnormal screening hematology or blood chemistry if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion criterion no. 1. 3. Patients with a recent history (i.e. six months or less) of myocardial infarction. 4. Patients who have been hospitalised for cardiac failure during the past year. 5. Patients with any unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or a change in drug therapy within the past year. 6. Patients with lung diseases other than asthma (e.g. Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD)). 7. Patients with known active tuberculosis. 8. Patients with malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed. 9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. 10. Patients with significant alcohol or drug abuse within the past two years. 11. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the 6 weeks prior to V 1. 12. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, Benzalconiumchloride (BAC), Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) or any other components of the study medication delivery systems. 13. Pregnant or nursing women. 14. Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control. 15. Patients who have been treated with betablocker medication within four weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. Topical cardioselective betablocker eye medications for nonarrow angle glaucoma are allowed. 16. Patients who have been treated with the longacting anticholinergic tiotropium (Spiriva®) within four weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 17. Patients who have been treated with oral betaadrenergics within four weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 18. Patients who have been treated with oral corticosteroids within four weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 19. Patients who have been treated with antiIgE antibodies, e.g. omalizumab (Xolair®), within 6 months prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period.20. Patients who have been treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium within two weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 21. Patients who have been treated with methylxanthines within two weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 22. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within four weeks prior to Visit 1. 23. Patients who have been treated with other nonapproved and according to international guidelines not recommended "experimental" drugs for routine asthma therapy (e.g. TNFalpha blockers, methotrexate, cyclosporin) within four weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 24. Patients with any asthma exacerbation or any respiratory tract infection in the four weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 should be postponed in case of an asthma exacerbation or respiratory tract infection. 25. Patients who have previously been randomised in this trial or are currently participating in another trial. 26.Patients who have been treated with depot corticosteroids within six months prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period. 27.Patients who have been treated with leukotriene modifiers within two weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period.</criteria>
