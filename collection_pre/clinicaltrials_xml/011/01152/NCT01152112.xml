	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the MyoSure Tissue Removal System when used by community gynecologists in an office setting for the treatment of patients with symptomatic intrauterine polyps and submucosal fibroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HOME Study: Hysteroscopic Office Myomectomy Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one hundred subjects will be enrolled in a randomized, comparative setting study conducted at 10-15 investigational sites. Sixty subjects will be randomized to undergo treatment in an office setting, and 40 subjects will be randomized to undergo treatment in a hospital or ambulatory surgical center (ASC) setting. Subjects will undergo a hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure to remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 fibroids, or type I fibroids. Saline infused sonohysterogram images (SIS) obtained at three months post treatment will be compared to pre-treatment images, to determine the percent reduction in target pathology volume. Additionally, subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11 point scale) will compare pain occurring during the treatment procedure to the average pain level experienced during a PAP smear. Economic data will be collected and compared between the two treatment settings.</detailed_description>

Up to two Type 0 or Type 1 myomas with at least one of the myomas being ≥ 1.5 cm and none of the myomas being 3.0 cm diameter If the first myoma is 3.0 cm, the second myoma must be ≤ 2.0 cm Fundal myomas must be Type 0 Polyps plus up to two Type 0 or Type I myomas with at least one of the myomas being ≥ 1.5cm and ≤ 3.0 cm The subject demonstrates a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the planned index procedure The subject must document a score of 5 or lower on the Pap Smear and Blood Draw scales of the Pain Tolerance Survey Subject has known or suspected cancer, including breast, endometrial, and ovarian Contraindication and/or allergy to local anesthetic, or oral medications specified in the treatment protocol The subject has a history of chronic narcotic use Previous uterine artery embolization or other uterine artery occlusion procedure (Doppler or laparoscopic) Subject has blood borne pathogensHIV, hepatitis B, CJD, etc. Subject has an IUD at the time of the procedure.
