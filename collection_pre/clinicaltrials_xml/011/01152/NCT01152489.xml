	<brief_title>A Test of the Effectiveness of a Device and Distraction for Pediatric Immunization Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Needle pain is the most common and the most feared source of childhood pain, resulting in needle phobia for 10$ of adults. Current standard of care for immunizations in the US is no pain relief. An inexpensive, immediately effective form of needle pain control could reduce needle phobia or vaccine refusal in the long term if demonstrated to be effective for immunization pain. Distraction can decrease procedural distress in children by 50%. The effect of using a multi-modal pain and distraction relieving approach has not been rigorously studied.</detailed_description>
