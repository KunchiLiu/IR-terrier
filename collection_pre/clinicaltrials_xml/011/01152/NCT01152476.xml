	<brief_summary>Sevoflurane has been used commonly in pediatric anesthesia since 1990. However, it has caused more emergency agitation (EA) that other inhalation agents and the incidence is up to 80%. Therefore, lower minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane will reduce the EA when it is used with remifentanil in pediatric general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
