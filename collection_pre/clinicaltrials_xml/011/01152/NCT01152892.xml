	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of non-invasive markers of the autonomic function and micro- and macrocirculation to predict mortality and cardiovascular end points in end-stage renal disease patients. Furthermore we aim at getting new insight into the insufficiently understood pathophysiology leading to excessively high cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients.</brief_summary>
