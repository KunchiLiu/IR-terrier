	<brief_summary>Psychotropic medications are a cornerstone of treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, however rates of full or partial non-adherence can exceed 60%. Inadequate adherence is associated with poor outcomes such as relapse, homelessness, hospitalization, and increased health care costs. Studies have shown a direct correlation between non-adherence and rates of relapse in schizophrenia; on average, non-adherent patients have a risk of relapse that is 3.7 times greater than their adherent counterparts. A major obstacle to good outcomes in the maintenance treatment of patients with severe mental illness is difficulty with medication routines on an on-going basis. For this reason, long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication is a particularly attractive treatment option for populations with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, although it is unlikely that medication treatment alone is likely to modify long-term attitudes and behaviors. This prospective study is a pilot analysis of a combined approach which merges a psychosocial intervention to optimize treatment attitudes towards psychotropic medication (CAE) and long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication (L) in recently homeless individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are known to have on-going difficulties with treatment non-adherence. It is expected that this combined approach (CAE-L) will improve illness outcomes among the most vulnerable of populations with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.</brief_summary>
