	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Between an Oral Nicotine Replacement Product and Nicorette® Gum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a single-dose, randomized, crossover study with 76 subjects (all subjects will receive all treatments). The investigational products will be given as single doses at separate treatment visits. Periods without Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), lasting for at least 36 hours, will separate treatment visits. Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be drawn before and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, as well as at 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after start of product administration. Used gums will be collected and analyzed to determine the amount of remaining nicotine. Subjects will also be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur.</detailed_description>
