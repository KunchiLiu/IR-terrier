	<brief_summary>The objective of this SAMMPRIS-affiliated study is to understand the mechanisms the mechanisms that underlie ischemic stroke recurrence in high-grade intracranial atherosclerotic disease in order to determine predictors of recurrent stroke. MoSIS will evaluate 6 specific mechanisms of stroke in the medically-treated SAMMPRIS cohort: decreased antegrade flow, progression of stenosis, decreased proximal collateral flow, decreased distal collateral flow, impaired cerebrovascular reserve, and artery-to-artery embolism.</brief_summary>
