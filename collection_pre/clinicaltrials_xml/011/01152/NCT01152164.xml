	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Patients After Combined Modality Treatment of Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the last two decades, rectal cancer research has lead to better understanding of disease behaviour, resulting in more efficient treatments and higher prevalence of cancer survivors.Due to aggressive therapy, rectal cancer survivors can exhibit late sequelae of treatment, most common being impaired bowel, voiding, sexual malfunctioning and quality of life impairment. In order to determine the impact of rectal cancer and its treatment on patients' quality of life over time, this study will prospectively follow a cohort of patients at specified intervals evaluating their physical symptoms, physical and social functioning and overall quality of life.Medical and sociodemographic factors that might be predictive will be tested.</detailed_description>
