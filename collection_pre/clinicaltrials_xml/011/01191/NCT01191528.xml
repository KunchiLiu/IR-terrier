	<brief_summary>To compare two ways to test breathing after surgery in acute care setting. One method tests oxygen level of the blood, and one method will test oxygen and the carbon dioxide that is breathed out.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparison of Pulse Oximetry, End-tidal Capnometry, and Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A simple comparison design will be used to compare pulse SpO2 monitoring of respiratory status to a combination of pulse SpO2 monitoring and EtCO2 nasal cannula monitoring with Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI). Using combination monitor, each subject will serve as their own control with repeated measurements of respiratory rate, SpO2, EtCO2 and IPI at 5 second intervals. Patients will be monitored for a minimum of 8 hours after admission to the acute care unit and through the first night. Subjects for this study will be a convenience sample post-operative in-patients admitted to 2 East after surgery at Allenmore Hospital/Multicare Health System a 75 bed community facility.</detailed_description>
