	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with colorectal, stomach, or pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Colorectal, Stomach, or Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:I. To establish whether 2 vaccine dose levels of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 (MVAp53) vaccines are safe and well tolerated in patients with p53 over-expressing solid tumor malignancy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To provide preliminary evidence of enhanced cellular and humoral immunity to p53. OUTLINE:This is a phase I, dose-escalation trial of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 (MVAp53).Patients receive MVAp53 subcutaneously (SC) on days 0, 21, and 42 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>
