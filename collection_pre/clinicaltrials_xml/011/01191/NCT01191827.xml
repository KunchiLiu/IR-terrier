	<detailed_description>This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study patients treated with risperidone, a commonly used neuroleptic that does not improves sensory gating, to those treated with clozapine to determine which brain areas are involved in clozapine's normalization of sensory gating in schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
