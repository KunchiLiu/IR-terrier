	<detailed_description>Bystander CPR improves survival from Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest. This study is the first of its kind to examine the efficacy of ultra-brief video training for Hands-Only CPR without the use of a manikin. The results will inform future efforts to mass train citizens in CPR. Subjects were randomized to one of four training conditions, then assessed for CPR skills retention. The four groups were 1) no training; 2) ultra-brief training video (90 seconds); 3) short training video (5 minutes) with no practice; and 4) short training video with hands-on practice. The subjects were then evaluated for CPR skills retention. One half of the subjects were evaluated on the training day, and the other half were evaluated two months later.</detailed_description>
