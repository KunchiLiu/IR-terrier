	<brief_summary>Covered self expandable metal stents (CSEMS) are three times larger in diameter than 10 Fr plastic stents. When compared to plastic stents, randomized trials have shown longer patency and fewer stent-related complications for CSEMS. The investigators hypothesize that placement of CSEMS would be a better treatment option for preoperative biliary decompression in patients with pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Covered self expandable metal stents (CSEMS) are three times larger in diameter than 10 Fr plastic stents. When compared to plastic stents, randomized trials have shown longer patency and fewer stent-related complications for CSEMS. The investigators hypothesize that placement of CSEMS would be a better treatment option for preoperative biliary decompression in patients with pancreatic cancer as there will be better drainage of the obstructed biliary system with fewer adverse events.</detailed_description>
