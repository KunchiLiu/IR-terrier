	<brief_summary>There is a high rate of partial response to standard thymoleptic medication. In this study the investigators want to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donepezil as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder with acute mania. The investigators hypotheses were that there would be greater mean reduction in manic symptoms with donepezil augmentation of lithium compared with placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of AChE Inhibitor Donepezil As Adjunctive Treatment to Mood Stabilizers in Acute Mania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness that affects 1-2% of the general population. Lithium and valproate are effective for treatment of acute mania for many patients. However up to half of patients do not respond adequately to currently approved treatments in the acute phase of mania. More effective treatment for mania are need. Imbalance in cholinergic and adrenergic tone has long been postulated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In the pathophysiology of mania,relative cholinergic hypoactivity was being implicated. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In an open case series with standardized ratings, addition of donepezil 5-10 mg/day to ongoing mood-stabilizer treatment was associated with marked improvement in treatment-resistant mania. We want to conduct a 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil as augmentation of lithium in patients with acute manic episode to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donepezil as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder with acute mania.</detailed_description>
