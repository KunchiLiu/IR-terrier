	<brief_summary>This single arm, open label study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) for the treatment of renal anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes. Patients who are not on dialysis and not currently treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents will receive Mircera subcutaneously every 4 weeks. The starting dose of 1.2 mcg/kg Mircera will be adjusted according to haemoglobin levels. Anticipated time on study treatment is 28 weeks.</brief_summary>
