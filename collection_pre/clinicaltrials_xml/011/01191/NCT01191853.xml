	<brief_summary>Background: - Seasonal influenza is a major health problem whose impact is typically reduced by vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen that has the potential to cause devastating illness and even death in the coming months. Currently, there are limited data on the cellular and molecular immune responses in adult recipients of either the seasonal or the H1N1 influenza vaccines. Objectives: - To obtain blood and nasal wash samples and perform laboratory studies to characterize the immune response in healthy adult volunteers at baseline and after immunization with the seasonal or H1N1 influenza vaccines. Eligibility: - Adult employees at least 18 years of age of the NIH Clinical Center who are deemed healthy by a brief medical history and physical examination and routine blood testing. Design: - Before the start of the influenza season, volunteers will receive either the seasonal influenza vaccine or the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available. If the H1N1 vaccine is available at the start of the season, volunteers will receive both the seasonal vaccine and the H1N1 vaccine. - Blood will be drawn over an 8-week period. Volunteers must not eat anything for 8 hours prior to the blood draw. The sequence of the blood draws is as follows: 2 weeks before vaccination; right before vaccination; and 1, 7, 14, 28, and 60 days after vaccination. - Two to four nasal washings will be collected by a nurse before volunteers receive the vaccination(s) and 28 days after the vaccination. - Prevaccine and postvaccine blood and nasal wash samples will be compared to determine volunteers immune responses. - Research samples will be stored indefinitely and will be used strictly for laboratory experiments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cellular and Molecular Characterization of the Immune Response in Healthy NIH Employees atBaseline, and After Immunization With the H1N1 or Seasonal Influenza Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seasonal influenza is a major health problem whose impact is typically reduced by vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen which has the potential to cause devastating morbidity and mortality in the coming months. In June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 outbreak to be a global pandemic. At present there are limited data on the cellular and molecular immune responses in adult recipients of either the seasonal or the H1N1 influenza vaccines. Therefore the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes this protocol designed to obtain blood from healthy adult subjects (NIH employees) prior to vaccination and then at various time points after receiving the FDA-licensed seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccine. These samples will be used to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the immune system at baseline and in response to vaccination. To our knowledge, this protocol will be the first study to characterize the human cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or immunome, in a large number of healthy adults (NIH employees). This information may be useful in designing newer, more effective vaccines to prevent the spread of H1N1 influenza. The primary objective is to perform laboratory studies to characterize the immune response in healthy adult volunteers at baseline and after immunization with the seasonal or H1N1 influenza vaccines. Primary endpoint is the results of the research laboratory assessments. As samples will be stored indefinitely, the time frame for primary endpoint is indefinite.</detailed_description>
