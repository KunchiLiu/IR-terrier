	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female Chinese patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) confirmed by at least two of the following signs: resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity. 2. Parkinson's disease diagnosed for at least 2 years. 3. Patients 30 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis. 4. Modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 to 4 at ontime. 5. If a patient is treated with standard or controlled release Levodopa combined with a DopaDecarboxylaseinhibitor or with Levodopa combined with a DopaDecarboxylaseinhibitor/entacapone, the dosage should be optimised according to investigator's judgement, and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline visit. 6. If a patient treated with Levodopa combined with a DopaDecarboxylaseinhibitor has motor fluctuations, he should not have more than 6 hours of offtime every day during waking hours (documented on a patient diary completed for 2 consecutive days before baseline visit). 7. Patient willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures (in particular, after training, the patient should be able to recognise the offtime and ontime periods during waking hours and to record them accurately in the patient diary). 8. Signed informed consent obtained before any study procedures are carried out (in accordance with International Conference on HarmonisationGood Clinical Practice guidelines and local legislation). Exclusion criteria: Medical exclusions: 1. Atypical parkinsonian syndromes due to drugs (e.g., metoclopramide, flunarizine), metabolic disorders (e.g., Wilson's disease), encephalitis or degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy). 2. Dementia, as defined by a MiniMental State Exam score &lt; 24 at screening visit [R962656]. 3. Any psychiatric disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition)criteria that could prevent compliance or completion of the study and/or put the patient at risk if he/she takes part in the study. 4. History of psychosis, except history of drug induced hallucinations (provided the investigator considers that participation to the trial would not represent a significant risk for the patient). 5. History of deep brain stimulation 6. Clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities at screening visit, according to investigator's judgement. 7. Clinically significant hypotension (i.e. supine systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg) and/or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (i.e. clinical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension associated with a decline &gt;=20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and a decline &gt;= 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, at one minute after standing compared with the previous supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure obtained after 5 minutes of quiet rest) at screening or baseline visit. 8. Malignant melanoma or history of previously treated malignant melanoma. 9. Any other clinically significant disease, whether treated or not, that could put the patient at risk or could prevent compliance or completion of the study. 10. Pregnancy (to be excluded by urine pregnancy test at screening visit) or breastfeeding. 11. Sexually active female of childbearing potential (less than 6 months postmenopausal and not surgically sterilised) not using a medically approved method of birth control (i.e. oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, or doublebarrier) for at least one month prior to the screening visit and throughout the study period (up to the followup visit). 12. Serum levels of Aspartate Aminotransferase, Alanine Aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatases or total bilirubin &gt; 2 Upper Limit of Normal (on screening lab test). 13. Patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2 (estimated by the local lab / the investigator using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and calculated on screening lab test)</criteria>
