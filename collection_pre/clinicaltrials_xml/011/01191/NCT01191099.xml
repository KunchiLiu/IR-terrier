	<detailed_description>1. To perform a large scale assessment of tissue hypoxia by pimonidazole and hypoxia marker gene expression in human prostate cancers 2. To characterize expression and hypoxia/HIF-responsiveness of myoglobin, cytoglobin, Î±-hemoglobin in prostate tumors and cell lines 3. To identify uni- and multivariate associations between marker gene expression and clinico-pathological parameters for the detection of robust and novel prognostic tools in prostate cancers</detailed_description>
