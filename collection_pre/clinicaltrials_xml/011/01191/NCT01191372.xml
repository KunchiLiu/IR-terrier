	<mesh_term>Hemophilia A</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Adult male patients ≥18 to ≤75 years of age. Hemophilia of any type or severity. Patients who are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) I and II antibody tests at screening. Male patients who, with their partners, are willing to use 2 effective, methods of contraception (i.e., for both self and partner) throughout the study and for at least 3 months after discontinuation of study drug treatment. All patients must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and must have signed the informed consent document. Female patients; If on a prophylactic coagulation factor concentrate regimen, inability or unwillingness to discontinue prophylaxis during participation in this study. Existence of other coexisting bleeding disorder (e.g., von Willebrand Disease). Medical history of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Scheduled for elective surgical procedure during the conduct of this study. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of study entry. Transaminase values &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) at time of screening. Haemoglobin &lt;12.0 g/dL. Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a significant infection or known inflammatory process on screening. Participants who have a clinically relevant history or presence of respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, dermatological, connective tissue diseases or disorders. Any medical condition the investigator believes would place the patient at increased risk as a result of participation in the study e.g. history of thromboembolic disease or stroke. Any medication the investigator considers may increase the risk of adverse effects during the study.</criteria>
