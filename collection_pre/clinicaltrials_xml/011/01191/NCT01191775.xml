	<brief_title>A Study of PNT2258 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PNT2258 in patients with advanced solid tumors for which no standard therapy exists. Patients will receive PNT2258 as an intravenous infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5) of every 21-day cycle (3 weeks). At first, patients will be treated in single patient cohorts following an accelerated titration design and evaluated for toxicities. After the accelerated portion ends, patients will be treated in cohorts of at least 3 patients at each dose level and evaluated for treatment-related toxicities.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically confirmed, malignant solid tumor (measurable or nonmeasurable disease) and cannot be a candidate for known regimens or protocol treatments of higher efficacy or priority. Recovered to Grade 1 from all acute toxicities of prior therapies, except for residual toxicities, such as alopecia, which do not pose an ongoing medical risk. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.
