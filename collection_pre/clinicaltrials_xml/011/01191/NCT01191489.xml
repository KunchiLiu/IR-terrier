	<brief_summary>The main aim is to demonstrate whether the high flow conditioned oxygen therapy reduces the reintubation rate. Post-extubation respiratory failure risk will be stratified (as the randomization). In high risk patients high flow conditioned oxygen therapy will be compared with with not conditioned non-invasive mechanical ventilation. In low risk patients comparison will be conventional oxygen therapy. Hypercapnic patients will be excluded.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Low Risk Patients: Any extubated patients after tolerating a spontaneous breathing trial. High Risk Patients: Any extubated patients after &gt;48 hours under mechanical ventilation and any of the following: &gt;65 years cardiac failure as the primary indication of mechanical ventilation COPD APACHE II &gt;12 points the extubation day BMI &gt;30 inability to manage respiratory secretions 1 failed spontaneous breathing trial 1 comorbidity 7 days under mechanical ventilation &lt;18 years thacheotomized patients recent facial or cervical trauma/surgery active gastrointestinal bleeding lack of cooperation and patients with any failed spontaneous breathing trial because of hypercapnia development.</criteria>
