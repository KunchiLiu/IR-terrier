	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the CHF 1535 (fixed combination of Beclometasone Dipropionate (BDP) 100 µg / Formoterol Fumarate (FF) 6 µg) delivered via the NEXT Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) does not show a greater exposure to BDP, Beclometasone-17-Monopropionate(B17MP, active metabolite of BDP) and FF in comparison to a free combination of BDP DPI plus FF DPI licensed products after a morning dose administration of BDP and FF (total dose of BDP 400 µg / FF 24 µg) in adolescent and adult asthmatic patients.</brief_summary>
