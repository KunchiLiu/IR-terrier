	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the antisialagogues (anti-salivary agents), Atropine and Glycopyrrolate, are effective in reducing hypersalivation when sedating patients with Ketamine for procedural sedation in the emergency department or abscess clinic. The investigators will measure salivary flow rate by collecting oral secretions by oral suctioning over a 30 minute time period starting with the administration of Ketamine. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive either atropine or glycopyrrolate will have fewer oral secretions than patients who receive placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Atropine and Glycopyrrolate to Reduce Hyper Salivation With Ketamine Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ketamine is a common sedation agent used in the pediatric emergency department for a variety of procedures, used in clinical practice since 1970. One potential side effect of Ketamine is hypersalivation, potentially leading to laryngospasms. To prevent hypersalivation (and reduce the potential for laryngospasms), an anti-salivary agent, such as Atropine, is commonly given in combination with Ketamine. Recently, however, the necessity of this practice has been brought into question. The consideration of using a different drug, glycopyrrolate, has been debated. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of each medication in addition to the placebo control. Patients enrolled into this study must present to the emergency department or abscess clinic with the need to receive Ketamine as part of a sedation procedure (as determined by the treating physician). This study will randomize enrolled patients to receive double-blinded Atropine, Glycopyrrolate or placebo given 30 minutes prior to Ketamine. After Ketamine is administered, a trained medical person will suction the patient's mouth every 5 minutes for a total of 30 minutes, collecting all oral secretions. Total saliva production will be measured and salivary flow rates will be calculated and compared between each assigned group. Adverse events and complications will be monitored throughout the patient's stay in the emergency department or abscess clinic.</detailed_description>
