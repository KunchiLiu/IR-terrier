	<brief_title>A Study in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (AWARD-4)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term rescue therapy in this trial was defined as therapy for participants who met criteria for persistent severe hyperglycemia and therapy for participants who required new intervention for any other reason. The latter included participants who discontinued study drug due to adverse events, participant decision, or any other reason. For efficacy analyses, participants who received rescue medication were included in the analysis population, but only measurements obtained prior to taking rescue therapy were included in the efficacy analysis. For safety analyses, with the exception of hypoglycemia, all measurements including those obtained after taking rescue therapy were included in the analysis.</detailed_description>
