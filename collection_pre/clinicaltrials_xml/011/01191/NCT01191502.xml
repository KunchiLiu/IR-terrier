	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate visual acuity in different lighting conditions (daylight and night time) and distances (distance, near and intermediate), and the independence of glasses, in patients who have had binocular implantation of the Tecnis Multifocal IOL or the Crystalens™ HD Accommodating IOL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Photopic and Mesopic Distance, Intermediate and Near Visual Acuity, and Spectacle Independence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>18 years of age or older Status post bilateral cataract or refractive lens surgery (with or without LRI) and implantation of Tecnis™ Multifocal IOL or Crystalens™ HD Accommodating IOL Bestcorrected ETDRS equivalent visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye Naturally dilated pupil size (in dim light) &gt; 3.5 mm (with no dilation medications) for both eyes Clear intraocular media (no posterior capsular opacification, or status post YAG capsulotomy) Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination procedures Ocular disease which could potentially limit uncorrected visual acuity or visual performance. Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect visual outcomes Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.) Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease History of ocular trauma History of ocular surgery other than that required for inclusion in this study Amblyopia or strabismus Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.) Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of worse than 20/30 Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) Pupil abnormalities (nonreactive, tonic pupils or abnormally shaped pupils)</criteria>
