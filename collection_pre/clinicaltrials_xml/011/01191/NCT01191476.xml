	<brief_summary>This study is being performed to compare the cost of anesthetic techniques with sevoflurane (low fresh gas flow balanced anesthesia) versus propofol (target controlled infusion [TCI]) versus propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia in subjects undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery with predicted anesthesic use between 1 and 3 hour duration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Pharmaceutical Economics and Efficacy of Sevoflurane With Low Fresh Gas Flow Balanced Anesthesia, Propofol Target Controlled Infusion Anesthesia and Propofol Induction Sevoflurane Maintenance Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three hundred thirty-six subjects were enrolled in this study. Two subjects, one treated with propofol for induction and maintenance and one treated with propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance are not included in the study participation since no information was available for these two subjects.</detailed_description>
