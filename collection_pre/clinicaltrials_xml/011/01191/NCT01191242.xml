	<brief_summary>Methadone has been an effective and inexpensive therapy in the management of chronic pain and opioid dependence. However it has been associated with sudden, unexpected deaths. Two mechanisms have been suggested, increased drug concentration in the blood, and a change in the heart rhythm. This study will look at blood samples for drug levels and genetic components and EKG's (a noninvasive test which reveals heart rhythm). There will be no intervention.</brief_summary>
