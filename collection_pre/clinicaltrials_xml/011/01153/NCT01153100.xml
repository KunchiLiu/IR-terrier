	<brief_summary>The investigators anticipate that the use of Glargine will decrease the duration of an insulin drip, the dose of short-acting insulin in the drip, hospital and ICU (intensive care unit) length of stay, improve glycemic control, and prevent rebound hyperglycemias when the insulin drip is discontinued.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic states, hyperglycemia with severe illness, pre and postoperative states, nothing by mouth (NPO), as well as gastric (tube feeding) and parenteral nutrition requiring insulin drip. Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) will be included. Patients with both types of diabetes will be among those treated with the insulin drip while being NPO, having severe concomitant illness or receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition. Patients will be of age 19 to 80. Inability to consent for the study for any reason including cognitive impairment secondary to hyperglycemia, presence of severe medical conditions requiring intubation, severe sepsis, hypothermia, and anticipated length of insulin drip 2 weeks and longer, pregnancy, Lantus allergy, and concurrent sulfonamide treatment</criteria>
