	<brief_summary>This protocol (a supplement to 805466) is to test whether our telephone continuing care model can be implemented successfully by "real world" publicly funded programs. Participants will be recruited from Philadelphia's Department of Behavioral Health - run drug programs. The investigators will train city telephone care managers to deliver our telephone continuing care intervention to patients in this program. The investigators will randomize 200 to receive this intervention or usual care and follow them for 12 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>(1) qualify for a DSMIV diagnosis of cocaine dependence, with cocaine use in the 6 months prior to entrance into the City of Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health facilities or controlled environment; (2) 18 to 75 years of age; (3) no current psychotic disorder (as assessed with the psychotic screen from the SCID) or evidence of dementia severe enough to prevent participation in outpatient treatment; (4) no acute medical problem requiring immediate inpatient treatment; (5) no current participation in methadone or other modes of Drug and Alcohol treatment, other than an Intensive Outpatient Program; (6) willingness to be randomized and participate in research. (7) Finally, because of study followup requirements, subjects will be able to provide the name, verified telephone number, and address of at least two contacts who can provide locating information on the patient during followup. We will include patients with dependence on other substances, provided that they are cocaine dependent and meet other inclusion criteria. Current dependence on opiates is an exclusion as those participants may be better served as part of a methadone program rather than a telephone based therapy protocol. Also, if patients are courtordered to treatment, or otherwise considered prisoners, they will not be included in the study.</criteria>
