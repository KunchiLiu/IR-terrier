	<brief_summary>Recent clinical trials in non diabetics showed that vitamin D supplementation markedly reduced serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, and tissue matrix metallo-proteinases. Our study objective is to evaluate if administration of vitamin D in African Americans with hypovitaminosis D and DM Type 2 decreases serum levels of inflammatory/thrombotic markers such as CRP: Highly Sensitive C Reactive Protein.</brief_summary>
