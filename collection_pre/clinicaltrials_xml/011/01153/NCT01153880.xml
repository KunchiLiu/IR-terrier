	<brief_summary>Retapamulin, a topical pleuromutilin antibiotic, is the first in a new class of topical antibiotics approved for human use. In the United States (US), retapamulin is approved for the treatment of impetigo in persons nine or more months of age and was launched on 12 April 2007. This five-year study is designed to examine use of retapamulin in the pediatric population less than nine months of age. We will conduct an annual assessment of prescription sales claims for retapamulin using the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS) National Managed Care Benchmarked Database. For each year of reporting, the observed frequencies of the exposure, with or without same-day, co-prescribed sales claim of mupirocin, will be identified. The study objectives are to determine the frequency of retapamulin sales in a representative US population stratified by the designated age group and to determine the frequency of same-day sale of the topical agent, mupirocin.</brief_summary>
