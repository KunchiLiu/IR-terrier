	<brief_summary>Schema focused therapy (SFT) is an innovative treatment approach to chronic, lifelong problems that incorporates cognitive, behavioral, experiential and psychodynamic elements and techniques. This study will determine whether SFT is a suitable and effective treatment for chronic depression in terms of acute effects and the prevention of relapse/recurrence. The secondary aim of this study is to identify the underlying mechanisms of change in SFT that lead to recovery from depression and the prevention of future relapse/recurrence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single-case series design with multiple randomized baselines across participants will be used in this study. The study will last approximately 36 months and comprises three phases. The first phase is a 6-12 weeks waiting list/baseline phase during which participants will be repeatedly assessed with the main outcome measures and putative mediators. In the second phase participants will receive up to 75 individual sessions of SFT for chronic depression depending on the individual progress in therapy. Upon completion of the intervention phase, participants will have monthly follow-up assessments for the next 12 months.</detailed_description>
