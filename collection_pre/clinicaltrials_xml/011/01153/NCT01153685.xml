Satisfactory baseline medical assessment by history and physical examination Comprehension of the study requirements, ability to comprehend and comply with procedures for collection of safety data, expressed availability for the required study period, and ability and willingness to attend scheduled visits. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Participation in previous year's (2009) Fluviral registration study Administration of any influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the study start (35 or more subjects in the &gt;60 year old age stratum will be recruited from among those who did NOT receive any inactivated influenza vaccine in 20092010 season, i.e. seasonal TIV or pandemic H1N1v). Administration of any other vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during the study period. Subjects who receive such treatment after enrollment will be followed per protocol and included in the safety analysis, but excluded from the accordingtoprotocol cohort. Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within 1 year preceding the study start. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Acute disease at the time of enrollment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever). All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness, i.e. oral temperature &lt;38.0°C. Significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness. "Uncontrolled" is defined as: Requiring institution of new medical or surgical treatment within one (1) month prior to study enrollment, or Requiring the reinstitution of a previously discontinued medication or medical treatment within one month prior to study enrollment, or Requiring a change in medication dosage in the one month prior to study enrollment due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a SAE within one month prior to study enrollment. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition including: History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Cancer or treatment for cancer, within 3 years of study enrollment. Persons with a history of cancer who are diseasefree without treatment for 3 years or more are eligible. History of renal impairment. History of hepatic dysfunction due to hepatitis B, C or toxins including alcohol. Complicated insulindependent diabetes mellitus. Unstable cardiopulmonary disease requiring chronic medical therapy or associated with functional impairment. Presence of blood dyscrasias, including hemoglobinopathies and myelo or lymphoproliferative disorder. Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids (prednisone &gt;= 20 mg/day for more than 14 consecutive days) within 1 month of study enrollment, or any cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs within six months of study enrollment. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. A history of any demyelinating disease including Multiple Sclerosis and GuillainBarré syndrome. Presence of an active neurological disorder. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Any significant disorder of coagulation that increases the risk of intramuscular injections or treatment with coumadin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g. lowdose aspirin, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency are eligible. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral (egg protein, thimerosal) and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to consumption of eggs, and/or reactions to products containing mercury (such as thimerosal). A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination. Pregnant and/or lactating/nursing female.
