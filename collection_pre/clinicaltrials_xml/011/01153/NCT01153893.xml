	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A when administered either as a booster dose or as a two dose catch-up vaccination in the second year of life to the Nigerian subjects previously enrolled in the primary vaccination study NCT00678301. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00678301).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR(s)) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female, between and including 1521 months of age at the time of visit 1. For the PnPn group, subjects who completed the full vaccination course in study NCT00678301. For the ZilPn group, subjects who were previously enrolled in the control group of study NCT00678301. Written informed consent, signed or thumb printed, obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by a witness. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s)/product(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to vaccination. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after. Locally recommended vaccines for example Oral Polio Vaccine or influenza vaccine are always allowed, even if concomitantly administered with the study vaccines, but should be documented in the CRF. Concurrently participating in another clinical study at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Administration of any pneumococcal vaccine since the end of study NCT00678301. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, since the end of study NCT00678301, based on medical history and physical examination. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any progressive neurological disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products less than 3 months prior to visit 1 or planned use during the study. Child in care.</criteria>
