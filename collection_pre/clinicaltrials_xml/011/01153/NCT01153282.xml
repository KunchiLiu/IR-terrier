	<brief_title>Physical Functional Side Effects of Taxane Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taxanes, a type of chemotherapeutic agent prescribed to breast cancer patients, have a known physical side effect of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The purpose of this qualitative study is to understand the experience and physical functional side effects of taxanes. This is the first of a two phase study. The overall goal is to identify existing objective physical performance measures to assess functional side effects of taxanes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women 2170 years old (Women over 70 are offered chemotherapy less frequently because of their risk benefit ratio. Including them would be a selection bias because of their differential underexposure). Initiated taxanebased chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or previously untreated metastatic setting. The range of exposure to taxanebased chemotherapy will include women on active treatment having received two cycles, to women who are within three months of their last infusion. Documented symptoms of CIPN per CTCAE grading criteria (half of sample) or NO symptoms (half of sample) Grade 0 = no CIPN symptoms Grade 1 = mild symptoms Grade 2 = moderate symptoms prescribed Gabapentin (Neurontin) Grade 3&amp;4= severe symptoms treated with Gabapentin (Neurontin), treatment plan altered Physical disabilities defined by use of assistive devices to complete functional tasks (wheelchair, crutches, prosthetic limbs) prior to starting chemotherapy. Current exposure to neurotoxic agents (Navelbine, platinums or other taxanes) Pregnancy during chemotherapy treatment Diabetes diagnosed 3 or more years , or insulin dependent, or with clinically established neuropathy Previous exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy HIV positive (high risk for neuropathy) Other neurological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis Other preexisting neuropathy</criteria>
