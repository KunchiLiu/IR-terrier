	<brief_summary>The purpose of this challenge grant is to conduct an initial test of a new, enhanced version of this protocol (telephone monitoring and counseling - enhanced, or TMAC-E), which has been modified to include the elements of our existing continuing care intervention plus patient-centered changes to boost patient involvement and community linkages. The investigators will recruit 150 cocaine dependent patients in publicly funded, community-based programs and randomize them to treatment as usual or the TMAC-E and follow them for 12 months.</brief_summary>
