	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will be to evaluate, in a multi-center setting, the ability of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of breast cancer lumpectomy sites to extend the "final" negative margin and consequently decrease the rates of re-operation. During the initial breast conservation procedure (lumpectomy), immediately following routine surgical resection of the tumor, radiofrequency energy (RFA) is applied to the wall (bed) of the fresh lumpectomy cavity, thus extending tumor free margin radially beyond the volume of the resected specimen.</brief_summary>
