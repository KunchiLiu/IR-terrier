	<brief_title>Moderating the Negative Impact of Abnormal Screening Mammograms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of two parts. Part 1 (focus groups) interviewed 11 women in total (6 diagnosed with breast cancer and 5 diagnosed with benign breast disease) reinforced the need for online information during the breast diagnostic process. The focus group reviewed online CHESS-Mammo module and suggested minor changes to content. Part 2 (Evaluation) will enroll 130 women in study and compare one group (65 participants) who receives access to CHESS-Mammo to another group of women (65 participants) who receive an email message containing screening mammography information. Both groups in Part 2 will be evaluated for health information competence, psychological distress, and patient satisfaction with physician through questionnaires. An evaluation of the group that accesses the CHESS-Mammo website will be done. The reason for conducting part 2 of this study is to allow greater insight into the clinical application of a novel Interactive Cancer Communication Systems (CHESS-Mammo) early in the diagnostic workup of breast cancer. By doing this project, we may achieve an important new way of implementing CHESS-Mammo in the clinic.</detailed_description>
