	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine the causes of "orthostatic intolerance" which occurs more commonly in women than in men. Orthostatic tolerance is the ability to remain standing up right for long periods of time, or to avoid dizziness when moving to standing from a seated or lying position.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sex Hormones and Orthostatic Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we are interested in determining the impact of female reproductive hormones (estrogen and progesterone) on orthostatic tolerance (described above) so we administer these hormones to participants. We also test participants' orthostatic tolerance in our laboratory and use this information to place subjects into groups.</detailed_description>
