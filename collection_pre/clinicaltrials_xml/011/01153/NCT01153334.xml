	<brief_summary>Objectives: An investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy of early intensive rosuvastatin therapy (rosuvastatin 40 mg for pre-PCI loading and 7 days post PCI and 10 mg daily thereafter) versus low dose conventional statin therapy (placebo for pre-PCI loading and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily after primary PCI) on infarct size measured by cardiac MRI and clinical outcomes in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Hypothesis: The infarct size in the early high dose rosuvastatin group is smaller than that of the control patients treated with low does conventional statin therapy.</brief_summary>
