	<brief_title>Romiplostim in Treating Hepatitis C-Infected Patients With Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the platelet count response to administration of weekly romiplostim patients with HCV infection whose initial platelet count is &lt; 70,000/L. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability of romiplostim the treatment of patients with HCV infection and thrombocytopenia; including physical symptoms and findings, hematologic, serum chemistries and liver function tests and adverse events. II. To assess the ability of romiplostim to enable subjects to achieve a platelet count sufficient to start antiviral therapy. III. To assess the ability of romiplostim to maintain platelet counts greater than 50,000/L while receiving antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive placebo subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks. Patients failing to achieve a platelet count of &gt; 100,000/L cross over to arm I. Patients achieving a platelet count of &gt; 100,000/L at 8 weeks receive PEG-interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously once weekly and oral ribavirin once daily. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 24-48 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 and 36 weeks.</detailed_description>
