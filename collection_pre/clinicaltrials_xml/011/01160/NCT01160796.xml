	<brief_summary>This is a national, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, phase III superiority trial. The main objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy of Lcr35® by comparing the mean time before the onset of the first clinical recurrence confirmed by laboratory tests in patients with bacterial vaginosis treated with Lcr35® versus placebo. Patients with bacterial vaginosis will be enroll by private gynecologists. Each patient will receive a treatment for the initial episode(Metronidazole)and a treatment to prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis (Lcr35®).</brief_summary>
