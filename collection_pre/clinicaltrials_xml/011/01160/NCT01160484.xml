	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg/dose in combination with bortezomib at 1.0 mg/m2/dose, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) at 4.0 mg/m2/dose, and intravenous (IV) dexamethasone at 40 mg/dose in adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The study consists of a screening period, followed by up to eight 28 day open label treatment cycles, a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle, and a follow-up period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone and Lenalidomide for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that combinations of PLD and bortezomib have striking synergy in preclinical studies and impressive response rates (73 &amp; 89%) in early clinical trials for MM patients with relapsed/refractory disease as well as first-line therapy. In addition, the efficacy of PLD with bortezomib in anthracycline-insensitive patients has been greater than single-agent bortezomib when comparing across studies. The immunomodulatory drugs, thalidomide and lenalidomide, target the tumor cell microenvironment, are antiangiogenic, have an immune activation effect and also exert a direct cytotoxic effect on myeloma cells. A phase 1 clinical study by our group also demonstrated that low dose PLD, administered at a more frequent dosing schedule, in combination with bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVD regimen) is well tolerated and associated with high response rates and durable responses. In this phase II prospective trial, we will evaluate this regimen and show that this change enhances the DVD-R regimen's safety and efficacy for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.</detailed_description>
