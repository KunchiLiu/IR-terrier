	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if participants with Stage IV NSCLC have a better outcome when treated with IMC-1121B in combination with pemetrexed + carboplatin/cisplatin or gemcitabine + carboplatin/cisplatin than when treated with pemetrexed + carboplatin/cisplatin or gemcitabine + carboplatin/cisplatin alone.</brief_summary>
