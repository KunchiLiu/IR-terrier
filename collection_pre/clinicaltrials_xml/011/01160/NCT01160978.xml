	<brief_title>Donor Simvastatin Treatment in Organ Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis is that the per orally administered donor-related simvastatin treatment protects the transplanted organs for cold ischemia-related injury and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Also, it potentially decreases natural immune activity, rejection activation and thus improves long-term prognosis. 80 mg simvastatin is administered into donor circulation through the nasogastric tube 4-6 hours prior organ harvesting. The impact of donor simvastatin treatment is investigated and analyzed by several specific blood samples and biopsies that are taken from the recipient at the various time-points during the perioperative and postoperative phase. The randomized and blinded control group includes heart-, lung-, kidney-, and liver recipients whose organ donors have not received any statin medication prior organ harvesting.</detailed_description>
