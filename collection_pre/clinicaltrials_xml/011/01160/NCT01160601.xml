	<criteria>Key Adults over 18 years of age with a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC that has not been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version 1.1). Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function. PT / INR ≤ 1.5 × ULN, aPTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN and Ddimer ≤ 3 × ULN. Key Squamous cell, small cell, or mixed histology. Known history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Cavitary tumors or tumors abutting large blood vessels. Bleeding: Clinically significant bleeding, such as gross hematuria, GI bleeding and hemoptysis, within 12 months of Screening. Venous thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary thromboembolism) within 6 months of Screening. Ongoing therapy with oral or parenteral anticoagulants. Concurrent estrogens, antiestrogens or progesterone compounds. Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks preceding Study Day 1. Symptomatic or clinically active brain metastases. Major surgery within 4 weeks of Study Day 1. Uncontrolled intercurrent disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disease). Symptomatic coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident,transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina pectoris within 6 months of Screening.</criteria>
