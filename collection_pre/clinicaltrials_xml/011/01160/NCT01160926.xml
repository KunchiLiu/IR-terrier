	<brief_summary>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD6244 or AZD2171 when combined with pre-operative capecitabine and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual REctcal Angiogenesis or MEK Inhibition radioTHERAPY Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best curative resection rates reported for patients with operable rectal cancer treated with standard chemoradiotherapy are approximately 50-60%.The pathological complete response rates are only 10-20%. Therefore, there is a need for more effective treatment. In this trial we will evaluate the combination of chemoradiotherapy with either a VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) or MEK (MAP Kinase)inhibitor. Aims 1. Define the tolerability, MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and DLT (dose limiting toxicities) of chemoradiotherapy in combination with - cediranib, a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits angiogenesis or - AZD6244, a potent MEK inhibitor that inhibits cell proliferation 2. Define a dose suitable for phase II evaluation 3. Test the impact of the combination on soluble and imaging (FLT-PET and DCEMRI/DWI) biomarkers to guide their use in phase II testing Summary Patients will receive standard chemoradiotherapy plus ascending doses of AZD6244 or cediranib from day -10 (relative to start of chemoradiotherapy) to day 35. If feasible, patients' tumours will be resected 10-12 weeks after treatment. Translational studies on available tissue and blood will be performed and DCE-MRI/DWI and FLT-PET will be carried out on 5 patients in the expanded cohort for AZD6244 (FLT-PET and DCE-MRI) and 5 patients in the expanded cohort for cediranib (DCE-MRI). Cohorts Cediranib - 15mg od, 20mg od and 30mg od AZD6244 - 50mg bd and 75mg bd</detailed_description>
