	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. AZD6244 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether fulvestrant is more effective with or without AZD6244 in treating patients with advanced breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well fulvestrant works with or without AZD6244 in treating patients with advanced breast cancer that progressed after aromatase inhibitor therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant With or Without AZD6244 in Treating Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer That Progressed After Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the efficacy of fulvestrant with versus without MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in patients with advanced stage, endocrine-sensitive breast cancer that progressed after aromatase inhibitor therapy. Secondary - To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - To examine other outcome parameters. - To develop a virtual tissue bank for future translational research. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, prior treatment with tamoxifen citrate (yes vs no), the setting in which prior aromatase inhibitor was given (adjuvant treatment vs advanced stage treatment), HER-2 disease (positive vs negative), visceral metastasis (present vs absent), performance status (0 vs 1 or 2), and disease (measurable disease vs bone-only disease or small but unequivocal liver or lung metastases). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (experimental): Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and on day 1 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive oral AZD6244 twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (control): Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I. Patients also receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
