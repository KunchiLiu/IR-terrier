	<brief_summary>Few reports described outcomes of complete compared with infarct related artery (IRA) only revascularization in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multivessel coronary disease (CAD). The purpose of this study is to determine outcome (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel failure) of 180 consecutive patients with STEMI and multivessel CAD undergoing primary angioplasty. Before the first angioplasty patients are randomized to 2 different strategies: 1) culprit vessel angioplasty only, 2) staged revascularization.</brief_summary>
