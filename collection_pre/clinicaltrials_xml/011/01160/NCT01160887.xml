	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with diabetes-related peripheral neuropathic pain also have non-recognized damage to the intestine caused by autonomic neuropathy. The model will shed light on aspects of peripheral nerve injuries on both somatic and as well as visceral sensory nerves. Classical autonomic parameters from electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter (24-h ECG and blood pressure) are compared with peripheral nerve injuries. The damage of autonomic nerves often recognized late in the course when patients develop gastroparesis, however an earlier recognition of this nerve damage may help clarifying the fundamental pathomechanisms and thereby optimize treatment for this patient group in the future.</brief_summary>
