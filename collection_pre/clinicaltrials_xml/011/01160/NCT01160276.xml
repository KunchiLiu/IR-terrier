	<brief_summary>Ciclosporin inhibits P-glycoprotein should increase colchicine bioavailability whereas tacrolimus should not influence colchicine disposition. This is a prospective, controlled, open labeled study performed in renal graft recipients comparing colchicine single dose (1mg) pharmacokinetics in 14 patients treated with tacrolimus and 14 patients treated with cyclosporin.</brief_summary>
