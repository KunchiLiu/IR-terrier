	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing two antibiotic treatment regimens for acute PID. Women with acute PID will be randomized to one of two treatment regimens: 1) a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days, along with placebo tablets orally twice a day for 14 days or 2) same doses of ceftriaxone and doxycycline, and metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days. The primary objective is to compare the eradication of anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract between women who receive standard outpatient antibiotic treatment to those who receive standard outpatient treatment along with a two-week course of metronidazole.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing two antibiotic treatment regimens for acute PID. Women with acute PID will be randomized to one of two treatment regimens. One group of women will receive a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days, along with placebo tablets orally twice a day for 14 days. The second group of women will receive the same doses of ceftriaxone and doxycycline, and metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days. The primary objective is to compare the eradication of anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract in women with acute PID who receive standard outpatient antibiotic treatment to the eradication of these organisms from the upper genital tract in women who receive standard outpatient treatment along with a two-week course of metronidazole. Women will be followed for one month for clinical outcomes, and will undergo assessment for clearance of microorganisms from the upper genital tract. Our hypothesis is that an antibiotic treatment regimen that includes anaerobic coverage will more effectively clear anaerobic organisms from the endometrium in women with acute PID compared to a standard antibiotic treatment regimen lacking effective antibiotic coverage against anaerobes.</detailed_description>
