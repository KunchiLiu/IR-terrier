	<brief_title>To Determine the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Effect on Pain of a Single Intra-articular Administration of Canakinumab in Patients With Osteoarthritis in the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled 18 weeks study, consisting of two parts: 1. Part A: an ascending single dose part in which the safety and tolerability of up to 4 different canakinumab doses are studied (starting dose 150 mg, maximum dose 600 mg). 2. Part B: a double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel design part in which the pain reduction of the canakinumab dose selected from part A is studied in comparison to Placebo and Naproxen.</detailed_description>

Patients who are on stable dose of opioids for at least 1 month before screening can continue to take their opioid at this stable dose throughout the study. 8. Patients must also be willing to abstain from any intraarticular or periarticular injections to the knee or surgery during the treatment period 9. Patients who, if they are currently taking aspirin (325 mg/day or less; as anticoagulants), are willing to remain on a stable dose one month prior to screening and throughout the study 1.

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive pregnancy test (serum or urine). 14. Subjects with known contraindications to naproxen (e.g. heart or circulation problems, history of ulcer disease etc.), analgesics, antipyretics, or NSAIDs. 15.

Observational arthroscopy, arthroscopic surgery or lavage of the knee within the last 6 months. 17. Use of assistive devices other than a cane (walking stick) or knee brace. 18. Subjects who have experienced, any time in the past, asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic edema, urticaria or other allergictype reaction after taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)/ aspirin or NSAIDs. 19.
