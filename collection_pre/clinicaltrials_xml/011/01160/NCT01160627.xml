	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of prevention of contrast induced nephropathy in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Three-center study Acute kidney injury was defined as a rise in creatinine &gt;25% from baseline Serum creatinine will be measured at baseline and each day for the following 3 days and at 30 days. Patients will be randomised to: 1. Standard treatment 2. Standard treatment + acetylcystein for 2 days 3. Standard treatment + Sodium bicarbonate 500 ml / followed by 100 ml/h for 5 hours 4. Standard treatment + acetylcystein for 2 days + Sodium bicarbonate 500 ml / followed by 100 ml/h for 5 hours</brief_summary>
