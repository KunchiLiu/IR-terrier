	<brief_summary>Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an increase in BAFF (BLyS) levels and a resulting B cell hyperactivity. B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of SS in both systemic and glandular features, and B cell downregulation may lead to a decrease of disease activity. Moreover, pathogenesis of SS is closed to that of Systemic lupus erythematosus, where Belimumab has been proven to be effective.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an increase in BAFF (BLyS) levels and a resulting B cell hyperactivity. B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of SS in both systemic and glandular features, and B cell downregulation may lead to a decrease of disease activity. Moreover, pathogenesis of SS is closed to that of Systemic lupus erythematosus, where Belimumab has been proven to be effective. This phase II open-label study has 2 mains objectives: - To evaluate the proof of concept of efficacy of belimumab in subjects with SS - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in subjects with SS Belimumab will be administered (10mg/kg on D0 D14 D28 and every 28 days for 24 weeks, with extension to 48 weeks if responders) to all patients</detailed_description>
