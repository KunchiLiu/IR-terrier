	<detailed_description>In order to document the epidemiological changes in the sero-prevalence of Hepatitis A, Human simplex virus (1 and 2), Varicella-Zoster virus and Cytomegalovirus infections, we propose to conduct a population based, seroprevalence, cross-sectional study, in Mexico. This will allow the identification of susceptible populations, which in turn, will serve as evidence for the elaboration of recommendations for the prevention of Hepatitis A, Human simplex virus, Varicella-Zoster virus and Cytomegalovirus infection in the region. This study was conducted using data and serum samples from a random sample of subjects that participated in the 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey.</detailed_description>
