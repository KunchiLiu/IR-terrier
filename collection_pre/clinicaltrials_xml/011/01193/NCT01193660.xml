	<brief_title>Allogenic Umbilical Cord Blood and Erythropoietin Combination Therapy for Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement and posture that result from a nonprogressive lesion or injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood onset disability through one's life. Umbilical cord blood(UCB) is suggested as therapeutic method for cerebral palsy which resulted from animal studies. Stem cells included in UCB is expected to exert therapeutic efficacy for functional recovery. It is also suggested that erythropoietin is useful to repair neurological injury in brain. The main mechanism of erythropoietin is supposed to be neuroprotection and neurogenesis which would reinforce the effect of stem cell as well. Although autologous umbilical cord would be safe, the children who have problems at birth seldom have autologous umbilical cord blood. Allogenic umbilical cord blood might be useful for these children if its effect is approved.</detailed_description>
