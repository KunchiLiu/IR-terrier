	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a multi-center randomized controlled trial, comparing two groups of patients with symptomatic extra-articular malunited distal radius fractures. One group of patients will undergo corrective surgery of the distal radius, with preoperative computer-assisted planning and virtual osteotomy, and the other group will undergo corrective surgery, with conventional (non-computer-assisted) preoperative planning. The investigators hypothesize that computer-assisted surgical planning will result in a better functional outcome.</brief_summary>
