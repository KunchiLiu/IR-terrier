	<detailed_description>1. The blast count in b/m after 7 days of prednisolone &gt;25% was shown in 64% of patients. The substitution of prednisolone by dexamethasone did not influence survival. 2. "no interruptions" induction was performed in 48% of patients. 3. In 19% of patients the L-asparaginase therapy was stopped due to toxicity. 4. Autologous stem cell transplantation was done in 20% of T-cell ALL patients.</detailed_description>
