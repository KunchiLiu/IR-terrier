	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of PF-04995274 on cerebrospinal fluid levels of soluble Amyloid precursor protein fragments and Amyloid beta fragments following single oral dose in healthy volunteers. Safety and tolerability of PF-04995274 single dose administration in healthy volunteers will also be assessed as part of the objectives.</brief_summary>
