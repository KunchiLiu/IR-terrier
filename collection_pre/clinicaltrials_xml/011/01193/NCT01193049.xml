	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between upper and lower airway allergen-induced cytokine responses in mild asthmatics by attempting to demonstrate the following: 1) a positive correlation between allergen-induced Type 2 T-helper cell (Th2) cytokines (interleukins 5 and 13) in sputum and nasal exudates; and 2) a positive correlation between effects of prednisone versus placebo on Th2 cytokines in sputum and nasal exudates.</brief_summary>
