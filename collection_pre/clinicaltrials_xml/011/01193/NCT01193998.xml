	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Presentation to the ED with undifferentiated shortness of breath Dyspnea of obvious cause, e.g. chest trauma, obvious clinical exacerbation of known chronic obstructive disease Obvious pulmonary edema in a patient with a known diagnosis of HF and recently admitted to hospital for HF Clinician does not plan to treat for AHF at all, but rather to pursue other causes of dyspnea (i.e., probability of AHF ≤ 20%) Clinician plans to treat for AHF and not to pursue other causes of dyspnea (i.e., probability of AHF ≥ 80%) Acute coronary syndrome within one month Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine ≥ 250 mol/l) Anticipated life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to noncardiovascular causes Participation in another interventional outcome trial Inability to obtain informed consent, including inability of patient to understand English</criteria>
