	<brief_summary>The investigators conducted a recent pilot study and found a strong positive correlation between the consumption of 100% chocolate and acne exacerbation. However, this study had limitations including the lack of placebo and the small sample size. Although studies have been conducted assessing chocolate's effect on acne, no study has been done evaluating this effect using chocolate with 100% cocoa content in a double blind placebo controlled fashion. This study will analyze the difference in the number and type of acneiform lesions per subject at the different time points (Day 4 and Day 7) compared to baseline in order to increase the validity of the investigators results. In addition, the investigators will use unsweetened cocoa powder,12 rather than chocolate candy, which contains higher quantities of additive ingredients such as sugar and milk to avoid interference with the results and the possibility to establish or not an association between the unsweetened cocoa and an effect on acne.</brief_summary>
