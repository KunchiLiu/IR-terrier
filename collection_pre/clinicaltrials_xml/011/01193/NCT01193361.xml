	<criteria>Subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 as documented by: positive for antiHCV antibody, HCV RNA, or a positive HCV genotype test at least 6 months prior to Screening, and positive for HCV RNA and antiHCV antibody at Screening HCV RNA ≥ 10*5* IU/mL at Screening Less than 4 weeks total prior therapy with an IFN formulation (ie, IFNα, pegIFNα2a), or RBV and no exposure to IFN or RBV within 24 weeks of Randomization Results of a biopsy obtained ≤ 24 months prior to Randomization showing no evidence of cirrhosis Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kg/m², inclusive. BMI = weight (kg)/ [height (m)]² at Screening Liver transplant recipients Documented or suspected HCC by imaging or liver biopsy Evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HCV (such as but not limited to: hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, toxin exposures) History of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) as documented by HBV serologies (eg. HBsAgseropositive). Patients with resolved HBV infection may participate (eg. HBsAbseropositive) Current or known history of cancer (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior to enrollment</criteria>
