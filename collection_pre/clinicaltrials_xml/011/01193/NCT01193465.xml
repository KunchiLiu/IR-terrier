	<brief_title>Temperature and Humidity Among Different Anesthesia Work-station</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fresh gas flow(FGF) is dry and cold in old fashioned anesthesia machine, especially at high folw (above 1 L/min). To the contrary, it has been assumed that the heat and humidity of FGF may be preserved using low FGF (below 1 L/min) during anesthesia or new anesthesia work station. However, it has not been proved yet. We hypothesized that the heat and moisture of FGF may be different in various FGF rate during anesthesia. In addition, it may be different in accordance to anesthesia work station. Therefore, we planed prospective observational study that will demonstrate that the difference of heat and moisture of FGF in different anesthesia work station (Excel; 1st generation anesthesia machine of Datex-Ohmeda Corp., Avance; 2nd generation anesthesia work station of Datex-Ohmeda Corp., Cato; 2nd generation generation anesthesia work station of Drager, Primus; 3rd generation generation anesthesia work station of Drager) and different FGF (0.5, 1, 4 L/min)</detailed_description>
