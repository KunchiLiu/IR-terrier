Free of dry eye during lens wear using the Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire ShortForm (Nichols et al, Cornea, 2002). Reports a contact lens wearing time of at least 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, daily wear basis (not overnight wear). Reports only occasional use of contact lens rewetting drops or artificial tears. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. For nonlens wearers and contact lens wearers: Pregnant.
