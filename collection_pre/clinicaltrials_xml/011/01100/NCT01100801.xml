	<brief_summary>This is an open, non-randomized, multicenter Phase II study evaluating cisplatin plus TS-1 or oxaliplatin plus TS-1 as first-line therapy in predicted 'responder' to platinum and fluoropyrimidine. This study is planned in 3 centers in Singapore and Korea. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled into each treatment arms. Each centers will recruit 15-25 subjects predicted to be 'responder' to platinum and fluoropyrimidine. The study will consist of a prescreening period, a screening period and a treatment period. A fresh tumour biopsy sample will be obtained during the prescreening period for gene expression profiling. As this is a genomics guided trial, obtaining tissue biopsies is vital to the conduct of the trial. Patients will have the primary in situ (requirement for entry into trial), endoscopic biopsy performed prior to 1st cycle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Genomic-guided 'Standard-of-care' Chemotherapy for in Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer is the world's second leading cause of cancer death. For patients with unresectable disease or recurrent disease after surgery, the main therapeutic option is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can improve survival and quality of life in patients with advanced disease when compared with best supportive care alone. Despite a large number of randomized trials, there is no consensus as to the best agent or regimen. In general, combination chemotherapy regimens provide higher response rates than do single agent, however, this translates into only a modest improvement in outcome with a trade off in increased treatment toxicities. The key challenge in managing patients with advanced gastric cancer is to identify the appropriate drugs for patients who might benefit for palliative chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease with differing chemosensitivities to anti-cancer drugs. Current selection of standard therapy is often empirical. Gene expression profiling has been shown to have the capability to dissect this heterogeneity allowing for sub-classification and risk-stratification of cancers according to their biological features and clinical outcome. Utilising gene expression data coupled with in-vitro, in-vivo or clinical response data is a promising strategy that may enable clinicians to match the right drug to the right patient. The purpose of the study are: 1. Assess the feasibility of genomic-guided therapy 2. Evaluated treatment response of standard-of-care chemotherapy in an enriched patient groups defined as 'responder' based on genomic-guided therapy</detailed_description>
