	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if combining uracil ointment (1UO) with capecitabine (Xeloda) can prevent Hand-Foot Syndrome. The study will also see what effects 1UO and capecitabine may have in patients with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of 0.1% Uracil Ointment (1UO) Ointment for the Prevention of Hand-Foot Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capecitabine is used in the treatment of human breast cancer among other human cancers. Following absorption, capecitabine is converted enzymatically to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The administration of capecitabine or 5-FU can cause a cutaneous toxicity known as hand-foot syndrome (HFS) or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). HFS is progressive with dose and duration of exposure to 5-FU or capecitabine. HFS is characterized by progressive redness and cracking of hands and feet. Currently, there are no approved therapies for HFS.</detailed_description>
