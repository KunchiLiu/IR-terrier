	<brief_summary>Populations that report high fiber consumption demonstrate lower rates of obesity. Enhanced satiety may play a key role in this relationship. The colonic fermentation of fibers is theorized to influence satiety and food intake. Short chain fructooligosaccharide (scFOS) are rapidly fermentable fibers that can easily be added to foods to impact these parameters. The objective of this study was to evaluate the satiety response of scFOS and its ability to decrease food intake.</brief_summary>
