	<criteria>• Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent; Be at least 18 years old; Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the investigator; Have ocular health findings considered to be "normal" and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses; Has vision correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better at distance in each eye with contact lenses; Be experienced at wearing contact lenses. • Any preexisting ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses; Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health An active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect wearing of contact lenses; Use of any topical ocular medication during trial with the exception of saline drops ; Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participant's ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial; Previous corneal refractive surgery; Contraindications to contact lens wear; Participated or currently enrolled in another clinical trial that may have affected vision or ocular physiology within the previous 2 weeks; Be pregnant (formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participant's verbal report is sufficient); Worn soft contact lenses 2 calendar days or rigid gas permeable/ orthokeratology lenses 7 calendar days prior.</criteria>
