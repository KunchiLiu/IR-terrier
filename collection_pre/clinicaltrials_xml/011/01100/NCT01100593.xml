	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare catheter length and extravasation rates for Ultrasound (US)-guided peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter insertion in a subset of emergency department patients with difficult IV access. Physicians, Emergency RNs, and Emergency Technicians can be taught to use US guidance to start peripheral IV in the ED. The optimal length of catheter to use for this procedure is unknown. This study will provide data on the length of catheter required to minimize extravasation. There is no guideline on catheter length selection for US-guided peripheral vascular access. This study may decrease extravasation rates for US-guided peripheral vascular access by providing guidance on catheter length selection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare catheter length and extravasation rates for US guided peripheral IV insertion in a subset of emergency department patients with difficult IV access. Physicians, Emergency RNs, and Emergency Technicians can be taught to use US guidance to start peripheral IV in the ED. The optimal length of catheter to use for this procedure is unknown. This study will provide data on the length of catheter required to minimize extravasation. There is no guideline on catheter length selection for US-guided peripheral vascular access. This study may decrease extravasation rates for US-guided peripheral vascular access by providing guidance on catheter length selection. The study design is a randomized non-blinded clinical trial of extravasation rates of US guided peripheral vascular access related to intravenous catheter length and venous depth in the ED. Primary endpoint is duration of usable vascular access. Secondary endpoints are catheter length, venous depth, time of procedure, successful cannulation, reasons for failure, number of skin punctures, site of cannulation, sonographic technique, type of provider obtaining access and complications.</detailed_description>
