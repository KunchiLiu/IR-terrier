	<detailed_description>We sought to investigate the relative contribution of functional or anatomic parameters as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance tomography (cMRI, 1.5 Tesla), and clinical variables including increasing age and gender on high sensitivity cTnT (TnThs) levels in healthy individuals. Therefore we measured TnThs in serum samples of 120 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 70 years. All individuals underwent cMRI including stress testing using dobutamine or adenosine.TnThs concentrations were related to cMRI and clinical findings. Partial correlation, as well as linear and hierarchical regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors and their relative contribution for prediction of TnThs values.</detailed_description>
