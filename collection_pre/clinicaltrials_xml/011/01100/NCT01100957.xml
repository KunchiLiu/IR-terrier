	<brief_summary>The study is in two parts Part one of the study describes the use of the new single-use flexible video-scope for intubation of patients with predicted normal airways. Part two compares the performance of the single-use flexible video-scope with that of a conventional flexible video-scope for awake intubation of patients with predicted difficult airways. The hypothesis is that the new single-use flexible video-scope for intubation performs as well as the traditional scope.</brief_summary>
