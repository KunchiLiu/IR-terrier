	<brief_summary>Military personnel face intense physical and cognitive demands. Diminished iron status affects physiologic responses to these challenges. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies indicate a significant decrement in iron status in enlisted female military personnel immediately following basic combat training (BCT). Decrements in iron status are associated with diminished cognitive and physical performance, and may affect body composition. The primary objective of this randomized, placebo controlled study is to assess the utility of an iron-containing food product for maintaining iron status during BCT. This study will provide insight into the utility and efficacy of an iron-containing food product for the maintenance of iron status during military training. Furthermore, it will provide novel scientific data regarding the relationship between iron status and physical and cognitive performance in female Soldiers.</brief_summary>
