	<brief_summary>During sepsis and septic shock the immune response can be overwhelming leading to excessive tissue damage, organ failure and death. Ideally, the inflammatory response is modulated leading to both adequate protection to invading pathogens as well as limitation of an exuberant immune response. In the last years, experimental evidence has been accumulating that enteral administration of lipid-enriched nutrition attenuates inflammation and preserves organ integrity in several inflammatory models. The current study investigates the immune-modulating potential of enriched enteral nutrition in a human setting of experimental endotoxemia.</brief_summary>
