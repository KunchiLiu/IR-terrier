To that end, the latency to persistent sleep (LPS) will be used as a primary endpoint at the end of the treatment, measured by polysomnography. The secondary objectives and endpoints of this study are as follows: - To evaluate the efficiency of eszopiclone compared to zopiclone by means of the patient's clinical history, using as secondary endpoints: - Variables of the sleep diary of the Associação Fundo de Incentivo à Psicofarmacologia (see Appendix A), namely: - Latency time to the beginning of the sleep; - Frequency of night wake-ups; - Time awake during bedtime; - Early morning awakening; - Total time in bed; - Sleep efficiency; - Sleep variables measured by actigraph; - Insomnia Severity Index (see Appendix B);45 - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (see Appendix C);46 - To evaluate the safety of eszopiclone compared to zopiclone by means of adverse events in each study arm.</detailed_description>
