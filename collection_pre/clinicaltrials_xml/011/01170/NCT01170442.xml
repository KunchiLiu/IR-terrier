	<brief_summary>Vitamin D status has been negatively associated with the presence of type II DM and glycemic control. However, a cause-effect relationship between vitamin D deficiency and glycemic control has not been established. The investigators plan to conduct a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in Type II DM.</brief_summary>
