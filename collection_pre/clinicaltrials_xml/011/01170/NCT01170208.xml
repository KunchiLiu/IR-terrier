	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of the computer software program in providing insulin dosage recommendations. Participation in the study for 60 research subjects will last for 16-weeks and includes 3-4 clinic visits and a series of weekly telephone calls from the study team (minimum of 12 calls). Participants will be provided with weekly Study Log Sheets to record their daily blood glucose readings, insulin doses, grams of carbohydrate eaten at each meal (if they have type-1 diabetes) and any changes in their health (e.g., hypoglycemic episodes, illnesses). Participants will fax or drop off a copy of the Study Log Sheet. This information will be entered by the IDC study team into the computer software program. The IDC study team will review the information from the software and, based on the IDC's study team approval, any insulin dose changes will be communicated back to the patient by phone or fax.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Dosage Software Program for People With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hygieia, Inc. is developing a device intended for use by insulin-requiring patients with diabetes. It will be a pocket-sized, hand-held device, combining a glucose meter with software that analyzes blood glucose levels recorded in the device's memory, and periodically recommends modifications in insulin dosage. The already developed software algorithms are based on the way an endocrinologist evaluates and frequently adjusts insulin dosage in a patient with diabetes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>GROUP I Have been clinically diagnosed with type1 diabetes for at least 1year Have an HgbA1c of 7.4% or higher Treated with shortacting insulin analog (i.e. HumaLog® Lispro, NovoLog® Aspart, Apidra® Glulisine) before each meal and only one injection of longacting insulin analog Lantus® (Glargine), per day. Subjects must typically eat 3 meals per day. The total daily combined dose of the longacting and shortacting insulin analogs must be 25 units or more. Patient must have been using the same insulin regimen for the previous 3months Is currently using an insulin/carbohydrate ratio to decide how much shortacting insulin to take before meals and must be able to use the gram versus choice method of carbohydrate counting. GROUP II Have been clinically diagnosed with type2 diabetes for at least 1year Have an HgbA1c of 7.4% or higher Treated with shortacting insulin analog (i.e. HumaLog® Lispro, NovoLog® Aspart, Apidra® Glulisine) before each meal and only one injection of longacting insulin analog Lantus® (Glargine) per day and. Subjects must typically eat 3 meals per day. The total daily combined dose of the longacting and shortacting insulin analogs must be 25 units or more. Patient must have been using the same insulin regimen for the previous 3months May be using other diabetes agent(s) at a stable dose for the last 3months. GROUP III Have been clinically diagnosed with type2 diabetes for at least 1year Have an HgbA1c of 7.8% or higher Take twice daily biphasic Insulin (e.g. HumaLog® Mix 75/25, NovoLog® Mix 70/30) or premixed insulin (i.e. Humulin® 70/30, Novolin® 70/30, NPH/Regular insulin 70/30) with a total daily insulin dose of 25 units and have been using the same insulin regimen for the past 3months May be using other diabetes agent(s) at a stable dose for the last 3months. Have a history of greater than 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the past year, or have hypoglycemic unawareness when glucose levels are less than or equal to 50 mg/dl Have a significant physical, psychological, or cognitive impairment that would prohibit adherence to the protocol Have any severe cardiovascular disease including a history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] 3 or 4), unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke that occurred within the 6months preceding enrollment Have known active anemia with a hemotocrit less than 25% in women or 30% in men Have known history of renal disease (e.g., serum creatinine level &gt;2.0 mg/dl or eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min) Have active cancer or cancer in the past 2years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer Have history of significant liver disease including cirrhosis or elevated liver enzymes (e.g., AST and ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal values) Have a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 45 kg/m2; and/or Are pregnant, plan to become pregnant during the study period, or are breastfeeding.</criteria>
