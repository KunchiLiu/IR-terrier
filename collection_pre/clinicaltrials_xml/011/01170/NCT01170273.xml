	<brief_summary>Vitamin D insufficiency is a problem of growing concern, given its prevalence in older persons and the association of low vitamin D with multiple major health problems, including mobility and balance deterioration and falls, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Sedentary persons are particularly vulnerable for these health problems and generally not adherent to prescribed physical activity. This study will investigate if treatment with vitamin D will benefit physical performance in male veterans age 65 to 95.</brief_summary>
