	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy in terms of the pathological complete response rate (pCR) to preoperative administration of qw or q3w Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Trastuzumab (PCH)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Trastuzumab, Paclitaxel and Carboplatin on HER2+ Preoperative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently Herceptin has moved to Neoadjuvant treatment combined with chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and Carboplatin are two of the best partners with high pCR. The significant efficacy and good safety profile of Herceptin® combination with taxane as adjuvant treatment on EBC are accepted; 1 year of Herceptin as adjuvant treatment is one standard therapy. This study is one small Phase II trial to explore the efficacy and safety of QW and Q3W of PCH as Neoadjuvant treatment, we only plan 60 pts and the trend of the two curves is anticipated</detailed_description>
