	<brief_summary>The usual response to chemotherapy is decided through the image change by computed tomography (CT), which is taken at least 6-9 weeks. In order to predict the response to chemotherapy earlier, patients received FDG-PET scan at the first cycle of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was guided by the metabolic response by FDG-PET scan.</brief_summary>
