	<brief_summary>This study will draw from proven interventions to refine and pilot test a cue card driven computer-assisted intervention, along with HIV/STI testing, that will be tailored to each participant's demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and biological test results. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1. To refine a cue card driven computer-assisted risk reduction intervention that will be tailored to each participant's demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity), risk behaviors, and biological test results (HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and herpes). 2. To pilot test the tailored intervention's effects on sexual risk behaviors (e.g., frequency of unprotected sex, condom use), drug use during sex and injection risk behaviors (e.g., direct syringe sharing, indirect sharing practices) using a two-group randomized design that compares the tailored intervention with a delayed treatment control condition. 3. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the tailored intervention in a rural setting.</brief_summary>
