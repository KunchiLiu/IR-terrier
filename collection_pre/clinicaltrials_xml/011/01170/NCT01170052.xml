	<criteria>Age 18 years or older Mantle Cell Lymphoma according to REAL/WHO classification First or second relapse or alternatively progression during therapy. Previous use of Bendamustine is permitted, if the patient has reached at least partial remission and progression occured more than 6 months after therapy. Previous high dose chemotherapy with autoSCT is permitted, if the patient has reached at least partial remission and progression occured more than 12 months after therapy. Patients must not be eligible for high dose chemotherapy with autoSCT or alloSCT. Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin &gt; 9g/dl, platelet count &gt;100/nL, absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,5 /nL) WHO/ECOG Performance Status 02 Measurable disease (two perpendicular diameters by either physical or radiological examination) Life expectancy â‰¥ 3 weeks Written informed consent Prior treatment with any mTOR Inhibitor Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (e.g. severe congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, severe, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis, severe pulmonary disease, severe diabetes) Abnormal liver function: transaminases or total bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Abnormal renal function: serum creatinine &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal Previous malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or inducers of CYP3A4 Pregnant or breastfeeding women (negative pregnancy test not older than 7 days is required for women of fertile age). Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (i.e. failure rate &lt; 1% p.a. ) Major surgery within 4 weeks before study entry; minor procedures (e.g. Implantation i.v. port catheter, Lymphnode biopsy) within 1 week before study entry Previous therapy with any investigational agents within 28 days before study entry Concomitant immunotherapy (e.g. Rituximab) or Chemotherapy other than Bendamustine.
