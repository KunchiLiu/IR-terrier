	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of advanced features, that have been implemented in the PARADYM ICD Platform offering single chamber (VR - model 8250), dual Chamber (DR - 8550) and Cardiac Resynchronization System with defibrillation capabilities (PARADYM CRT System, model 8750) in a general ICD population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Status Monitoring in Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD) Patients by Physiological Diagnosis (PhD) Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will particularly focus on a new sensor-based diagnostic feature, called PhD-Clinical Status (PhD). A dedicated PhD screen shows the trends of patients' ventilation levels at rest (MVR) and under effort (MVE), and the corresponding level of activity, day-by-day, over a period of 6 months.</detailed_description>
