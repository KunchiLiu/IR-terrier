	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the mydriatic effect of intracameral lidocaine 1% is as effective as topical cyclopentolate 1% and phenylephrine 10% for achieving effective mydriasis during phacoemulsification surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lidocaine Usage for Pupil Dilatation (Mydriasis)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Former studied done on the effect of Intracameral lidocaine 1% compared to topical mydriatic agents for achieving effective mydriasis during phacoemulsification surgery have compared 2 different groups of patients, ie; One group received topical agents and the other received intracameral lidocaine. The resultant pupil size was recorded and evaluated in the 2 groups. Our purpose is to compare the effect of these agents on the same group of people. Patients recruited will be invited first for evaluation at least 1 week before the surgery. During this evaluation 1 dose (drop) of topical cyclopentolate 1% and Phenylephrine 10% will be instilled to the evaluated eye 3 times at 10 minutes intervals. After 1 hour from the last instillation pupil diameter will be recorded. In the second part of this study during the phacoemulsification surgery patients will be given intracamerally lidocaine 1% (0.2 ml) and the pupil size will be recorded after 90 seconds. the resultant values will be evaluated/compared.</detailed_description>
