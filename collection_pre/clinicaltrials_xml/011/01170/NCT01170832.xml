	<brief_summary>This proposal will test if, in patients with type 1 diabetes, wide blood glucose fluctuations lead to the injury to heart nerves , called cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), and to impaired heart contractile (pumping) function and heart failure. It will also evaluate the natural history of heart failure and enhanced cardiac risk in patients with type 1 diabetes in the current standard of diabetes care.</brief_summary>
