After an informed consent procedure for both parents and patients, patients will go through a clinical and cognitive evaluation. They will receive a protocol of 4 weeks (20 work days) of rTMS using the figure of 8 magstim coil at 100% threshold, 42 trains of 4 seconds each, intertrain interval of 30 sec to the LDPC, 1680 pulses per day. Then they will be reevaluated.</brief_summary>
