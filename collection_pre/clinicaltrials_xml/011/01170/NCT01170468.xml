	<brief_summary>Both vitamin D deficiency and type II DM/prediabetes are highly prevalent. Vitamin D status has been negatively associated with the presence of type II DM and glycemic control. A cause-effect relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the development of type II DM has not been established. The investigators plan to conduct a 2 year, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial on the effect of vitamin D3 supplement on the incidence of type II DM in high risk individuals.</brief_summary>
