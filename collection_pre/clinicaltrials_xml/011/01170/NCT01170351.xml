	<brief_summary>Untreated Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive disease. Mainstay of treatment are corticosteroids (CS). In addition to being ineffective a substantial minority of cases, corticosteroid side-effects hamper effective therapy in another subgroup. Alternative options for induction of remission are limited. There are reports of successful salvage therapy with Cyclosporine-A (CsA) in steroid refractory cases. In addition, open-labeled studies have shown efficacy of Cyclosporine-A in treatment-naive AIH patients. There are no studies comparing CsA and CS in a head to head trial. The investigators aim to assess the efficacy and tolerability of CsA directly to the CS for induction of remission in treatment-naive AIH patients.</brief_summary>
