	<brief_summary>This clinical investigation is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized trial. The primary objective concerns the safety and effectiveness of the AAIsafeR mode with the preventive algorithms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Atrial Arrhythmia in Patients Without Atrioventricular (AV) Conduction Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients are randomized to DDD mode, AAIsafeR mode, or AAIsafeR mode plus atrial arrhythmia preventive algorithms. The atrial arrhythmia (AA) burden serves as the primary measure of effectiveness.</detailed_description>
