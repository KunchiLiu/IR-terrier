Patient must not currently be and must agree not to become a participant in any other clinical trial until completion of his/her 2year followup. Angiographic Inclusion Criteria 1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native de novo coronary artery with a visually estimated diameter between ≥ 2.25 and ≤ 4.0 mm. 2. Target lesion(s) must measure ≤ 28 mm in length by visual estimation. 3. A maximum of two de novo lesions can be treated, ie, 1. One lesion in one vessel, OR 2. One lesion in each of two vessels, OR 3. Two lesions in one vessel General Exclusion Criteria 1. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year post index procedure 2. Patients with known renal insufficiency or failure (eg, serum creatinine level of &gt; 2.5 mg/dL, or patient is on dialysis) 3. Patient had an MI within 72 hours and creatine kinasemyocardial band isoenzyme (CKMB) has not returned to the normal range at the index procedure 4.

Patient meets contraindications of the IFU Angiographic Exclusion Criteria 1. Lesion located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to a diseased arterial or saphenous vein graft 2. Lesion located in left main coronary artery 3. Ostial lesion (within 3 mm of the aorta junction, or origin of the left anterior descending or left circumflex arteries) 4. Involves a bifurcation in which the side branch is ≥ 2 mm in diameter AND the ostium of the side branch is &gt; 50% stenosed by visual estimation 5. Total occluded lesions (TIMI=0) 6. Restenotic lesions 7. Thrombuscontaining vessel 8. Extreme angulation (≥ 90º) proximal to or within the lesion 9. Excessive tortuosity proximal to or within the lesion 10.
