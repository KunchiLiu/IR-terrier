	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether pomalidomide is safe and effective in reversing red blood cell (RBC)-transfusion-dependence in persons with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis. (Global Study) and to describe the frequency of anemia response to pomalidomide in Chinese participants with MPN-associated myelofibrosis and severe anemia not receiving REC-transfusions (China Extension Study only)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase-3 Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Pomalidomide in Persons With Myeloproliferative-Neoplasm-Associated Myelofibrosis and RBC-Transfusion-Dependence Myelofibrosis and RBC-Transfusion-Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study sites in China will also participate in a China-specific, single-arm, open label extension of the current study. Participants will have myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis and severe anemia and not be receiving red blood cell (RBC)-transfusions. Eligible participants will receive pomalidomide (0.5 mg/day) and will be evaluated on a schedule parallel to that of the global study.</detailed_description>
