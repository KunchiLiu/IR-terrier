	<brief_title>Parathyroidectomy vs Cinacalcet in the Treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Post Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT) with hypercalcemia is prevalent after transplant (affects up to 25% of patients) and negatively affects graft and patient outcome. The subtotal parathyroidectomy is the standard treatment, although currently has been replaced by the calcimimetic cinacalcet. Several studies guarantee that cinacalcet is effective in controlling hypercalcemia derived of persistent HPT after renal transplantation. However, maintenance treatment is need because hypercalcemia increases quickly after treatment is stopped. This fact makes increase a lot the cost of transplantation in these patients. The hypothesis of this study is that subtotal parathyroidectomy by minimally invasive surgery is superior to cinacalcet for treatment of persistent secondary HPT post renal transplant, with minimal morbidity and significantly reduces the cost of treatment after transplantation.</detailed_description>
