	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Homeopathy for Moderate Depression (Acute Phase)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Homeopathy is often sought by patients with depression. In classical homeopathy, the treatment consists of two main elements: the taking of the case history and the prescription of an individually selected homeopathic remedy. Homeopathic medicines are produced through sequential, agitated dilutions. A Q-Potency is prepared by grinding the raw material, followed by a process of consecutive 1:50.000 agitated dilutions. Previous data suggest that individualized homeopathic Q-potencies were non inferior to the antidepressant fluoxetine in a sample of patients with moderate to severe major depression. The question remains whether individualized homeopathic Q-potencies have a specific therapeutical effect in acute depression as this has not yet been investigated.</detailed_description>
