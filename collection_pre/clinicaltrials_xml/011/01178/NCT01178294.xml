	<criteria>Written informed consent from subject, trusted person or person who is legally authorized to sign on behalf of the participant (Legal Representative in U.S.), depending on local regulations Participants with acquired hemophilia with autoimmune inhibitory antibodies to human factor VIII with a clinical diagnosis established by the following criteria: a) Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), b) Prothrombin time (PT) ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) + 2 seconds and platelet count within normal range, c) Abnormal aPTT mixing study (patientnormal control 1:1) consistent with a factor VIII inhibitors reduced factor VIII activity level (below 10%) Has a serious bleeding episode, as documented by the investigator Be willing and able to follow all instructions and attend all study visits Participants taking antithrombotics (such as clopidogrel, heparin or heparin analogue) may be included provided three halflives of the agent have elapsed since the last dose of the agent Life expectancy, prior to onset of the hemorrhagic episode, of at least 90 days Participants of reproductive age must use acceptable methods of contraception and if female, undergo pregnancy testing as part of the screening process Hemodynamically unstable after blood transfusion, fluid resuscitation and pharmacologic or volume replacement pressor therapy. This hemodynamic instability is characterized by symptomatic hypotension resulting in vital organ dysfunction, such as cardiac ischemia, oliguria (urine volume &lt;0.5 mL/kg in the previous six hours), central nervous system hypoperfusion manifested by mental status change such as confusion (unless head injury or intracranial hemorrhage is present), pulmonary compromise, and/or acidosis (manifested by pH and lactate levels) Has an established reason for bleeding that is not correctable Bleeding episode assessed likely to resolve on its own if left untreated AntiOBI1 inhibitor that exceeds 20 Bethesda Units (BU) (prospectively or retrospectively) Subsequent bleeding episode at the site of the initial qualifying bleeding episode within two weeks following the final OBI1 dose for the initial qualifying bleeding episode, or subsequent bleeding episode at a different site than the initial qualifying bleeding episode within 1 week following the final OBI1 dose for the initial qualifying bleeding episode will not be considered "new" qualifying bleeding episodes Prior history of bleeding disorder other than acquired hemophilia. Known major sensitivity to therapeutic products of pig or hamster origin; examples include therapeutics of porcine origin (e.g. previously marketed porcine factor VIII, HyateC®) and recombinant therapeutics prepared from hamster cells (e.g. Humira®, Advate® and Enbrel®) Use of hemophilia medication: rFVIIa within 3 hours prior to OBI1 administration or aPCC treatment within 6 hours prior to OBI1 administration Participation in any other clinical study within 30 days of the first OBI1 treatment Anticipated need for treatment or device during the study that may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of OBI1, or whose safety or efficacy may be affected by OBI1 Is currently pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or father a child during the study Abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize the subject's safety or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objectives of the study Inability or unwillingness to comply with the study design, protocol requirements, or the followup procedures Participant of majority age under legal protection</criteria>
