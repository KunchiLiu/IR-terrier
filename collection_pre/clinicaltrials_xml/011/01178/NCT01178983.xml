	<brief_summary>In the recent decades, with technology development, computer workstation has become fundamental both at work and at home environments, and is now used routinely for many purposes. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are most often characterized by backaches, neck and upper extremities pain, discomfort and pain in joints, muscles and soft tissues. Since it has been found that many musculoskeletal disorders are connected, among others, to biomechanical and psychosocial factors relating to a person's work environment, the literature refers to them as Work Related MSD (WRMSD). Risk factors correlated with WRMSD include repetitive motions, awkward positions or static muscle loading over prolonged periods of time, use of high keystroke force, direct mechanical pressure, vibration and extreme temperatures. Computer operators found to be sitting statically for a long time in front of the computer and keyboard, with limited options of changing body position. Psychosocial factors have also been implicated in the workstation musculoskeletal disorders with computer operators. Workers with WRMSD may suffer from persistent pain, loss of function and work disability. Therefore, it may include changes in the employment and earnings for injured workers. The complex nature of these injuries suggests that workplace rehabilitation interventions are a crucial aspect of treatment management. The main objective of this study is to explore the use of biofeedback intervention, based on tele-rehabilitation principle, with computer operators suffer from WRMSD. Treatment efficacy will be tested by use of RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) method. Data analysis will be done by ANOVA Repeated Measures. Hypothesis: Biofeedback intervention, based on tele-rehabilitation principle, will be found effective with computer operators suffer from WRMSD.</brief_summary>
