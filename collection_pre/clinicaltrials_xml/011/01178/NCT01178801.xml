	<brief_summary>As a result of increasing adoption of health information systems in hospitals, more and more health records can be gathered and accumulated in the healthcare data repository. For this reason, the opportunity of analyzing and mining the healthcare data for quality improvement is increasing and becoming more and more important. The purpose of the project is to gather the clinical data relevant to liver cancer, and adopt the knowledge discovery and mining modules in information technology (IT) for analyzing and discovering the knowledge from the gathered clinical data. We can analyze the gathered clinical data for comparing the outcomes of different treatment strategies, finding out new diagnosis and staging criteria and factors, and other hidden knowledge included in the clinical data. Afterwards, the discovered results and the mining algorithms can be shared though the sharable knowledge mining platform provided by our project.</brief_summary>
