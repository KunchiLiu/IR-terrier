	<brief_title>An Extension Protocol for Subjects Who Were Previously Enrolled in Other ARQ 197 Protocols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label extension protocol for patients who have been treated in previous ARQ 197 studies that have reached their designated end-dates. Patients enrolled in this extension protocol will receive either ARQ 197 as monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s) at the same dose(s), and same schedule(s) in which they were originally enrolled. This extension study is designed to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ARQ 197 monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s) when given to patients who tolerated previous treatment well and may benefit from the continuing treatment. ARQ 197 will be administered twice daily, orally, with meals (regardless of the original protocol requirements).</detailed_description>
