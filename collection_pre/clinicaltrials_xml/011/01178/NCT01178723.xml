	<brief_title>The Effects of Breakfast Size on Hormonal Profile in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of obesity has rapidly increased during recent decades, while the prevalence of skipping breakfast has increased. Several studies have reported inverse relationships between the consumption of breakfast and BMI and weight gain. A study that examined the effect of breakfast size, found that an increased percentage of daily energy consumed at breakfast was associated with relatively lower weight gain. Preliminary results of clinical research (unpublished) show a connection between a large breakfast and weight loss and increased feeling of satiety throughout the day. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of breakfast size on blood glucose balance, and its correlation with hormonal profile (including appetite hormones), adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, weight and body composition and lipid profile in adults with type 2 diabetes. The study will use a randomized-controlled, non-blinded, prospective design, including 48 participants with type 2 diabetes, who are not insulin dependent. The research group will receive instructions to eat a large breakfast compared with the control group that will receive instructions to eat a small breakfast. The estimated duration of the study is about three months.</detailed_description>
