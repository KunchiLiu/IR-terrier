	<brief_summary>Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the major causes of sexually transmitted disease and also the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world.Treatment of C. trachomatis eye infection has involved for a long time. The efficacy of single dose azithromycin has already been demonstrated as effective in the treatment of both trachoma and adult inclusion conjunctivitis.However, in our clinical experience, some patients of chlamydial conjunctivitis may require augmented single dose azithromycin treatments before C. trachomatis is eradicated. In this way, we would like to known the efficacy of single dose and augmented single dose azithromycin in the treatment of chlamydial conjunctivitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Oral Azithromycin in the Treatment of Chlamydial Conjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical records of patients with clinically suspected chlamydial conjunctivitis between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 at one cornea specialist's (Y.C.H) out-patient clinic were retrospectively reviewed. At this clinic, patients of both sexes with acute, chronic or recurrent follicular conjunctivitis with the symptoms and signs of chlamydial conjunctivitis suspected were tested for Chlamydia direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests and arranged for next time out-patient clinic follow up 1-2 weeks later. The patients who attended the follow up visit with positive DFA results were treated with oral azithromycin. These patients received a single dose oral azithromycin (400mg~1000mg, according to their age and body weight) once a week for consecutive two weeks. Repeated DFA examinations were performed 4 to 6 weeks later. If the DFA examinations still showed positive results, augmented single dose oral azithromycin once a week for one week was given again till the DFA showed negative results. The occurrence and frequency of adverse events recorded in the medical charts were reviewed as well.</detailed_description>
