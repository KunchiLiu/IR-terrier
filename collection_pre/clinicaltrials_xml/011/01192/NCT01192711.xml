	<brief_summary>The Diabetes Interactive Diary (DID) is both a CHO (carbohydrates )/insulin bolus calculator, an information technology and a telemedicine system based on the communication between health care professional and patient by SMS messages. Aim of the study is to compare an insulin regimen of insulin glargine + prandial insulin glulisine associated with a telemedicine system to teach CHO counting (DID) with the same insulin regimen administered according to usual practice.</brief_summary>
