	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine what dose of GSK1120212 can be given safely in combination with at least one other drug that is already approved to treat cancer. This study will test the safety of up to 6 different GSK1120212 study treatment combinations (GSK1120212 plus either docetaxel, erlotinib, pemetrexed, pemetrexed + carboplatin, pemetrexed + cisplatin, or nab-paclitaxel). The doses identified in this study may be used in future trials to test whether the combination treatment is a safe and effective therapy for subjects with metastatic lung and/or pancreatic cancers.</brief_summary>
