	<brief_summary>Inflammatory proteins from eosinophil granulocytes in blood from patients with seasonal allergic hayfever have been shown to predict development of asthma at a six-year follow-up. This study is a 15-year follow-up of the same patients to verify earlier results and study disease development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eosinophil Markers and Development of Disease in Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of a single visit at which patients fill in a questionnaire on actual hayfever and asthma symptoms as well as current treatment. Blood samples and nasal lavages are drawn and analysed for eosinophils as well as eosinophil cationic protein and tryptase. Spirometry is performed. If patients use drugs which can interfere with results, ie. corticosteroids or beta-agonists, biochemistry and/or spirometry are omitted.</detailed_description>
