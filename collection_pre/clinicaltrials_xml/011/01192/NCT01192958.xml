	<brief_summary>At present influenza immunity can only be reliably confirmed by a blood test. This test is invasive for the patient. This study is intended to validate an oral fluid/saliva antibody test for the variant Swine Influenza H1N1. If such a test were available, this painless and non invasive test will improve direct clinical care to an individual as well as significantly help guide future public health management of the pandemic.</brief_summary>
