	<brief_summary>All women on tamoxifen receive the standard dose of 20mg QD, irrespective of the use of potential CYP2D6 inhibitors, and are not tested for CYP2D6 polymorphisms prior to start of tamoxifen treatment.However CYP2D6 polymorphisms and/or the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors as co-medication may influence the treatment outcome of tamoxifen. The investigators propose a prospective study in women taking tamoxifen at a dose of 20mg QD. In each woman, information will be collected on endoxifen levels, CYP2D6 status, adherence and use of co-medication. In women who are phenotypically poor metabolizers of tamoxifen, a dose increase to 40mg QD will be applied and the effect of this intervention on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics will be evaluated after 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PharmacoKINEtics of TAMoxifen and Its Metabolites in Breast Cancer Patients: the Influence of a Dose Increase in Phenotypic Poor Metabolizers of CYP2D6 (KINETAM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although already some information is available on the importance of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and/or the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors as co-medication that may influence the treatment outcome of tamoxifen, this information does currently not lead to a change in the management of this patient population. All women on tamoxifen receive the standard dose of 20mg QD, irrespective of the use of potential CYP2D6 inhibitors, and are not tested for CYP2D6 polymorphisms prior to start of tamoxifen treatment. In an attempt to at least resolve some of these issues we propose a prospective study in women taking tamoxifen at a dose of 20mg QD who are being followed at several large oncology clinics in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands (Nijmegen (CWZ &amp; Radboud), Den Bosch, Harderwijk and Arnhem). In each woman, information will be collected on endoxifen levels, CYP2D6 status, adherence and use of co-medication. In women who are phenotypically poor metabolizers of tamoxifen, a dose increase to 40mg QD will be applied and the effect of this intervention on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics will be evaluated after 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
