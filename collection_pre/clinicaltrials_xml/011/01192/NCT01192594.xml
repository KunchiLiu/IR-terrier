	<brief_summary>This nested design clinical outcome study of psychiatric case manager education on disease state, psychopharmacology of schizophrenia, relapse, motivational interviewing, and the process of psychological adjustment post-psychosis (Milestones of Adjustment Post-Psychosis Recovery Model-MAPP) will test the following hypotheses: 1. Medication non-adherence in patients with schizophrenia assigned to case managers who receive MAPP training will decrease from their pre-study rate and from the reported national average after one year enrollment compared to consumers not enrolled in the MAPP arm of the study. 2. Consumers in the MAPP intervention will have higher Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-Les-Q (53) scores than consumers not enrolled in the MAPP at quarterly measures. 3. Consumers enrolled in the MAPP intervention arm of the study will successfully complete the first two phases of the MAPP Recovery Model in one year. 4. Consumers in the MAPP intervention arm will have greater symptom reductions at quarterly data points compared to consumers not enrolled in the MAPP intervention arm.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>52 psychiatric case managers will receive manualized training in the disease state of schizophrenia, psychotropic medications, motivational interviewing, and relapse prevention. After randomization, 26 case managers will receive additional manualized training in the process of post-psychotic adjustment. Outcomes of 130 consumers (5 per case manager) related to medication adherence, relapse rates, symptom intensity, and quality of life will be evaluated at quarterly intervals over a two-year period. Outcomes of 130 consumers related to medication adherence, relapse rates, symptom intensity, quality of life, and progression through the phases of postpsychotic adjustment (MAPP-Milestones of Adjustment Post-Psychosis Recovery Model) will be evaluated at quarterly intervals via rating scales over a two-year period and the two groups compared.</detailed_description>
