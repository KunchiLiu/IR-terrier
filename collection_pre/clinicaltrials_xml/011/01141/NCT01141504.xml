	<brief_summary>Adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) serves as the sole energy source for muscle contraction. Therefore human performance of brief maximal exercise is limited, in part, by the availability of ATP to the contracting muscle. Because muscle ATP storage is small (enough to sustain maximal exercise for less than 1 second), factors that enhance either storage or resynthesis of ATP may have a positive impact on repeated muscle contractions. The current study will test the hypothesis that increasing ATP availability to muscle via oral supplementation will improve performance of repeated high intensity exercise as measured by a) work performed in each of the three 50 contraction fatigue tests, b) sum of total work performed, and c) percentage decrement in total work from the first to third third 50 contraction test.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date we have studied 10 subjects who have followed through with all 3 of the original interventions (Placebo, 250 mg PeakATP/d and 400 mg PeakATP/d). Currently we have received approval and are expanding the study with 5 additional subjects who will receive the Placebo, 400 mg PeakATP/d and the 400 mg PealATP/d plus proprietary blend interventions.</detailed_description>
