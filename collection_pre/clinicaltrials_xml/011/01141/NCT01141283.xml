	<brief_title>Safety of BTDS in Subjects With Osteoarthritic (OA) Pain of Hip or Knee: A 6-Month Open-label Extension Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic with over 25 years of international clinical experience indicating it to be safe and effective in a variety of therapeutic situations for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Transdermal systems may offer advantages over currently indicated oral products including ease and convenience of use, improved compliance, possible reduction in patient care, and prolonged and consistent delivery of drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with moderate to severe osteoarthritic (OA) pain who completed all visits of the doubleblind phase on study drug, or who discontinued study drug due to lack of therapeutic effect in the doubleblind phase, but still completed all visits of the doubleblind phase off study drug, are eligible to enroll in the extension phase. Excluded from the study are subjects who ingest &gt; 2500 mg/day acetaminophen as part of their current stable nonopioid analgesic regimen.
