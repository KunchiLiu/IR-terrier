	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of home-based measurement of walking capacity in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients, uing the Global Positioning System (GPS). This study should state if the GPS technique could be used in clinical routine in order to assess walking capacity in PAD patients. Patients will be assessed a first time (test 1) and six months later (test 2).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The measurement of walking capacity in PAD patients is an important step in the management of such patients. The gold standard method to assess this walking capacity is the measurement of the maximal walking distance on a treadmill. However, treadmill measurement are not readily accessible and the relationship with free-living walking capacity is, although not well known, weak. A novel approach was developed using a Global Positioning System in order to assess community-based walking capacity. This method showed interesting results, validating the technique, but was limited to one laboratory and to the place where the measurements were performed. The next step is therefore to assess the feasibility of home-based measurement of walking capacity using the GPS technique, through a multicenter study regrouping university hospitals, independent vascular specialists (angiologists) and private clinic(s).</detailed_description>
