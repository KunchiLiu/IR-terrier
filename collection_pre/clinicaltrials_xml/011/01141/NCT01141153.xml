	<brief_summary>Objective: The main objective is to evaluate the pattern of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 300 mg / day + clopidogrel 75 mg / day) compared to the use of the triple regimen (Acenocoumarol as control + acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg / day + Clopidogrel 75 mg / day) in patients with atrial fibrillation, low-moderate risk of stroke (CHADS ≤ 2) who are undergoing PCI-S. Design: Randomized, parallel, with two arms, blind evaluation by third parties. Patients: 304 patients undergoing PCI-S with atrial fibrillation, low-moderate risk of stroke (CHADS ≤ 2), which requires prevention of thrombosis</brief_summary>
