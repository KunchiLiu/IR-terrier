	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering health information about patients with non-small cell lung cancer who never smoked cigarettes may help doctors learn more about the disease. Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is studying internet-based clinical information and blood sample collection from patients with non-small cell lung cancer who never smoked cigarettes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet-Based Clinical Information and Blood Sample Collection From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Never Smoked Cigarettes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To assess the feasibility of an internet-based protocol to collect clinical information and biological specimens from 2,000 never smokers with non-small cell lung cancer. - To perform genome-wide association studies to identify alleles that predispose to lung cancer in patients that never smoked cigarettes. OUTLINE: Patients complete an internet-based questionnaire using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) survey to determine eligibility. The survey consists of a detailed smoking questionnaire and questions to collect information regarding diagnosis, sex, age, ethnicity, treatment history, and any history of previous malignancies. Blood samples are then collected from eligible patients for DNA and other laboratory analyses. Patients' pathology reports are also reviewed.</detailed_description>
