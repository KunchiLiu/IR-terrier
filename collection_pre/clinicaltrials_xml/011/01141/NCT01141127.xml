	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid (TXA) is administered intravenously to prevent bleeding associated with cardiac surgery and by pass in adult and children. The pharmacokinetic of this product is unknown in the pediatric population. Only a few studies report a clinical efficacy with different dosages. The purpose of this study is to determine the plasma level of TXA using two different administrations methods: continuous versus intermittent. The second objective is to determine whether fibrinolysis decreased. The population consists in children weighting 10 to 30 Kilos, undergoing cardiac surgery and at high risk of bleeding.</detailed_description>
