	<brief_summary>The aim of the current study is to compare the use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and endotracheal tube (ETT) in pediatric adenotonsillectomy. The primary objective is to assess the incidence of post-operative laryngospasm between the LMA and ETT. The investigators also sought to compare anesthetic, operative, and recovery times in the LMA and ETT groups. We hypothesized that the LMA would be a safe efficient alternative to the ETT.</brief_summary>
