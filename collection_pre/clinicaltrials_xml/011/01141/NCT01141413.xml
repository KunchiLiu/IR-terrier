	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe infliximab and abatacept dosing patterns (i.e., dosing amount and frequency) and costs among a population of managed care enrollees with RA. This study will also identify changes in infliximab and abatacept dosing over time and the implication these changes may have on the costs of medication administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation With Remicade® and Orencia®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two parts. The primary analysis is a longitudinal analysis, where patients' health care claims from a period during which the patient was continuously enrolled in the health plan will be used to evaluate the primary outcome (i.e., dose escalation). The second analysis will be cross-sectional, where patients' health care claims from a fixed period of time (i.e., 2008) will be used to examine health care cost. The final enrollment for the longitudinal portion of the study was 2,001 (1,306 infliximab and 695 abatacept patients). Final enrollment for the cross-sectional portion was 3,450 (2,646 infliximab and 806 abatacept patients). There may be some overlap in these numbers.</detailed_description>
