	<brief_summary>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that presents during childhood, and is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive behavior. It is proposed that classical homeopathic treatment can reduce the symptoms of ADHD without serious side effects. This is an open label pilot feasibility study (36 participants). Participants, age 6-16, will consult with a homeopathic practitioner who will select treatments based on classical homeopathy principles. All participants will be assessed on a 4-weekly basis for a total of 36 weeks. The purpose of the study is to assess feasibility of recruitment and patient retention, to obtain pilot data on which to base a sample size calculation for future study, and to identify major safety concerns. The study will use single homeopathic medicines approved for over-the-counter use in Canada. The primary outcome measure will be the validated Conners 3rd Edition - Parent.</brief_summary>
