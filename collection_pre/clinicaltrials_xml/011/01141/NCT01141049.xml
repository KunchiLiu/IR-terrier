	<brief_summary>Primary Hypotheses: 1. Gabapentin will significantly reduce the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as compared to placebo. The primary outcome measure of alcohol withdrawal will be the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) (Sullivan, Sykora, Schneiderman, Naranjo, &amp; Sellers, 1989) score. 2. Gabapentin will significantly reduce alcohol consumption and promote abstinence as compared to placebo. The primary outcome measure will be the number of the heavy drinking days (defined as any day where the number of standard drinks was at least 5 for men and at least 4 for women) per week as measured by the timeline follow-back method. Secondary Hypotheses: 1. Gabapentin will be superior to placebo in reducing alcohol use as measured by secondary outcomes such as amount of drinks per day, amount of drinks per drinking day, percent days abstinent and serial measurement of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) serum level.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gabapentin for Abstinence Initiation in Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In an 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled outpatient pilot trial the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of alcohol dependence will be studied in 60 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment under double-blind conditions with either 1) a fixed dosing schedule of gabapentin or 2) placebo. All participants will receive weekly supportive behavioral treatment that promotes abstinence from alcohol and other substances, encourages mutual-support meeting attendance, and facilitates compliance with study medication. The primary outcome measures will be: the treatment of alcohol withdrawal as measured by the CIWA-Ar and the reduction of heavy drinking days per week as measured by the timeline follow-back method. Participants will be alcohol-dependent men and nonpregnant women who report drinking a minimum of 5 standard drinks for men or 4 standard drinks for women at least 4 days per week over the past 28 days. The daily minimum drinking requirements are consistent with the commonly accepted definition of "binge drinking." A minimum requirement of having a heavy drinking episode 4 days a week would select for a population of individuals who are drinking excessively more days than not. A minimum threshold of weekly alcohol use is set to prevent a "floor effect" (i.e. participants with minimal alcohol use at baseline would be unable to demonstrate significant improvement.)</detailed_description>

A diagnosis of current major depressive disorder or any other current Axis I psychiatric disorder as defined by DSMIVTR, other than alcohol dependence, that in the investigator's judgment might require intervention with either pharmacological or nonpharmacological therapy over the course of the study.

Pregnancy, lactation, or failure to use adequate contraceptive methods in female patients who are currently engaging in sexual activity with men. Unstable medical conditions, such as poorly controlled diabetes or hypertension (&gt; 140/90 mm Hg), which might make participation hazardous. Subjects who have a current DSMIVTR diagnosis of other substance dependence, with the exception of nicotine and caffeine dependence. A diagnosis of substance abuse will not be exclusionary unless significant illicit substance use is present. Are legally mandated to participate in an alcohol use disorder treatment program.
