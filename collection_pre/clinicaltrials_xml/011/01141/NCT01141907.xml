	<brief_summary>Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million Americans with HF morbidity reaching epidemic proportions. Annual rates of new and recurrent HF events including hospitalization and mortality are higher among African Americans. In this study, the investigators are testing an interdisciplinary model for heart failure care, with focus on enhancing self management and use of telehealth, which has significant potential to improve self management and outcomes. The main purpose of this study is to learn how to help African Americans with heart failure care for themselves at home. We hope to find out if a team including a nurse and community health navigator using a computer telehealth device can help people with heart failure stay healthier. The team will help people with heart failure to manage their medication, monitor their symptoms and weigh themselves every day after they leave the hospital. The team will also help people with heart failure learn to solve problems that may keep them from following their treatment plan.</brief_summary>
