	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Angiocal® (PRS-050-PEG40) is safe and well tolerated when it is injected into the veins of patients with solid tumors. Other purposes of this study are to investigate how the body of the patients reacts to Angiocal®, how the blood level of Angiocal® develops after injection and how the tumor responds to the injection of Angiocal®.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Angiocal® in Patients With Solid Tumors, Investigating Safety, Tolerability, Blood Concentration of Study Drug</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation study with Angiocal® in patients with solid tumors using a group sequential adaptive treatment assignment. Patients will be allocated to different dose levels in small cohorts and will receive one single dose application on Day 1, followed by a repeated dosing period. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Angiocal® when administered intravenously to patients with solid tumors. The secondary objectives of the study are the characterization of the pharmacodynamic response, evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of Angiocal®, observation of tumor response.</detailed_description>
