	<brief_title>The Dallas Hereditary Spherocytosis Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a new or established diagnosis of HS seen at Children's Medical Center will be asked to enroll in the study. Previous and current medical records will be reviewed to systematically catalogue their history of HS, including diagnosis, complications, hospitalizations, medications and laboratory data. Health-related quality of life questionnaires will be given to the patients and their parents at enrollment and periodically during the follow-up. Those who agree will have up to three small samples of blood collected and frozen for future laboratory studies of complications associated with HS and/or splenectomy. We anticipate enrolling approximately 200 children and young adults with HS in this study and following them until adulthood (age 18-21 years).</detailed_description>
