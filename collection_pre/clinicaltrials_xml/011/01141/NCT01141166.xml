	<brief_title>Octabaix Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Method: Three hundred and twenty eight people born in 1924, after recruitment will be followed for a three year period. Subjects received two in-home visits from a trained nurse or physicians who assessed falls and nutritional risk factors using an algorithm. The intervention consisted of recommendations to the subject and their primary physician, and other providers, telephone calls, and exercise and nutritional plan. Control subjects received a general primary care assessment. Measurements: the primary outcome were rate of falls and rate of undernourished risk. Secondary outcomes included different geriatrics characteristics.The outcomes of this study will provide important new information to reduce the incidence of falls and the risk of undernutrition of this population by intervention. Significant differences are not expected according to social-demographics sex and other factors, but they are expected by other obtained factors and indices that could allow to detection of octogenarian people with great risk of deterioration in just a short time.</detailed_description>
