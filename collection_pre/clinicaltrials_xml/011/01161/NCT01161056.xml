	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the immune system works. By studying immune function in many people, we will be able to determine the range of normal variation. The second purpose is to enroll people who are willing to serve as comparisons in future research studies into the Genotype and Phenotype Research Registry (GAP Registry). Volunteers are asked to provide information on age, ethnicity and medical history. Volunteers are asked to provide a blood sample of up to 100cc and allow us to contact you about additional studies.</detailed_description>
