	<brief_summary>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive liver disorder of unknown cause. Current evidence suggests that genes, the genetic material we inherit from our parents, in combination with environmental factors, likely play an important role in the development of PSC. This study is being done to investigate whether genes make people more likely to develop PSC. Discovery of these genes will help us to better understand how PSC developes and subsequently, to apply new approaches for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</brief_summary>
