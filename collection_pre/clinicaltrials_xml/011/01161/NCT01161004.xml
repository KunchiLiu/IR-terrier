	<brief_summary>It has been demonstrated that antagonism of neuromuscular blockade (neostigmine 0.04 mg kg-1) affects depth of anaesthesia with an increase in bispectral index (mean maximal change of 7.1) and middle-latency auditory evoked potentials (mean maximal change of 9.7). Sugammadex has a quicker and more complete effect than neostigmine. This study aims to demonstrate if sugammadex administration increases bispectral and neurosense indices of the depth of anesthesia while patients still receive propofol-remifentanil iv anesthesia.</brief_summary>
