	<brief_title>Treatment of Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy With Tripterygium Wilfordii Plus Steroid vs Tacrolimus Plus Steroid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Over the past decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with tacrolimus plus steroid in patients with nephrotic syndrome including patients with membranous nephropathy. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a traditional herbal extraction, Tripterygium wilfordii, plus steroid in reducing the amount of protein in the urine in patients with membranous nephropathy. A hundred patients with biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy will be recruited. They will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and an examination for infection, cancers, and other conditions that can cause membranous nephropathy. The investigators plan to conduct an open-label study of the efficacy and safety of Tripterygium wilfordii in the treatment of membranous nephropathy. Half of them will be treated with oral Tripterygium wilfordii plus steroids for 6 months, followed by 6 months of maintenance, and the other half treated with tacrolimus plus steroid as positive contrast. Proteinuria, renal function will be monitored. Complete remission is defined as 24-hour urinary protein excretion to less than 0.4 mg/day and serum albumin&gt;35g/L. This study will explore the potential role of Tripterygium wilfordii in the treatment of membranous nephropathy, it's cost less .</detailed_description>
