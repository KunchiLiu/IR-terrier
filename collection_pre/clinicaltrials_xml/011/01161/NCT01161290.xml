	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS:The study purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured pursed-lips breathing (PLB) protocol taught via real-time interactive telecommunication with a home computer using the lnternet and Skype software in veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD. The primary hypothesis is veterans with COPD and dyspnea on exertion who receive a PLB educational intervention taught via weekly interactive telecommunication over a 4-week period will have greater reduction of exertional dyspnea compared to those who receive the PLB educational intervention with no weekly interactive sessions. RESEARCH PLAN: An experimental two- group design is used. All subjects receive a brief 5 - 10 minute one-on-one PLB educational session. Subjects are then randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group receives 4 weekly interactive group sessions with the health educator (principal investigator)via computer. A free software program known as Skype allows synchronous video and audio interaction. The comparison group receives only the brief PLB educational session with no weekly follow-up. RESULTS: At end of 4 weeks, the intervention group had significantly lower dyspnea intensity scores (group X time interaction F = 6.69, p = 0.02) and significantly higher social support scores (group x time interaction F = 4.34, p = 0.058). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Skype is a viable means for providing patient education. A structured PLB protocol provides significant differences in exertional dyspnea over time. A structured PLB protocol plus Skype showed significant reduction in patients' sense of dyspnea intensity and increased social support scores.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of COPD, expiratory airflow limitation evidenced by forced expiratory volume 1 second/forced vital capacity percent (FEV1/FVC %) less than 70 and FEV1 % predicted less than 80 with no reversibility by inhaled bronchodilator, and self report of shortness of breath when walking as assessed with the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) chronic dyspnea questionnaire. Exacerbation of symptoms (dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and/or increased sputum purulence) within the past four weeks, hospital admission within the past four weeks, change in bronchodilator therapy within the past two weeks, unable to walk, unstable angina, unstable cardiac dysrhythmia, unstable congestive heart failure, and/or unstable neurosis or psychiatric disturbance.</criteria>
