	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if regadenoson is as safe and effective as adenosine when used in the cardiac catheterization lab during measurement of coronary flow reserve and fractional flow reserve. The study hypothesis is the assessment of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) in the catheterization lab can be performed with equivalent accuracy when hyperemia is induced with IV Regadenoson compared with IV Adenosine without compromising patient safety.</brief_summary>
