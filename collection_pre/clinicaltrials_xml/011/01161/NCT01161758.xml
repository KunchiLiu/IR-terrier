	<brief_summary>Passive accessory cervical mobilization is widely used as a clinical approach to the management of musculoskeletal pain of spinal origin. The purpose of the study is to determine if passive cervical mobilization can improve motor function in situations where motor performance is not impaired by the presence of pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Effect of Cervical Mobilization on Motor Function and Pressure Pain Threshold in Pain Free Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical mobilization has been shown to elicit effects on pain perception, autonomic function and motor function in subjects who experience musculoskeletal pain. The improvement in motor function may be a direct effect of the treatment or secondary to a hypoalgesic effect. This study aims to demonstrate whether it is possible to alter motor function following joint mobilization, in situations where motor performance is not impaired by pain.</detailed_description>
