	<brief_summary>Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a progressive liver disorder of unknown cause. Current evidence suggests that genes, the genetic material we inherit from our parents, in combination with environmental factors, likely play an important role in the development of PBC. This study is being done to investigate whether genes make people more likely to develop PBC. Discovery of these proposed genes will help us better understand how PBC developes, and subsequently, to apply new approaches for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</brief_summary>
