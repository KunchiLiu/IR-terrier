	<brief_summary>In French primary schools, children participate in 3 compulsory hours of physical education (PE) each week unless they have a medical contra-indication. But, there is no scientific evidence (randomized trial) that a weekly physical activity splitting up of these 3 hours of PE brings or not the same effects, particularly to prevent overweight or obesity. Regul'aps is a cluster randomized controlled trial which wants to evaluate whether splitting up the 3 hours into 3 or 4 sessions (vs. 1-2 sessions) of PE per week has an effect on speed of a BMI increase and on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) over the school year. Study hypothesis: reduction of speed of increase of BMI and an increase of HRQoL</brief_summary>
