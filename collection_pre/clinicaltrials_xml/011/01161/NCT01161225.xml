	<brief_summary>Aims of this study are: 1. To determine the feasibility of implementing the intervention using a peer-assisted asthma day camp for adolescents with asthma. 2. To determine patterns of change in knowledge, attitudes toward asthma, self-efficacy, perception of barriers, and self-management behaviors, asthma control and quality of life over time among peer leaders. 3. To test the following hypothesis: - Adolescents participating in a peer-assisted asthma camp program will report improved knowledge, attitudes toward asthma, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors, decreased perception of barriers, and increased asthma control and quality of life at 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention compared with the adult-led camp group. 4. To examine the moderating effect of personal factors (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, illness status, family support) on intervention outcomes such as self-management behaviors, asthma control and quality of life in adolescents with asthma. 5. To examine the effect of the peer-assisted camp program on self-reported health care utilization including emergency department visits, days of hospitalization, outpatient visits by comparing between baseline and 9-months post-camp data and between the peer-led camp and the adult-camp programs.</brief_summary>
