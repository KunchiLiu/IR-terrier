	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is a useful clinical instrument for diagnosis and treatment of residual limb volume fluctuation in individuals who use prosthetic limbs. One hypothesis to be tested is that the instrument effectively measures short and long term volume fluctuations in individuals with trans-tibial amputation. Another hypothesis to be tested is that when subjects add a sock or insert to the prosthesis residual limb volume decreases, and when they remove the sock or insert residual limb volume increases.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>transtibial amputees who have a regular prosthetist and who wear the prosthesis at least five hours per day. Inability to ambulate continuously with a prosthesis (with or without the use of an assistive device such as a cane or walker) for 10 minutes indoors on a level walkway. 2. Inability to shift from horizontal to vertical posture in 30 seconds.</criteria>
