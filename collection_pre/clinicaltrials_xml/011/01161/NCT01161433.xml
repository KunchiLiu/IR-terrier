	<brief_summary>Spirometry is a recommended component of asthma diagnosis and treatment in the primary care setting, however, few primary care providers report routine use of spirometry in the provision of care for their asthma patients. Even when spirometry is used to aid in asthma severity classification, primary care providers have a high rate of failing to meet the quality goals for testing established by the American Thoracic Society. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtually delivered quality improvement (QI) program. The program is designed to train primary care providers and their medical staff in the use of spirometry to improve pediatric primary care management for children with asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Practical Model to Transform Childhood Asthma Care - Spirometry Training in the Primary Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cluster randomized trial with matched practice pairs. All practices receive a spirometer and standard vendor training. Those randomized to the intervention group receive a 7-month QI program, which includes: 1. Spirometry Fundamentalsâ„¢ CD-ROM; 2. Case-based, interactive webinars; and 3. an Internet-based spirometry quality feedback reporting system.</detailed_description>
