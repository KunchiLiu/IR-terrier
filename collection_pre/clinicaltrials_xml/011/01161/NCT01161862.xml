	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that our closed-loop glucose-control system can provide BG control in subjects with type 1 diabetes using the estimated BG signal from a CGM as the input signal to the controller.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integration of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Into a Bi-Hormonal Closed-Loop Artificial Pancreas for Automated Management Of Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three specific aims of this study are: Aim 1: To test the safety and efficacy of our control system in the bi-hormonal configuration in regulating BG in adults (18 years of age or older) and in children (12-17 years of age) with type 1 diabetes based on interstitial-fluid (ISF) glucose data from a CGM. Experiments will be 51 hours in length incorporating 6 meals and two (night) sleep periods. In order to evaluate the effect of exercise on BG control, the last 48 hours of the experiment will be divided into two 24 hour blocks, the second of which will contain a period of structured exercise near the beginning of the block. Aim 2: To test the safety and efficacy of our control system in the insulin-only configuration in regulating BG in adults (18 years of age or older) and in children (12-17 years of age) with type 1 diabetes based on interstitial-fluid (ISF) glucose data from a CGM. Experiments will be 51 hours in length incorporating 6 meals and two (night) sleep periods. In order to evaluate the effect of exercise on BG control, the last 48 hours of the experiment will be divided into two 24 hour blocks, the second of which will contain a period of structured exercise near the beginning of the block. Aim 3: To directly compare the performance of the bi-hormonal and insulin-only configurations of the controller in adults (18 years of age or older).</detailed_description>
