Subject has a diagnosis of acute tendonitis or bursitis of one shoulder with the onset of the current episode 5 days and ≤ 21 days preceding the screening visit. Diagnosis is indicated by a positive Hawkins Test and Neer Test, both resulting in pain with motion and the existence of shoulder impingement related to tendonitis or bursitis. Subject has a Current Pain Intensity rated prior to study entry ≥ 5 but ≤ 8 on a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) (11 point; range 0 to 10; anchors to be "none" and "severe"). Main Subject has a suspected tear in the rotator cuff, calcific tendonitis.

Subject has a positive Drop Arm Test indicative of a suspected tear; a positive O'Brien's Test suggestive of a glenoid labral tear; a positive Apprehension Test which would be indicative of glenohumeral instability. Subject had a previous episode of shoulder pain in the same area within two months. Subject received passive physical therapy treatments (e.g., deep heat or ultrasound) for the tendonitis/bursitis for the target shoulder within the past 24 hours; requires continued use of an immobilization device for treatment of the current episode of tendonitis or bursitis or use of iontophoresis. Subject has used oral pharmacologic treatment (NSAIDs or analgesic medications) less than 3 halflives before the baseline assessments; ibuprofen is permitted prior to baseline as long as it is not within 6 hours of the baseline assessment. Subject has used any form of opioid within 24 hours of study entry or use of opioids for 5 or more consecutive days within the 30 days preceding enrollment. Subject has received systemic corticosteroids in the 30 days preceding the screening visit. Subject recently initiated sleep medications, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants or antidepressants. Subject used TNF alpha blockers or Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs within the past 60 days. Subject has a history or physical assessment finding of clinically significant. GI ulcers or abnormal bleeding, anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, poorly controlled lung, stomach, heart, or other vital organ disease as determined by the study investigator/physician. Subject has a history or physical assessment finding that is not compatible with safe participation in the study. Subject has a pain or medical problem that in the investigator's opinion may interfere with pain measurement of the target joint. Subject has active skin lesions or disease at the intended site of application of the study medication. Subject has a history of allergy to etodolac, other NSAIDs, lidocaine or adhesives (e.g., adhesive tape). Subject has a history of prior failed treatment with topical NSAIDs.
