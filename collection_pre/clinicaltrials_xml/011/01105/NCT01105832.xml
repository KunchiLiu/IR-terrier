	<brief_summary>40 postmenopausal women, with a non-operated proximal humeral fracture, will be randomized to standard treatment (physiotherapy) or standard treatment + Forsteo (rhPTH 1-34) during 4 weeks. Follow-up will be at 7 weeks and 3 months including x-ray and DASH score (The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) measuring physical function, and pain on a visual analoge scale (VAS). Two doctors, blinded to the treatment, will judge the callus formation and healing on the x-rays and guess the treatment. The DASH score and the pain score will be compared between the treatment groups. The investigators hypotheses are that callus formation and healing will be more pronounced and that patients have less pain and better function in the rhPTH 1-34 group.</brief_summary>
