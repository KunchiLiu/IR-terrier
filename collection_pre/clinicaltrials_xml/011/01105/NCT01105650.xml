	<brief_summary>This is a single center phase II trial designed to optimize a clinical platform of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and T-cell suppression to promote the persistence, function, and expansion of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer and advanced metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Peritoneal and Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The donor NK cells are infused on day 0, after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine plus a cyclosporine A (CsA) based immunosuppressive therapy. Subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) is started the evening of the NK infusion and continued three times a week for 6 doses total. Up to 4 sequential immunosuppressive platforms will be tested (Arms 1 and 2 are currently closed) to identify a platform where patients have the potential for successful NK cell expansion (defined as an absolute circulating donor derived NK cell count of &gt; 100 cells/Î¼l 14 days after NK cell infusion). Once a clinical platform is determined, the platform will be expanded to a total of 18 patients. The primary goal of this extended phase is to obtain preliminary efficacy information. Follow-up for disease response is for 1 year from the NK cell infusion, with the possibility of re-treatment for patients who experience at least a clinical benefit who progress after 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has failed or progressed after at least 2 prior salvage chemotherapy regimens (directed at recurrent/metastatic disease). OR Diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer (female or male) that has progressed on or failed at least one salvage chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease and that meets the following disease specific related criteria: If estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive must have progressed on prior hormonal therapy and/or if HER2neu positive must have progressed on trastuzumab, lapatinib, or similar agent Women with a history of both cancers are eligible for this study provided that they currently meet eligibility for one of the diseases. Women who have had another malignancy and have been disease free for at least 3 year, or with a history of completely resected nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible. Measurable disease per disease specific Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 patients with bone as their only site of disease will not be eligible. If history of brain metastases must be stable for at least 3 months after treatment A brain computed tomography (CT) scan will only be required in subjects with known brain metastases at the time of enrollment or in subjects with clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastases.

Participants of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 14 days prior to registration to rule out pregnancy and agree to use adequate birth control during study treatment Active infection subjects must be afebrile, off antibiotics, and with no uninvestigated radiologic lesions (infiltrates or lesions with negative cultures or biopsies) are allowed</criteria>
