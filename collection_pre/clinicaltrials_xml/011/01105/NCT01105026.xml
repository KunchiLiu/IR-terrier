	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate by histology and MSCT scans during a 7-month period, the efficacy of a bioactive glass (Inion BioRestore™) placed in human extraction sockets in the maintenance of alveolar ridge.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Investigation to Evaluate the Healing of Tooth Extraction Sites Filled With BioRestore™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>14 subjects in need of implant therapy were enrolled in the study. A total of 32 teeth were extracted and the fresh sockets underwent to ridge preservation procedures using Inion BioRestore™. Two different time points (1 week and 3 months after RPP) MSCT scans for each patient were used as a basis for bone change analysis occurred in the localized grafted alveolar sites. Twenty-two biopsied, representative of intermediate (3-4 months, n=10) and late phase (6-7 months, n=12) of healing, were harvested and histologically analysed.</detailed_description>
