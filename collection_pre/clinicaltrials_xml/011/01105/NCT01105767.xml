	<brief_title>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSTI) Prevention in Military Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRSA SSTIs have become endemic in congregate community settings where there is frequent close person-to-person contact, such as athletic teams, correctional facilities, and military training facilities. These infections interfere with the mission of training soldiers as they impair soldiers' ability to participate in required activities and successfully complete a training program. Hygiene-based prevention programs (e.g., hand washing, environmental disinfection, and community-based education) appear to be effective in stemming outbreaks of MRSA SSTIs and need to by systematical evaluated. This cluster-randomized prospective study will evaluate the effect of hygiene-based intervention strategies on the incidence of overall SSTI and MRSA-associated SSTI among military trainees. The study population will be drawn from six training battalions, each consisting of an average of six companies. Each company is composed of four platoons consisting of approximately 50 trainees. Training battalions are the unit of randomization in this study and sub-clusters (platoons within companies) within each battalion will receive the same hygiene-based intervention assigned to that battalion at study start. During the proposed 20-month evaluation period, five cycles of platoons (approximately 14 weeks per cycle) will enter and exit training activities. In total, the study population will be comprised of approximately 36,000 trainees observed over a 20-month period. Each of the six battalions will receive an in-processing preventive medicine briefing augmented with MRSA prevention information based on U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. Additionally, trainees who seek medical care for a SSTI will receive standardized care at a SSTI clinic applying uniform practice guidance. Four of the battalions will also receive supplemental SSTI education for trainees and drill sergeants, including standardized guidance on SSTI surveillance (e.g., skin inspection) for drill sergeants; trainees will be instructed to take a 10 minute shower with soap every Sunday while in garrison; and will be issued a personal first aid kit. Two of these four battalions will be offered chlorhexidine antiseptic body wash to use during the Sunday shower. Endpoints of the evaluation (i.e., incident SSTIs among military trainees) will be captured through clinical record review at the completion of training.</detailed_description>
