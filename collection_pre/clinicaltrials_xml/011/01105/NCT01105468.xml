	<brief_summary>The volatile content of the exhaled breath gas of mamma carcinoma patients will be chemically analyzed by proton-transfer-reaction time of flight mass spectrometry. The goal of the study is to determine typical breath gas components that allow to distinguish patients with mamma carcinoma from women without carcinoma. Further, the investigators will test whether these breath gas markers can be used as tumor markers, which change in a typical manner during the progress of the disease. Finally the data will be investigated for the presence of marker components, that identify patients who will develop metastasis.</brief_summary>
