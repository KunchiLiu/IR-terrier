	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess short and long term outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with chemotherapy for pulmonary malignancies in patients who are not candidates for surgical resection. This study will evaluate the efficacy of RFA combined with chemotherapy for the treatment of lung tumors by assessing its impact on local tumor control, progression free survival, overall survival, dyspnea score and quality of life (QOL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Combined With Chemotherapy for Pulmonary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous image-guided RFA is a minimally invasive technique used to treat solid tumours. Because of its ability to produce large volumes of coagulation necrosis in a controlled fashion, this technique has gained acceptance as a viable therapeutic option for unresectable liver malignancies. Recently, RFA has been proposed as a viable option for the treatment of pulmonary malignancies. Experimental studies in animal tumor models have confirmed the effectiveness of RFA in the destruction of experimentally-induced pulmonary malignancies. Pilot clinical investigations have suggested that the treatment can achieve high proportions of tumor response. We designed a prospective clinical trial aimed at assessing feasibility, safety and effectiveness of RFA combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of lung malignancies.</detailed_description>
