	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of your participation in this study is to help answer the following research question(s) - Whether LY2484595 in combination with a statin drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin or rosuvastatin; currently used to treat abnormal fat or cholesterol in blood) improves the blood fat profile more than statins alone. - Whether LY2484595 alone improves blood fats profile compared to sugar pills. - Whether LY2484595 interferes with break down or functioning of statins. - Whether LY2484595 has any side effects that would not support testing it in future studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of LY2484595 in Patients With High LDL-C or Low HDL-C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be stratified according to baseline levels of serum triglycerides (&lt;150 or greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL, HDL-C (&lt;45 or greater than or equal to 45 mg/dL for men; &lt;50 or greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL for women), and region (United States or Europe). After a diet lead-in and prior therapy washout phase, subjects meeting all entry criteria will be randomized to one of 10 double-blind treatment groups for a 12 week treatment phase. After randomization, patients will self-administer the study drugs once a day with a low fat meal as their first meal of the day.</detailed_description>
