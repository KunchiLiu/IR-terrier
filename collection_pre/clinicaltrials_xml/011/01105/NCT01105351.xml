	<brief_summary>The common polymorphism in MTHFR gene (C677T) has a significant effect on (6S)-5-CH3-H4folate after folic acid supplementation. For example, post supplementation differences in (6S)-5-CH3-H4folate between CC and TT are above 30%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Folic Acid on Primary Folate Forms in Relation to MTHFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to test the effect of low doses of folic acid with or without B6 and B12 on folate forms in relation to polymorphisms in folate catabolising enzymes in elderly people. Our hypothesis is that differences in folate forms after folic acid supplementation might be due to polymorphisms in folate catabolising enzymes. Therefore, folic acid might be retained by people with certain genotypes.</detailed_description>
