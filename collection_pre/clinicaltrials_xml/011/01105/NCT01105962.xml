	<brief_summary>This is an observational research study whose purposes are to see: 1. if 40 Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy sessions at 1.5 atmospheres (HBOT 1.5) or more (60, or 80 HBOT's) help, worsen, or have no effect on subjects with chronic TBI/PCS (Traumatic Brain Injury/Post-Concussion Syndrome) and/or PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). 2. if improvements or worsening of symptoms can be recorded with computerized and written tests for memory and thinking, and with questionnaires about the subject's quality of life and health. 3. determine the long-term outcome of the treatment. 4. confirm, in large numbers of study participants at multiple sites nationwide, the strong positive results obtained in pilot studies</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Any 1865 yearold patient with mildmoderate TBI or PTSD. (If a military injury, subject may be active duty or a veteran. If active duty, participants will have to voluntarily contact NBIRR.) 2. Have demonstrated a &gt;20% decrement (compared to predeployment baseline) in ANAM composite score or specific subscore with regard to "simple reaction time" and/or "procedural reaction time". 3. Have a diagnosis of TBI, chronic TBI/PCS or TBI/PCS/PTSD or PTSD made by a military (military etiology of blast injury) or civilian specialist. 4. Negative pregnancy test in females. 5. Less than 90% on the Percent Back to Normal Rating Scale. (If patient is considered 100% normal before TBI, patient should be less than 90% normal for entry into the study). 1. Pulmonary disease that precludes HBOT (e.g., asthma unresponsive to medication, bullous emphysema). 2. Unstable medical conditions that are contraindicated in HBOT (e.g. severe congestive heart failure or heart failure requiring hospital emergency evaluation or admission in the previous year). 3. Severe confinement anxiety (claustrophobia; e.g., patients who require anesthesia conscious sedation for MRI or who cannot go in elevators). 4. Pregnancy. 5. Other preTBI neurological diagnoses.(seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Lyme, etc.) 6. Participation in another experimental trial with active intervention. 7. High probability of inability to complete the experimental protocol (e.g. terminal condition). 8. Past or current history of mental retardation unless diagnosed post TBI (baseline IQ â‰¤ 70). 9. Pre or postTBI history of systemic illness with impact on central nervous system. (Principal Investigator in consultation with study sponsor Medical Officer will make the ultimate decision). 10. Any preexisting chronic infection not related to battlefield injuries or government service.</criteria>
