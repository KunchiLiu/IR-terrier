	<brief_summary>Critically ill patients often need ventilatory support through a plastic tube connected to a ventilator. Those patients have a altered microbiological flora in the mouth, oropharynx as well as throughout the intestine. Bacteria that can cause illness are often found in the oropharynx in such patients and measures are taken in order to reduce the risk of secondary infections by those bacteria. In all intensive care patients oral care is provided by the nursing staff aiming at a reduction of the pathogenic species. This is done by a variety measures. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is an antisepticum with a capability to reduce bacterial counts in the mouth and oropharynx and has been shown to be of value also for intubated patients. It is used frequently throughout the world. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a costly rather frequent complication to intensive care and mechanical ventilation and is usually caused by aspiration of infected secretions from the oropharynx. CHX has in some studies been shown to reduce the frequency of VAP. The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299 has the ability to adhere to the mucosa throughout the gastro-intestinal tract including the mouth and in our pilot study we found that L plantarum had better ability to reduce colonisation with enteric bacteria in the oropharynx than CHX had. Figures not statistical significant so this present study is aiming to get a larger amount of data. The procedure was found to be safe Hypothesis: Lactobacillus plantarum is better than CHX for the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx in intubated mechanically ventilated patients and consequently has a better potential to reduce the frequency of VAP</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chlorhexidine vs Lactobacillus Plantarum for Oral Care in Intubated ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an expansion of a pilot study performed at the ICU Lund University Hospital, Sweden where 50 patients were included (ISRCTN00472141). Results have been published in Critical Care 2008, 12:R136 The protocol is the same and in this second phase we intend to include 100 patients and results will be summed up. Three centres are engaged. The results from the pilot study is encouraging and we are aiming at getting statistical significance in the differences in pathogenic findings in the cultures from oropharynx and also better a better basis for the calculation of the number of patients needed to get sufficient power to study difference in VAP frequency.</detailed_description>
