	<brief_title>Self-help Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CBT has previously been identified as an effective treatment for insomnia. However, there is a lack of trained CBT-therapists, and self-help is beginning to prove useful for many areas of psychological distress. Earlier studies of different kinds of self-help (e.g. computer based and bibliotherapeutic) suggest that many patients do indeed benefit from self-help treatments for insomnia, but there is a need for independent replications. Also, most previous studies have had very strict inclusion criteria, such that for instance only individuals with primary insomnia and no co-morbid problems have been included. A general question in self-help is whether patients need therapist support to benefit from treatment, or if a book is enough to alleviate symptoms.</detailed_description>
