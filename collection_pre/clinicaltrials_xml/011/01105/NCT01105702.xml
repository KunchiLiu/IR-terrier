	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving temozolomide, bevacizumab, lithium carbonate, and radiation therapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temodar (Temozolomide), Bevacizumab, Lithium and Radiation for High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of high grade glioma (HGG) with anti-angiogenic therapy results in clinical improvement and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). However, mant patients experience diffuse recurrence and treatment failure. This is a phase II trial testing the feasibility of adding lithium carbonate, previously shown to have anti-invasive properties in HGG, to bevacizumab and chemoradiation following surgical resection of HGG.</detailed_description>
