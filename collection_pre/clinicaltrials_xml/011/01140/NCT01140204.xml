	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study, double-blind within each dose level, with four ascending dose levels to test the tolerability and safety of iopromide-paclitaxel in patients with de novo lesions in coronary arteries. Thirty-two patients were included into the trial, which were divided into four treatment groups. A total of four concentration levels of paclitaxel-iopromide concentrations were investigated. In each treatment group, six patients received iopromide-paclitaxel and two patients placebo (iopromide without paclitaxel). In each patient, the doses were adjusted individually as needed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Non-stent-based immediate release formulations of paclitaxel have been shown to reduce in-stent restenosis in animal experiments and initial clinical trials. Paclitaxel dissolved in the angiographic contrast agent iopromide was well tolerated and inhibited neointimal proliferation in a dose-dependent manner after injection into porcine coronary arteries. Methods: As a first step in entering clinical development, a phase I trial was performed using 4 ascending paclitaxel dose/concentration levels: samples of up to 100 ml of the contrast agent containing 10, 50, 100 or 200 μM paclitaxel were randomly administered to 6 adult patients each assigned to bare metal stent implantation for single de novo coronary artery lesions, while 8 patients treated with plain contrast medium served as controls. Safety variables and tolerability as well as angiographic parameters were assessed.</detailed_description>
