	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - Evaluate the rate of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) recurrences one month after randomization according to different timings of initiation of dronedarone. Secondary Objective: - Evaluate the rate of AF recurrences two months after randomization. - Assess the safety of the change from amiodarone to dronedarone - Assess dronedarone safety - Explore dronedarone and its active metabolite plasma level (in a subset of countries) - Explore potential Pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between dronedarone and amiodarone (in a subset of countries)</brief_summary>
