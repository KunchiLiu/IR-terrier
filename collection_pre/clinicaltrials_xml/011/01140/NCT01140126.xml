	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine whether the antibody (UB-421), targeting the HIV-1 receptor on the CD4 molecule (domain 1) of T-lymphocytes and monocytes, is safe and well tolerated when administered to asymptomatic HIV-1 infected adults by intravenous infusion and to assess pharmacokinetic parameters of the antibody in blood and on cells. The neutralizing activity of UB-421 blocks HIV-1 from binding to its receptor on CD4-positive cells; thus, UB-421 functions as an immunotherapeutic intervention to prevent HIV-1 infection.</brief_summary>
