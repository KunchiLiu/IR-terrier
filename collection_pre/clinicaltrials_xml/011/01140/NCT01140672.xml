	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of PF-04634817 administered orally to healthy adult subjects. In additional, the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of PF-04634817 administered orally to healthy adult subjects will be evaluated. Finally, the effect of multiple doses of PF-04634817 on circulating monocytes will be explored.</brief_summary>
