	<brief_summary>Recent literature suggests that certain patients with squamous cell cancers of the head and neck region may benefit from photodynamic therapy whether or not they may have received prior therapy, e.g. radiation therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Photodynamic Therapy With HPPH for Treatment of Dysplasia, Carcinoma in Situ and T1 Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity and/or Oropharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to initiate a Phase 1 a clinical trial using HPPH and 665 nm light in patients with cancer of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx, including lesions of moderate to severe dysplasia, squamous carcinoma in situ and T1 squamous cells carcinoma. The study will employ a fixed HPPH dose of 4 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour, and 24 hours later light doses escalating from 100 J/cm2 to 125 and 140 J/cm2, respectively. The primary goal is the determination of the maximally tolerated PDT dose. Preliminary evidence for PDT efficacy wil also be obtained.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with moderate to severe dysplasia and/or squamous carcinomainsitu of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx. Patients with T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx. Patient may have primary and/or recurrent lesions to be treated. Diagnosis must confirmed by biopsy. Prior therapy of any type is allowed. Male or female patients at least 18 years old. Female patients must not be pregnant and must be practicing a medically acceptable form of birth control, be sterile or postmenopausal. Male patients should be using a medically acceptable form of birth control or be sterile. Patients must have an ECOG score of 02 (Appendix A 1 ). Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure. Patients with T2 or greater squamous cell carcinoma. True tongue base lesions (as determined by the treating physician). Patients with severe trismus that prevents adequate access to the lesion for treatment light delivery (as determined by the treating physician). Porphyria or hypersensitivity to porphyrin or porphyrinlike compounds. Patients with impaired hepatic (alkaline phosphatase (hepatic) or SGOT;:3 times the upper normal limits). Patients with minimal impairment of renal function (total serum bilirubin;: 2 mg/dl, serum creatinine;: 2 mg/dl) Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements. Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the patient an unsuitable candidate to receive study drug and or light treatment. Patients on concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy or less than 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study.</criteria>
