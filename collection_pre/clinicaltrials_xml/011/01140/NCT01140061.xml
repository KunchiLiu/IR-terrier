Part I and Part II in healthy participants will be initiated prior to Part III in psoriasis participants. The primary hypotheses of the study are: 1) that MK-0873 is safe and well tolerated in healthy participants and participants with psoriasis and 2) that the maximum plasma concentration of MK-0873 is &lt;20 nM in healthy participants and participants with psoriasis.</brief_summary>
