	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A specific type of mutation called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of CF in approximately 10% of subjects with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally delivered investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 3 extension trial that will evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren (PTC124) in adult and pediatric patients with nonsense mutation CF, as determined by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in pulmonary function, CF pulmonary exacerbations, health-related quality of life, antibiotic use for CF-related infections, CF-related disruptions to daily living, body weight, and CF pathophysiology.

	<brief_title>Extension Study of Ataluren (PTC124) in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3, open-label, safety and efficacy study will be performed at sites in North America, Europe, and Israel. The study will enroll up to approximately 208 patients with nonsense mutation CF who participated in a previous Phase 3 study of ataluren (PTC124) (PTC124-GD-009-CF, NCT00803205). Subjects will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for approximately 48 weeks (approximately 1 year). Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits every 8 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Completion of blinded study drug treatment in the previous Phase 3 study (PTC124GD009CF). Ability to provide written informed consent (parental/guardian consent if applicable)/assent (if &lt;18 years of age). In subjects who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during ataluren administration and the 4week follow up period. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions. Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the study drug (list provided at study sites). Current pregnancy or lactating, or pregnancy or lactating during the previous Phase 3 study. Ongoing participation in any other therapeutic clinical trial. Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, psychiatric condition, behavioral disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.</criteria>
