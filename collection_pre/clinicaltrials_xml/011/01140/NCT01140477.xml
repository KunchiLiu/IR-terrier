	<criteria>Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of agerelated cataract Subjects must require a lens power from 16 to 27 diopters Subjects must have predicted postoperative corneal astigmatism between 0.83D and 2.50D, as determined by the Toric Calculator Subjects with any anterior segment pathology for which extracapsular/ phacoemulsification cataract surgery would be contraindicated. Subjects with diagnoses of degenerative visual disorders. Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture. Subjects who have had previous corneal surgery in the planned operative eye. Subjects with irregular corneal astigmatism. Subjects with clinically significant retinal pigment or epithelium/macular changes. Subjects with chronic use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications. Subjects either concurrently participating in another clinical trial or have participated in another clinical trial within 60 days prior to enrollment in this study. Subjects with a difference in corneal astigmatism measured with the IOL Master and the topographer greater than 0.5 D using vector analysis.</criteria>
