	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab DP plus BSC as a double-blind, placebo-controlled (placebo plus BSC) comparison. Approximately 544 participants, at least 18 years of age, with Child-Pugh score &lt; 7 and diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomized. Participants must have received sorafenib as first-line systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and must have discontinued sorafenib prior to entering the study. Hypothesis: This sample size will allow differentiation of the expected increase in median overall survival (OS), from 8 months in the placebo arm to 10.67 months in the ramucirumab arm. Upon registration and completion of screening procedures, eligible participants with HCC who have disease progression during or following first-line therapy with sorafenib, or were intolerant to this agent, will be randomized to receive either ramucirumab DP or placebo. The treatment regimen will be continued until radiographic or symptomatic progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the participant, or investigator decision.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1 ChildPugh score of &lt;7 (ChildPugh Class A only) Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C or BCLC stage B not amenable to locoregional therapy or refractory to locoregional therapy Diagnosis of HCC (excluding fibrolamellar carcinoma) in the absence of histologic or cytologic confirmation There are either clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings consistent with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis Has a liver mass measuring at least 2 centimeters (cm) with characteristic vascularization seen on either triphasic computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium At least 1 measurable or evaluable lesion that is viable [that is (i.e.), is vascularized], and has not been previously treated with locoregional therapy. A lesion that has been previously treated will qualify as a measurable or evaluable lesion if there was demonstrable progression following locoregional therapy Previously treated with sorafenib and has discontinued sorafenib treatment at least 14 days prior to randomization. Participants may have experienced: Radiographically documented disease progression during sorafenib therapy or after discontinuation of sorafenib therapy, or Discontinuation of sorafenib due to an adverse drug reaction, despite dose reduction by 1 level and BSC The participant has received sorafenib as the only systemic therapeutic intervention. Any hepatic locoregional therapy that has been administered prior to sorafenib is allowed, but not following sorafenib. Radiation to metastatic sites [for example (e.g.), bone] following sorafenib therapy is permitted. Resolution of clinically significant toxicity of any anticancer therapy to Grade ≤1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events volume 4.0 (NCICTCAE v. 4.0). Adequate Organ Function defined as: Total bilirubin &lt;3.0 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) [51.3 micromole/liter (µmol/L)], aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum creatinine ≤1.2 × ULN or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;50 milliliters/minute (mL/min) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 10^3/microliter (μL) (1.0 × 10^9/liter (L)]), hemoglobin ≥9 grams/deciliter (g/dL) [5.58 millimoles/liter (mmol/L)], and platelets ≥75 × 10^3/µL (75 × 10^9/L) International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤5 seconds above ULN. Participants receiving prophylactic lowdose anticoagulant therapy are eligible provided that INR ≤1.5 and PTT ≤5 seconds above the ULN The participant's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis. If urine dipstick or routine analysis indicates ≥2+ proteinuria, then a 24hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate &lt;1000 milligrams (mg) of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study Exclusion criteria: Major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization, or central venous access device placement within 7 days prior to randomization Hepatic locoregional therapy within 28 days prior to randomization Radiation to any nonhepatic (e.g., bone) site within 14 days prior to randomization Sorafenib within 14 days prior to randomization Received any investigational therapy or nonapproved drug within 28 days prior to randomization Received any previous systemic therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors (including investigational agents) other than sorafenib for treatment of HCC Fibrolamellar carcinoma Received any transfusion, blood component preparation, erythropoietin, albumin preparation, or granulocyte colonystimulating factors (GCSF) within 14 days prior to randomization Therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin, lowmolecularweight heparin, or similar agents. Participants receiving prophylactic, lowdose anticoagulation therapy are eligible provided that the coagulation parameters defined in the inclusion criteria (INR ≤1.5 and PTT ≤5 seconds above the ULN) are met Receiving ongoing therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs, e.g., indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, celecoxib, etoricoxib, or similar agents) or other antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, dipyridamole, picotamide, indobufen, anagrelide, triflusal). Aspirin (ASA) at doses up to 100 milligrams/day (mg/day) is permitted Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia Any arterial thrombotic event, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack, within 6 months prior to randomization Uncontrolled arterial hypertension systolic ≥150 / diastolic ≥90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) despite standard medical management Grade 34 gastrointestinal bleeding or any variceal bleeding episode in the 3 months prior to randomization requiring transfusion, endoscopic or operative intervention (participants with any bleeding episode considered lifethreatening during the 3 months prior to randomization are excluded, regardless of transfusion or intervention status) Esophageal or gastric varices that require immediate intervention (e.g., banding, sclerotherapy) or represent a high bleeding risk. Participants with evidence of portal hypertension (including splenomegaly) or any prior history of variceal bleeding must have had endoscopic evaluation within the 3 months immediately prior to randomization. Participants with evidence of portal hypertension are eligible for study participation if endoscopic evaluation does not indicate esophageal or gastric varices that require immediate intervention or represent a high bleeding risk; however, these eligible participants must receive supportive therapy (e.g., beta blocker therapy) according to institutional standards and clinical guidelines during study participation Central nervous system (CNS) metastases or carcinomatous meningitis History of or current hepatic encephalopathy or current clinically meaningful ascites</criteria>
