	<brief_title>Sub-total Parathyroidectomy Reduces Vascular Calcification in Haemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in patients with end-stage renal disease have been shown to have an increased morbidity and mortality mainly due to cardiovascular disease. The precise mechanism of cardiovascular disease in PHPT is not well understood . The excess in cardiovascular mortality is significantly and independently related to serum calcium, the connection between the biochemical disturbances and the cardiovascular disorders in PHPT patients is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship. Indeed, the impact of surgical cure of hyperparathyroidism on cardiovascular risk factors and mortality is controversial. Some studies suggest that cardiovascular risk markers remained unaltered after Sub-total Parathyroidectomy.</detailed_description>
