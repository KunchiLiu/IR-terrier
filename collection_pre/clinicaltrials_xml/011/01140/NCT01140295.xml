	<detailed_description>Study subjects will be randomized in two groups: Group one will receive 1.5 g/kg of Miralax orally the day before procedure and one day of clear liquid diet, while subjects in Group 2 will receive two doses of senna the day before procedure with two days of liquid diet (one day full liquid and one day clear liquid diet). On the day of the procedure parents/subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding prep compliance and adverse events. Electrolytes will be obtained prior to colonoscopy to monitor for electrolyte imbalance. Endoscopists will assess preparation for colonoscopy using validated cleanliness scale (Aronchick scale).</detailed_description>
