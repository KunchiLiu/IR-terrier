	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that switching to a regimen based on efavirenz will be as effective and safe as remaining on a regimen based on Lopinavir/ritonavir for HIV-infected children. The investigators propose an unblinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate a simplification, protease-inhibitor (PI)-sparing treatment strategy among nevirapine (NVP)-exposed HIV-infected children treated initially with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). HIV-infected children aged 3-5 years, who have a history of exposure to NVP as part of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT), initiated LPV/r-based therapy in the first 36 months of life or who were enrolled on the control arm of Neverest 2 and who are virally suppressed with a viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml will be included. These children will be randomized to either substitute efavirenz (EFV) for LPV/r or to continue on their LPV/r-based regimen. Eight weeks prior to the primary randomization, eligible children will also be randomized to either remain on stavudine (D4T) or switch to abacavir (ABC). Children will be followed with regular viral load and other clinical tests for 48 weeks after the primary randomization. Children in the experimental arm who have breakthrough viremia (-defined as two subsequent viral loads &gt; 1000 copies/ml) on the EFV-based regimen will reinitiate the LPV/r regimen. The primary objective is to test whether the durability of viral suppression is equivalent when children are switched to EFV-based therapy. The primary study endpoint is failure to have HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml and/or confirmed viremia &gt;1000 copies/ml. Secondary aims include comparison of immune preservation, toxicities, selection of resistance mutations, and adherence across the two arms. Antiretroviral drug concentrations and adherence will be investigated as possible explanations for the success and/or failure of this simplification regimen. The overall goal of the study is to contribute to the evidence base to allow expansion of treatment options for HIV-infected children in low resource settings.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIVinfected child 3 to 5 years of age at time of screening for this trial if enrolled from outside or any age if enrolled from control arm of Neverest II. Reliable history or documented exposure to NVP used as part of PMTCT Initiated antiretroviral therapy with LPV/r at age less than 36 months Receiving LPV/rbased ART for at least 12 months At least one viral load measurement less than 50 copies/ml conducted as part of screening for the study ALT measurement grade I or less (DAIDS Toxicity Tables 2004) (Appendix A). These may be repeated until ALTs normalize if necessary. Exclusion criteria: Prior treatment with any NNRTI drug as part of a therapeutic regimen Substitution of other NRTI drugs (instead of 3TC and D4T which are the standard first line regimen) will be allowed.</criteria>
