	<brief_summary>Dendritic cells vaccinations are increasingly used in order to develop antitumoral immune response. This will be a Phase 2 trial using autologous dendritic cells pulsed with leukemic apoptotic corpse in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients in first or second Complete remission (CR).</brief_summary>
