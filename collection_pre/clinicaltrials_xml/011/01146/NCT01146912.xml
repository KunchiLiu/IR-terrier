	<brief_summary>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)recommends that the flu vaccine be administered annually to all children aged 6 months to 18 years as well as women who are pregnant during the influenza season. Nevertheless, targeting and mobilizing these populations has been difficult and influenza immunization rates nationwide remain low. Immunization reminder-recalls have been shown to be effective, but have had limited ability to rapidly identify and reach large target populations in a cost-effective manner. Evidence on how to optimally design these systems is not yet available and thus text message immunization alerts have not been widely implemented. The investigators propose to implement and evaluate tailored, targeted influenza text message reminders in urban pediatric and pregnant populations.</brief_summary>
