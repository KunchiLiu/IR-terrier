	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of a Herbal Medicinal Product (Dry Extract BNO 1016) in Patients With Acute Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this clinical study is to investigate the efficacy of a 15-days treatment with the herbal medicinal product BNO 1016 for therapy of acute rhinosinusitis in adult patients. Due to the considerable morbidity and the diminished quality of life experienced by people afflicted with acute rhinosinusitis an important aim of the treatment is to reduce the severity of rhinosinusitis symptoms and the duration of the disease. By grading the severity of the disease on the basis of the 5 main rhinosinusitis symptoms the investigator will assess the efficacy of the treatment.</detailed_description>
