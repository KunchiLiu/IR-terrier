	<brief_summary>Alcohol misuse amongst youth is a significant clinical and public health problem. The Emergency Department (ED) is an important setting for the treatment of alcohol-related problems as it is often the first point of contact between youth, their families, and the healthcare system. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a computer-based intervention in the ED for youth with alcohol-related presentations. The investigators research team will: (1) evaluate the methodological and operational processes involved in study recruitment and intervention implementation, (2) determine recruitment and retention rates, and (3) obtain preliminary data on the difference in alcohol consumption at different time points. The clinical and health service implications of this research will be used to plan further investigations designed to improve the standard of ED care among youth aged 12 to 16 with alcohol-related presentations. This research will also help optimize the planning and development of a full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial of a computer-based intervention designed to reduce higher-risk alcohol consumption and alcohol-related health and social problems in this target population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study Youth aged 12 to 17 years who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with an alcoholrelated problem. Medically stable Alcohol involvement will be determined by youth selfreport of drinking alcohol prior to event necessitating a visit to the ED and/or a positive Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). Study Youth who require hospital admission Youth whose ED presentation is linked to drugs aside from alcohol Youth who report other drug use within the last 24 hours prior to ED presentation Youth who do not speak or understand English Youth who are currently enrolled in a treatment program for alcohol use Youth who are accompanied by a nonguardianship adult but are not considered Mature Minors Youth who do not have the capacity to give informed consent as determined by their attending ED physician Youth do not have regular access to their own telephone</criteria>
