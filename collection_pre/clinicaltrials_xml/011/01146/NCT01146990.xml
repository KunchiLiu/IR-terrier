	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, noninterventional follow-up study designed to provide a developmental assessment of children born to mothers who participated in the 17P Efficacy Trial. When subjects reach an age of 23 months after adjustment for gestational age, they will be screened for developmental delay using the 24 month ASQ version 3. Subjects who score positive (fall below the specified cut-off) for developmental delay in 1 or more domains will be referred for the 24 month Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition, Bayley-III) and a neurological examination.</detailed_description>
