	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out whether regulation of brain blood flow is altered in patents with mild cognitive impairment (those who have memory problems but otherwise healthy) when compared with healthy elderly individuals. In addition, this study will determine whether exercise training improves brain blood flow, brain structure, and brain function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This is a research study because at present the investigators know little about brain blood flow regulation in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The investigators also know little about whether exercise training improves brain blood flow, brain structure, and brain function in patients with mild cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Training in Mild Cognitive Impairment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to study 70 patients with amnestic MCI and 30 healthy older adults with similar age, sex, and educational level in this research at the University of Texas Southwestern(UTSW) Medical Center Dallas and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas - Institute for Exercise an Environmental Medicine (IEEM). To help decide if you qualify to be in this study, the researchers may ask you questions about your health, including medications you take and any surgical procedures you have had. You may also have to fill out certain forms or have the following exams, tests or procedures. The screening process usually takes 2-3 hours. You will be required to come for 7-9 visits including the initial screening for eligibility to participate in this study. The experiments will measure your brain perfusion, vascular function and exercise capacity. For the healthy controls, the expected length of this study will be about 2-3 months including all the test visits. Your participation in this study will end following completion of your testing. For those with Mild Cognitive Impairment, the expected length of this study will be about 18 months including all the test visits and exercise training. Your participation in this study will end following completion of your repeat testing after one-year exercise training or control intervention. On occasion, training may be delayed due to injury, illness or personal matters. If this is the case, your enrollment in the study may last longer than one year as we attempt to complete the training and testing.</detailed_description>
