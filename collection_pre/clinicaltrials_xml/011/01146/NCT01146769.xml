	<brief_summary>The aim of study is to investigate the difference in Maximum Squeeze Pressure in patients with and without pelvic floor muscle training in low anterior resection in peri-operative period</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Improves Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength in Patient After Low Anterior Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The functional outcome after low anterior resection varies greatly. Proportion of patient suffers from urgency and incontinence. Pelvic muscle disuse with atrophy and fibrosis may be a cause for the poor function. Peri-operative pelvic floor muscle training may preserve pelvic floor muscle bulk and function and thus improve functional outcome after surgery.</detailed_description>
