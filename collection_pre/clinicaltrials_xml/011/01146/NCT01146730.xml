	<brief_summary>Mental disorders, mainly various anxiety and depressive disorders, are an increasing reason for sick leave and disability pension. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to have an effect on anxiety and depression, but the investigators know little about this in relation to employment. Close follow-up in ordinary employment increase employment participation for serious mental illness, but this is not yet investigated to the same degree for lighter mental disorders. Center for Work-Coping (No: "Senter for Jobbmestring" - SJM) combines Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and individual placement and support (IPS) and facilitation of work for people with anxiety and depression who are in danger of falling out of work. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in SJM. The effect will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which participants will be randomized to SJM or regular follow-up by The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) or by their regular general practitioners (GP) and self-help resources. The main outcome measures are work participation with changes in mental health as a secondary outcome.</brief_summary>
