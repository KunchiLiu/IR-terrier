	<brief_summary>The purpose of this follow-up study is to collect the outcome and safety of FTET cycles after the embryos are cryopreserved in P06029 (NCT01144416). P06029 was a study in which a single injection of corifollitropin alfa (SCH 900962) was compared with daily recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (recFSH) injections in women aged 35 to 42 years undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</brief_summary>
