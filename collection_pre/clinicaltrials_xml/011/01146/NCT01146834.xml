	<brief_summary>This phase III randomized trial compares three different peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for patients with multiple myeloma who have received primary induction therapy or other therapies. Up to 180 patients will be enrolled. Patients eligible for treatment will be randomized to one of the three following mobilization regimens: Arm A = VELCADE, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, G-CSF Arm B = VELCADE &amp; G-CSF Arm C = CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE &amp; G-CSF</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Three Stem Cell Mobilization Regimens for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES • To compare the efficacy of the following peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for MM: i. High dose cyclophosphamide, VELCADE, and G-CSF ii. VELCADE and G-CSF iii. High dose cyclophosphamide and G-CSF SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES • To evaluate biomarkers as surrogate markers of mobilization in each arm To evaluate changes in tumor mass as defined by standard response parameters. To evaluate the safety of each of the arms. This phase III randomized trial compares three different peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for patients with multiple myeloma who have received primary induction therapy Primary Endpoints a) Percentage of patients able to collect &gt;6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in &lt; 2 collections. Secondary Endpoints 1. Engrafting: Neutrophil recovery (ANC &gt;0.5 of &lt;12 days), Plt recovery (&gt;20K untransfused &lt;20 days)) after mel 200 based transplant. 2. Toxicities</detailed_description>
