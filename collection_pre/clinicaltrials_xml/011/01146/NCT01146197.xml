	<brief_summary>Gitelman syndrome is a rare renal disease where the kidneys are unable to normally retain some salts (sodium, potassium and magnesium). Main consequences of these renal leaks of salts are a tendency toward low blood pressure, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia both contributing to cardiac and muscles symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Input of the Use of Indometacin in Gitelman Syndrome as Compared to Potassium Sparing Diuretics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with received in random order 75mg/day indometacin (Chronoindocid®), 10-20 mg/day amiloride and 50-150 mg /day eplerenone (Inspra ®).
