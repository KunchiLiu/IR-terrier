	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - to assess the relative bioavailability of a single dose of insulin glargine (Lantus) and lixisenatide given subcutaneously as on-site mix versus separate and simultaneous injections of each drug Secondary Objectives: - to compare the activity of a single dose of insulin glargine and lixisenatide given subcutaneously as on-site mix versus separate and simultaneous injections of each drug - to assess the safety and tolerability of insulin glargine and lixisenatide given subcutaneously as on-site mix</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than one year with total insulin dose of &lt;1.2 U.kg/day, but otherwise healthy with glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) â‰¤ 9.0%, stable insulin regimen for at least 2 months prior to study, normal finding in medical history and physical examination. Exclusion criteria: any history or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic (apart from diabetes mellitus type I), hematological, neurological, psychiatric, systemic (affecting the body as a whole), ocular, gynecologic (if female), or infectious disease; any acute infectious disease or signs of acute illness More than one episode of severe hypoglycemia with seizure, coma or requiring assistance of another person during the past 6 months Frequent severe headaches and/or migraine, recurrent nausea and/or vomiting (more than twice a month) Symptomatic hypotension, or asymptomatic postural hypotension defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) equal to or greater than 20 mmHg within three minutes when changing from the supine to the standing position Presence or history of a drug allergy to clinically significant allergic disease Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by the clinical study protocol Pregnant or breast feeding women Any medication within 14 days before inclusion, or within 5 times the elimination halflife of that drug, whichever the longest and regular use of any medication other than insulins in the last month before study start with the exception of thyroid hormones, lipidlowering and antihypertensive drugs, and, if female, with the exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone replacement therapy, any vaccination within the last 28 days. Positive reaction to any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface (HBs Ag) antigen, antihepatitis B core antibodies (antiHBc Ab) if compound having possible immune activities, antihepatitis C virus (antiHCV2) antibodies, antihuman immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies (antiHIV1 and anti HIV2 Ab) History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and/or pancreatectomy The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
