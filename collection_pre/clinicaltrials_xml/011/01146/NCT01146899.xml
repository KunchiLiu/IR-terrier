	<brief_summary>Childhood influenza coverage rates are far below rates for the other childhood vaccinations. Increasing influenza vaccine coverage rates is important not only for the health of the child, but for that of the child's household and community. Yet,influenza vaccine delivery rates at pediatric clinics are low, even when the vaccine is available. The proposed project will take advantage of existing health information technology to tailor, implement and evaluate influenza vaccine alerts in the electronic health record (EHR) for pediatric providers to help improve health care decision making.</brief_summary>
