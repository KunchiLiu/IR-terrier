	<brief_summary>Endovascular therapy of Aortic Aneurysms depends on good imaging facilities. A relatively new kind of x-ray equipment makes it possible to create computer tomography (CT) - like slice images in the operating room. The purpose of this study is to verify the clinical usefulness of DynaCT in a preoperative setting. To do so we compare aortic measurements in DynaCT to the same measurements in ordinary CT-images which are regarded the gold standard.</brief_summary>
