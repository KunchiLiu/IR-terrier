	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to conduct a prospective, randomized non-inferiority study to compare clinical outcome between endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided gallbladder drainage and percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) in high risk acute cholecystitis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Trial for Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Gallbladder Drainage for Acute Cholecystitis in High Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary outcome is to compare clinical resolution rate of EUS-guided gallbladder drainage versus percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage in acute cholecystitis patients with high risk. The secondary outcome is to compare complications, conversion rate to open cholecystectomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
