	<brief_summary>Reverse total shoulder replacement surgery (RTSA) is performed for individuals with advanced arthritis of the shoulder who also have tears in their rotator cuff muscles. A metal hemisphere is placed in the shoulder blade, and a plastic cup on a stem is placed in the upper arm. This orientation is opposite to the normal anatomy, giving rise to the term "reverse" shoulder replacement. While RTSA has a good clinical track record, no studies have examined how well fixed the implanted components are within patients.</brief_summary>
