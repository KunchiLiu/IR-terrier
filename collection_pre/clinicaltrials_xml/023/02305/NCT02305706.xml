	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is technically challenging. Conventionally, colonoscopy begins with patients positioned in the left lateral position. However, few published studies have explored alternatives and there is consequently little evidence to support left lateral starting position over alternatives.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We aim to perform a randomised controlled trial of right versus left lateral starting position for colonoscopy. Primary outcome: time to caecum. Secondary outcomes: patient comfort; volume of sedation used.</detailed_description>
