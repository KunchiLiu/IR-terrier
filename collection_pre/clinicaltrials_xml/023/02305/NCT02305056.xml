	<brief_title>Study of Tumor Metabolism by Isotopic Tagging in Patients With High-grade Glioma (CARBONOMIC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project aims to study protein turnover in glioblastoma using mass spectrometry after 13C-valine incorporation. This will allow to identify proteins in circulation secreted by tumor which could be diagnostic and pronostic biomarkers in patients With High-grade Glioma.</detailed_description>
