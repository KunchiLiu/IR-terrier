	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of loratadine in decreasing the incidence and severity of bone pain following G-CSF administration in patients with hematologic malignancies, patients undergoing mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and patients who have undergone an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant. This is a different patient population than those being assessed in current clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Loratadine for G-CSF Induced Bone Pain in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The primary objective is to determine the incidence of bone pain following G-CSF administration in patients with hematologic malignancies, patients undergoing mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and patients who have undergone an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant. Incidence will be determined via patient-reported incidence following G-CSF administration. Secondary objectives include determining the efficacy of loratadine for bone pain prevention as indicated by a decrease in incidence and a decrease in severity (questions 4 and 5 of the survey).</detailed_description>
