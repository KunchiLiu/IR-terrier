	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of ASP015K in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Who Had an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate (MTX) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, confirmatory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K administered in combination with MTX in patients with RA who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects will orally receive ASP015K or placebo once daily (QD) in combination with MTX after breakfast for 52 weeks. At Week 12, inadequate responders in the placebo group, as determined by a &lt; 20% improvement from baseline (i.e., treatment initiation day) in tender or painful joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC), will be switched to ASP015K, and the dosage will be maintained until the end of treatment. In addition, subjects receiving placebo at Week 28 will be switched to ASP015K, and the dosage will be maintained until the end of treatment. The ASP015K dose that will be started for placebo group subjects at Week 12 or Week 28 will be randomly chosen at baseline. The dose will be switched under the blinded condition. Subjects who complete this study will be eligible for participation in the open-label extension study (015K-CL-RAJ2). Subjects will make a follow-up visit after the Week 52 visit if they do not enroll into the extension study on the day of the Week 52 visit</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject has RA of &lt; 10 years duration at baseline that was diagnosed according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria or the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria Subject who did not receive the following drugs, or received the drugs with stable dosage for at least 28 days prior to the baseline (start of treatment) for RA treatment: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; excluding topical formulations with a local action), oral morphine or equivalent opioid analgesics (≤ 30 mg/day), acetaminophen, or oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day in prednisolone equivalent) At screening subject has active RA as evidenced by both of the following: ≥ 6 tender/painful joints (using 68joint assessment) ≥ 6 swollen joints (using 66joint assessment) CRP (latex agglutination test) of ≥ 1.00 mg/dL at screening. Subject meets the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for the Classification of Global Functional Status in RA Class I, II or, III at screening Inadequate responders to MTX which was continuously administered for at least 90 days prior to screening and MTX ≥ 8 mg/week for at least 28 days prior to baseline. However, inadequate responder to MTX &lt; 8 mg/week is eligible if intolerance precludes dose increase and defined as MTXIR Subject is able to continue stable dose of MTX (a maximum of 16 mg/week) from at least 28 days prior to screening until the end of treatment Subject has bone erosion at the joint (as evidenced by xrays of hands and feet) assessed in mTSS and any of the following apply at screening. Bone erosion may be evidenced by xrays within 90 days prior to baseline. Positive antiCCP antibody: ≥ 4.5 U/mL Positive rheumatoid factor: &gt; 15 IU/mL Subject has received a biologic DMARD within the specified period Inadequate responder to at least 3 biologic DMARDs as determined by investigator/subinvestigator Subject has received intraarticular, intravenous, intramuscular or endorectal (excluding suppositories for anal diseases) corticosteroid within 28 days prior to baseline Subject has participated in any study of ASP015K and has received ASP015K or placebo Subject has received other investigational drugs within 90 days or within 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to baseline Subject has received plasma exchange therapy within 60 days prior to baseline Subject has undergone joint drainage, has received local anesthesia and nerve block, or has received articular cartilage protectant at the assessed joint within 28 days prior to baseline Subject has undergone surgery and has residual effects in the assessed joints at the discretion of investigator/subinvestigator, or is scheduled to undergo surgery that may affect the study evaluation of the assessed joints at the discretion of investigator/subinvestigator A diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis (psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, SLE, sarcoidosis, etc.) other than RA Any of the following laboratory values at screening: Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/μL Absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 800/μL Platelet count &lt; 75000/μL ALT ≥ 2 ×ULN AST ≥ 2 × ULN Total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 1.5 × ULN Estimated GFR ≤ 40 mL/min as measured by the MDRD method βDglucan ≥ 11 pg/mL Positive HBs antigen, HBc antibody, HBs antibody or HBVDNA quantitation (However, subject with negative HBs antigen and HBVDNA quantitation, and positive HBc antibody and/or HBs antibody is eligible if HBVDNA is monitored by HBVDNA quantitation at every scheduled visit after initiation of study drug administration.) Positive HCV antibody Subject has a history of or concurrent active tuberculosis (TB) Subject has a history of or concurrent interstitial pneumonia and investigator/subinvestigator judges that it is inappropriate for the subject to participate in this study Subject has a history of or concurrent malignant tumor (except for successfully treated basal cell carcinoma) Subject has received live or live attenuated virus vaccination within 56 days prior to baseline. (Inactivated vaccines including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are allowed.) Subject has a history of or concurrent demyelinating disorders Subject has any ongoing severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, infectious, or autoimmune disease except for RA (excluding Sjogren's syndrome and chronic thyroiditis), or any ongoing illness which would make the subject unsuitable for the study as determined by the investigator/subinvestigator Subject has a history of clinically significant allergy. (Clinically significant allergy includes allergies such as systemic urticaria induced by specific antigens and drugs, anaphylaxis, and allergy associated with shock necessitating hospitalized treatment.) Subject has concurrent cardiac failure, defined as NYHA classification Class III or higher, or a history of it Subject has concurrent prolonged QT syndrome or a history of it. Subject has prolonged QT interval (defined as QTc ≥ 500 msec. Subject has QTc ≥ 500 msec at retest will be excluded) at screening Subject has a history of positive HIV infection Subject has congenital short QT syndrome or a history of it. Subject has shortened QT interval (defined as QTc &lt; 330 msec. Subject has QTc &lt; 330 msec at retest will be excluded) at screening.</criteria>
