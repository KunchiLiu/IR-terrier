	<brief_summary>Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease involving the skin, the joints and the vascular compartment. The mechanisms linking inflammation in the skin and joints and in the vascular walls are poorly understood. One hypothesis for the increase in vascular inflammation observed in patients with psoriasis involves circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Patients with psoriasis have an increase in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-22, IL-6 as well as a the chemokine S100A913. It is possible that one of those cytokines/chemokine induces vascular inflammation in the vascular compartment. The purpose of this cross sectional retrospective study is to highlight the correlation between vascular wall inflammation using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose - Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) fluorodeoxyglucose technology and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline frozen serum samples will be identified from the 107 enrolled Inno-6025 (Abbvie A13-935) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01722214) patients who also underwent a pre-adalimumab FDG-PET scan for the study. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in these samples will be measured; IL-17 and IL-22 using the Singulex immunoassay platform, and S100A9, IL-6 and TNF alpha using multiplex ELISA. Vascular inflammation will be measured as the target to background ratio (TBR) in the ascending aorta using PET-scan technology. Correlation analyses will be performed between serum levels of cytokines and a chemokine and vascular inflammation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient has plaque psoriasis. 2. Patient has at least a 6 month history of plaque psoriasis. 3. Patient has a Body Surface Area (BSA) covered with psoriasis of 5% or more at Day 0. 4. Patient is a candidate for systemic therapy. 5. Patient is male or female, 18 to 80 years of age at time of consent. 6. Patient's weight at screening is a maximum of 180 kg. 7. Patient using medication to control angina, hypertension, serum lipids and any medication that can have an effect on inflammation must be on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before Day 0. 8. Patient has an ascending aorta atherosclerotic plaque inflammation targettobackground ratio of 1.6 or more as determined by 18FDG uptake measured by PET scanning. 9. Patient or patient's partner has been in a menopausal state for at least a year, is surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation or vasectomy), is clinically diagnosed infertile, has a samesex partner, is abstinent, or is willing to use effective contraceptive method for at least 30 days before Day 0 and at least 6 months after the last study drug administration. Effective contraceptive methods are: 1. Barrier methods such as condom, sponge or diaphragm combined with spermicide in foam, gel or cream; 2. Hormonal contraception (oral, intramuscular, implant or transdermal) which include DepoProvera, Evra and Nuvaring; 3. Intrauterine device (IUD); 10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening visit. 11. Patient is judged to be in good general health as determined by the principal investigator based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, physical examination, and Chest XRay (CXR) performed at Screening. 12. Patient will be evaluated for latent TB infection with a purified protein derivative (PPD) or a Quantiferon Gold test and CXR. Patient who demonstrates evidence of latent TB infection (either PPD more than or equal to 5 mm of induration or positive Quantiferon Gold, irrespective of Bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG) vaccination status and negative CXR findings for active TB, and/or suspicious CXR findings) will not be allowed to participate in the study. 13. Patient must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and comply with the requirements of this study protocol. 14. Patient must be able and willing to selfadminister subcutaneous (SC) injections or have a qualified person available to administer SC injections. 1. Patient has spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis. 2. Patient has other active infections (bacterial, fungal or viral) or skin diseases or skin infections (bacterial, fungal, or viral) that may interfere with evaluation of psoriasis or with patient's safety. 3. Patient has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to constituents of study drug, including latex (a component of the prefilled syringe). 4. Patient has used a nonbiological systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis less than 30 days before Day 0. 5. Patient has used an investigational chemical or biological agent less than 30 days or 5 halflives prior to the Day 0 visit (whichever is longer). 6. Patient has used a biological therapy for the treatment of psoriasis less than 90 days before day 0. 7. Patient has used a systemic immunosuppressor (eg. Azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine) less than 30 days before Day 0. 8. Patient is taking or requires oral or injectable corticosteroids during the study. Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed. 9. Patient has used a topical treatment for psoriasis or has used phototherapy within the last 2 weeks prior to Day 0 (at the exception of low potency topical corticosteroids for groin, genitals, face, inframammary area, palms and soles). 10. Patient has received Anakinra/Kineret within the last 2 weeks prior to the Day 0 visit or is likely to receive Anakinra/Kineret during the course of the study 11. Patient has a poorly controlled medical condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes, documented history of recurrent infections, unstable ischemic heart disease, class III or IV (New York Heart Association Functional Classification; NYHA) congestive heart failure, an ejection fraction of less than 30%, recent stroke (within the past 3 months), chronic leg ulcer or any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk if participating in the study. 12. Patient has had a myocardial infarction or has been hospitalized for a cardiac condition within the past 12 weeks. 13.
