	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to evaluate different regional anesthesia regimes for thoracoscopic surgery to evaluate their efficiency in (postoperative) pain control. Three regional anesthesia forms are evaluated: thoracic epidural anesthesia, (ultrasound-guided) serratus-anterior-plane-block an local infiltration with local anesthetic at the site of performing the thoracoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Anesthesia for Thoracoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective evaluation of different regional anesthesia regimes for thoracoscopic surgery to elucidate their efficiency in (postoperative) pain control. A day before surgery the patients gave their written informed consent to the study. Patients choose their favorite regional anesthesia out of the following: thoracic epidural anesthesia, (ultrasound-guided) serratus-anterior-plane-block an local infiltration with local anesthetic at the site of performing the thoracoscopy. In addition a general anesthesia was applied for the surgical procedure. Anesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil. The patients pain score (visual analog scale), consumption of analgesic medication, satisfaction with pain therapy will be obtained one, six, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. These prospective evaluation of different regional anesthetic techniques might provide us data to recommend a procedure for thoracoscopic surgery.</detailed_description>
