	<brief_summary>Previous research suggests that regular physical activity may make cancer survivors do better in the long run. Laboratory studies suggest that stress may be bad for cancer patients as well. The investigators are interested in whether yoga, a practice that combines physical activity and stress reduction, is beneficial to cancer survivors. To answer that question, the investigators will need to do a large scale clinical trial. Before the investigators can do that large study, they need to know whether people are willing to participate in this kind of study, whether they can do the yoga practice regularly and for how long, what kind of changes they may experience in how they can handle their daily activities, emotion, sleep, memory and problem solving ability, and what are the changes that can happen in their body after doing the yoga practice. Answering these questions is what this study is about.</brief_summary>
