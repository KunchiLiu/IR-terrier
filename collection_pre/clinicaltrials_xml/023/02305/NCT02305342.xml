	<brief_summary>This study is aiming to evaluate the sensitivity of uropathogens isolated in patients with community acquired UTI with Enoxacin in comparison to other antimicrobials. While Secondary objective is to study the spectrum of uropathogens responsible for community acquired UTI in local population</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mid stream , clean catch urine specimens of patients with uncomplicated community acquired UTI sent to microbiology labs by treating consultants from filter clinics for evaluation of pathogens will be utilized for sensitivity analysis. Only the first positive urine culture obtained per sample will be included in the analysis to eliminate any possibility of recurrence and nosocomial infection. The polymicrobial cultures and cultures with multidrug-resistant uropathogens will not be included in the analysis. Cultures with common contaminants, including coagulase-negative staphylococci and hemolytic streptococci, and cultures with Candida growth will be excluded. . Data points to be collected will be date of collection, computer generated Lab #, age, gender,list of cultured organisms, sensitivity of organisms with antibiotics.</detailed_description>
