	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is the prospective data collection of a new device used for trochanteric fractures of the femur. It should be answered how the newly developed implant called Trochanteric Fixation Nailing with anti-rotation feature (TFNA) is performing clinically and radiological in terms of intra- and postoperative complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Focused Registry on the Titanium Trochanter Fixation Nail Advanced (TFNAdvancedâ„¢)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In comparison to previous implants, the TFNA has been improved substantially. Therefore the purpose of this focused registry is to investigate how the newly developed implant called Trochanteric Fixation Nailing with anti-rotation feature (TFNA) is performing clinically and radiologically in terms of surgical technique, intra- and postoperative complications and short term outcome. All investigated procedures are part of the standard of care treatment. Only the parker mobility score is study-specific. All patients included are followed up from the time point of enrollment until three months after surgery.</detailed_description>
