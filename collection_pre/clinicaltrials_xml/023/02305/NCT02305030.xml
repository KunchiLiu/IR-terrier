	<detailed_description>Single-centre, open-label, fixed-sequence design consisting of 2 periods separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. In Period 1, a single dose of 25 mg warfarin was administered alone. In Period 2, subjects received 475 mg OPC, on Day 1 and D2 followed by 50 mg OPC once daily for 5 days (D3 to D7).
