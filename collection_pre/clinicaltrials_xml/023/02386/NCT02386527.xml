	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In the US, it is estimated that as many as 3 million adults may suffer from the disease. Fortunately in the last few years, a shift in strategy toward the earlier institution of disease modifying drugs and the availability of new classes of medications have greatly improved the outcomes that can be expected by most patients. The goal of treatment now aims toward achieving the lowest possible level of arthritis disease activity and even remission, if possible as early on as possible. Research has shown that this translates into minimized joint damage and enhanced physical function and quality of life for the RA patient. This also requires that a diagnosis of RA be made as early on as possible, and herein lies the challenge, i.e. identifying the RA patient early on in the course of their disease.</brief_summary>
