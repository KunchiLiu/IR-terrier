	<brief_summary>Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common lung. Despite the important progresses achieved in treatments, the majority of affected patients suffer from severe symptoms and tend to be frequently hospitalised due to exacerbation. Reasons for uncontrolled asthma and COPD are manifold, but often a poor inhalation technique and a poor following of the prescribed treatment plan is observed, which is called non-adherence. The primary aim of this study will therefore be to measure medication adherence in patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases, and to investigate the impact of an audio reminder on disease outcomes and quality of life. The investigators hypotheses will be that an adherence reminder, improve medication adherence and that a good medication adherence elongate the time to next exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases. A prospective single-blind randomized controlled study is planned, where the investigators are going to analyse the adherence over a period of six months of in- and outpatients, who have experienced at least one exacerbation during the last year. The adherence of intervention- and control group will be measured by specific electronic data capture devices which can save each actuation with date and time. Patients assigned to the intervention group will be reminded for the inhalation by an audio reminder and will receive support calls if medication will not be taken as prescribed or if rescue medication will be used too often. In contrast, the control group, will not be reminded and will not receive any calls, if do not comply with the prescribed medication schedule or if they use their rescue medication too frequently. During study period, participants will be assessed every two months. Each assessment will include spirometry, measurement of diffusion capacity, exhaled nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Moreover participants will demonstrate their inhalation techniques by using placebo devices and fill out questionnaires regarding quality of life. Statistical significance will be acquired if a p value of less than 0.05 is attained. Time to next exacerbation will be compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. Results will be reported as HR (hazard ratio) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value. "Time to next exacerbation" is subject to the investigators power calculation. A previous study has shown that 30% of COPD patients are readmitted again within six month because of an exacerbation. The investigators expect that 12% of patients in the intervention group will have an exacerbation. This corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.36. Assuming a sample size of 70 subjects for each study group, there is a power of 80% to detect a HR of 0.36 based on a one-tailed test. Additional 14 subjects (7 for each study group) have been added to account for drop outs. Therefore, 154 subjects will be investigated in this study.</brief_summary>
