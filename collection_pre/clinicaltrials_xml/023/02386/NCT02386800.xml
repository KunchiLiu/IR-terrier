	<brief_summary>This roll-over protocol allows patients who are still receiving clinical benefit to continue to be treated from multiple protocols in one program spanning multiple indications during the completion of the parent study/(ies). The population for the roll-over study should be consistent with the population defined in the program parent study/(ies). The primary eligibility criteria for a patient to enter the roll-over protocol is the participation and completion of a Novartis OGD&amp;GMA/Incyte study with ruxolitinib. Efficacy parameters would not be measured; however safety data will be collected. Patients who have completed a prior study with ruxolitinib and who are assessed by the Investigator to continue to benefit from ongoing treatment with the investigational ruxolitinib will be eligible.</brief_summary>
