	<brief_summary>ABSTARCT Background: Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Lately, it has shown to have anti-inflammatory and bone stimulatory effects. The aim of the current study is to explore the effectiveness of 1.2% atorvastatin (ATV) as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) in the treatment of mandibular degree II furcation defects. Method: A total of sixty subjects were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. 1. SRP plus placebo gel 2. SRP plus 1.2% ATV gel. Clinical parameters like probing depth (PD), relative vertical clinical attachment level (RVCAL) , relative horizontal clinical attachment level (RHCAL), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI) and site specific plaque index were recorded at baseline and then at 3, 6 and 9 months. The radiological assessment of bone defect fill was done at 6 and 9 months, using a computer-aided software.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>lower first molars demonstrating a probing pocket depth of 5 mm and horizontal probing depth of 3 mm following phase 1 therapy, with furcation defects (degree II) present bucally in asymptomatic, vital lower first molars, with a furcation radiolucency on a periapical radiograph of the molars. patients with systemic diseases like cardiovascular disease diabetes or HIV infection or on medications like corticosteroids which may impede the healing in periodontal tissues. pregnant/lactating females tobacco users alcoholics patients with unsatisfactory oral hygiene (plaque index greater than 1.5) teeth having gingival recession, caries involving pulp, intrabony defect present interproximally, grade 2/3 mobility Furthermore, patients allergic to ATV or other statins or those taking ATV/other statins systemically were excluded.</criteria>
