	<detailed_description>Genomic changes leading to the formation of brain tumors are slowly being discovered. Despite advances in genomic technology, much analysis is hindered by the lack of control samples that could better delineate genomic alterations leading to disease. The ideal genomic control would be the genetic material of the parents of afflicted individuals. The researchers propose to then compare the genomic material from parents of siblings, both of whom have a diagnosis of a high-grade glioma. Additionally, the researchers will then compare the genomic alterations between the parents and the patients. This analysis will provide an unprecedented insight into genomic level changes that take place between parents and patients that resulted in the formation of a high-grade glioma.</detailed_description>
