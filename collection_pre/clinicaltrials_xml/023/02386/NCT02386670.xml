	<brief_summary>This 5-year randomized controlled trial will compare the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation (trans-cranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS) combined with cognitive remediation (CR) versus sham ("placebo") tDCS combined with sham ("placebo") CR in slowing down cognitive decline and preventing Alzheimer's Dementia in older persons with mild cognitive impairment or major depressive disorder with or without mild cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease With CR Plus tDCS in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Depression (PACt-MD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By the time Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) are diagnosed the brain has sustained substantial insult that limits the efficacy of current treatments. Preventive interventions are urgently needed but prevention studies require large numbers of participants and long follow-up periods unless they can target a high-risk population. The investigators propose to study the efficacy of a preventive intervention for AD in three high risk groups: (1) older persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); (2) older persons with a major depressive disorder (MDD) without MCI; and (3) older persons with MDD and MCI. MCI is considered a prodromal condition for dementia with a progression rate of about 1% per month. MDD has independently been identified as one of the most promising targets for AD prevention studies since, even after successful treatment of their depressive episode, older persons with remitted MDD develop MCI or dementia at a rate of 1-2% per month. The investigators proposed intervention is a combination of cognitive remediation (CR) and non-invasive brain stimulation - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Participants with MCI or MDD (with or without MCI) will be randomized to tDCS + CR or sham ("palcebo") tDCS + sham ("placebo") CR. Both CR and tDCS have been shown to induce neuroplasticity and improve cognition. The investigators hypothesize that their combination will enhance cognitive reserve and protect against cognitive decline and the onset of MCI in those with "normal" cognition or AD in those with MCI. The investigators design is informed by their experience conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in older participants with dementia, MCI, or MDD over more than two decades. In the investigators recent donepezil prevention trial, combining donepezil with standard antidepressant maintenance prevented cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia in participants who had had both MDD and MCI. Building on this prevention trial, the investigators conceptualize the proposed study as a high-risk, high-gain RCT aimed at enhancing cognitive reserve and preventing cognitive decline and dementia in a high risk population. If the investigators are successful in this high risk population, then tDCS + CR can be tested in, and extended to, the general population (i.e., for universal prevention) or other groups at high risk for AD (i.e., for selective or indicated prevention). Over 30-36 months, five Toronto academic sites with a history of successful collaboration will enroll and randomize: (1) 125 participants age 60 and older with MCI; and (2) 250 participants age 65 and older who have been successfully treated for an episode of MDD (defined as a major depressive episode occurring for the first time in late life or that recurs in late life) with or without MCI. These 375 participants will be randomized under double-blind conditions to receive either tDCS + CR or sham tDCS + sham CR and followed for 24-60 months.</detailed_description>

The following psychotropic medications are allowed: i) any antidepressant; ii) zopiclone, trazadone, or a benzodiazepine if they have been taken at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry and; iii) gabapentin and pregabalin if they have been taken at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry AND if prescribed for chronic pain. A pacemaker or other metal implants that would preclude safe use of tDCS. MDD Group Inclusion: Age â‰¥ 65 (on day of randomization) Meets DSM 5 criteria for one or more MDE(s)with: 1. an offset of 2 months to 5 years from the screening visit date. It is not necessary for this (these) episode(s) to have received medical attention OR 2. an offset of 5 years or more from the screening visit date. It is necessary that at least one MDE received medical attention (e.g., previously been on one or more antidepressant(s), saw a psychiatrist, primary care physician, or had a previous hospitalization). Also, the MDE must have occurred during the participant's adult life (i.e., at 18 years of age or older).
