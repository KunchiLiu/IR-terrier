	<brief_summary>This study is to explore risk factors for poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in ENKTL, and establish a prognostic model for ENKTL patients treated with non-anthracycline based treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective cohort study using anonymized information from patients with ENKTL. The following criteria are required: (1) Patients diagnosed with ENKTL, nasal type between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2012; (2) Patients treated with non-anthracycline based therapy as an initial treatment. The pathology of initial diagnosis was reviewed by designated pathologists.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosed with ENKTL, nasal type Patients diagnosed between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2012 Patients treated with nonanthracyclinebased therapy as the initial treatment after diagnosis Nonanthracyclinebased therapy includes the following treatments: Radiotherapy including concurrent chemoradiation Chemotherapy not including anthracycline such as doxorubicin (e.g. SMILE, VIPD) The type of salvage treatment will not be a criterion for exclusion. Thus, patients who had received various kinds of salvage treatment including anthracyclinecontaining regimens can be included. Patients who had undergone autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation can also be included in the analysis if they satisfy the abovementioned inclusion criteria. Patients who had received anthracyclinebased therapy, such as CHOP or CHOPlike regimens, as the initial treatment. Patients who do not have pathology slides available for central review.</criteria>
