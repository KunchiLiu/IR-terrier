	<brief_title>Aloe Vera in Chronic Periodontitis With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Advances in the field of alternative medicine have promoted widespread use of herbal agents, like Aloe vera (AV), for both medical and dental therapy. AV has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, hypoglycaemic, healing promoting and immune boosting properties. The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of AV gel local drug delivery as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of subjects with chronic periodontitis (CP) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 subjects with probing depth (PD) ≥5mm and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥3mm were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 was treated with SRP + placebo gel local drug delivery (LDD) and Group 2 with SRP + AV gel LDD. Clinical parameters including full mouth plaque index (PI), modiﬁed sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded first at baseline and then at intervals of 3 months and 6 months.</detailed_description>
