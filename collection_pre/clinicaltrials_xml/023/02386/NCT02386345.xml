	<brief_summary>This is a registry to assess the safety and effectiveness of FIRM guided procedures for the treatment of symptomatic any type of atrial fibrillation. FIRM (Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation) guided ablation is defined as ablating rotors identified by the FIRMap® basket catheter for visualising of rotors with the RhythmView® mapping system. In addition to the FIRM guided ablation any other ablation method could be applied.The acute success of FIRM ablations is defined as elimination of rotors defined by absence of rotors. Data items will be collected, if available, consistent and applicable with routine and standard clinical care at each participating site.</brief_summary>
