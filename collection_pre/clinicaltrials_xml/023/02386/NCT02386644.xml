	<brief_summary>This study's aim is to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of transperineal ultrasound assessment compared with speculum examination, nitrazine and placental micro globulin-1 tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transperineal Ultrasonography and Premature Rupture of Membranes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with early and late preterm pregnancies with a complaint of fluid leakage are enrolled in the study. Prior to speculum examination, sagittal view of the birth canal and transverse view of cervix and fornices are obtained with transperineal technique and images are stored. Then speculum examination for pooling, nitrazine test and placental microglobulin-1 tests are performed and results are recorded. Ultrasound images are analysed by an observer blind to physical examination findings. Hypoechogenic fluid appearance of adequate size around the cervix and in the fornices are considered positive. Placental microglobulin-1 test is used as reference. Sensitivity and specificity values are calculated for each test.</detailed_description>
