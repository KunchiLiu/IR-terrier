	<detailed_description>Adolescents are often reluctant to receive psychological help. The investigators developed a web-based cognitive behavioral self-help intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The investigators aimed to examine the participation rate and outcomes on glycemic control and quality of life. Single center study was conducted to describe participation and efficacy of internet cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with type 1 diabetes. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes, aged 13-20 years, treated at a Juvenile Diabetes Center, were offered to participate in the intervention. Recruitment period lasted for 2 months, during January-February, 2011. HbA1c measures of adolescents that agreed to participate, were obtained from medical records.The adolescents, that logged in, were asked to complete questionnaires before the intervention assessing their expectations of the program, quality of life and parental support. After completion of questionnaires, the adolescents were encouraged to complete 6 virtual sessions. Satisfaction was assessed after each session. In the end of the program, participants were asked again to complete questionnaires. HbA1c levels were obtained again for participants that logged in, and for participants that passively refused, 3 months or more after the recruitment.</detailed_description>
