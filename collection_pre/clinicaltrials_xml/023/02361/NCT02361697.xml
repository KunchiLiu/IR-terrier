	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-randomised, non-blinded, single center study of children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome to detect differences or early changes in diffusion-weighted imaging (DTI) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DTI in Children With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In children and adolescents with either multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome an MRI with special DTI-sequences of the brain is performed at timepoint of first manifestation of disease and every 6 months at 3 Tesla MRI according to a specific investigation protocol. Besides MRI-DTI several clinical data are recorded every 6 months: 1. expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 2. disease activity/ relapse rate 3. lesion load (number of T2-lesions) 4. brain atrophy 5. visual and somatosensoric evoked potentials (VEP, SSEP) 6. neuropsychological examination Furthermore a complete neurological examination is done every 6 months and particular medication of each patient is recorded in a specific investigator form (case report form, CRF)</detailed_description>
