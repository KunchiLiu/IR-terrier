	<brief_summary>Psychologic status is associated with poor outcome after joint arthroplasty and perhaps chronic pain. To enhance the therapeutic effect of a psychologic intervention, the specific disorders or pain-related beliefs that contributed to chronic pain should be identified. We therefore determined whether specific psychologic disorders (depression, anxiety disorder) or health-related beliefs (self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing) are associated with chronic pain after joint arthroplasty for osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
