	<brief_summary>The importance of the detection of early inflammatory arthritis is recognised as being essential to the prevention of permanent joint damage. Furthermore, drug development in inflammatory arthritis is in increasing need of imaging that is able to sensitively and accurately detect and quantify inflammation in a reproducible and objective manner. There is an increasing body of evidence to support the role of PET-CT for these indications. The PET tracer 11CPBR28 is specific to the translocator protein (TSPO) highly expressed on activated macrophages. In this proof of principle study, the investigators aim to ascertain whether or not the PET tracer 11CPBR28 is taken up in inflamed joints. The investigators also aim to explore the significance of TSPO to inflammatory arthritis, through blood and joint lining samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PBR28 PET and Inflammatory Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to recruit a minimum of 12 patients with known, active rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis in the feet and ankles. Patients will first undergo a screening genotyping test; low affinity binders for PBR28 PET will be excluded from this pilot study. Those patients meeting inclusion criteria, will then undergo a PET-CT localised to feet and ankles that have been identified to be clinically inflamed (on examination and ultrasound at the screening visit). After PET-CT, patients will undergo synovial biopsy of one joint imaged. After 6 patients have undergone PET-CT, an interim analysis will be undertaken, to optimise PET scan duration and to alter the group of joints being imaged with CT.</detailed_description>
