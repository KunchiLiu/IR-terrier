	<brief_title>Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BGB-290 in Subjects With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Part IA: 1. Provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. 2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age. 3. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which no effective standard therapy is available. 5. BRCA1/2 mutations are not required but enrichment of this subject population is permitted. 6. Small cell lung cancer, high grade serous ovarian cancer, and triple negative breast cancer subjects will be preferentially recruited. 7. Glioblastoma multiforme subjects may be eligible, after discussion between the sponsor and investigator. 8. Archival tumor tissues are strongly recommended to be collected if available. 9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1. Phase IB/Part A: 1. Provided written informed consent prior to screening visit. 2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic ovarian, fallopian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, breast cancer, or CRPC and have progressed after receiving at least one prior chemotherapy regimen in the advanced or metastatic setting could be recruited L 4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1, except: 1. Subjects with ovarian cancer without measurable disease may be considered if evaluable based on GCIG CA125 criteria, after discussion with sponsor medical monitor. 2. Subjects with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) and with only nonmeasurable bone lesions must have either progression with 2 or more new lesions or have prostatespecific antigen (PSA) progression as specified by the PCWG2 criteria for study eligibility within the 6week period before study drug administration. 5. All subjects must agree to provide blood sample for germline BRCA and/or other mutation testing. 6. ECOG performance status of ≤1. 7. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Phase IB/Part B: 1. Provided written informed consent prior to screening visit. 2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which no effective standard therapy is available. 4. BRCA1/2 mutations are not required but enrichment of this subject population is preferable. Subjects with ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, breast cancer or CRPC must agree to provide blood sample for germline BRCA and/or other mutation testing even if it has been previously tested. 5. It is highly recommended that subjects provide archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy for biomarker analysis 6. Small cell lung cancer, highgrade serous ovarian cancer, and triple negative breast cancer subjects will be preferentially recruited. 7. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1. Subjects with ovarian cancer without measurable disease may be considered if evaluable based on GCIG CA 125 criteria, after discussion with sponsor medical monitor. 8. ECOG performance status of ≤1. 9. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 1. Subjects who have been treated with chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or other investigational agent within 5 t1/2 or within 4 weeks (whichever is longer) prior to starting study drug (or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy) 2. Subjects who have undergone major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 4 weeks of screening visit. subjects must have recovered from the treatment and have a stable clinical condition before entering this study 3. Subjects who have received radiotherapy of target lesions 4. Subjects who have received local radiotherapy of nontarget lesions for local symptom control within the last 4 weeks must have recovered from any adverse effects of radiotherapy before recording baseline symptoms 5. Lesions treated with locoregional therapies within the last 3 months before study inclusions do not qualify as target lesions unless progression was demonstrated</criteria>
