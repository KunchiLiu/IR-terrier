	<brief_summary>In a controlled, parallel, double-blind intervention study over 6 months, the investigators investigated the effects of kefir-fermented milk (1,600 mg/kg) supplemented with calcium bicarbonate (CaCO3, 1,500 mg/kg) and bone metabolism in 40 osteoporosis patients, and compared them with CaCO3 alone without kefir supplements. Bone turnover markers were measured in fasting blood samples collected before therapy and at 1, 3, and 6 months. BMD values at the spine, total hip, and hip femoral neck were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 months.</brief_summary>
