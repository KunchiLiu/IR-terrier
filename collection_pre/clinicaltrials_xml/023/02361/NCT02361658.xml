	<brief_summary>Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common and potentially life threatening condition arising from a variety of pathological conditions including traumatic brain injury (TBI), intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain tumors. Monitoring the ICP is the most important aspect of the management of these patients. Recently, transorbital ultrasonography has gained popularity as a noninvasive bedside exam that has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of raised ICP by evaluating the change in the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). Transorbital ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD appears to be a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive bedside examination for the diagnosis of raised ICP. The investigators aimed to determine the changes in ONSD with acute controlled changes in ICP in healthy volunteers. The controlled changes in ICP will be produced by manipulating the PCO2 with the use of Respiract and jugular venous compression with the use of custom made neck collar.</brief_summary>
