	<brief_summary>The high rates of childhood obesity in the US demand innovative and cost-effective weight gain prevention tools; mobile applications (apps) represent one such solution. Using a randomized design, the mFIT study tests the effectiveness of using commercially available apps and a physical activity (PA) monitoring device (Tech, n=50 parent-child dyads) compared to the apps and PA device plus a mobile website and theory-based family intervention that encourages increased parent-child communication about PA and healthy eating as well as family behavior change (Tech+, n=50 parent-child dyads).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives and Significance. Finding scalable and engaging ways to disseminate obesity treatment and prevention for children has been challenging. Mobile applications (apps) are an engaging way to involve children in health behavior changes, capitalizing on the portability and affordability of delivering health information via mobile devices and the opportunity to use gaming to make health information entertaining. Previous research by our team, including a systematic review of commercially available mobile apps for family weight loss, physical activity, and healthy eating as well as a pilot test of commercially available apps and physical activity monitoring devices with parent-child dyads, revealed significant gaps in the available mobile tools. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of using commercially available apps and a physical activity monitoring device (Tech) compared to the apps and physical activity device plus a mobile website and theory-based family intervention that encourages increased parent-child communication about physical activity and healthy eating and family behavior change (Tech+). The two programs will be administered remotely via email, mobile apps, and a mobile website to parent-child dyads (child 9-12 years old), using over a 3-month intervention period. Parent-child dyads will be randomized to the two behavioral interventions: Tech (50 dyads) or Tech+ (50 dyads). Our proposed research has two aims: Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of an evidence-based mobile intervention with enhanced parent/child communication (Tech+) versus commercially available products (physical activity and healthy eating apps, physical activity device) alone (Tech) for improvements in physical activity and healthy eating in parents and children. Aim 2: Examine the impacts of evidence-based family intervention on parent-child relationship quality and communication about physical activity and healthy eating.</detailed_description>
