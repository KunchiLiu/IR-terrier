	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess vitreous concentrations of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prostaglandin E2 in patients treated with NSAIDs before vitrectomy. A total of 0.5 to 1 mL undiluted vitreous was removed from the midvitreous cavity at the beginning of the surgery before infusion with balanced salt solution. Samples were immediately frozen and stored at -40Â°C until analysis. Samples were evaluated in a masked fashion. Vitreous concentrations of the study drugs were quantified using a reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy system. The minimum quantification limit for ketorolac, bromfenac, nepafenac, and amfenac was 0.8 ng/mL. Prostaglandin E2 concentrations were determined using a commercially available competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).</brief_summary>
