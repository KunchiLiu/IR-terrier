	<brief_summary>The concept of acquired immunodeficiency after a first severe infection in the ICU is widely described in the literature. There is a dual risk: increased mortality and increased secondary infections. Several approaches of immunostimulatory treatments have been proposed in the literature. The treatment proposed by this study consists of the administration of Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), colony stimulating factor widely used particularly in the USA where it is marketed. A phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in Germany in 2009. The main objective is to measure the incidence of ICU-acquired infections in 2 groups of patients treated by GM-CSF or placebo. ICU patients at risk are defined as surviving at D3 from a severe sepsis or septic shock and presenting a sepsis associated immunodepression. The detection of immunosuppressed patients will be achieved by measuring the HLA-DR (Human Leucocyte Antigen DR)with a threshold of less to 8000 sites. Our hypothesis is that the number of secondary infections (primary endpoint) will be significantly reduced in the treated group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ICU patients presenting a severe sepsis or a septic shock associated with a sepsisinduced immunosuppression. 1. Severe sepsis OR septic shock defined by the association of: at least 2 criteria of Systemic Inflammation Response Syndrome (SIRS) a clinically or microbiologically defined infection and respectively at least one organ failure (level ≥ 2 in one organ failure of the SOFA score) OR the need of a vasopressor treatment (epinephrine or norepinephrine ≥ 0,25mg/kg/min for at least 6 hrs to maintain a systolic pressure ≥ 90 mmHg or a mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg). 2. AND Sepsisinduced immunosuppression: reduced mHLADR levels (&lt; 8,000 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) per cell at D3). 1. Therapeutic limitation 2. Evolutive hemopathy, neutropenia &lt; 500/mm3, stemcell transplant 3. Solid tumor with ongoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy 4. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD 4 count &lt; 200 cell/mm3 5. Immunosuppressive treatment (including corticosteroid at immunosuppressive dose : &gt; 10 mg equivalent prednisolone and cumulative dose &gt; 700 mg) 6. Primary immunodeficiency . 7. Extra corporeal circulation within one month 8. Recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (within the current clinical episode) 9. Patients admitted in ICU for extensive burns 10. Contraindications to sargramostim 11. Pregnant or lactating women 12. Participation to another interventional study.</criteria>
