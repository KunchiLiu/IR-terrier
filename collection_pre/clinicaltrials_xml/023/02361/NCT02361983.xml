	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare the success rate of lung isolation and time to accomplish a correct placement of the device between anesthetists with experience in thoracic anesthesia (defined as at least 4 years clinical practice experience as attending anesthetists in thoracic) and residents in training in thoracic anesthesia. A prospective randomized trial was designed. To check the optimal DLT (Broncho-Cath Covidien, Ireland, Dublin, Teleflex Medical, Athlone, Irelanad) and/or BB (Uniblocker, Phycon, Fuji, Japan Arndt Cohen Cook, Australia), placement a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used. The lung collapse was assessed by surgeons. Time from laringoscopy to the correct placement of the device, confirmed with FOB, was checked. Data were analyzed with Student't Test and Chi-square test; p value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant.</detailed_description>
