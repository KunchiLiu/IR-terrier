	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to observe patients with Type 2 Diabetes on basal insulin alone or basal insulin with oral agents can be efficiently and safely started with meal time insulin using U100 rapid acting insulin analog and V-Go® Disposable Insulin Delivery Device (V-Go) using one of two dose titration algorithms to achieve improved A1C at 4 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Compare Various Dosing and Titration Guidelines of Insulin Delivered Via V-Go ® in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Initiating Basal Bolus Therapy in Primary Care Offices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study addresses the informational needs of Primary Care Physicians with regard to providing insulin dosing and titration information utilizing a V-Go disposable insulin delivery device. We look to compare two treatment arms of insulin dosing and titration in patients with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes - a fixed dose titration arm, and an arm where 50% of the insulin dose is given at the largest meal of the day. This study will provide practical information on glycemic control, dose requirements and safety in patients with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin with or without oral anti-diabetic agents who are being primarily managed in the primary care office.</detailed_description>
