	<brief_title>Paravertebral Catheters for VATS Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Level I randomized prospective outcomes study comparing two groups of patients. One group will receive Dilaudid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. The other will receive an ultrasound guided paravertebral block with indwelling paravertebral catheter with an infusion of 0.2% Ropivicaine post-operatively and a PCA. Sample Size: 50 patients Study Duration: Approximately 24 months Population:. Patients presenting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center for elective Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS), for thoracic, lung, or mediastinal lesions or masses. Primary Objective: To determine if post-operative paravertebral catheters in patients with elective VATS procedures result in decreased pain compared to patients treated with PCA for post-operative pain. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine whether the use of paravertebral catheters impacts the length of ICU and hospital stay for patients, compared to a PCA in patients undergoing elective Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). 2. To determine whether the use of paravertebral catheters leads to lower risk of complications, compared to use of a PCA in patients undergoing elective Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). 2. Synopsis and Medical Application: Specific Aims: Primary Hypothesis: Paravertebral catheters will result in improved pain control relative to PCA for post-operative pain from thoracic surgery. Secondary Hypothesis: Paravertebral catheters will result in fewer hospital days and improved subjective respiratory function compared to patients in the PCA group.</detailed_description>
