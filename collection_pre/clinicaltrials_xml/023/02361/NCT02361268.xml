	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of intra-dialysis yoga to an educational program among patients with end-stage renal disease. The investigators hypothesize that yoga as compared to the educational program will significantly improve quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>End-Stage Renal Disease Intra-dialysis Lifestyle Education Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a prospective, randomized clinical trial among on maintenance hemodialysis to compare the effects of intra-dialysis yoga to an educational program. In a sample of 68 patients the investigators will compare the clinical effects of a 12-week program of yoga to a 12-week education program during dialysis. Outcome assessment of study participants will occur at baseline, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 24 weeks for: disease-related quality of life (physical component primary outcome of the study), physical performance, blood pressure, fatigue, satisfaction with dialysis, sleep quality, and mood. Among a sub-sample of 20 participants, the investigators will measure the potential effects of the interventions on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and autonomic tone. The sub-study will collect outcomes at baseline and 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
