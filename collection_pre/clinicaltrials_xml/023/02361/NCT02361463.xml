	<brief_summary>Laparoscopy training programs with virtual reality simulators are widely used before new surgeons are allowed to operate on patients. Laparoscopic surgery results in shorter time to recover, less surgical trauma and thereby a shorter stay at the hospital compared with open surgery. However, it is more difficult to learn laparoscopic surgery, than open surgery, in part because surgeons have to work in a 3-dimensional space, through a 2-dimensional interface on a screen. This results in loss of depth perception and therefore a higher visual and cognitive load. This trial examines if using 3D vision instead of 2D vision on the laparoscopic virtual reality simulator reduces the time to reach proficiency, by decreasing the cognitive and visual load during practice on a Virtual Reality Simulator.</brief_summary>
