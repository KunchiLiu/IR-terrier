	<brief_title>e-Compared-S: Comparative Effectiveness Research on Internet-based Depression Treatment - Spanish Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a common mental disorder with a negative impact on mental well-being, quality of life, and social and work-related functioning both in the short and longer term. Additionally, depression is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, health care utilization and health care costs. On a population level, depression is one of the most costly diseases. The economic costs of depression were estimated at â‚¬136.3 billion (EU25) in 2010 in the EU and are still rising. European health care systems face the challenge of improving access to cost-effective treatments while simultaneously working to sustain budgetary stability in times of economic austerity. Internet-based depression treatment appears a very promising alternative to current routine depression treatment strategies. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness and potential cost-effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression in controlled research setting. Internet-based treatment thus has the potential to keep depression treatment affordable, as it enables mental health care providers to reach out to large populations needing depression treatment at a better cost-effectiveness than those of standard treatment as usual (TAU), but with similar levels of clinical efficacy and quality of care. The trials will be conducted in 8 European countries. In Spain the trial will be carried out in routine primary, comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CBT and TAU for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Respondents will be followed until 12 months after baseline (measures will be taken at BL, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months).</detailed_description>
