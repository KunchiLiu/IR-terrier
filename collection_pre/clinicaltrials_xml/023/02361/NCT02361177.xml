	<brief_title>Role of Oxytocin in Telling and Detecting Lies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this project is to further explore the role of oxytocin in moral judgment and ethical behavior. Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced in a variety of hypothalamic neurons. It is released into the brain or brought into general circulation through sensory stimuli in a pulsatile fashion. In social psychology research, oxytocin is hypothesized to coordinate both the causes and effects of positive social interactions in a biofeedback loop.</detailed_description>
