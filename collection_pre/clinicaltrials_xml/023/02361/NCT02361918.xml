	<brief_title>Predictive Value of Procalcitonin, CRP, Drain Fluid Culture, Il-6 and Tnf-α in Anastomotic Leakage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To search for a biomarker, which might be able to predict rectal anastomotic leakage before its clinical presentation. Serum procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and drain fluid culture, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were evaluated in 50 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection with colorectal anastomosis.</detailed_description>
