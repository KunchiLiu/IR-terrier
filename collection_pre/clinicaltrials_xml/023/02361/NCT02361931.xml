	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of a Novel Topical Formulation Containing Erythropoietin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to play a major role in wound healing. EPO is a safe molecule, and commercially available biomolecule which is the basis of an FDA approved drug for treating anemia. EPO has a known mechanism of action on chronic wounds that affects all phases of the wound healing process and has shown promising results in experimental animal wound models [Hamed et al., 2010, 2011]. In humans, topically applied EPO considerably enhanced wound healing and improved wound conditions of acute and chronic wounds [Bader et al., 2011]. Our study seeks to extend these findings, to investigate the efficacy of EPO for treatment of diabetic chronic wounds in humans. The investigative product, developed by Remedor, is a unique gel formulation that optimizes the administration of EPO to the wound bed. This novel formulation has been shown to stabilize EPO in the gel and to maintain its activity over long periods. The Remedor formulation used in the clinical trials will be prepared either by a compounding pharmacy which is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health, or by an Israeli GMP certified pharmaceutical plant.</detailed_description>

Subjects whose study ulcer size decreases by more than 30% during this initial standardofcare phase (pretreatment phase); 6. Have any signs of infection in the wound (which could be linked to raised body temperature), abscess, cellulitis, necrosis, erythema, mild drainage or known osteomyelitis; 7. Have a history of HIV or a clinically significant cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, liver, or kidney disease; 8. Anemia (Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL) or White Blood Cells count &gt; 11,000/μL or Platelets count &lt; 100,000/μL or liver function tests &gt; 3 times upper normal lab values or Creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dL; any indication of malnourishment (Albumin &lt; 3 g/dL); INR&gt;2 or any other clinically significant blood and urinalysis tests per the physician's discretion 9.

Patients on concomitant medications that alter blood glucose levels (e.g. ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering agents, etc.) who have not been on a stable dosage regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the study and who cannot maintain a stable dosage throughout the study; 11. Malignant disease except Basal Cell Carcinoma or Cervical Carcinoma in situ; Chemotherapy treatment or severely immunosuppressed for any reason that would limit or preclude healing in the opinion of the Investigator; 12. Females who are pregnant, lactating, of childbearing potential, or postmenopausal for less than 2 years, not using a medically approved method of contraception (i.e., oral, transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, diaphragm, condom, abstinence, or surgical sterility), or females who test positive on a bloodbased pregnancy test; 13.
