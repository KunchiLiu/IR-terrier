	<brief_summary>This Phase I, multiple ascending dose study will seek to enroll subjects with progressive B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with measurable disease (lesion &gt; 1.5 cm) (including SLL) OR relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL who have received standard treatment with at least one anti-CD20 antibody (e.g.; rituximab, ofatumumab)) containing front-line regimen that resulted in initial response, followed by relapse/recurrence and who are not eligible for any further approved biologic therapy, chemotherapy and/or autologous stem transplantation and/or refuse alternative approved therapies and/or are unlikely to achieve clinical benefit from any therapy of higher priority by Investigator assessment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PK, PD, Safety, Tolerability of Multiple Dose Regimens of MT-3724 for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's B-Cell Lymphoma and B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is intended to provide investigators and sponsor with the following information regarding the investigational new drug MT-3724 in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma (including SLL) OR relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL: 1. The maximum dose of a single course of MT-3724 given as intravenous (IV) infusions on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 at which there are negligible side effects and/or at which maximum serum levels and/or at which maximum effect on blood lymphocytes are observed. Four dose levels will be investigated. 2. The changes in MT-3724 serum levels and blood lymphocytes over time following IV doses at different points in the study. 3. The changes and kinds of clinical and laboratory effects and side effects that may occur over repeated courses of MT-3724 4. The changes in each subject's immune status and their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma following one or more cycles of 6 infusions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men or women, age 18 years or older Histologic diagnosis of BCell NHL. Histology based upon bone marrow biopsies and/or fine needle aspirates as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable. All patients must have measurable disease. Any tumor mass of at least 1.5 cm is acceptable. Presence of lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly with histopathological evaluation of a lymph node biopsy consistent with CLL. Clonality of the circulating Blymphocytes should be confirmed at screening. Previously confirmed immunohistological diagnosis with a characteristic CD5+/CD20+ Bcell immunophenotype according to WHO criteria. CLL diagnosis requires an absolute peripheral blood monoclonal CD20+/CD5+ Blymphocyte count ≥ 5000 cells/μL for the duration of at least 3 months. Subject must have the following staging requirements: 1. CLL: Rai Stage III or IV disease, or stage 0II disease that meets National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCIWG) criteria for active disease requiring therapy that may include either of the following diseaserelated symptoms: Progressive lymphadenopathy including bulky disease as defined by mass, lymph node or lymph node cluster &gt; 10 cm. Progressive lymphocytosis with &gt; 50% increase over a 2month period, or anticipated doubling time &lt; 6 months. 2. NHL: Intermediate or high risk by Ann Arbor Staging with Cotswald Modifications that meets criteria for active disease requiring therapy. History of at least one antiCD20 antibody containing regimen that resulted in initial measurable response (partial or complete remission), followed by relapse/recurrence. Patients must have received all approved therapies known to provide clinical benefit for their disease subtype and for which they are eligible or must have refused these treatment options prior to consideration for enrolment. In the case of patients who have lymphomas for which highdose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDASCT) is considered a standard curative therapy, eligibility for this study requires that the patient's disease has relapsed after HDASCT, that the patient is not eligible for HDASCT, or that the patient has refused HDASCT. Patients with known central nervous system metastases may be enrolled if they have received radiotherapy, do not require chronic steroid therapy, have had computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain within 1 month of study entry that shows stable disease and they have no neurological symptoms other than low grade neuropathy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt; 2. Patients must be at least 28 days past their last course of lymphoma or CLL treatment, at least 84 days past their last course of any antiCD20 MAb treatment. Patients with preexisting severe or life threatening side effects/conditions from prior therapy or due to other diseases may not be enrolled Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to initiating dosing. Male and female subjects with reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods while on study therapy and for 12 week following their last dose of study medication. Patients who cannot comply with protocol requirements including clinic visits for intravenous infusions and birth control measures may not be enrolled. Female patients who are pregnant or are breast feeding. Potential patients with a history of another cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical cancer in situ) may not be enrolled unless it is documented that their previous cancer was treated, they have been disease free for five or more years prior to starting this study and they are in their doctor's judgment at less than 30% risk of relapse of this previous malignancy. Patients with a peripheral blood total lymphocyte count of higher than 25,000/mm3 may not be enrolled. Patients cannot have experienced a significant (CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 with or without neutropenia) infection within 2 weeks of their first dose of MT3724. Patients are not eligible if they are using any other approved or investigational antineoplastic therapies or any other investigational therapies for any other reason. Patients may not be receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy at a prednisone dose &gt; 20 mg/day (or steroid equivalent) within 2 weeks of starting study. Patients with uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarct or unstable angina within 6 months prior to start of study treatment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias requiring medication for treatment, clinically significant pericardial disease, or cardiac amyloidosis may not be enrolled. Patients with a known history of drug abuse or any chronic neurologic, psychiatric, endocrine, metabolic, immunologic, hepatic or renal disease (including a history of hemolytic uremic syndrome) that in the opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect study participation. Patients with known active Hepatitis C, HIV or a present history of Hepatitis B Patients must not have received any vaccines for 28 days prior to administration of their first dose of MT3724 and should not receive any vaccine during the study or within 28 days after their last dose of MT3724. Patients with a suspected allergy or sensitivity to any component of MT3724 drug preparation based upon known allergies to compounds of a similar class who have had an anaphylactic or other severe infusion reaction to human immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibody administration are n ot eligible. Patients who have had an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are not eligible. Patients who have had major surgery within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug or have major surgery planned during the first 12 weeks after MT3724 has finished.</criteria>
