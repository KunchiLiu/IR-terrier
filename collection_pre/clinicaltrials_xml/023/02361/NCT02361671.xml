	<brief_summary>Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common and potentially life threatening condition arising from a variety of pathological conditions. The ability to monitor ICP is a crucial aspect in the management of these patients. Currently, the diagnosis of whether ICP is elevated or not is determined either with clinical signs (headache, nausea and vomiting or visual disturbances) or from the changes in the preoperative neuroimaging modalities such as computerized tomography (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, transorbital ultrasonography has gained popularity as a noninvasive bedside exam that has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of raised ICP by evaluating the change in the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). The aim of our study is to use transorbital ultrasound to evaluate ONSD changes in patients with intracranial pathology and to compare the changes in the ONSD before and after surgical intervention as well as between patients with and without clinical or radiological signs of increased ICP.</brief_summary>
