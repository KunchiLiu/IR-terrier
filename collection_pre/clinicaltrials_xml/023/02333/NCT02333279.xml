	<brief_summary>The investigators will determine the cancer risk in organ transplant recipients compared to the general population with the help of statistical analysis. Secondly the investigators will try to characterize the different cancer types.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Development In Organ Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cohort analyses will focus on incident and recurrent cases of development of non-skin cancer over time. We will consider time to first formation of non-skin solid cancer after solid organ transplantation as well as the cumulative number of non-skin solid cancer formation over time. Both aspects are equally important and will be reflected in the analytic methods of this study. Theses analyses will be restricted to the most prevalent transplantation types of heart, kidney, liver, and lung.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We will select all patients within the STCS based on the date of the first solid organ transplantation. Patients with multiple organ transplantations will be included as well. Patients contribute to the study observation time until death or end of followup due to other reasons. We will exclude patients with nonsolid organ transplantation (e.g. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation), because the detailing of information in the STCS is insufficient to allow for detailed analysis of cancer development and control of relevant confounders. We will exclude</criteria>
