	<brief_summary>Head and neck cancers usually occur in patients who have a history of long tobacco use. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic progressive disease of the airways and lung parenchyma that is also associated with exposure to tobacco. COPD and head &amp; neck cancer share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure. the investigators hypothesize that patients with chronic lung disease related to smoking have a higher risk to develop cancer in the head and neck. The investigators designed a study to assess the prevalence of cancer and pre-cancer disease in the head &amp; neck in patients with chronic lung disease. the investigators will examine patients with and without a history of smoking and chronic lung disease in order to determine the prevalence of head and neck cancer in the different groups. The patients who will be included in the study will undergo comprehensive evaluation of their lung function and voice performance. This study is a joint effort of the Pulmonology Institute and the Department of Otolaryngology, Head &amp; Neck Surgery in Israel and the Netherlands.</brief_summary>
