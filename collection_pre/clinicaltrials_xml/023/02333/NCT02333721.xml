	<brief_title>Study on Laparoscopic Spleen-Preserving No. 10 Lymph Node Dissection for Advanced Middle or Upper Third Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized comparison of laparoscopic spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection for gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the short-term, long-term and oncological outcomes. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.</detailed_description>
