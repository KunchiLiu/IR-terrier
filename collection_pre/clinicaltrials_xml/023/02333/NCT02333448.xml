	<brief_summary>The study consists in taking 4 tubes of blood at different times over a period of 10 days, via a catheter (central venous or arterial catheter) already in place in the usual therapeutic management. These samples will make it possible to measure blood levels of certain markers specific to invasive candidiasis. PCR will be used to quantify fungal load precisely, that is to say the quantity of yeast present in the blood and to monitor this quantity over time. These samples will be transferred to a specialized unit and stored for a maximum of three years for use at the end of the study.</brief_summary>
