	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of PCV Chemotherapy in Patients With Recurrent High-grade Glioma With IDH1/2 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is aimed at evaluating the safety and effectiveness of PCV chemotherapy in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma with IDH1/2 mutation. And, this trial is approved by medical ethics committee of hebei yanda hospital. Also, the trial has got a registry code "ChiCTR-OOC-15005759" in China clinical trial registry. Researchers will conduct thsi trial from 2015/02 to 2017/12, and 100 recurrent high-grade glioma with IDH1/2 mutation patients will be recruited. Patients who are recruited will get PCV chemotherapy in ether Hebei Yanda Hospital or Beijing Tiantan hospital, and get follow-ups from clinicians.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis of highgrade glioma was established by pathological method,and the recurrency of the disease is ongoing. The report of the pathological diagnosis contained the status of IDH gene, and showed that IDH1/2 mutation existed. The age of the patient is between 18 years old and 70 years old. The condition of the patient permits the procedure of chemotherapy using PCV schema. The patient is informed consent, and willing to join in this research. The diagnosis is not recurrent highgrade glioma. The diagnosis of highgrade glioma was not established by pathological method. No molecular neuropathological report is available, or the report showed that IDH1/2 mutation did not exist. The age of the patient does not meet the requirement of this research. The condition of the patient does not permit the procedure of chemotherapy using PCV schema. There are other conditions that the clinicians believe that the PCV chemotherapy is not appropriate for the patient. The patient is not willing to join in this research.</criteria>
