	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Provide written, informed consent prior to all trialrelated procedures (if under 18, include consent of legal guardian). 2. Body weight of ≥30 kg (in light clothing and no shoes). 3. Willingness and ability to attend scheduled followup visits and undergo study assessments. 4. Provide consent to HIV testing (if an HIV test was performed within 1 month prior to trial start, it should not be repeated as long as documentation can be provided [ELISA and/or Western Blot]). 5. Male or female, aged 14 years or above. 6. Subjects with one of the following pulmonary TB conditions: 1. XDRTB documented by culture positive (for M.tb.) results (with resistance to isoniazid, rifamycins, a fluoroquinolone and an injectable within 3 months prior to screening); 2. MDRTB documented by culture positive results (for M.tb.) within 3 months prior to screening with documented nonresponse to treatment with the best available regimen for 6 months or more prior to enrollment who in the opinion of the Investigator have been adherent to treatment and will be adherent to study regimen; 3. MDRTB documented by culture positive (for M.tb.) results within 3 months prior to screening who are unable to continue second line drug regimen due to a documented intolerance to: i. PAS, ethionamide, aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones; ii. Current treatment not listed above that renders subject eligible for the study in the Investigator's opinion. 7. Chest XRay picture (taken within a year prior to screening) consistent with pulmonary TB in the opinion of the Investigator. 8. Be of nonchildbearing potential or using effective methods of birth control, as defined below: Nonchildbearing potential: 1. Subject not heterosexually active or practices sexual abstinence; or 2. Female Subject/sexual partner bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation and/or hysterectomy or has been postmenopausal with a history of no menses for at least 12 consecutive months; or 3. Male Subject/sexual partner vasectomised or has had a bilateral orchidectomy minimally three months prior to Screening. Effective birth control methods: A double contraceptive method should be used as follows: 1. Double barrier method which can include any 2 of the following: a male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom (male and female condoms should not be used together); or 2. Barrier method (one of the above) combined with hormonebased contraceptives or an intrauterine device for the female Subject/partner; 3. and are willing to continue practicing birth control methods throughout treatment and for 6 months (both male and female Subjects) after the last dose of study medication or discontinuation from study medication in case of premature discontinuation. Note: Hormone based contraception alone may not be reliable when taking investigational medicinal products; therefore, hormone based contraceptives alone cannot be used by female Subjects or female partners of male Subjects to prevent pregnancy. Exclusion Criteria Medical History 1. Any condition in the Investigator's opinion (i.e., an unstable disease such as uncontrolled diabetes or cardiomyopathy, extrapulmonary TB requiring extended treatment), where participation in the trial would compromise the wellbeing of Subject or prevent, limit or confound protocol specified assessments. 2. In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient is not expected to survive for more than 12 weeks. 3. Karnofsky score &lt; 50 within 30 days prior to entry. 4. History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to any of the trial Investigational Medicinal Products or related substances. 5. HIV infected Subjects having a CD4+ count &lt;50 cells/µL. For HIV infected Subjects having a CD4+ count ≥50 cells/µL; a. Currently treated with or will need to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) which is not compatible with the allowed ARTs and is not considered an appropriate candidate for switching to a regimen of ARVs which is allowed. Examples of allowed treatment include but are not limited to the following. If there are any questions, discuss with the Sponsor Medical Monitor for confirmation of appropriate ARV regimen. i. Nevirapine based regimen consisting of nevirapine in combination with any NRTIs; ii. Lopinavir/ritonavir (Aluvia™) based regimen consisting of lopinavir/ritonavir (Aluvia™) in combination with any NRTIs; iii. In the case of resistance or intolerance to the above two regimens, a triple nucleosidase reverse trascriptase inhibitors (NRTI) based regimen consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine and abacavir may be used with caution; iv. Raltegravir in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); b. Cannot ensure a 2 week interval between commencing IMP and the start of ART, if not already on ARTs. 6. Having participated in other clinical studies with dosing of investigational agents within 8 weeks prior to trial start or currently enrolled in an investigational study that includes treatment with medicinal agents. Subjects who are participating in observational studies or who are in a follow up period of a trial that included drug therapy may be considered for inclusion. 7. Significant cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. 8. Subjects with the following at Screening: 1. QTcF interval on ECG &gt;500 msec. Subjects with QTcF &gt; 450 must be discussed with the sponsor medical monitor before enrolment. 2. History of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes, (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome); 3. Clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias; 4. Subjects with other cardiac abnormalities that may place them at risk of arrhythmias must be discussed with the sponsor medical monitor before enrollment. Such abnormalities include: Evidence of ventricular preexcitation (e.g., Wolff Parkinson White syndrome); Electrocardiographic evidence of complete or clinically significant incomplete left bundle branch block or right bundle branch block; Evidence of second or third degree heart block; Intraventricular conduction delay with QRS duration more than 120 ms. 9. Females who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening or already known to be pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to conceive a child during the study or within 6 months of cessation of treatment. Males planning to conceive a child during the study or within 6 months of cessation of treatment. 10. A peripheral neuropathy of Grade 3 or 4, according to DMID (Appendix 2). Or, subjects with a Grade 1 or 2 neuropathy which is likely to progress/worsen over the course of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator. Specific Treatments 11. Concomitant use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or prior use within 2 weeks of treatment assignment. 12. Concommitant use of serotonergic antidepressants or prior use within 3 days of treatment assignment if Investigator foresees potential risks for serotonin syndrome when combined with linezolid. 13. Concomitant use of any drug known to prolong QTc interval (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, bepridil, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, cisapride, cyclobenzaprine, clarithromycin, disopyramide, dofetilide, domperidone, droperidol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, halofantrine, haloperidol, ibutilide, levomethadyl, mesoridazine, methadone, pentamidine, pimozide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol, sparfloxacin, thioridazine). 14. Concomitant use of any drug known to induce myelosuppresion. 15. Subjects may have previously been treated for DS/MDRTB provided that treatment is/was discontinued at least 3 days prior to treatment assignment. Based on Laboratory Abnormalities 16. Subjects with the following toxicities at Screening (labs may be repeated) as defined by the enhanced Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMID) adult toxicity table (November 2007): 1. serum potassium less than the lower limit of normal for the laboratory; 2. Hemoglobin level of &lt; 8.0 g/dL; 3. Platelet count &lt; 80,000/mm3; 4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000/ mm3; 5. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥5.0 x ULN. Subjects with AST &gt; 3.0 x ULN must be discussed with the sponsor medical monitor before enrolment; 6. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥5.0 x ULN. Subjects with ALT &gt; 3.0 x ULN must be discussed with the sponsor medical monitor before enrolment; 7. total bilirubin grade 3 or greater (≥2.0 x ULN, or ≥1.50 x ULN when accompanied by any increase in other liver function test); 8. Serum creatinine level greater than 2 times upper limit of normal.</criteria>
