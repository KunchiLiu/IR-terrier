	<brief_summary>Pain is a prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with cancer, having an enormous impact on functioning and quality of life. Integration of patient self-management and professional care by means of care technology provides new opportunities in the outpatient setting. In this project a technology based and nurse delivered multicomponent self-management support intervention has been developed. Important components include monitoring, feedback, education, and nurse support. Following feasibility evaluation, the primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of the intervention regarding pain intensity and quality of life as compared to care as usual. Secondary outcomes of the effect evaluation are self-efficacy, knowledge, anxiety and depression, and pain medication use. Besides, a cost-evaluation and summative process evaluation will be performed.</brief_summary>
