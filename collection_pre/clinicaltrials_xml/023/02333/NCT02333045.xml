	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigator seeks to understand the immune cells in the cervical fluid of HIV-negative healthy female volunteers, and to see if these cells can be modified using a combined anti-viral and antiinflammatory drug called maraviroc, a medicine used in the treatment of HIV infection. Maraviroc works by preventing HIV from entering human immune cells by blocking a protein on the outside of these cells called the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receptor. When maraviroc is bound to this protein, the virus cannot enter the cell. The investigator thinks that CCR5 antagonists could be particularly good drugs for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and could potentially be dosed in ways that are easier to take than the current drugs used for PrEP. In order to further evaluate this PrEP strategy, the investigator will first study the immune cells in the blood and genital tract of HIV-negative healthy female volunteers over the course of 3 months to see how these cells change over time and are affected by factors such as age, menstrual cycle, and genital infections. The amount of maraviroc compared with the drugs in the current drugs used for PrEP (tenofovir/ emtricitabine) in the blood and genital tract of HIV-negative healthy female volunteers before, during, and after they are given maraviroc versus tenofovir/ emtricitabine for 7 days will be measured. We will also study immune cells from the blood and genital tract from these women to see if maraviroc, tenofovir, or emtricitabine have an effect on these cells that would prevent them from becoming infected with HIV.</detailed_description>
