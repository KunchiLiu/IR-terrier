	<detailed_description>40 patients attending IVF center during 2013 &amp;2014 were fulfilling criteria of poor response and they failed to go through OPU as they gave &lt;3 mature follicles on a dose of 300U GN or more. All patients were revised for history, examinations and investigations, including age, type and duration of infertility, day 3 FSH, Day 3 E2, AMH, AFC All patients were 35 years old ore more We exclude patient &gt;44ys ,AMH &lt;0.3ng/ml,FSH &gt;13, also patients of DM, endometriosis, general disease were excluded, any local uterine anomalies were excluded.
