	<detailed_description>In the study, after evaluation of the general and physical status, eligible patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned into two arms at an 1:1 ratio. In the control arm patients will be receiving standard therapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guide line (control group) and in experimental arm, patients will be receiving simultaneous standard therapy and injection of mix vaccine (MV). MV will be injected weekly till disease progression. Blood sample will be obtained at baseline and every week before MV injection for the assessment of clinical hematology, biochemistry measurements and immunology index (including immunoglobin, interleukin and interferon). Patients will be evaluated for toxicity throughout the study. Side effect, progression free survival, immunology index and general status will be recorded.</detailed_description>
