	<brief_title>The Efficacy Study of Aclasta on Prosthetic Fixation in Postmenopausal Women After THA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the efficacy of Zoledronic acid and placebo treatment on the prosthetic transverse translation in post-menopausal osteoporosis women under cementless total hip arthroplasty by Radiostereometry （RSA）in two-year follow-up period . Meanwhile to assess efficacy of Zoledronic acid treatment on the vertical translation of acetabulum and the subsidence translation of femoral stem by Radiostereometry（RSA), prevention of peri- prosthetic bone loss by observing the local average bone mineral density ( BMD ) changes for 7 femoral region Gruen zones through Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA）scans, et al.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who was diagnosed with Postmenopausal osteoporosis( bone mineral density T&lt;2.5;or with previous fragility fracture, bone mineral density T 2.5~1.5), responding to Zoledronic acid, within one week after the successful cementless total hip arthroplasty surgery. 1. Patients with any history of disorders except osteoporosis known to severely affect bone and mineral metabolism such as Paget disease; 2. Patients who suffer from secondary osteoporosis 3. Patients who were treated with bisphosphonate within the previous one year ,anabolic drug or strontium; 4. Patients with contraindications for Zoledronic acid: 5. Patients with invasive malignant tumor on any organ in the past 5 years, treated oruntreated; 6. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. 7. Serum calcium &gt;2.75mmol/L (11.0mg/dL). 8. Patients who are unwilling to accept the treatment of Zoledronic acid. 9. Patients who accepted the treatment of investigational product and/or device in the 30 days before randomization. 10. Patients with any medical or mental diseases, which prevent patients from complying with protocols or completing protocols, judged by investigators. 11. Patients with the medical history of inflammation of the iris or uveitis, except the inflammation which is secondary to trauma and cured 2 years ago before screening. 12. Patients with the medical history of diabetic nephropathy or diabetic retinopathy. 13. Patients aged under 60 years old and whose result of urine pregnancy test paper is positive.
