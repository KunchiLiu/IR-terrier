	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to evaluate an alternative myeloablative, but reduced toxicity conditioning regimen in children, to describe the safety and efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) Treosulfan administered as part of a standardised Fludarabine-containing conditioning and to contribute to the current pharmacokinetic model to be able to finally give age (or body surface area) dependent dose recommendations. The treatment regimens given in the protocol MC-FludT.17/M are based on sufficient clinical safety and efficacy data. Considering the vital indication for allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation of the selected patient population, the risk-benefit assessment is therefore reasonably in favour of the study conduct.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treosulfan-based Conditioning in Paediatric Patients With Haematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol MC-FludT.17/M is a clinical phase II trial to describe the safety and efficacy of Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in at least 70 paediatric patients with haematological malignancies (male and female children with haematological malignant diseases as acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemias (JMML), requiring myeloablative conditioning treatment with following allo-HSCT). Treosulfan dose per day is to be calculated by using body surface area (BSA). Two background conditioning regimens with Treosulfan are allowed: One regimen consists of a standardised Fludarabine-containing regimen and the other consists of an intensified regimen with Fludarabine and ThioTEPA. Freedom from transplant (treatment)-related mortality (TRM), defined as death from any transplant-related cause from the day of first administration of study medication until day +100 after HSCT is the primary objective of the trial. Moreover, the current pharmacokinetic (PK) model should be contributed to be able to finally give age (or BSA) dependent dose recommendations.</detailed_description>

Females of childbearing potential or male patients' partners with childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (pearl index &lt; 1 %) such as complete sexual abstinence, combined oral contraceptive, hormone intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), vaginal hormone ring, transdermal contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant or depot contraceptive injection in combination with a second method of contraception like a condom or a cervical cap / diaphragm with spermicide or surgical sterilisation (vasectomy) in male patients or male partners during the study and at least 6 months thereafter. 9. Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. 1. Third or later alloHSCT. 2. HSCT from haploidentical or umbilical cord blood donor. 3.
