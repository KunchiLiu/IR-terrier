	<brief_summary>The effect of transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing thyroidectomy surgery remains unclear. Therefore, the investigators conducted this prospective, randomized, double-blind study to verify the hypothesis that pre-operative TEAS could improve the quality of recovery (QoR) after thyroidectomy surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation Improve the Quality of Recovery After Thyroidectomy?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is a form of non-invasive electrical stimulation that produces a perceptible sensation via electrodes attached to the skin. It has no risk of infections and can potentially be applied by medical personnel with minimal training. Clinical trials have demonstrated that TEAS reduces the consumption of intra-operative anesthetics and general anesthesia related side-effects.</detailed_description>
