	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Density Status in Pediatric and Adolescent Survivors of Childhood Cancer With History of Bone Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the status of bones in children and young-adults who have had bone fractures after treatment for childhood cancer. Bone complications including fracture can be important issues for some childhood cancer survivors. In this study we are measuring bone mineral density in children and young adults who have had bone fracture after treatment for childhood cancer. We will measure bone mineral density in two ways. We will use: 1) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (also known as DXA), and 2) peripheral quantitative computed tomography (also known as pQCT).</detailed_description>
