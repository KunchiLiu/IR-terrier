	<detailed_description>A non-interventional, multicenter study to observe the main criteria used in clinical practice by physicians when selecting the second-line add-on therapy in patients with inadequately metformin-controlled type 2 diabetes in 2 time points at 1 year distance. The study will enrol a minimum of 500 patients in each time point, resulting in a total of at least 1000 from approximately 50 investigators from Bulgaria. Each investigator will recruit approximately 10 subjects. The assignment of the patients to a particular add-on therapy is not decided in advance by the NIS protocol, but falls within current practice and the prescription of medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the subject in the study. No additional diagnostic and monitoring procedures shall be applied to patients, other than daily clinical practice and the epidemiological methods shall be used for the analysis of collected data. The intention of the study is to collect data on patients with type 2 diabetes and add-on therapies under routine clinical care. The patients will participate in only one study visit, at the time of enrolment, when they provide the written informed consent, thus allowing the access to their data. Data will be collected by reviewing the medical records of patients. Two study groups are to be defined at each time-point - one study group enrolled in moment 1 of evaluation (Feb - Mar 2015) and one study group enrolled in moment 2 of evaluation (Feb - Mar 2016). A patient enrolled in study moment 1 may not be enrolled in study moment 2. No patient will be prospectively followed-up during the study. Investigators participating in this non-interventional study will be diabetologists in outpatient settings, as this group of specialists treats most of the T2DM patients in Bulgaria.</detailed_description>
