	<brief_summary>This feasibility trial aims at assessing practical issues and feasibility of a future randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness of vibrating vaginal pelvic floor training balls for postpartum pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation, at monitoring harms of the experimental intervention, and at exploring women´s perspectives on and experiences with the interventions and the trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibrating Vaginal Balls After Childbirth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Pelvic floor muscle training after childbirth is recommended to prevent or treat urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor problems. A device that is sometimes recommended to women in Austria to enhance their pelvic floor muscles are vibrating vaginal pelvic floor training balls. To date, only a small study on vibrating balls exists, and it researched women with urinary incontinence and not women after childbirth. Therefore, research is needed to scientifically objectify the popular claim of these balls´ effectiveness in the postpartum period and further evidence based practice. Method: The tested study features comprise - recruitment strategies, - inclusion and exclusion criteria, - the necessary number of participants, - the randomisation procedure, - the interventions themselves, - concordance and retention measures, - data collection, - effectiveness outcomes, - a survey of women's views of and experiences, - statistics and content analysis. Results: The results of this trial will inform the features and feasibility of a future full RCT. It will be concluded that a full RCT to determine the effectiveness of vibrating vaginal pelvic floor training balls post partum is feasible as planned, feasible with modifications or not feasible. If considered feasible, the results will enable the full study to be planned correctly.</detailed_description>
