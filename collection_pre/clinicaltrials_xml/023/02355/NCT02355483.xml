	<brief_title>Impact of Unenhanced Computed Tomography (CT) in Elderly Patients Admitted to the Emergency Department With Acute Abdominal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A systematic unenhanced abdominal CT is performed in elderly patients admitted to the emergency patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Accuracy of unenhanced CT is assessed by comparing diagnosis and therapeutic management recorded before and after unenhanced CT versus gold standard diagnosis and management. Gold standard diagnosis and management are established at 3 month follow up, based on patient's medical records and a systematic telephone interview.</detailed_description>
