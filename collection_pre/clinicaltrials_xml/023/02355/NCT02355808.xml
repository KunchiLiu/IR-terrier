	<brief_summary>Lack of internet infrastructure, personal skills, and service provision have been identified as potential barriers to e-health but as yet there is no good evidence of the impact of interventions to improve them. This study aims to assess impact on e-health uptake of three interventions (i) superfast broadband, (ii) a tailored leaflet to help participants improve personal internet skills and support, (iii) GP interventions to improve health service provision of e-health. In a cluster randomised factorial controlled trial, 1388 households from 78 postcodes were randomly selected from the 20088 Cornish postcodes and allocated to the 8 (2X2X2) arms of the study. Comparison of 'e-health readiness' and 'miles travelled' from baseline to 18 month follow-up between the 8 arms of the study, will be used to assess the effects of interventions, singly and in combination.</brief_summary>
