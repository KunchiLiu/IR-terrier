	<brief_summary>Objectives: Primary Objective: To identify and preselect patients with chronic HBV mono infection, who are undetectable for anti-Ad5 nAb, currently being treated with nucleo(t)sides, for participation in the TG1050.02 Phase1/1b First in Man (FIM) study. Secondary Objectives: To assess the prevalence of undetectable anti-Ad5 nAb in chronic HBV mono-infected patients. Methodology: Patients with chronic HBV mono-infection, who are currently being treated with nucleo(t)sides for their HBV infection, will be enrolled in this study to measure Ad5 nAb levels. A single peripheral blood collection (4 mL) will be obtained and Ad5 nAb titers will be measured by a central laboratory using a newly validated assay.</brief_summary>
