	<brief_title>Thera-Band® HEP for LBP Secondary Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of acute and chronic LBP has been extensively studied, but study of the strategies for preventing the progression of acute LBP episodes into chronic back pain is still lacking. Therefore, determining the most effective secondary prevention strategy for the prevention of recurrences of LBP is essential for the reduction of long term disability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a Thera-Band based home exercise program (HEP) on LBP and disability 4 weeks post treatment discharge. A convenience sample of 22 new patients, 18-65 years of age, with current, chronic LBP will be recruited for this study at the discharge visit from care. Exclusionary criteria will include, current pregnancy and the presence of any red flags such as tumor or cancer, vertebral fracture, or infection. Upon agreeing to the study, patients will sign an informed consent, complete a demographics questionnaire, and complete specific outcome measure assessments. The outcome measures will include Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete a secondary prevention program questionnaire. Following the initial paperwork, all patients will be provided with a Thera-Band® Loop and Band and handout describing the HEP to be performed 3 times a week for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of 4 weeks, a follow-up phone call or email, based on patient preference, will be conducted. The follow-up will include pain, disability, compliance, satisfaction of program of the home program.</detailed_description>
