	<brief_summary>The goal of this prospective randomized double-blind study is to compare clinical and radiological results of cemented and uncemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Two hundred and fifty patients will be randomized in two groups : cemented TKA and uncemented TKA. The primary outcome is the comparison of the International Knee Society (IKS) Score revised in 2011 at one year postoperative. The second outcome is the comparison of standard one year-postoperative x-rays looking for signs of loosening.</brief_summary>
