	<brief_title>Comparative Effects of Moxonidine on Bone Metabolism, Vascular and Cellular Aging in Hypertensive Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several experimental studies have demonstrated that moxonidine may lower the activity of Na+- independent Cl-/bicarbonate exchanger (anion exchanger, AE) which plays an essential role in viability of osteoclasts that are crucial for bone resorption. The suppression of AE proteins activity has been proven to inhibit osteoclast activity and reduce bone resorption whereas the moxonidine molecule is known to reduce the AE protein activity. Therefore, the results of experimental studies have shown the ability of moxonidine to inhibit bone resorption through its effect on the osteoclast activity. Published data contain information on positive effects of beta-blockers on the bone tissue condition. There are data which clearly demonstrate a positive effect of beta-blockers on bone mass. The proposed trial is a comprehensive study of moxonidine effects on processes of cellular and vascular aging as well as bone metabolism.</detailed_description>
