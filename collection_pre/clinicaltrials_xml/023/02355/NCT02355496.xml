	<detailed_description>This study is a clinical trial to determine the impact on inpatient laboratory test ordering of presenting providers with medicare fee data at the time of order entry. We will randomly assign 60 laboratory tests to an active arm (medicare fee data displayed) or to a control arm (medicare fee data not displayed). The primary outcome will be the change in the ratio of tests ordered per patient day over 12 months by study group (intervention vs. control).</detailed_description>
