	<brief_summary>This study is looking at the safety and effectiveness of treating Patients diagnosed with a low-risk Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in an outpatient setting instead of the standard, in-patient hospitalization. Patients have several medical tests done during their Emergency Department visit. Based on those tests, those who are determined to have a low-risk PE are eligible to participate in the study. Those choosing to participate are discharged after 12 hours of medical observation. Patients who choose to participate are followed up by telephone approximately 90 days later.</brief_summary>
