	<brief_summary>Naxozol is a combination product of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor which is designed to improve symptoms and reduce risk of gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether naxozol protects the gastrointestinal tract effectively compared to celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor.</brief_summary>
