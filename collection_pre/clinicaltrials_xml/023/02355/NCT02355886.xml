	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess if perioperative gabapentin will decrease post-operative analgesic requirements within the first 48 hours after radical cystectomy (RC) in patients undergoing RC as measured morphine equivalents. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess patient self-assessment of postoperative pain on Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) at 24 and 48 hours. II. To assess time to return of bowel function (ROBF). III. To assess length of stay (LOS) following RC. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gabapentin orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for 48 hours after surgery. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO TID for 48 hours after surgery.</detailed_description>
