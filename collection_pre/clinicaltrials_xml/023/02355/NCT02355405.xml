	<brief_summary>Lung ultrasound offers a novel, reliable and radiation-free tool for diagnosing perioperative atelectasis and evaluating its severity in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia in the operating room.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Values of Lung Ultrasound for Perioperative Atelectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atelectases occur in up to 90% of patients undergoing general anesthesia and intubation. The aim of the present observational study was designed to further to evaluate the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound (LUS) in detection of postoperative atelectasis in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. Results of LUS as the experimental method will be compared to the results of computed tomography (CT) as the reference technique for the detection of atelectasis. The investigators want to confirm former findings of the appearance of perioperative atelectases and to prove that ultrasound is a valid tool for detection of atelectases.</detailed_description>
