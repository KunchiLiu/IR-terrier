	<brief_title>Female Sexual Function and Socioeconomic Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Female sexual dysfunction is common, and the effect of socioeconomic status in an urban population is unknown. The objective is to determine socioeconomic and clinical factors associated with female sexual dysfunction for patients with publicly and privately funded health insurance in an urban outpatient gynecology clinic. Methods: We performed an observational, IRB approved, cross-sectional study of 238 sexually-active, non-pregnant women reporting to two urban gynecology clinics, representing patients with publicly funded (n=70) or privately funded health insurance (n=168). The participants completed validated questionnaires measuring sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index or FSFI), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), urinary incontinence (Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis), and demographic variables. Data was analyzed with non-parametric t-tests, chi-squared tests, and linear regression models.</detailed_description>
