	<brief_summary>For the target population of adult patients following primary total hip arthroplasty, the randomized clinical trial will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the use of a mobile negative pressure wound therapy(NPWT) device compared to a standard absorptive dressing in the immediate postoperative period. We will apply two dressing types and evaluate the postoperative wounds with a wound scoring system (ASEPSIS) that incorporates multiple variables of wound infection risk.</brief_summary>
