	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of a novel strategy for tuberculosis (TB) infection control known as FAST (Find cases Actively based on cough surveillance, Separate temporarily, and Treat effectively). It is anticipated that this will decrease time to effective treatment initiation and also decrease transmission of TB to health care workers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finding and Treating Unsuspected and Resistant TB to Reduce Hospital Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is longstanding evidence that tuberculosis (TB) transmission is not from TB patients on effective treatment, but from unsuspected cases, and cases with unsuspected drug resistance. This study seeks to investigate the implementation of a refocused TB transmission control approach that we call FAST (Find cases Actively based on cough surveillance, Separate temporarily, and Treat effectively based on molecular drug-susceptibility testing [DST]). We will conduct this study at Hospital Nacional Hipólito Unanue in Lima, Peru. Our hypothesis is that FAST will reduce delays in identifying infectious TB patients (and unsuspected drug resistance) entering the hospital, facilitate timely effective therapy, and thereby reduce the risk of TB transmission in a cost-effective manner. We will assess the decrease in transmission by evaluating for a decrease tuberculin skin test conversions (TST) among health care workers. We will also evaluate acceptability and barriers to/facilitators of FAST, novel screening strategies, and health care worker TST using a mixed methods approach.</detailed_description>
