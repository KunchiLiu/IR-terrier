	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare continuous femoral nerve block with adductor canal block after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction arthroscopically，especially in the effect on quadriceps strength; and to evaluate which regional anesthesia is more ideal for the patients postoperatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adductor Canal Block Versus Femoral Nerve Block for Analgesia After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Arthroscopically</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists（ASA） Ⅰ-Ⅲ（no limitation of age and gender）are randomized to receive either a continuous adductor canal block(ACB) or a femoral nerve block(FNB) via a catheter (a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine, 5 mL/h for 48 hours)in the PACU immediately after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction arthroscopically. Patients were under general anesthesia during the operation and received a femoral nerve block with 0.25% ropivacaine 10ml before the surgery.Both groups will receive postoperatively IV patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine (bolus 0.8mg,lock-out time 15 minutes, background infusion 2ml/h)beside the continuous nerve block. Patients are going to be visited for follow-up on the day of surgery and in the following two days. Quadriceps strength is assessed with the displacement of patella.VAS at rest time、degree of knee flexion、VAS at 45°flexion of the knee、dose of opioids、whether the patient has sleep disturbance are also recorded.</detailed_description>
