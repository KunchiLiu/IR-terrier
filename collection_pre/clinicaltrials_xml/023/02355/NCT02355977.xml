	<brief_title>The Response of Pathogens to the Respective or Combined Treatment of SRP and Local Minocycline in Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate the respective or combinatory efficacy of minocycline and scaling and root planning in the aspects of both clinical parameters [Pocket depth (PD) and sulcus bleeding index (SBI)] and the loads of four main periodontal pathogens [Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Prevotella intermedia (Pi)]. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) will be used as a powerful tool with high sensitivity and specificity to quantitatively assess target periodontal bacteria in a period of 7 days. The investigators will also try to correlate the reduction of either total or respective bacteria with the improvements of clinical parameters, with an aim to uncovering the potential microbiological mechanism accounting for the efficacy of a therapy.</detailed_description>
