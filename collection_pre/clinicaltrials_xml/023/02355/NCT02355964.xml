	<brief_summary>This project aims to study the effects of lifestyle changes on asthma and systemic inflammation in a randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise. The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration in the areas of medicine, physiology and nutrition, centred on improving asthma control in non-obese sedentary asthmatics via simple means.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EFFORT Asthma: Effects of Diet and Exercise in Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screening and enrollment, a total of 200 Danish sedentary, non-obese asthma patients will be randomized to one of four groups: 1) control group (no intervention), 2) physical exercise intervention, 3) diet intervention (a diet with an overall high content of protein and a low glycemic index) or 4) exercise plus diet intervention. Asthma is defined as respiratory symptoms and at least one positive asthma test. Patients will continue their regular doses of anti-asthma treatment unchanged throughout the study period. Type of anti-inflammatory medicine will be recorded and the adherence to the therapy will be assessed before the intervention period and at follow-up using questionnaires</detailed_description>
