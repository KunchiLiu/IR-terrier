	<criteria>1. Patient must have biopsyproven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially treated with curative intent (surgery and radiation therapy are most common treatments but other treatments are also eligible). 2. Biochemical recurrence defined as any of the following: PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL in at least two sequential tests for patients treated with surgery. PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL above the post therapy nadir for patients treated with radiation therapy, brachytherapy or cryotherapy. PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/ml above the most recent therapy nadir for patients who have received additional treatment in the recurrent setting. 3. Patient must have undergone standardofcare restaging that does not clearly identify site(s) of active disease. Standard staging examinations may include one or more of the following: CT or MRI, bone imaging (either Tc99m bisphosphonate scintigraphy or F18 sodium fluoride PET), OR In111 capromab pendetide scintigraphy. 4. Age &gt; 18 years. 5. Patient must be able to tolerate PET/MRI or PET/CT imaging 6. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document. 7. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) (Medicare patient) or a Notice of Noncoverage (NNC) from (nonMedicare patient) that addresses the potential cost to the patient of C11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI. 1. For patients planned to have PET/MRI: Patient must not have claustrophobia or any other contraindication to MRI as evaluated by a standardized MRI safety questionnaire. If applicable, patient must not have renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on measurement within the past 60 days) or be undergoing dialysis as these conditions preclude safe administration of MRI contrast agents. NOTE: At the discretion of principal investigator, a subject may be allowed to enroll/continue on study and undergo imaging without the administration of contrast in the event of renal insufficiency. If applicable, patient must not have a known prior reaction to gadolinium based MRI contrast agents. 2. For patients planned to have PET/CT: Patient must not have claustrophobia that would preclude PET/CT imaging or other contraindications to CT imaging.</criteria>
