	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain observational data allowing for the preliminary assessment of the utility of a noninvasive physiologic monitor for monitoring of patients with congestive heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of the CoVa™ Monitoring of Patients With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study proposes to utilize the CoVa™ Monitoring System, a novel body-worn sensor that remotely monitors thoracic fluid, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, skin temperature, posture, and, using transmitted waveforms, stroke volume and cardiac output to evaluate the system's monitoring capabilities in individuals recently hospitalized for congestive heart failure. The data acquired through this study will play a critical roll in developing future interventional studies that will allow patients with HF to potentially receive better and more timely treatment in the home setting, decreasing hospitalizations and improving quality of life.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults over age 18 Have wireless internet access within their homes. Acute hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) diagnosed on the basis of all of the following: 1. Symptoms: Onset or worsening of dyspnea within the past 2 weeks 2. Physical exam (at least 1 present): Rales/ Crackles on auscultation Elevated JVP &gt; 8 cmH2O Weight gain LE edema 3. Diagnostic imaging/ labs (at least 1 present): Evidence of pulmonary congestion or edema on chest Xray/ chest CT Elevated NTproBNP (ageadjusted) (&gt;1000) Patients of particular interest will be those who already have a Medtronic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device with the OptiVol feature that tracks transthoracic impedance. Allergy to ECG electrodes Psychological or social situation that would make the study difficult for the patient Inability to consent Pregnant women Pneumonia currently, or within the past 30 days Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (e.g. ARDS) Interstitial lung disease Endstage renal disease and on hemodialysis For any reason unable to wear or place the CoVa™ device, e.g. pectus excavatum, fragile skin, severe arthritis.</criteria>
