	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the feasibility of using the Third Eye Panoramic device in conjunction with standard colonoscopes in a clinical setting. Patients will undergo a colonoscopy procedure during which the study device will provide video imaging of areas of the colon that are difficult to evaluate with the colonoscope alone. The utility of the device will be assessed from the impressions of the investigators and from telephone follow-up with subjects to assess for post-procedural complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Third Eye Panoramic Device Feasibility Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Third Eye Panoramic device along with a standard colonoscope as a means of enhancing the ability of endoscopists to view areas that are hidden from the view of the colonoscope. Colonoscopy is generally agreed to be the best method for detecting and removing cancers and pre-cancerous adenomas in the colon. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that from 22% to over 40% of adenomas are missed during standard colonoscopy. More importantly, 12% of large adenomas (at least 1 cm) are missed even by expert endoscopists using meticulous technique with the best available equipment, and these large adenomas are the ones that are most likely to transform into cancer. Factors such as quality of bowel cleansing and time spent examining the colonic mucosa have been shown to affect miss rates. However, comparison with the results of CT colonography has shown that 2/3 of missed adenomas are located behind folds in the wall of the colon, in areas that are very difficult to see with a standard forward-viewing colonoscope. When clipped onto the tip of a standard colonoscope, the Third Eye Panoramic device provides two additional miniature video cameras and light sources that offer views to the left side and right side of the colonoscope's tip. These lateral views complement the forward view of the colonoscope's camera to result in a "panoramic" view of over 300Â°. This extreme wide-angle view allows the endoscopist to examine the areas located behind folds. In this study, each subject will undergo a colonoscopy procedure utilizing the Third Eye Panoramic device along with a standard colonoscope. The investigators will evaluate issues related to usability and safety based on their experience and impressions, with telephone follow-up with subjects to assess for any post-procedural complications.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The patient is undergoing colonoscopy for screening, for surveillance in followup of previous polypectomy or for diagnostic workup. 2. The patient must understand and provide written consent for the procedure. 1. Patients &gt;75 years of age; 2. Patients with a history of colonic resection; 3. Patients with suspected chronic stricture potentially precluding complete colonoscopy; 4. Patients with diverticulitis or toxic megacolon; 5. Patients with a history of radiation therapy to abdomen or pelvis; 6. Patients who are currently enrolled in another clinical investigation in which the intervention might compromise the safety of the patient's participation in this study.</criteria>
