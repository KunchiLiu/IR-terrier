	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of acquired disability in youth and a source of significant morbidity and family burden. Novel behavior problems are among the most common and problematic consequences, yet many youth fail to receive needed psychological services due to lack of identification and access.

	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness of Family Problem-Solving Therapy (F-PST) for Adolescent TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of acquired disability in youth and a source of significant morbidity and family burden. Novel behavior problems are among the most common and problematic consequences, yet many youth fail to receive needed psychological services due to lack of identification and access. Linking youth with TBI to effective treatments could improve functional outcomes, reduce family burden, and increase treatment satisfaction. Methods: The investigators overarching aim is to compare the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of three formats of family problem solving therapy (F-PST) for improving functional outcomes of complicated mild to severe adolescent TBI: therapist-guided, face-to-face; therapist-guided online; and self-guided, online F-PST. The efficacy of face-to-face and online F-PST in reducing behavior problems following TBI has been established. However, their comparative acceptability and effectiveness are unknown and it is unclear if families could also benefit from online F-PST without therapist support. To identify which patients benefit most from each intervention, participants will be stratified by distance from the clinic with patients living more than 20 miles or 60 minutes from the clinic randomized to one of the two online arms and others equally randomized among three arms. Patient-reported outcomes pertaining to child, caregiver, and family functioning along with patient treatment preferences will be assessed: prior to treatment initiation, at treatment completion, and at a follow-up 3 months later. Stakeholder input (adolescents with TBI and their caregivers) will guide measurement selection and refinements to the treatment protocols. Each treatment modality consists of 10-14 sessions addressing TBI education, problem-solving, self-regulation, and family communication, but varies in the nature and extent of therapist involvement. Participants will include families of 120 adolescents age 14-18 recruited from four metropolitan TBI centers. Mixed models analyses will be used to examine group differences in improvements in child behavior/functioning, caregiver distress, and family burden. Moderators of comparative effectiveness including socioeconomic status, prior technology use, and patient preferences will be examined. Anticipated Impact: Results will elucidate the relative effectiveness of face-to-face versus online and self-directed versus therapist-supported online modes of treatment including patient and family preferences. They will also provide information about how these programs can be delivered and disseminated through existing head injury follow-up clinics. These data could potentially be translated to other patient populations of youth with psychological symptoms arising from neurological conditions.</detailed_description>
