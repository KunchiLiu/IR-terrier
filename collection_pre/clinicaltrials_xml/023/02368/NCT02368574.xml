	<brief_summary>Based on the value-based medicine, a randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the role of class II and class III hysterectomy in patients with low risk early staged cervical cancer (defined as tumor lesions less than 2cm with less than 50% stromal invasion).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Class II and Class III Hysterectomy in Early Stage Cervical Cancer Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 1:1 multi-center randomized trial with class II hysterectomy plus node dissection as the experimental arm, and class III hysterectomy plus pelvic node dissection as the control arm. Primary endpoints are: (1). 3-year diseases-free survival (DFS) rate; (2) the rates of treatment-related toxicity; (3) post-operation QoL (including sexual function) and (4) treatment costs. Secondary endpoints areï¼š(1) the rates of pelvic and/or extra-pelvic relapse; (2) overall survival(OS) rate; (3) the numbers of retroperitoneal node dissection, and (4) the rates of parametrial, margins and pelvic/para-aortic nodes involvement.</detailed_description>
