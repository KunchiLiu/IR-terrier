	<brief_title>Reha Drive: Predictors of Fitness to Drive a Car for Cardiologic Patients and Determination of Vital Signs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing numbers of elderly people with cardiovascular diseases and the wish to drive a car need recommendations corresponding to fitness of driving after their discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation. A policy paper of the German Cardiac Society (DGK) of 2010 discusses the aptitude of driving a car of cardiovascular patients on experience but only little trial data.Therefore predictors of reduced fitness to drive a car are determined via medical data in comparison to data elevated while "driving" in a simulator and evaluated via Lane Change Test (LCT). Also monitoring of the fitness of driving in the car, automotive monitoring via contactless sensors, could be helpful for judgement.Therefore possible evaluation of heart and breathing rate will be examined with contactless measurements via video camera.</detailed_description>
