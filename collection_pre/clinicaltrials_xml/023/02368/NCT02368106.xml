	<brief_summary>This study will create a patient data registry to collect and analyze information on technology usage and outcomes among patients receiving a broad range of relatively new radiation treatments that have become standards of care in our practice. Review of this information will serve as a basis for development of better patient management plans, to inform decisions about acquisition of new technologies, to provide information about quality in our care delivery, and to create a database that will securely warehouse ongoing information about what treatments the patients we serve need most and the challenges they face in the treatment process. The information gathered is likely to not only improve our services at the University of Maryland and its community sites but to advance medical science and enhance the quality of care for cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to create a robust and long-term patient data registry containing limited demographic, diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up data on patients at the study sites undergoing one or more of the following radiation treatments/technologies: Brachytherapy, including High-Dose-Rate and Low-Dose-Rate Techniques/ GammaPod Therapy/ GRID Treatment/ Image-Guided Radiation Therapy/ Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and Intensity-Modulated Arc Therapy/ MammoSite and SAVI Applicator/ Photodynamic Therapy/ Proton Therapy/ SIR Spheres and Radiolabeled Microsphere Therapy/ Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy/ Thermal Therapy (Hyperthermia)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients who are 18 years old or older and scheduled to undergo any of the listed radiation treatment technologies at the University of Maryland Medical Center or one of its community sites as included in this protocol provided s/he consents to participate. Patients who are incarcerated or in legal custody are not eligible for this study. Patients who are younger than 18 years, are cognitively impaired, or are otherwise unable to provide informed consent. Patients who are pregnant</criteria>
