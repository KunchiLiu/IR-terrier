	<brief_summary>This clinical study is part of the BIOVACSAFE project which is funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative. In this study we will take a small muscle biopsy in order to identify any differences in the response around the actual site of injection compared with responses we measure in blood at the same time.</brief_summary>
