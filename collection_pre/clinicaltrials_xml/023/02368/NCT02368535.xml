	<brief_title>Improving Teamwork in an Academic, Tertiary Care Labor and Delivery Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Failures in teamwork and communication are among the leading cases of sentinel and adverse obstetric events. Multidisciplinary approaches and communication could improve patients outcomes. In 2003, leaders from the department of obstetrics, anesthesia and nursing decided to institute interdisciplinary rounds as a method of improving team communication. Obstetricians, Anesthesiologists, Nurses, Perinatologists, Administrative Assistants, Consultants, and Neonatologists participate in the rounds. The investigators wanted to determine if the establishment of interdisciplinary rounds has made meaningful changes in the perceptions of teamwork and communication. The purpose of this study is to determine if the establishment of interdisciplinary daily rounding has improved teamwork in an academic, tertiary care labor and delivery unit.</detailed_description>
