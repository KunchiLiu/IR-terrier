	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to prove equivalence of efficacy and safety of BCD-080 and Clexan for deep vein thrombosis and embolism prophylaxis at orthopedic surgeries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of BCD-080 Compared to Clexan for Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis at Orthopedic Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include 116 patients who are planned for hip or knee replacement. Patients will randomized in 2 groups. 1-st group will receive BCD-080 at dose 30 mg every 12 hours during 14 days after surgery, 2-d group will receive Clexane at the same dose. Efficacy assessment will include frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (proximal and/or distal; symptomatic or asymptomatic), symptomatic nonlethal thromboembolia of the pulmonary artery (PATE) and venous thromboembolism death. Safety assessment will include frequency of "big", "small" and other bleedings and frequency of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.The assessment of efficacy and safety parameters will be made during the treatment and follow-up period (till 60 day).</detailed_description>

Necessity for continued treatment with anticoagulants (except for planned under this study), antiaggregant and fibrinolytics (eg, patients with artificial cardiac valve, atrial fibrillation patients receiving warfarin, etc.) 25. The use of dextrans or fibrinolytic therapy or other drugs affecting hemostasis; 26. Necessity for use of systemic glucocorticosteroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (except for the use of the latter with the purpose of anaesthesia in the early postoperative period during 3 days after the planned hip or knee replacement) 27.
