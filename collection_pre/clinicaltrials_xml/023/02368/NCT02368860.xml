	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory Phase I study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the OXIRI regimen [oxaliplatin (O), xeloda (X) and irinotecan (I)] and to evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy, in patients with advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The investigators hypothesize that 2 of 3 weekly doses of oxaliplatin and genotype directed-dosing of irinotecan in combination with chronomodulated capecitabine (xeloda) administered continuously will be more tolerable than the FOLFIRINOX regimen (folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) while maintaining anti-tumour activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study comprises a dose escalation phase using 3+3 design to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the OXIRI regimen and an expansion phase to further evaluate the MTD and to determine early signs of efficacy. Eligible patients will receive a novel chemotherapeutic regimen (OXIRI regimen) with xeloda being administered in a chronomodulated fashion and the dose of irinotecan being guided by the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 genotype status of the patient.</detailed_description>
