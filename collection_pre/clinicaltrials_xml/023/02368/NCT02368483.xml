	<brief_summary>This is a single-group, prospective, intervention study. A total of 30 participants with unilateral symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement will be included into the study. The intervention consists in neuromuscular training for the lower limb muscles (12 weeks, 2 times/week supervised training, 2 times/week home training). The training includes physical exercises routinely used worldwide in clinical settings. No control intervention group was included into the study because nowadays there is no standard conservative treatment for patients with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement. Assessments will be performed at (1) baseline, (2) mid-intervention, (3) end-intervention, and (4) follow-up. Clinical, functional, neuromuscular and self-reported parameters will be collected during assessments.</brief_summary>
