	<brief_summary>The number of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) had been increasing. Maternal GDM has a great impact on both the health of the mothers and the offspring. Antenatal lifestyle interventions, in particular dietary intervention appear to be feasible to improve maternal GDM and weight gain. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such trial examining the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention in pregnant women in Hong Kong. Therefore, we plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing a lifestyle modification program (LMP) in early pregnancy and the usual antenatal care in high risk Chinese pregnant women in Hong Kong. Intervention group subjects (n=110) will participate in a dietitian-led LMP including dietary and exercise component from the first antenatal (AN) booking to 24 weeks gestation. 110 women in the control group will receive routine hospital antenatal care. The primary endpoint will be the prevalence of GDM measured using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation. The secondary endpoints will be the proportion of infant born with large for gestational age (&gt;=95th percentile of the customized birth weight) and macrosomia (&gt;=4 kg at birth). The intervention group involves dietary and exercise advice and monitoring. No drug or invasive procedure is involved. The control group will receive routine antenatal care and will be provided with an educational pamphlet on diet and exercise during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
