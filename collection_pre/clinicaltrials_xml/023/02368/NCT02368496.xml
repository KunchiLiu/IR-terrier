	<brief_summary>Recent progress in parenteral nutrition has contributed to improve vital prognosis and to reduce morbidity in patients with severe intestinal failure. Currently, home parenteral nutrition is the only alternative to prolonged hospitalization for those patients. However, long-term parenteral nutrition can result in complications especially in bone, such as osteopenia or osteomalacia, then increasing the risk of fractures. Children are especially at risk because of bone growth and peak mineralization acquisition during puberty. Moreover, frequency and risk factors of those complications are not well documented for children. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is considered as the golden standard for bone mineralization measurement. In pediatrics, this technique has some limits such as the underestimation of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in short stature, the overestimation of the BMD in tall children, and the inability to distinguish cortical from trabecular bone or to evaluate the bone microarchitecture. HR-pQCT, High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography enables noninvasive assessment of bone microarchitecture (virtual bone biopsy) using a radiation similar to DXA. However this technique has never been validated in patients with long-term parenteral nutrition. During the usual follow-up of the patients, HR-pQCT will be the only exam which will come in addition to the routine medical tests.</brief_summary>
