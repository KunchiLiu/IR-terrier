	<brief_summary>Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a rare genetic disease that is associated with oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding, granulomatous colitis, and pulmonary fibrosis in some subtypes, including HPS-1, HPS-2, and HPS-4. Pulmonary fibrosis causes shortness of breath and progressive decline in lung function. In HPS patients with at-risk subtypes, almost all adults eventually develop fatal pulmonary fibrosis unless they undergo lung transplantation. The purpose of this study is to identify the earliest measurable pulmonary disease activity in individuals at-risk for HPS pulmonary fibrosis. The study also aims to develop biomarkers that will aid in understanding of the causes of HPS pulmonary fibrosis and facilitate more rapid conduct of therapeutic trials in HPS patients with mild pulmonary disease in the future.</brief_summary>
