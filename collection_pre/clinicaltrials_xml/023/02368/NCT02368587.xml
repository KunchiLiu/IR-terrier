	<brief_title>Intracoronary or Intravenous Infusion Human Wharton' Jelly-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic heart failure (IHF) secondary to myocardial infarction is a common, lethal, disabling, and expensive condition. Despite advances over the last 30 years, the prognosis of patients with IHF remains poor. At present, there has been increasing interest in attempting to repair the failing heart with the use of stem cells, since this approach has the potential to regenerate dead myocardium and thus alleviate the underlying cause of IHF. A very primitive population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been isolated from a continuum from the sub-amnion to perivascular region of umbilical cord, referred to as Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). WJMSCs retain a combination of most of their embryonic stem cell (ESC) and MSC markers in primary culture and early passages, thus retaining their multipotent stem cell characteristics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that WJMSCs can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and to integrate into the vasculature and ischemic cardiac tissue, as well as to improve heart function significantly. Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with ischemic heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary or intravenous infusion of WJMSCs or placebo, to investigate the therapeutic safety and efficacy of WJMSCs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age no limited 2. Patient must provide written informed consent. 3. Have a diagnosis of chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to myocardial infarction (MI) as defined by any of the following 3 criteria: Previous MI is documented by a clinical history that includes an elevation of cardiac enzymes and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with MI. Patients treated with thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous coronary revascularization. Screening CMRI shows an area of akinesis, dyskinesis, or severe hypokinesis associated with evidence of myocardial scarring based on delayed hyperenhancement after gadolinium infusion. 4. Patient has been treated with appropriate maximal medic al therapy for ICMP. For β blockade, the patient must have be en on a stable dose of a clinically appropriate βblocker for 3 months. For angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibition, the patient must have been on a stable dose of a clinically appropriate agent for 1 m 5. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&lt;45% by echocardiogram, CMRI, or left ventriculogram within the prior 6 m 6. Patients who are a candidate for cardiac catheterization assignment intracoronary infusion group; but patients in nocandidate for cardiac catheterization assignment intravenous infusion group. 1. Have a baseline glomerular filtration rate &gt; 50 mL/min per 1.73 m2 2. Evidence of a lifethreatening arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or complete heart block) on screening ECG.. 3.

Have liver dysfunction , as evidenced by enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) &gt;3× the upper limits of normal. 5. Have a coagulopathy (international normalized ratio &gt; 1.3) not because of a reversible cause (ie, coumadin). 6. Have a contraindication to performance of CMRI (CMRIs will be performed in patients with pacemaker who are not pacemaker dependent). 7. Be an organ transplant recipient. 8. Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 y except curatively treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma. 9.
