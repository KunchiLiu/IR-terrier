	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on sensorial perception in lung cancer patients in comparison to a control group (individuals without lung cancer and chemotherapy treatment). We will use a longitudinal approach whereby 44 patients and 44 controls will be tested for olfactory and gustatory abilities before and after treatment (for patients) and for two sessions separated by the same duration for controls. Primary measure outcome will be to examine the impact of treatment on the perception of hedonic valence of odors. Secondary measure outcome will include odor and taste perceptual changes and questionnaires on eating habits and behaviors, in order to examine the impact of treatment on odor, taste and food perception.</brief_summary>
