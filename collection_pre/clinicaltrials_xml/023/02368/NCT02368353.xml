	<brief_summary>The first psychotic episodes are preceded by a pauci-symptomatic phase from 2 to 4 years during which the psychotic symptoms are present at a subliminal level in severity or in frequency. The clinical criteria "mental status with risk" (AR) identifies patients among whom 10 in 40 % will make a psychotic transition in the year. Our hypothesis is that interventions to reduce reactivity to stress are effective in reducing the intensity of psychotic symptoms in subjects with prodromal psychotic symptoms. Our project is to evaluate a therapy for stress management in at risk patients, compared to a conventional monitoring, and implement a longitudinal follow-up concerning the reduction of psychotic symptoms in conjunction with other markers of stress. Nonstigmatizing, these interventions offer an alternative to antipsychotics all the more interesting since they should also reduce the risk of depression and suicide.</brief_summary>
