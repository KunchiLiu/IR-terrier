	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress pathway is activated in peripheral tissues (adipose tissue) in insulin resistant diabetic patients compared to healthy subjects normoglycemic matched for age and sex an to investigate whether ER stress pathway can be activated in response to insulin. Indeed, some preliminar on rates studies shows that ER stress pathway is activated by insulin in liver and adipose tissue showing that hyperinsulinemia might help trigger stress path ER. For this, we propose a case control study of type 2 diabetic patients vs control subjects in which markers of ER stress will be evaluated from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemic. We chose to consider adipose tissue subcutaneous rather than visceral adipose tissue for obvious reasons of lesser invasiveness.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Specific criteria for diabetic patients: Having type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months HbA1c ≤ 8% Treated by lifestyle and dietary rules associated or not to a hypoglycemic therapy (metformin and / or sulfamid) and / or insulin secretors dependent glucose as inhibitors of DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase4): Vildagliptin, Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin No modification of hypoglycemic therapy and / or insulin secretors for at least 3 months Specific criteria for control subjects: Nondiabetic subjects (fasting blood glucose &lt;7.0 mmol / l without hypoglycemic treatment). The control subjects should be matched to patients for age (± 5 years), sex, and BMI (± 2 kg/m2).
