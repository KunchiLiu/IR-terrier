Subject has used any phototherapy (including laser), photochemotherapy or other forms of photo based therapy for the treatment of their psoriasis within 30 days prior to study start. Subject has used any systemic methotrexate, retinoids, systemic corticosteroids [including intralesional, intraarticular, and intramuscular corticosteroids], cyclosporine or analogous products within 90 days prior to study start. Subject has used any systemic biologic therapy (i.e., FDAapproved or experimental therapy) within five halflives of the biologic prior to study start.
