	<brief_summary>Mandibular osteoradionecrosis, despite its low incidence, remains being the most problematic and irreversible complication after head and neck radiotherapy with no medical treatment to limit or reduce symptoms. Different clinical trials have shown a significant scientific evidence that the treatment with pentoxifylline + tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment of the tissue fibrosis. This study proposes to use this drugs to determine if there is healing of mandibular osteoradionecrosis and/or a symptomatic improvement as well.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mandibular osteoradionecrosis which occurs after the use of radiation therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer remains being the most problematic and irreversible complication despite its low incidence with no medical treatment to limit or reduce symptoms. Clinical trials conducted to date have shown a significant scientific evidence that the treatment with pentoxifylline + tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment of the tissue fibrosis that have been irradiated based on the properties of this drugs in increased tissue oxygenation and their antioxidant effect. The aim of this study is to determine if there is a clinical improvement of mandibular osteoradionecrosis using Pentoxifylline in combination with Tocopherol as treatment because, currently, there is no effective treatment to achieve bone healing and/or a symptomatic improvement.</detailed_description>
