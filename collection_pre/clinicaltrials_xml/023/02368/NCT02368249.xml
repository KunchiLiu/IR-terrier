	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to address whether terlipressin improves the renal outcome after liver surgery. Therefore the investigators are planning to conduct a double-blinded randomized control trial. The investigators will randomize patients undergoing any kind of liver surgery and being at increased moderate to high risk for post-operative acute renal failure into a control group receiving post- operative a placebo or into a group receiving post-operatively terlipressin in combination with human albumin.</brief_summary>
