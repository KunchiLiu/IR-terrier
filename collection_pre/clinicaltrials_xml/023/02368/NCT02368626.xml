	<brief_summary>The need for cosmetic facial enhancement procedures with minimal down time and low risk has led to the development of methods for non-surgical skin rejuvenation. Various ablative lasers were developed, which remove the full skin surface in a controlled manner. However, the prolonged recovery and the significant risks prompted the development of fractional lasers which ablate the skin in a fractional manner, leaving untreated areas to improve healing process. In the past few years, fractional RF systems have been introduced that enable controlled skin resurfacing accompanied with dermal collagen remodeling. System using focused ultrasound , coagulating small volume of tissue in the dermis , have shown a lifting effect.8 Similar to these devices the EndyMed Proâ„¢ System with RF Micro-Needles handpiece (INTENSIF) enables fractional skin coagulation with dermal heating for the reduction of wrinkles together with a lifting effect.</brief_summary>
