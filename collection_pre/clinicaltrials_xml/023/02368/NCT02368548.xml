	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial of a Pharmaceutical Care Program in Chronic Patients Users of an Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial aimed to assess the impact of a pharmaceutical care program initiated in the Emergency Department vs standard care in patients with heart failure and/or COPD, conducted at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain) between Jan12-Feb13. The researchers hypothesize that a systematic, standardized pharmaceutical care program may be related to a lower frequency of drug related problems (DRP). Moreover, the investigators also hypothesize that 6-month mortality, the average length of the hospital stay, and its related cost may also be decreased. This study was approved by the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau Ethics Committee. Written informed consent will be obtained from the participants . The study will include 100 patients who fulfill all the inclusion criteria, described in the Eligibility Section.</detailed_description>
