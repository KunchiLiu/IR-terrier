	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of dose regimens of ALX-0061 administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) to subjects with active RA despite MTX therapy, compared with placebo. To assess the effects of ALX-0061 on quality of life, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of ALX-0061, and to define the optimal dose regimen for ALX-0061, based on safety and efficacy, for further clinical development.</brief_summary>
