	<brief_title>Atrial Appendage Closure Prospective Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be followed in an observational study. We propose to do a single follow-up TEE at 3 to 6 months (this is standard of care) to confirm LAA (left atrial appendage) occlusion. The TEE is not mandatory (this is not a clinical trial), but will be strongly recommended to patients to confirm the efficacy of treatment. This will help confirm whether patients may safely remain off anticoagulation. The risks of TEE are a less than 1 in 1000 risk of death, and a 1% or less risk of a major complication, such as esophageal perforation.</detailed_description>
