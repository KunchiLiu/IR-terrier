	<brief_summary>The investigators have developed a simple to use device that facilitates the monitoring of the upper eyelids motion, acquires the eyelid vertical movement and enables analysis and graphic presentation of the results. the device system consists 3 components : glasses for the patient including magneto sensitive probes, hardware and dedicated software. Our purpose is to characterize eyelid motion in normal population. The methods include measuring each patient 10 minutes during watching a short movie.</brief_summary>
