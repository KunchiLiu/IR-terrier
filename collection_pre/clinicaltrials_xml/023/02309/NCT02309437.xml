	<brief_title>Early Use of Opioid to Control Local Mucosa Pain Induced by Irradiation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is a prospective, randomizing, case-controlled, multi-center clinical trial. 174 firstly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who need radical radiation therapy will be randomly divided into either early intervention or common intervention group. OxyContin will be used to control the pain caused by radiation oral mucositis when the pain level is mild or moderate, respectively. Nutrition status, quality of life (QOL), and clinical outcomes are to be observed.</detailed_description>
