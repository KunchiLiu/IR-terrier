	<brief_summary>The aim of this split mouth study is to compare which method is better in reducing bone loss and healing times following implants. Specifically, the two methods investigated will be immediate gradual loading and early loading protocol. Research Hypothesis Immediate gradual loading using gingival formers is superior to early loading protocols in improving bone quality and thus reducing the healing time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the Secondary Stability of Dental Implants: Immediate Gradual Loading Versus Early Loading Protocol in Posterior Maxilla</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>These two methods (gradual loading and early loading) will both be used in implants patients with the aim to compare which protocol leads to a better outcome for the patient. A 'better outcome' is defined as the method, which leads to the least crestal bone loss, and the fastest healing time. Immediate gradually loaded side: will include transmucosal healing of dental implants using gingival formers which will be replaced every 2 weeks by consequent larger size gingival former.i.e. at surgery time the implants will receive 2 mm height gingival former which will be swapped by 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm and the last is 6 mm early loaded side: implants will be submerged from the surgery time till loading time (2 month).</detailed_description>
