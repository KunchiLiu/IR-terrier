	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, historical controlled, post-market study of patients requiring surgical repair of a focal articular cartilage lesion or osteochondral defect in the knee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EAGLE European Post Market Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BioMatrix CRD is a CE marked device that is intended to repair focal articular cartilage lesions or osteochondral defects in the knee. BioMatrix CRDâ„¢ is a sterile, biphasic, bioresorbable scaffold designed to aid in the repair of cartilage and subchondral bone. The device serves as a scaffold for cellular and extracellular matrix ingrowth supporting the regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone. The purpose of this post-market study is to confirm the safety and performance of the BioMatrix CRD for its intended use. Fifty (50) patients will be enrolled at up to 10 hospitals in Europe. Patients will be followed for 2 years post-operative to examine the rate of adverse events associated with the device, track improvement in knee pain and knee function over time, and assess the quality of repair tissue.</detailed_description>
