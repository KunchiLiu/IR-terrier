	<brief_title>Tissue Repair Device (VergenixTM STR) in Patients With Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VergenixTM STR device is an advanced Soft tissue repair device, made of lyophilized Type I rhCollagen and Calcium Chloride that will be mixed with autologous PRP prior to injection for the repair of non ruptured tendon injuries (Tendinopathy). Three (3) ml of the mixed solution will be injected into the common extensor tendon.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Man or woman aged 18 80 years old. 2. Clinical diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis based on site of pain, pain elicited with active extension of the wrist in pronation and elbow extension. 3. Documented ultrasonography diagnosis of common extensor tendinosis and possible tear based on abnormal echotexture (tendon thickening, anechoic areas, areas of hypoechogencicity, loss of fibrillar pattern). 4. Chronic symptoms (equal or greater than 3 months). 5. PRTEE questionnaire score of at least 50 out of 100. 6. For childbearing potential females, documentation of birth control. 7. Signing informed consent form. 1. Acute symptom onset (less than 3 months). 2. History of acute elbow trauma. 3. History of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 4. History of Inflammatory disease 5. History of Fibromyalgia 6. The patient has active malignant disease of any kind. A patient who has had a malignant disease in the past, was treated and is currently diseasefree for at least 5 years, may be considered for study entry. 7. The patient is treated with anticoagulant medication 8. The patient previously underwent a surgery for lateral epicondylitis. 9. The patient previously received local injections, including steroids within the last 30 days 10. Signs of other causes for lateral elbow pain (posterior interosseous nerve entrapment, osteochondral lesion). 11. Wounds around the elbow 12. Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigator, with maintaining followup. 13. Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology and blood chemistry lab tests at screening that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the patient's safety or participation in the study. 14. Known as positive HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. 15. Known history of a significant medical disorder, which in the investigator's judgment contraindicates the patient's participation. 16. Known hypersensitivity and/or allergy to collagen. 17. Drug or alcohol abuse (by history). 18. Pregnancy of childbearing potential females. 19. Participation in another study within 30 days prior to screening visit.</criteria>
