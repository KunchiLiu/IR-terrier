	<brief_summary>The purpose: to pilot whole-body MRI scanning in infants who are already getting brain MRI for suspected child abuse Research design: prospective, blinded reading of Whole-Body MRI (WB-MRI) images during the routine care of the hospitalized infant with comparison to routine radiographic skeletal survey images Procedures to be used: whole-body MRI images Risks and potential benefits: no additional risk (the infant will be receiving and MRI of their brain as part of routine care, the additional images will be obtained at the same time without additional sedation); benefits to the infant include the identification of injuries which would have otherwise been missed by routine care importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result: results from this study will potentially influence the use of radiographic skeletal survey and decrease the radiation exposure to infants being evaluated for suspected child abuse.</brief_summary>
