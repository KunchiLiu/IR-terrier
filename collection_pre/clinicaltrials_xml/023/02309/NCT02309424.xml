	<brief_summary>This open, randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study aims to investigate the effects of vinegar on glucose metabolism, endothelial function and circulating lipid levels in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes, using the arteriovenous difference technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Vinegar on Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in Subjects With Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with IGT or type 2 diabetes will be randomised to consume 20ml vinegar (6% acetic acid) or placebo before a mixed meal. Plasma samples will be taken for 300min from the radial artery and from a forearm vein for measurements of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol. Muscle blood flow will be measured with strain-gauge plethysmography. Glucose flux will be calculated as the arteriovenous difference of glucose multiplied by the blood flow rates.</detailed_description>
