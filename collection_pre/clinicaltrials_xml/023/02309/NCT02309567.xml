	<brief_summary>p53 is a tumor suppressor gene which plays an important role in controlling normal cell proliferation regulation that is located on the chromosome 17 (17p13.1). It is the most common goal of genetic alteration in many tumors. Serum p53 protein is presence in normal healthy individuals. However p53 antibody is extremely rare. Mutations in this gene cause an accumulation of non-functional proteins and development of anti-p53 antibodies, which can be detectable in tissues, slouhed cells, blood and other body fluids. Some studies have reported that, p53 mutations are highly common in leukemia, lymphoma, lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, bone, bladder, ovarian, and brain cancers. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths and the survey is low after the initial diagnosis. Accurate staging is important for determine the choice of treatment and predict prognosis. 18F-FDG PET/BT has important value for initial staging and it is the most advanced imaging technique developed all over the world for determine of the characterization of the metabolic tumor volume. Maksimum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) which was acquired by PET imaging is commonly used in clinical practice as a criterion for malignancy. Due to the development of new software programs recently studies have shown that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) may be useful quantitative parameters for the prognostic evaluation. Viable tumor volume could be estimate with this programs.The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between serum anti-p53 antibody level and quantitative PET parameters as SUVmax, SUVave, MTV and TLG.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patients who were referred to our department with the purpose of 18FFDG PET/CT imaging for staging due to lung cancer diagnosis patients who were performed 18FFDG PET/CT for diagnosis in the cause of the suspected pulmonary nodule/lesion in thorax CT but not detected pathologic FDG accumulation In the control group, healthy subjects with no history of cancer and without any complaint Patients had operated for lung cancer, received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for lung cancer, with no definitive histological diagnosis, and a blood glucose level greater than 150 mg/dL</criteria>
