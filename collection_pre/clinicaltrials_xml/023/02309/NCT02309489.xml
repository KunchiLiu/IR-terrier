	<brief_summary>The uptake of postpartum contraception, postpartum care attendance and the practice of exclusive breastfeeding are low in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the involvement of men in maternity care has been shown to be a promising strategy for the achievement of other reproductive health goals, little is known about the effect of their participation on these outcomes. This study aims to test whether the involvement of men can improve care-seeking and promote healthy behaviours among postpartum women in Burkina Faso.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Involving Men in Maternity Care in Burkina Faso</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a paucity of evidence on strategies to increase the uptake of postpartum contraception and attendance at facility-based postpartum care in developing countries, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is also a need to test new solutions to improve adherence to recommended infant feeding practices in these settings. Partner opposition is a major barrier to women's uptake of contraceptive methods in the postpartum period in Burkina Faso, and research has shown the need to sensitise and inform men about a broad range of topics related to reproductive health. However, the effect of involving male partners on women's and newborns' health and wellbeing in low-resource settings is not well known, and there is particularly little evidence for outcomes related to the postpartum period. The aim of this study is to assess whether male partner involvement in maternity care has the potential to increase care-seeking and promote healthy behaviours among postpartum women in an urban West-African setting. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to promote the involvement in maternity care of the partners of pregnant women attending primary health care facilities will be conducted in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. The intervention consists of three extra components in addition to standard maternity care: one extra couple counselling session during pregnancy (A), partner participation in a group education session for men (B), and partner participation in the pre-discharge consultation after birth (C). Women in the control group will receive standard maternity care only, in which men do not participate. A qualitative component will be carried out alongside the RCT, in order to examine the factors that may have determined the success, or lack thereof, of the intervention by reflecting on the experience of participants (women, partners , and health workers), and to explore their attitudes, beliefs and concerns relative to partner involvement in maternity care, through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The policy implications of the study findings will be assessed and, if appropriate, a strategy will be developed for their dissemination among policymakers and other stakeholders.</detailed_description>
