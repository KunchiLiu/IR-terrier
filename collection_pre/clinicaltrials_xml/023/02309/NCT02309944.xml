	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Gynecologic Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most gynecologic and many intra-abdominal malignancies are treated with an initial surgical procedure. There has been a dramatic increase in obesity rates in the US with more than one third of US adults being obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) of &gt; 30kg/m2). There is a direct link between obesity and wound complications following surgery with an increasing BMI leading to increasing rates of complications. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a system that utilizes sub-atmospheric pressure to improve wound healing by increasing the formation of granulation tissue. NPWT has been shown to improve outcomes in both the orthopedic and cardiothoracic surgery populations. To date, there is no prospective study evaluating the application of prophylactic NPWT in laparotomy patients. This study will be a randomized clinical trial. Patients will be enrolled at the time of consent for laparotomy for suspected gynecologic malignancy. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) Standard closure group (control arm): closure of the fascia, subcutaneous tissue and skin per the surgeon's standard method; or 2) NPWT group (study arm): closure of the fascia, subcutaneous tissue and skin per the surgeon's standard method + placement of a negative pressure wound therapy device over the closed incision for 2-3 days, with removal of the device prior to hospital discharge. The rate of wound complications for two groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
