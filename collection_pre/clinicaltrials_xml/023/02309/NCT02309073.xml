	<brief_summary>Background: Despite considerable progress in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART) maximum pregnancy rates generally do not exceed 30%. Furthermore, substantial differences in pregnancy rates are seen between women starting ART from seemingly similar clinical starting points and information on pregnancy/neonatal complications after ART is limited. For physicians and patients it would be extremely valuable if tools could be developed through which individualised chances of live birth and the development of pregnancy/neonatal complications can be calculated. In addition, there is increasing knowledge about health risks associated with subfertility and in particular with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure (POF). An important void in research to date is the absence of a control group to check important new findings. Objectives: The study protocol aims to form a cohort of normo-ovulatory women with a regular indication for ART which can aid the investigators principle lines of research: 1. To study initial predictors of ovarian response to stimulation for IVF 2. To study predictors of chances for live birth after repeated IVF cycles 3. To assess the role for vascular health in the probabilities of success in ART treatment 4. To study predictors for pregnancy and neonatal complications 5. To form a control group for cycle disturbance studies Study design: In this part of the protocol, serum and material for DNA analysis will be collected by asking patients to have 20 ml of blood drawn during a routine blood withdrawal. This blood will be stored in the Biobank of the UMC Utrecht at -80 C. Study population: All women starting ART will be asked to participate. Nature and extent of the burden and benefits associated with participation: There are no benefits or risks for the study patient as blood is withdrawn during a routine venapuncture and results will not be used for clinical practice.</brief_summary>
