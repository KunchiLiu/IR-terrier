	<brief_summary>Dendritic cells (DC) play a central role in the activation of T-cell responses and have shown to be very immunogenic in preclinical in vivo and in vitro assays. The aims of this study is to assess the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination pilot clinical trial in Genotype 1 HCV patients using autologous DC transduced with a recombinant adenovirus encoding NS3</brief_summary>
