	<brief_summary>When older patients develop cognitive problems - like memory loss - there may be any of several underlying causes, sometimes occurring in combination. Clinicians have a better chance of providing appropriate treatment if they understand what the cause of the problem is. A diagnostic tool can help the patient by helping the clinician to make a more accurate diagnosis. This study investigates whether a new diagnostic tool - beta amyloid imaging - may potentially improve medical practice. The tool can potentially improve practice only if it can influence clinical judgment. This study investigates whether the provision of beta amyloid imaging information influences clinical judgment. The investigators will conduct a survey that presents clinicians with descriptions of hypothetical older patients with cognitive complaints. Some of the respondents also receive beta amyloid imaging information. The investigators will test the investigators hypothesis that the information will affect diagnostic judgment and management recommendations by comparing the responses of clinicians who receive the beta amyloid information to the responses of clinicians who do not.</brief_summary>
