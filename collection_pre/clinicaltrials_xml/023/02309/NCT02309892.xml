	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate how safe, how well tolerated and how effective a range of doses of L-DOS47 in combination with standard doublet therapy of pemetrexed/carboplatin in patients with Stage IV (TNM M1a and M1b) recurrent or metastatic non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Study of L-DOS47 in Recurrent or Metastatic Non-Squamous NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is planned that patients will receive 4 cycles of combination treatment with L-DOS47 + pemetrexed/carboplatin. Patients who have not progressed following the 4 cycles of combination treatment and who have not experienced unacceptable toxicity will have the opportunity to continue to receive L-DOS47 treatment for as long as there is clinical benefit and it is well-tolerated, in the opinion of the Investigator, until disease progression. Patients who are unable to complete 4 cycles of L-DOS47 + pemetrexed/carboplatin combination treatment due to pemetrexed/carboplatin toxicity will have the opportunity to continue receiving L-DOS47 treatment following discontinuation of pemetrexed/carboplatin, for as long as there is clinical benefit and it is well-tolerated, in the opinion of the Investigator, until disease progression.</detailed_description>
