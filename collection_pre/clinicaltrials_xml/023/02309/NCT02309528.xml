	<brief_summary>Few educational intervention clinical trials have been conducted among those at risk for or with early chronic kidney disease. To the investigators' knowledge none have used digital storytelling as a means to deliver the educational message and have been conducted among American Indians, a group with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease. The aims of the research project are to: 1. Quantify levels of chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians. 2. Determine the effectiveness of a culturally tailored health presentation with computerized digital stories made by American Indians for improving chronic kidney disease knowledge and factors thought to be preventative of chronic kidney disease or its progression at baseline and follow-up in a pilot educational clinical intervention trial.</brief_summary>
