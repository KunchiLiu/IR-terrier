	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), inhibiting tyrosine kinase activation. It has been approved to treat squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in different countries. Currently, the registered clinical trials of Nimotuzumab combined with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer and glioma have been approved and are ongoing all over the investigators' country. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Nimotuzumab combined with Irinotecan in patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Study of Nimotuzumab in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-centered, non-randomized and open-labeled Clinical Pharmacokinetics Study of Nimotuzumab in patients with solid tumors. The test includes 3 dose groups, namely Single dose group, Multiple single-week dose group and Multiple bi week dose group, to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Nimotuzumab combined with Irinotecan in patients with solid tumors.</detailed_description>
