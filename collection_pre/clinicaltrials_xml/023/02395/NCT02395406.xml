	<brief_summary>Endotracheal intubation is usually required to allow unrestricted surgical approach. The Macintosh laryngoscope is the standard method. However in certain situations as difficult airway this technique is ineffective and poorly tolerated by the patient. Fiberoptic intubation is the gold standard in this scenario, however sometimes it is not possible due to failure or unavailability, so alternatives are needed. The TotalTrack (MedComflow SA, Barcelona, Spain) and the Airtraq (Prodol Meditec, Vizcaya, España) been designed specifically for the airway management. However, despite their use in clinical practice, there are no comparative studies.</brief_summary>
