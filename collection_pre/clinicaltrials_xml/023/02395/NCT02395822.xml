	<brief_summary>A phase II trial of CD3/CD19 depleted, IL-15 activated, donor natural killer (NK) cells in adults and subcutaneous IL-15 given after a preparative regimen for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The primary objective is to study the potential efficacy of NK cells and IL-15 to achieve complete remission while maintaining safety.</brief_summary>
