	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well methoxyamine works when added to standard temozolomide in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methoxyamine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methoxyamine and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the efficacy of TRC102 (methoxyamine) and temozolomide, as measured by response rate, in bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma. (Arm I) II. To estimate the efficacy of TRC102 and temozolomide, as measured by response rate, in bevacizumab refractory glioblastoma. (Arm II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxicities of oral TRC102 and temozolomide in this patient population. II. Estimate the efficacy of TRC102 and temozolomide, as measured by progression-free survival, progression-free survival at 6 months and overall survival, in bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma. III. Estimate the efficacy of TRC102 and temozolomide, as measured by progression-free survival in bevacizumab refractory glioblastoma. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the tissue correlates of N-methylpurine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) glycosylase (MPG), topoisomerase II-alpha (topo II a), and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, with response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive methoxyamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma that is progressive or recurrent following radiation therapy and temozolomide Tumor MGMT methylation status must be available; results of routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction [MSPCR ] or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are acceptable Arm 1 patients must have measurable (defined by at least 1 cm x 1 cm) contrastenhancing disease by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging within 21 days of starting treatment Patients must be able to undergo MRI of the brain with gadolinium; patients must be maintained on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroid regimen (no increase for 5 days) prior to this baseline MRI Arm 1 patients must be in first recurrence of glioblastoma following radiation therapy and temozolomide Arm 2 patients may have an unlimited number of prior therapy regimens but may not have received prior antiangiogenesis therapy except for bevacizumab (patients may not have received aflibercept, ramucirumab, cediranib, cabozantinib, or XL184) Arm 1 patients must have not received bevacizumab previously Arm 2 patients must have progressed/recurred on bevacizumab as the most recent regimen; patients on arm 2 should continue on bevacizumab as clinically necessary to control brain edema Patients must have a tumor tissue form indicating availability of archived tissue from initial resection at diagnosis of glioblastoma completed and signed by a pathologist; availability of tissue is not a requirement for study participation Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy; the following intervals from previous treatments are required to be eligible: 12 weeks from the completion of radiation 6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy 3 weeks from a nonnitrosourea chemotherapy 4 weeks from any investigational (not Food and Drug Administration [FDA]approved) agents 2 weeks from administration of a noncytotoxic, FDAapproved agent (e.g., erlotinib, hydroxychloroquine, etc.) Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 60% (i.e. the patient must be able to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others) Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Total bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 4 x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal Patients must be able to provide written informed consent Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to study start; women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and through 30 days after the last dose of study drug; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and through 30 days after the last dose of study drug Patients must have no concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or bladder; patients with prior malignancies must be diseasefree for &gt;= five years Patients must be able to swallow capsules Patients receiving any other investigational agents are ineligible Patient must not have known sensitivity to TRC102 or any formulation excipients Patients on enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; patients may be on nonenzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs or not be taking any antiepileptic drugs; patients previously treated with EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the first dose of TRC102 Patients must not be on any anticoagulation Patient must not have prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery or GI disease that might interfere with the absorption of TRC102 Patients who have not recovered to &lt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 toxicities related to prior therapy are ineligible Patients must not have active brain metastases from a systemic solid tumor Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, are ineligible Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with TRC102 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible</criteria>
