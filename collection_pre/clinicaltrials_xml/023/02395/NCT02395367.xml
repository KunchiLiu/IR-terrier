	<brief_title>A Prospective, Observational, Real-world Study Based on the Register System of Oral and Maxillofacial Malignant Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A register system of oral and maxillofacial malignant tumors based on a prospective, observational, real-world study in north Chinese population was absent. The aim of the study is to construct a register system of oral and maxillofacial malignant tumors based on a prospective, observational, real-world study in Chinese population. The variables in the study include social informatics, etiology, and psychological and quality of life, coexistence disease, baseline clinicopathological data, postoperative complications, and long-term follow-up results. By released annual analysis report, the epidemiological features and prognostic factors of oral and maxillofacial malignant tumors in north Chinese population can be identified.</detailed_description>
