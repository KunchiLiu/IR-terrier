	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Dual Action Pneumatic Compression System: Tolerance and Comfort in Patients With Venous Leg Ulcers (VLUs)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with a chronic venous leg ulcer will participate in a 2 week run in phase using standard of care multi-layer bandaging before receiving 4 weeks of treatment using a pneumatic compression device. Subjects will be seen in clinic weekly for an evaluation, complete symptom and quality of life questionnaires.</detailed_description>
