	<criteria>1. Patients with HCC must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 70, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks 2. GPC3 is expressed in HCC tissues by IHC. 3. Nondiffuse HCC with the presence of extrahepatic metastasis or portal vein vascular invasion. 4. The liver cirrhosis status should be ChildPugh A or B with a score equal to 7. 5. ECOG physical status score is equal to 01 or KPS score is higher than 80. 6. Enough venous access for apheresis or venous sampling and no contraindications to other blood cell separation 7. WBC≥2500/ml，PLT≥60×10^9/L，Hb≥9.0g/dL，LY≥0.7×10^9/L，LY%≥15%，Alb≥2.8g/dL， serum lipase and amylase＜1.5 ULN，serum creatinine≤2.5mg/dL，ALT and AST≤5 ULN，serum total bilirubin≤3.0mg/dL，PT:INR＜1.7 or PT beyond the normal value less than 4s. All laboratory test results should be in the stable range, and no persistent support treatment is given. 1. The transduction efficiency of the T cells is less than 30% or the amplification of the T cells via αCD3/CD28 stimulation is less than 5 times. 2. Pregnant or lactating women (the safety of the experimental treatment to the unborn baby is unknown; The pregnancy status of the female participants should be negative when her serum or urine is evaluated 48 hrs before infusion). 3. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses including those of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease. 4. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease). 5. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities). 6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity to any of the agents including cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin. 7. Steroid is now systemically used. 8. Prior treatment with any other gene therapeutics. 9. the past or present existence of hepatic encephalopathy 10. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding 11. Patients with a history of organ transplantation or are waiting for organ transplantation. 12. serum sodium＜125mmol/L 13. baseline serum K＜3.5mmol/L（The patients can be included when the serum K≧3.5mmol/L after supplementation） 14. patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin) 15. patients need longterm antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel at a dose &gt; 75mg/d) 16. Patients treated by radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior the first apheresis. 17. Patients using fludarabine or cladribine chemotherapy within two years</criteria>
