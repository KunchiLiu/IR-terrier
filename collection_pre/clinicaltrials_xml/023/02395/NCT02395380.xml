	<brief_summary>Colic and rectal resection represents a majority of hospitalizations in visceral surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic of inflammatory markers dosage (CRP, procalcitonin and venous lactate) on the postoperative recovery after colorectal surgery and on the length of stay.</brief_summary>
