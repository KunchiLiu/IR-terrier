	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Signed written informed consent before any trial related procedure Male or female subjects aged greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 years Availability of a formalinfixed, paraffinembedded block containing tumor tissue or 7 unstained tumor slides suitable for PDL1 expression assessment Tumor determined to be evaluable for PDL1 expression per the evaluation of a central laboratory Subjects with histologically confirmed Stage IIIb/IV or recurrent NSCLC who have experienced disease progression Subjects must have progressed after an acceptable therapy defined as follows: 1. Subjects must have progressed during or after a minimum of 2 cycles of 1 course of a platinum based combination therapy administered for the treatment of a metastatic disease. A history of continuation (use of a non platinum agent from initial combination) or switch (use of a different agent) maintenance therapy is permitted provided there was no progression after the initial combination. A switch of agents during treatment for the management of toxicities is also permitted provided there was no progression after the initial combination OR 2. Subjects must have progressed within 6 months of completion of a platinumbased adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive chemotherapy, or concomitant chemoradiation regimen for locally advanced disease Subjects with nonsquamous cell NSCLC of unknown epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status will require testing (local laboratory, or central laboratory if local testing is not available). Subjects with a tumor that harbors an activating EGFR mutation will not be eligible Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 1 at trial entry Estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks Adequate hematological function defined by White Blood Cell (WBC) count &gt;= 2.5 × 10^9/L with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 × 10^9/L, lymphocyte count &gt;=0.5 × 10^9/L, platelet count &gt;= 100 × 10^9/L, and hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (may have been transfused) Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) range and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels &lt;= 2.5 × ULN for all subjects Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 milliliter per minute (mL/min) according to the CockcroftGault formula (or local institutional standard method). Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply Exclusion criteria In the United States only, subjects with a squamous cell histology will be excluded Systemic anticancer therapy administered after disease progression during or following a platinum based combination Subjects with nonsquamous cell NSCLC whose disease harbors EGFR mutation(s) and/or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement will not be eligible for this trial. Subjects of unknown ALK and/or EGFR mutation status will require testing at screening (local laboratory, or central laboratory if local testing is not available) Prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting T cell coregulatory proteins (immune checkpoints) such as PD1, PD L1, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen4 (CTLA4). Concurrent anticancer treatment Major surgery for any reason, except diagnostic biopsy, within 4 weeks of randomization and/or if the subject has not fully recovered from the surgery within 4 weeks of randomization Subjects receiving immunosuppressive agents (such as steroids) for any reason should be tapered off these drugs before initiation of the trial treatment. All subjects with brain metastases, except those meeting the following criteria: 1. Brain metastases have been treated locally, and 2. No ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the disease Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agent: 1. Subjects with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo or hyperthyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible 2. Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at doses less than or equal to (&lt;=)10 milligram (mg) or equivalent prednisone per day 3. Administration of steroids through a route known to result in a minimal systemic exposure are acceptable Previous or ongoing administration of systemic steroids for the management of an acute allergic phenomenon is acceptable as long as it is anticipated that the administration of steroids will be completed in 14 days, or that the daily dose after 14 days will be &lt;=10 mg per day of equivalent prednisone Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply</criteria>
