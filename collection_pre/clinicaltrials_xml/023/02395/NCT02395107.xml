	<brief_summary>Aortic stenosis results in increased filling pressures of the heart. Size and function of the left atrium may be a marker for more advanced heart disease (heart failure) in patients with severe aortic stenosis, not presenting any apparent symptoms. The goal of this study is to establish the importance and possible implications of left atrial dilation in asymptomatic patients with aortic valve stenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Volume Index in Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease in the western world. Mild and moderate AS generally is well tolerated severe AS is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The consequence of AS is increased pressure load on the left ventricle, which causes changes in the ventricular function and structure (Left ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, fibrosis). With longstanding elevated filling pressures the left atrium will dilate and heart failure symptoms will develop. When apparent, symptoms of heart failure, in AS are associated with high mortality rate and aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended. The clinical assessment of heart failure symptoms in AS is however challenging particularly in the elderly, as symptoms progress slowly and may mimic age related fragility. In this observational study, the goal is to investigate the importance and possible implications of left atrial dilation and heart failure among 100 patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Participants undergo echocardiographic evaluation for diastolic heart failure and we assess myocardial fibrosis using magnetic resonance imaging and exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring (right heart catheterization). LA dilatation may potentially identify patients likely benefiting of early surgery. The importance and possible implications of LA dilatation in asymptomatic AS patients has however not yet been established.</detailed_description>
