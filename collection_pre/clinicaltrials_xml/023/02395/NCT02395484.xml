	<brief_summary>Constipation is a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease, influenced by a number of different genetic and environmental factors. By applying the standard two-stage GWAS strategy to design and carry out a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) to find the relationship between gut microbiota and constipation, to identify disease-associated metagenomic markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metagenome Analysis of Gut Microbiota in CC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a two-stage case-control metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) based on deep next-generation shotgun sequencing of DNA extracted from the stool samples from a total of 50 Chinese constipation patients and healthy controls.</detailed_description>
