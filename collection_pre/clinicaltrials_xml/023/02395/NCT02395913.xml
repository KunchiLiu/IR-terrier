	<brief_summary>Acebrophylline is metabolized by being separated into Ambroxol and 7-theophylline when orally administered as a salt composed of an acid-base as a compound that was synthesized by and chloride (salifying) the ambroxol to 7-theophylline. Acebrophylline is selectively applied to the bronchial or lung tissue and inhibit the activity of phospholipase bronchoalveolar shows the expectorant action to raise the surface activity of the alveolar, leukotrienes (LTs) and by suppressing the production of prostaglandins (PGs), showed potent anti-inflammatory activity, bronchial was celebrated by reducing the bronchial hyperreactivity to normal state is allowed to recuperate or extended. It was developed to improve compliance improve pharmaceutically Surfolase capsule(Acebrophylline 100mg) that intake twice daily 100mg to Surfolase CR(Acebrophylline 200mg) that intake once daily 200mg</brief_summary>
