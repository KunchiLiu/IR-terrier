	<brief_title>Cytosponge Adequacy Study Evaluation II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cross-sectional study of subjects with Barrett's esophagus (BE) to assess the utility of the Cytosponge device as a non-endoscopic method for collecting surface cells from the esophagus. This study will enroll 2 groups of subjects: 1) Subjects presenting for routine endoscopic BE surveillance examinations (n=120), and 2) Subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms undergoing upper endoscopy for screening for BE (n=55). After informed consent, and on the same day as the endoscopic procedure, the subject will undergo administration of the Cytosponge device and complete a questionnaire. The subject will then undergo routine upper endoscopy, with assessment of BE (where applicable), and biopsy per accepted surveillance or screening recommendations. The Cytosponge will be placed in fixative and shipped to an accredited pathology laboratory for embedding in paraffin and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining to assess the adequacy of the specimen. Further evaluation of the specimen may be performed using trefoil factor 3 (TFF3). If the Cytosponge tissue specimen is inadequate, the subject will be recalled for a repeat sponge procedure (not endoscopy) 30 days later. Routine care tissue biopsies will undergo standard processing and H&amp;E staining at the home institution, with assessment by expert gastrointestinal pathologists. Subjects will be contacted via phone 7 days (+/- 2 days) after Cytosponge administration to complete additional questionnaires and assess adverse events.</detailed_description>
