	<brief_summary>This phase II study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated proton beam therapy (PBT) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients in hepatitis B endemic area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Proton Beam Radiotherapy for Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is local progression free survival. The trial is a single arm phase II trial with the historical arm. The expected 3-year local progression free survival for patient with HCC patients treated with proton beam therapy would be 80%. With a power of 80% and a type I error level of 10%, evaluable 40 patients are required to reject that the null hypothesis that true 3-year local progression free survival rate is ≤65%. Considering the 10% unevaluable patients due to loss of follow up, a total 45 eligible patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosed as (i) the presence of risk factors including hepatitis B or C virus and liver cirrhosis, a serum afetoprotein (AFP) level greater than 200 IU/ml and a radiologically compatible feature with HCC in one or more CT/MRI/angiograms, or (ii) the presence of risk factors including hepatitis B or C virus and liver cirrhosis, a serum afetoprotein (AFP) level less than 200 IU/ml, and a radiologically compatible feature with HCC in two or more CT/MRI/angiograms or (iii) histological confirmation Inoperable HCC or refusal to surgery Recurrent/residual tumor after other local treatments (local ablation therapy, or transarterial chemoemobolization, etc), or unsuitable/refusal to other treatments. Patients without evidence of extrahepatic metastasis The largest diameter of tumor should be less than 7cm, and the number of tumor ≤2 The targeted tumors is more than 2cm away from the alimentary tract (i.e., stomach, duodenum, esophagus, small and large bowel) No previous treatment to target tumors by other forms of RT Liver function of ChildPugh class A or B7 (ChildPugh score of ≤7) Age of ≥18 years Performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score Required Entry Laboratory Parameters WBC count ≥ 1,500/mm3; hemoglobin level ≥ 7.5 g/dL; platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3; and adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL; AST and ALT &lt; 5.0× upper limit of normal; no uncontrolled ascites No serious comorbidities other than liver cirrhosis Signed informed consent form prior to study entry There is evidence of extrahepatic metastasis. Age of &lt;18 years Liver function of ChildPugh class B89 and C (ChildPugh score of &gt;7) Previous history of other forms of RT adjacent to target tumors Poor performance status of 2 to 4 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score Multicentric HCCs, except for those with the following two conditions: (i) multinodular aggregating HCC that could be encompassed by single clinical target volume and within single clinical target volume; (ii) lesions other than targeted tumor that were judged as controlled with prior surgery and/or local ablation therapy. Pregnant or breast feeding status Previous history uncontrolled other malignancies within 2 years</criteria>
