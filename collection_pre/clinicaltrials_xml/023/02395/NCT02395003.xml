	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether the reduced transcription of key lipogenic/adipogenic genes in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in obese adolescents with a High VAT/SAT (visceral adipose tissue/subcutaneous adipose tissue) ratio translates functionally into a reduced in vivo triglyceride (TG) synthesis and adipocyte proliferation, which in turn will contribute to ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance (IR). To test whether the storage capacity of gluteal SAT is linked to the level of VAT/SAT fat distribution in obese adolescents. To explore if changes in dietary fat intake (palmitate intake), alters ceramide concentration in both plasma and adipose tissue (AT) and the Inflammasome complex in the different fat distribution phenotypes and their associations with IR.</brief_summary>
