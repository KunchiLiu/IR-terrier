	<brief_summary>Objectives: Evaluate the effects of a rehabilitation program based on movement training on symptoms, functional limitations and acromiohumeral distance (AHD) in individuals with SPS. Methods: Twenty-five participants with SPS participated in a 6-week program. Outcomes of both groups were evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. Changes in symptoms and functional limitations were assessed. Changes in AHD for both groups were assessed using ultrasonographic measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Movement Training for Subacromial Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Multiple factors have been associated with the presence of a subacromial pain syndrome (SPS), including deficits in performance of scapular and glenohumeral muscles. Such deficits can lead to inadequate kinematics and decreased acromiohumeral distance (AHD). Exercises that aim at correcting these deficits, such as movement training, were suggested to improve symptoms and functional limitations. To date, few studies have assessed outcomes following an intervention focused on movement training. Objectives: Evaluate the effects of a rehabilitation program based on movement training on symptoms, functional limitations and AHD in individuals with SPS. Design: Prospective single group pre-post design. Methods: Twenty-five participants with SPS (SPS group) participated in a 6-week program. Twenty asymptomatic volunteers were recruited for normative AHD values (control group). Outcomes of both groups were evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks, i.e. immediately following intervention for the SPS group. Changes in symptoms and functional limitations for SPS group were assessed using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index (WORC) and Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH). Changes in AHD for both groups were assessed using ultrasonographic measures.</detailed_description>
