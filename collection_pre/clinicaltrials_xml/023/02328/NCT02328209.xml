	<brief_summary>Recently studies have shown that intravitreal injection of ranibizumab is effective for age related macular degeneration. However there are problems about injection regimen of maintenance phase. We plan to perform new simplified treat and extend regimen using ranibizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Simplified Treat And Extend Regimen Using Ranibizumab in Exudative Age Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the simplified treat and extend regimen using ranibizumab in eyes with wet age related macular degeneration about best-corrected visual acuity, central retinal thickness, the disappearance rate of the morphological change and treatment continuous rate.</detailed_description>
