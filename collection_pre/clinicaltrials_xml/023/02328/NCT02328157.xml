	<brief_summary>Toric intraocular lens (IOL) is now widely used for the cataract surgery with preoperative corneal astigmatism. Symptomatic epiretinal membrane (ERM) is often treated with 25-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy, resulting in good visual recovery. So far, however, limited information is available on the the stability of axis rotation, astigmatism correction, and improvement in uncorrected distance visual acuity, using astigmatism-correcting IOL in a 25-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery. In the current study, eyes with a preoperative corneal cylinder of more than 0.75 diopter had a triple procedure for idiopathic ERM using a toric IOL. Outcome measures will be the amount of IOL axis rotation, uncorrected visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, and corneal and refractive astigmatism up to 6 months postoperatively. We are expecting to show that postoperative IOL axis stability is similar to that reported for cataract surgery alone in vitrectomy (triple procedure) for idiopathic ERM with a toric IOL.</brief_summary>
