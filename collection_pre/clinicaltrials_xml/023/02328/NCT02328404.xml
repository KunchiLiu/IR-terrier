	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation Among Overweight Jordanian Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of 50,000 IU vitamin D supplementation once weekly for 3 months on improvement in PCOS prognosis and improvement in serum 25(OH)D levels in 60 overweight Jordanian females (defined as having a BMI 25-30kg/m2), diagnosed with PCOS (based on Rotterdam criteria), and with hypovitaminosis D (defined as a serum 25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/mL), compared with placebo. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the dosing regimen will be conducted over 6 study visits during which clinical and biochemical signs of PCOS as well as serum 25(OH)D level, serum chromium level, insulin resistance, and BMI will be evaluated. The measurements will be collected as follows : day (-7) during screening , Day (0) base line measurements , Day (30) , Day(60), Day (90), day (104).</detailed_description>
