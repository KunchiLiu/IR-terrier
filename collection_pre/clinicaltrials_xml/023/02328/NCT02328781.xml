	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy Vertebral Drug-eluting Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial utilizes the prospective, multicenter, single-arm target value trial design, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Firehorus vertebral artery rapamycin-target-eluting stent system (hereinafter referred to as Firehorus) in clinical use, for which 5 (or more) institutions will be selected as Clinical Trial Centre.Subjects will be screened in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the this protocol and will be treated with Firehorus. Immediate stent implantation success rate of all subjects after surgery will be recorded, DSA angiographic follow-up will be performed at six months (±30 days) after surgery to assess the incidence of stent restenosis ( stenosis ≥ 50%) of the subjects, and the subjects will be followed up at 30 days (±7 days), 6 months (± 30 days), 12 months (± 30 days) after surgery for long-term clinical follow-up, so as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Firehorus in clinical use. The expected participating duration of each subject from enrollment to complete the follow-up is 12 months (± 30 days).</detailed_description>
