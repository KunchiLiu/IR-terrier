	<brief_title>Impact of Physical Activity on Biomarker of Aging and Body Composition Among Breast Cancer Survivors Age 65 and Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LCCC1410 is designed to compare the change in p16 from baseline to end of chemotherapy in 100 older (â‰¥ 65 years) breast cancer patients participating in a home-based physical activity program (intervention group) to 100 patients in the concurrent control group not participating in a physical activity intervention (enrolled in a separate RO1 study as described in section 1.7). The biomarker p16 is known to dramatically increase with chemotherapy, and we hypothesize that the increase will be attenuated by a physical activity intervention. We will evaluate changes in p16 between the two study populations. Data from the geriatric assessment at baseline will be used to characterize the study population, and subscale scores from the GA will also be assessed for differences between baseline and end of chemotherapy to compare the LCCC1410 study population with the concurrent control.</detailed_description>
