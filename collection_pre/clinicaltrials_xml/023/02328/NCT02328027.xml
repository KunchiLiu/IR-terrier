	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are: Primary objective: - To determine the safety and tolerability of medical imaging with 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 Secondary objectives: - To determine the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry of 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 - To demonstrate the time-dependant distribution and localization of 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 both in RA and AS patients - To determine ability of early imaging with 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 to evaluate the presence of lesions before and after short term treatment of either RA or AS patients. Study hypothesis: 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 could be used as an adjunct for the diagnosis of early stage rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and for the assessment of response to treatment of these diseases.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosed with RA based on ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria (score &gt;=6), or Patients diagnosed with AS based on the ASAS criteria. Patients with RA must have serology assessment performed and documented at the time of enrollment. Patient with RA active disease (DAS &gt; 2,6) and the introduction of a BiDMARD should be indicated. RA patients must have been treated with DMARD (methotrexate, leflunomide and sulfasalazine) or combination of these treatments for at least 3 months. Treatment will be pursued while on study. or RA patients must have been previously treated with BiDMARD before initiation of the new BiDMARD treatment. The nonresponse of the previous BiDMARD treatment must be documented. or Patients with AS with insufficiently controlled disease while under NSAID and indication for BiDMARD. These patients must be under NSAID for at least 3 months and under the same NSAID for at least 1 month prior to enrollment. ≥ 18 years old Karnofsky ≥ 80% Negative Pregnancy test for women with childbearing potential For women with childbearing potential, use of two reliable means of contraception (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, intrauterine device, associated with other barrier method of contraception such as the use of condoms) , throughout their participation in the study Absence of ECG anomaly written ICF signed Pregnancy or lactation Liver impairment (ALT, AST or Bilirubin &gt; 2 ULN) at screening visit or baseline Kidney impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL) History of congestive heart failure (NYHA III &amp; IV) History of malignant disease within 5 years History of any disease or relevant physical or psychiatric condition or abnormal physical finding which may interfere with the study objectives at the investigator judgment Known hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or any of its components Participation to another clinical trial within 4 weeks before study inclusion except for patients who have participated or who are currently participating in an interventional study without any study drug administration.</criteria>
