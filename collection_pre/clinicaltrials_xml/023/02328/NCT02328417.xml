	<brief_title>Enhanced Recovery After Radical Cystectomy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective non randomized study of two cohorts, one defined by the usual protocol and the other one by the application of accelerated recovery protocol. It's discarded a priori a prospective randomized trial, since it does not seem feasible to avoid byass of control group when synchronizing the active intervention and control. Subjects surgery will be followed after discharge for a minimum of 90 days, and thereafter according to protocol of each center. Patients will be provided with a satisfaction survey 90 days after surgery. The degree of compliance with the protocol will be assessed through a checklist indicating compliance with each of the steps of the protocol in both groups. All patients will sign an informed consent for the study authorizing the use of their clinical data for statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
