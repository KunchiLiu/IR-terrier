	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy (LASH) for benign uterine lesion has regained its popularity in the past decade due to its minimal invasiveness that results in less operation time, less blood loss and quicker return to normal activity. The standard surgical procedure in LASH includes separation of adnexa and round ligament from pelvic sidewall or uterus, dissection of the vesico-uterine peritoneum and opening of the paravesical space; followed by amputation of the uterus with energy-producing modalities (such as Harmonic Scalpel, monopolar electrocautery, bipolar electrocautery). Large uteri may result in longer operative time and higher possibility of conversion to laparotomy due to technical difficulty and excessive blood loss. In order to overcome these difficulties, we introduce a modified surgical technique of LASH which incorporated two methods of vessels ligation and laparoscopic in situ morcellation.</brief_summary>
