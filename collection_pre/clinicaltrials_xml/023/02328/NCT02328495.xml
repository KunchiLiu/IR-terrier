	<brief_title>Misoprostol Versus Uterine Striating by Bladder Filling for Pain Relief During Office Hysteroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies revealed that cervical ripening with misoprostol is effective in reducing pain especially in postmenopausal patients. A recent randomized controlled trial revealed that uterine striating by bladder filling prior to office hysteroscopy is associated with reduced pain perception and easier introduction of hysteroscope through the cervix. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of misoprostol versus uterine straightening by bladder filling for pain relief in menopausal patients undergoing office hysteroscopy.</detailed_description>
