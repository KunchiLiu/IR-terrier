	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Specific IgE Levels to Common Foods and Aeroallergens Measured by EUROIMMUN Allergy and ImmunoCap</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children aged 0-15 years old who was diagnosed as asthma and/or allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and underwent to measured specific IgE levels to suspicious relevant allergen, were invited to join the study. Specific IgE levels of each patient was measured by EUROIMMUN Allergy and ImmunoCap. The levels of specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, American cockroach, Bermuda, Johnson, Cat dander, Cow's milk, Egg white and wheat were determined the correlation between these two methods.</detailed_description>
