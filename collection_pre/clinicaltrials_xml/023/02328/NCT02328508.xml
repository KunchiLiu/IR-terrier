	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE - This study evaluated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on wound healing, inflammation index, glycemic control, amputation rate, survival rate of tissue, bacterial wound cultures, and quality of life (QOL) in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This study was a randomized, single-center clinical trial. The effects of HBOT on patients in the experimental group were compared with the control group received only routine care. HBOT was carried out in a hyperbaric chamber for 120-min per session, five days a week for four consecutive weeks (20 treatment sessions). Data were collected at 4 segments: pre-treatment (before first administration of HBOT; T1), during treatment (at the tenth administration of HBOT; T2), post-treatment (at the twentieth administration of HBOT; T3), and treatment follow-up (two weeks after the last therapy ended; T4).</detailed_description>
