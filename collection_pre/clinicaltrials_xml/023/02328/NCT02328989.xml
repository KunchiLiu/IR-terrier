	<brief_summary>For 25 years, the twin pregnancy rate has regularly increased in the majority of European countries and in the United States, by 35% between 1981 and 2006. Increased use of medically assisted procreation and older maternal age are the two main causes. At the present time twin pregnancies represent nearly 20% of premature deliveries. The rate of very premature births (&lt; 32-34 weeks) is 7 times higher in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. As prematurity accounts for 75% of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and extreme prematurity is the principal cause of neonatal mortality and of brain sequelae in twins, the search for a preventive treatment appears as a priority in perinatal medicine. The investigators recently showed in a prospective multicenter study that cervical ultrasound at 22 and 27 wks was a better predictive investigation of premature delivery &lt; 34 wks than digital examination. Recently in a randomized trial in a population of short-cervix singleton pregnancies, the premature delivery rate decreased by 40% in the pessary group compared with the usual management group. No other trial of pessary use in short-cervix twin pregnancies was published today. Recently, in a historical comparison of twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome treated with laser, Carreras et al. have showed a decreased rate of preterm delivery with the use of pessary in case of short cervix. The investigators wish to set up a randomized multicenter study in France in the population of short-cervix twin pregnancies to show a potential benefit of the pessary compared with simple surveillance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For 25 years, the twin pregnancy rate has regularly increased in the majority of European countries and in the United States, by 35% between 1981 and 2006. Increased use of medically assisted procreation and older maternal age are the two main causes. At the present time twin pregnancies represent nearly 20% of premature deliveries.

The investigators recently showed in a prospective multicenter study that cervical ultrasound at 22 and 27 wks was a better predictive investigation of premature delivery &lt; 34 wks than digital examination.[1] As there is currently no recommended preventive treatment for prematurity in twin pregnancies[2], the 2009 guidelines of the College of Obstetricians leave the teams with the option of carrying out systematic cervical ultrasound or not during follow-up investigations.[3] Recently in a randomized trial in a population of short-cervix singleton pregnancies, the premature delivery rate decreased by 40% in the pessary group compared with the usual management group.[4] In a recent multicenter trial (ProTWIN), while therapeutic efficacy of the pessary (versus usual management) was not demonstrated in the overall group of twin pregnancies, in the short-cervix subgroup (&lt; 25th percentile of the population) the &lt; 32 wks delivery rate decreased from 29% to 14% (OR= 0.49 (0.24-0.97) and neonatal morbidity also decreased.[5] No other trial of pessary use in short-cervix twin pregnancies was published today. Recently, in a historical comparison of twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome treated with laser, Carreras et al. have showed a decreased rate of preterm delivery with the use of pessary in case of short cervix.[6] The investigators wish to set up a randomized multicenter study in France in the population of short-cervix twin pregnancies to show a potential benefit of the pessary compared with simple surveillance.</detailed_description>
