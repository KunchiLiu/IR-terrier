	<brief_title>Laser Therapy for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a course of laser therapy on peripheral neuropathic pain in persons with diabetes. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-months followup, and the study will consist of two treatment arms, including: (a) twice-per-week laser treatment for 4 weeks and once-per-week laser treatment for 8 weeks or (b) same treatment schedule sham (or placebo) for 12 weeks. Additionally, the study will examine inflammatory markers, functional status, and quality of life. Specific Aim 1. Change from baseline in self-reported pain in a sample of adults with diabetes at their last visit and at 3 months. Hypothesis 1: The laser therapy will produce significant improvement at post-intervention and three-month followup on measures of self-reported pain among adults with diabetes. Specific Aim 2: Decrease biochemical markers of inflammation by investigating levels of cytokines. Hypothesis 2: The laser therapy will produce significant improvement at post-intervention and three-month followup on levels of inflammatory markers.Specific Aim 3: Improve quality of life. Hypothesis 3: The laser therapy will produce significant improvement at post-intervention and three-month followup on quality of life.No substantial psychological, medical, or social risks exist to the participants, other than minor discomfort associated with the venipuncture. Although all measures to protect confidentiality will be put in place, the possibility exists that electronic data could be jeopardized. In the remote case that such event occurs, it will be immediately reported to the IRB.The proper use of the LiteCure LightForce FX Therapy Laser class IV laser therapy device should be harmless and presents no different risks than similar laser therapy devices currently on the market. At the time of this submission, no serious adverse events have been reported to the company or the regulatory authority by consumers. All study personnel will complete detailed training in the use of the device and will follow the directions of the manufacturer for operating the device; all instructions for use of the device will be followed for each subject. As reported by LiteCure Medical the LiteCure LightForce FX therapy laser device has been cleared by the FDA, tested according IEC electrical safety standards for medical devices, and manufactured in an ISO13485 compliant facility. These certifications ensure that LiteCure Medical devices are manufactured in state of the art facilities, under strict quality control, and environmental protection standards. Participants will incur no additional appreciable psychological or social risks by participating in this study. The process of interviewing during the assessment may cause discomfort. Discomfort or fatigue may also be experienced in completing the assessment battery. The information obtained in this study will help in determining the efficacy of using a class IV laser therapy device for neuropathic pain, inflammation, and quality of life in persons with diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy. By participating in the study, subjects may feel less pain, have lower inflammation, and experience improved quality of life. The minimal risk of participating in this study is reasonable because of the potential benefit gained in pain status, inflammatory status, and quality of life.</detailed_description>
