	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of daily sacral root magnetic stimulation for 10 sessions in patients with nocturnal enuresis.Eligible patients were randomized to receive either real or sham repetitive sacral root magnetic stimulation (rSMS; 15 Hz with a total of 1500 pulses/session) for 10 sessions. Evaluation was performed before starting treatment, immediately after the 5th and 10th treatment session, and 1 month later, using frequency of enuresis/week, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Quality of life. Cortical excitability of upper and lower limbs were done before and after the end of sessions.</brief_summary>
