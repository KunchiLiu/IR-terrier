	<detailed_description>Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined from demographic information, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests within 4 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study will be admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Urine collection is scheduled drug 12 hour before and 24 hour after midazolam administration. Subjects will be dosed study drug via intravenous around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects performed scheduled procedures. In period 2, Subjects will be admitted on Day 3-5. Subjects performed scheduled period 2 (Itraconazole co-administration phase, 2 times administration of itraconazole 200 mg), and period 3 (rifampicin 150 mg co-administration phase) procedure. Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 23~35).</detailed_description>
