	<brief_summary>Failed fusion and failure to relieve back pain following spinal fusion are still frequent, irrespective of the type of procedures or grafts used by the surgeon. Moreover, revision surgeries are unfortunately associated with higher procedure-related complication rates, technical difficulties, longer operative time, and quite disappointing and unreliable success rates for both fusion and clinical results. The present Phase 2a study aims at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ALLOBÂ®, a proprietary population of allogeneic osteoblastic cells, in rescue interbody fusion.</brief_summary>
