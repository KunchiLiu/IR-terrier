	<brief_summary>Previously, 4 investigators conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT) at their own site to evaluate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared to medical/lifestyle management of type 2 diabetes. Each study followed subjects for a duration of about 1 - 3 years. The aim of this study is to combine data from the 4 studies and continue to follow the original randomized subjects for an additional 2 years of follow-up. The purpose of the study is to determine the longer term durability and effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared to medical/lifestyle intervention on the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
