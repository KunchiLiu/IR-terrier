	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how well SmartTarget guided prostate biopsies perform, compared with our current standard of "visually directed biopsies" in the detection of prostate cancer. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is dependent upon sampling the prostate to confirm disease. Standard trans-rectal biopsies are taken in a random fashion, without prior knowledge of the disease location. Transperineal mapping biopsies overcome this by systematically samples the entire gland but are very intensive and time consuming to perform. An alternative method is to perform targeted prostate biopsies where an MRI prior to biopsy can be used to inform doctors about the location of the disease. This is a difficult procedure to perform as it requires the surgeon to mentally translate the location of disease on MRI image to the live ultrasound seen in theatre. SmartTarget may help this procedure by providing guidance to the location of the disease by fusing the MRI image onto the live ultrasound, thereby providing the clinician a target to biopsy. This trial will compare the outcomes of "visually directed biopsies" with those directed by SmartTarget</brief_summary>
