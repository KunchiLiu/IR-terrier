	<brief_summary>Subjects were randomly placed in five groups: (1) single exposure at 5째C in cold water immersion, (2) single exposure at 15째C in cold water immersion, (3) multiple exposures at 10째C in cold water immersion, (4) whole body cryotherapy (WBC) at 110째C and (5) passive recovery (control group). The single exposure groups performed cold water immersion immediately after exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) for 20 minutes. The multiple exposures group performed cold water immersion immediately, 24h, 48h and 72h after EIMD (once a day) for 20 minutes. The WBC group remained in the cabin immediately after EIMD for 3 min. The control group was not exposed to treatment after the EIMD protocol. The subjects were asked to visit the laboratory on seven occasions. The first visit was the familiarization of the subjects with experimental procedures and their anthropometric assessment. One week after familiarization, on visit two, volunteers performed the exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) protocol and they were allocated to one of experimental groups. Indirect markers of muscle damage and inflammatory responses were evaluated at baseline (pre), immediately post, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, and 168h following the EIMD protocol by measuring anterior thigh muscle swelling, isometric knee extensors peak torque, knee extensors muscle soreness, countermovement vertical jump and blood sample analyzes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To avoid circadian influences, subjects were asked to visit the laboratory always at the same time of day. Volunteers were asked to not perform any vigorous physical activities or unaccustomed exercise during the experiment period. In addition, they were instructed not to intake medications or supplements during the study.</detailed_description>
