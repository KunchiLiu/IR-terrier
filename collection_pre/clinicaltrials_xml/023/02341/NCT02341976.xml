	<brief_title>Whole Body Vibration Training for Pelvic Floor Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence is a common problem due to a weak pelvic floor muscle associated with decrease quality of life. The vibration exercises have been associated with improvements of the muscle component. Due to this, some researches have proposed that this technique could be applied to weak pelvic floor. However, it is unknown which vibration trainings have the highest impact on the pelvic floor muscle and urinary sphincter, more objectives studies to validate these data are necessary. The purpose of our research is to evaluate the activity in the urinary sphincter and the pelvic floor muscle by vibratory platform training in women. Subjects will be recruited, criteria exclusion will be evaluated, age, and BMI will be recorded. Each subject will exercise on the vibratory platform in 3 different positions, each one with 2 different frequencies and 1 minute each position and frequency. Pelvic electromyography (EMG) will assess the activity of the urinary sphincter and pelvic floor muscle with vibratory exercise. Data will be collected during all procedures. According to our purpose and anticipating the impact of this research extrapolating whole body vibration (WBV) training as program to improve the strength of the pelvic floor muscle elaborating a guided plan to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients suffering from urinary incontinence with this new nonsurgical treatment approach to women with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence, as well as this research allow us to increase our knowledge in urinary continence and the pelvic floor.</detailed_description>
