	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the study was to characterize and quantify the histopathological changes in the surgical specimens obtained in patients undergoing prostatectomy in addition to imaging changes (MRI) following a single injection of Liproca Depot in patients with localized prostate cancer. The secondary aims ere to evaluate efficacy and safety of a single injection of Liproca Depot, and to follow the pharmacokinetic profile.</detailed_description>
