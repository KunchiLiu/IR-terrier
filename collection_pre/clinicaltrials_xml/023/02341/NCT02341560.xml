	<brief_summary>This study will determine the effect of QPI-1007 on visual function in subjects with recent-onset NAION and assess the safety and tolerability of intravitreal injections of QPI-1007 in this population. This study will also evaluate the structural changes in the retina following administration of QPI-1007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2/3, Randomized, Double-Masked, Sham-Controlled Trial of QPI-1007 in Subjects With Acute Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double masked, randomized, sham-controlled efficacy and safety study that will enroll approximately 530 subjects with recent-onset NAION. Subjects will be randomized into one of 5 groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio, and assigned to receive QPI-1007 and/or a sham procedure. Subjects will have a one in five (20%) chance of receiving sham procedure (no active treatment). Total study time involvement is approximately 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Positive diagnosis of first episode of NAION in the study eye with symptom onset within 14 days prior to planned study drug administration/sham procedure Best corrected visual acuity score in the study eye is better than or equal to 15 letter score, measured using the ETDRS visual acuity protocol at Day 1 prior to study drug administration/sham procedure. Clear ocular media and able to undergo adequate pupil dilation to allow a good fundus examination Key Present use or history of any treatment for the current episode of NAION, including systemic steroids, brimonidine, or traditional Chinese herbal medicine Prior episode of NAION in the study eye only Present use of drugs known to cause optic nerve or retinal toxicity at Day 1/Randomization, such as: chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, ethambutol, Vigabatrin. Subjects who need to be prescribed any of these drugs during the course of the study will be discontinued from the trial. Any medical condition, concomitant therapy, or previous incisional or laser surgery that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude IVT injection in the study eye only Clinical evidence of temporal arteritis</criteria>
