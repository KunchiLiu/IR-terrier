	<brief_title>Safety and Dose Escalation Study of AAV2-hCHM in Subjects With CHM (Choroideremia) Gene Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of subretinal administration of AAV2-hCHM, in an inter-subject group dose escalation in individuals with choroideremia, based on a comprehensive clinical monitoring plan. The secondary objectives are to define the dose of AAV2-hCHM required to achieve stable, or improved, visual function/functional vision and to assess development of immune responses to AAV2 and REP-1.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male at least 18 years of age diagnosed with CHM gene mutation Central visual field (VF) &lt; 30° in any of the 24 meridians (using Goldmann perimetry III4e isopter) in the eye to be injected Any evidence of functioning outer retinal cells within the central 10° Previous history of ocular inflammatory disease (uveitis) Prior intraocular surgery within six months Participation in a previous gene therapy research trial within one year of enrollment or participation in any other ocular gene therapy trial Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the past six months Grossly asymmetrical disease, or other eye morbidity, which may render the contralateral eye ineffective as a control Visual acuity &lt; 20/200 on standard ETDRS testing in the eye to be injected Presence of disease which may preclude the subject from participation in this trial Use of medications known to be neuroprotective or retinotoxic that could potentially interfere with the disease process and/or cause ocular adverse events; individuals who discontinue use of these compounds for 6 months may become eligible Identification by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to perform / be compliant with study procedures.</criteria>
