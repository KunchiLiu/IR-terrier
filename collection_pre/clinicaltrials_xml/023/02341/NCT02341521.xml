	<brief_summary>An open label study in 9 male and 9 female healthy subjects to determine the pharmacokinetics of parent compound and metabolite after eight days of dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Metabolic Profile of OC000459</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include 9 male and 9 female healthy subjects. Following informed consent and satisfactory screening, each will be dosed for seven consecutive days on an outpatient basis with OC000459 50 mg daily taken before breakfast. On the seventh day, subjects will report to the clinical unit. Following an overnight fast, blood samples will be drawn for baseline safety and pharmacokinetic measurements and a urine specimen will be obtained for urinalysis and baseline metabolite measurements and subjects will be dosed with 50 mg OC000459. Blood samples will then be drawn at selected intervals for 120 hours post dosing and will be analysed for OC000459 parent compound and its metabolite. Urine collections will be obtained over the same period to determine the excretion of the metabolite and parent compound in urine.</detailed_description>
