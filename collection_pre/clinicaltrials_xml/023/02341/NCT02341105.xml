	<brief_summary>Randomized trial of low-dose amiodarone therapy versus catheter ablation (CA) in older patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Primary Objective: To compare amiodarone to catheter ablation in patients aged 50 to 80 years with symptomatic AF for the composite outcome of hospitalization for cardiovascular cause or emergency department visit for atrial arrhythmia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMIOdarone vs. Catheter Ablation for Prevention of Recurrent Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single centre vanguard phase prospective randomized open label study with blinded outcome adjudication. Patients will be randomized by a central randomization system (1:1) to amiodarone or catheter ablation. 1. Amiodarone will be started at a dose of 400 mg/day. After one month the dose will be lowered to 200 mg per day. Patients will be seen every six months. At each visit the dose of amiodarone will be lowered by 100 mg per week if the patient is having a good clinical response to treatment. Good clinical response will be a a clinical assessment that takes into account not only actual or possible arrhythmia recurrence but also side-effects and patient acceptability of treatment. A minimum dose of 700 mg/week will be allowed. If patient symptoms recur, the amiodarone dose may be increased but not above a dose of 200 mg/day . 2. Catheter ablation of persistent AF will be done within two months using pulmonary vein isolation in all subjects 3. Patient not in sinus rhythm at time randomization will undergo DC cardioversion after at least 1 month of amiodarone Rx or during CA. Follow up: Clinical assessment will include a medical history and physical examination to be performed at baseline, and every 3 months. This will also include 12-lead ECG. b. At 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months: QOL questionnaire (AFEQT- Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of life) c. Thyroid and liver function tests, chest X-ray will be obtained at regular intervals. d. Arrhythmia will be monitored using a 2-week event monitors at 6, 12, 18, 24 months.</detailed_description>
