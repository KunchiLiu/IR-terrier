	<brief_summary>To evaluate the contribution of the assessment of endothelial dysfunction (ED) in improving coronary hearth disease (CHD) risk stratification obtained by the Framingham risk score (FRS) in rheumatoid arthritis population (RA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endothelial Dysfunction Evaluation for Coronary Heart Disease Risk Estimation in Rheumatoid Arthritis (EDRA Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ED, determined by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), will be evaluated at baseline in 3000 RA patients free of previous cardiovascular events. Incident CHD events during the 3-year planned follow-up will be registered. A measure of the incremental yield of ED will be obtained comparing 2-year Framingham risk score for CHD (FRS) and FRS plus ED differential prognostic performances by C-statics and risk reclassification analysis.</detailed_description>
