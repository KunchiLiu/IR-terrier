	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to test the effectiveness of warm gel gloves in reducing the time it takes individuals to fall asleep (sleep latency). The investigators will have subjects track their sleep for two-weeks using both sleep logs and a small wristwatch-like monitor called an actigraph to measure the degree of the persons' difficulty falling asleep. It must take at least 30-minutes to fall asleep 3-days per week to qualify for the study. If a subject qualifies, they will wear the heated gel gloves or a placebo non-heated gel glove during sleep for two-weeks and sleep will be measured again using sleep logs and actigraphy. The baseline sleep latency data will be compared to the treatment period using a independent t-test. The investigators believe that wearing the warm gel gloves will reduce sleep latency.</brief_summary>
