	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare an enhanced intervention that includes narrative and game components to a standard intervention that only targets self-monitoring. These approaches will be tested among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who are sedentary and overweight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-monitoring Activity: a Randomized Trial of Game-oriented Applications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Habitual physical activity decreases risk of multiple negative health outcomes, including breast cancer recurrence and mortality. It is also associated with better quality of life and reducing negative effects of cancer and cancer treatment. However, most breast cancer survivors do not engage in sufficient physical activity. Behavior change interventions produce short-term increases in activity but have difficulty motivating sustained active lifestyles over longer periods and are not equally effective in women of different races/ethnicities. The purpose of this study is to test a novel intervention that uses video games and storytelling to increase motivation. Video game mechanics increase enjoyment and feelings of autonomy (control), competence, and relatedness to others. All of these feelings are associated with motivation for activity and, in turn, sustained activity over time. Additionally, narrative storytelling is an effective method of persuading individuals to change their behavior. We propose that play of active video games that include compelling storylines will increase physical activity among a diverse sample of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a clinical trial that compares the enhanced intervention (story-based video games) to a standard intervention in 90 sedentary, overweight postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Participants in the enhanced group will receive a mobile device and accessories with two story-based video game applications installed. The games incorporate behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring and feedback while also using game mechanics and a lengthy storyline to motivate physical activity. Participants in the standard group will receive the same mobile device with an electronic activity monitor and its companion feedback application. Both groups will receive brief weekly telephone counseling. By comparing two groups that both receive typical behavior change intervention components (counseling) and a novel electronic intervention, we will be able to investigate the specific effects of game mechanics and storytelling on motivation and physical activity. We will measure changes in physical activity, fitness, function, and quality of life from the beginning of the study to 6 months. We will also investigate further changes during an additional 6 month follow-up period in which participants keep their intervention tools but do not receive any counseling, to measure maintenance of activity. This project will develop and test a promising, innovative intervention that has the potential to be used on a widespread basis in clinical and community settings.</detailed_description>
