	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the this study is to evaluate the safety of TissueGene-C, a gene therapy product that uses allogenic human chondrocytes expressing Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-Î²1 by assessing the inflammation at the injection site, the incidence and severity of the adverse events, the physical examination findings, and the laboratory test results after the intra-articular injection of TissueGene-C. And Secondary purpose is to evaluate the biological efficacy (knee pain, range of motion, functional tests, and MRI) of TissueGene-C and the distribution of TissueGene-C outside the injection site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Biological Efficacy Study of TisssueGene-C to Degenerative Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of normal chondrocyte cells and transduced chondrocyte cells that express growth factor to modify osteoarthritis symptom for long term period. During clinical trial Phase 1, we compare three different dose levels of TisssueGene-C in 6 months with 12 outpatients with degenerative arthritis. The patients are randomized by three different dose levels of TisssueGene-C in 1:1:1 ratio, and they are monitored and recorded for alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of adverse events.</detailed_description>

Has a history of drug abuse within one year from the enrollment, or the urine test or blood alcohol test result was positive at the screening visit 4. Received any injection in the target knee within two months before the initiation of the study 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding female 6. With another joint disease apart from degenerative arthritis (e.g., systemic rheumatic inflammatory disease associated with the knee or chondrocalcinosis, hemachromatosis, inflammatory arthritis, necrosis of the trochanter, Paget's disease adjacent to a joint in the femur or the tibia, ochronosis, hemophilic arthropathy, infectious arthritis, Charcot's disease in the knee joint, villonodular synovitis, and synovial chondromas) 7. With an infectious disease, including HIV or hepatitis (HBV/HCV) 8. With a history any of the following clinically significant diseases: heart disease [e.g., myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, other serious heart disease, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)] kidney disease (e.g., chronic renal failure, glomerulonephritis) liver disease (e.g., liver cirrhosis, fatty liver, acute or chronic liver disease) endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, diabetes insipidus, Cushing's disease) insulindependent diabetes mellitus medical history of or current malignant tumor In particular, the tumors that TissueGeneC may aggravate can be screened using the following tests Leukemia : White Blood Cell level in the hematology Osteochondroma, Chondromas, Chondroblastoma, Chondromyxoid fibroma, Chondrosarcoma : Alkaline phosphatase level in the hematology 9. Participated in another clinical trial (using the investigational drug or a medical device) within 30 days before enrollment in this study 10.
