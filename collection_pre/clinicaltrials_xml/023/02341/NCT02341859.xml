	<brief_title>Lens Fitting Evaluation of CooperVision MyDay™ Compared With 1-DAY ACUVUE® TruEye® and DAILIES TOTAL1®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this non-dispensing study is to evaluate the fitting performance of MyDay™ 8.4 base curve, especially for flatter corneas, and compared it with 1-DAY ACUVUE® TruEye® 9.0 base curve and DAILIES TOTAL1® 8.8 base curve in a range of spherical powers.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Is between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive) Has had a selfreported visual exam in the last two years Is an adapted soft spherical contact lens wearer Has a contact lens spherical prescription between 4.00 to 6.00 and higher than 7.00D (Diopters) (inclusive) Has a BFS (Best Fit Sphere) that is higher than 8.2 measured and calculated by corneal topography Can achieve best corrected spectacle distance visual acuity of 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) or better in each eye Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMAR) or better in each eye with the study contact lenses Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease Has read, understood and signed the information consent letter Patient contact lens refraction should fit within the available parameters of the study lenses Is willing to comply with the wear schedule Is willing to comply with the visit schedule Is not a habitual wearer of soft spherical contact lenses Has a contact lens prescription outside the range of the available parameters of the study lenses Has a contact lens prescription outside the range of the inclusion power range Has a spectacle cylinder ≥1.00D of cylinder in either eye Has a history of not achieving comfortable contact lens wear (5 days per week; &gt; 8 hours/day) Has contact lens best corrected distance vision worse than 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) in either eye Presence of clinically significant (grade &gt; 2) anterior segment abnormalities Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medications which might interfere with contact lens wear Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as: Moderate to severe dry eye Pterygium, pinguecula, or corneal scars within the visual axis Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from of the limbus Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GCP) worse than grade 1 Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present) Seborrheic eczema, Seborrheic conjunctivitis History of corneal ulcers or fungal infections Poor personal hygiene Has a known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity) Has aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea Has Presbyopia or has dependence on spectacles for near work over the contact lenses Has undergone corneal refractive surgery Is participating in any other type of eye related clinical or research study</criteria>
