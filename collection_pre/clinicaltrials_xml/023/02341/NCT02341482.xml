Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary: Aspartate transaminase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase (SGOT) or alanine transaminase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transminase (SGPT) &gt;=1 x upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin &gt;=1.5 x ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin is &lt;= ULN. Subjects with epilepsy, or history of epilepsy, or conditions that lower seizure threshold, seizures of any etiology (including substance or drug withdrawal), or who have increased risk of seizures as evidenced by self reported history of electroencephalogram (EEG) with epileptiform activity.
