	<brief_title>ICE COPD PikoLogic® Cohort Study.Implementation, Compliance, and Effectiveness of Integrating the PikoLogic®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Candidate subjects participating in the cohort study will receive training by the clinical research associate (CRA) on the use of PikoLogic® for home disease management prior to discharge from the hospital. The CRA will also confirm COPD discharge education was completed by a discharge coordinator and the patient understood the instructions. The CRA will review "seek medical care if:" and "seek immediate medical care if:" instructions at discharge. The discharge CRA will also evaluate subjects for their ability to use the PikoLogic® correctly and will score the patient using an objective and subjective measurement tool. A modified Discharge Knowledge Assessment Tool© will be utilized.1 Objective measurements will include training time and patient compliance with PikoLogic® prior to discharge. Subjective data scores and objective measurements will be utilized for program implementation evaluation.</detailed_description>
