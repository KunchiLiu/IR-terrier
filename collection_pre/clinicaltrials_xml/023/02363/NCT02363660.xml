	<brief_summary>1. Compare rates of seroconversion and GMTs generated following a 3-dose series of vaccine in women given low doses of vaccine by the ID route with the NFI (Group III) to those women given standard doses by the IM route with a needle and syringe (Group I) at 1 month, 6 months and 18 months following completion of the vaccination series. 2. Compare rates of seroconversion and GMTs generated following a 3-dose series of vaccine in women given standard doses of vaccine by the IM route with the NFI (Group II) to those women given standard doses by the IM route with a needle and syringe (Group I) at 1 month, 6 months and 18 months following completion of the vaccination series.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary hypotheses: The primary goal of this study is to compare the vaccination groups. Using GMTs to measure immunogenicity of the 3 different vaccination regimens, we will test for non-inferiority between Group I and Group II and between Group I and Group III. Our hypotheses are: 1. GMTs of antibodies to all 4 HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18) following a 3-dose series of vaccine in women given low doses of vaccine by the ID route with the NFI (Group III) will be non-inferior to GMTs in women given standard doses by the IM route with a needle and syringe (Group I). Non-inferiority criteria will have been satisfied when the upper 95% confidence limit on the ratio of GMTs (GI/GIII) is less than 1.5 for all HPV types. 2. GMTs of antibodies to all 4 HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18) following a 3-dose series of vaccine in women given standard doses of vaccine by the IM route with the NFI (Group II) will be non-inferior to GMTs in women given standard doses by the IM route with a needle and syringe (Group I). Non-inferiority criteria will have been satisfied when the upper 95% confidence limit on the ratio of GMTs (GI/GII) is less than 1.5 for all HPV types. 3. The proportions of baseline-na√Øve vaccinees seroconverting to all 4 HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18) following a 3-dose series of vaccine in women given low doses of vaccine by the ID route (Group III) and standard doses of vaccine by the IM route (Group II) with the NFI will be non-inferior to the seroconversion rates in women given standard doses by the IM route with a needle and syringe (Group I). Non-inferiority criteria will have been satisfied when the upper 95% confidence limit on the difference in proportions is less than 10% for all HPV types.</detailed_description>
