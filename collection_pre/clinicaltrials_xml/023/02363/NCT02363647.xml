	<brief_summary>Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is an uncommon thyroid malignancy comprising of up to 5% of all thyroid cancers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that 56,460 Americans will be diagnosed with thyroid cancer and 1,780 will die from the disease in 2012. Early disease is usually only confined to the thyroid and can be cured with surgery. Unfortunately, more than 50% of cases are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and a 10-year survival for them is about 40%. In most tumors, as well as in MTC, single-agent inhibitor therapy has faced numerous problems and has often provided patients with only limited benefits. In this study, the investigators will be using the results of a previous study in which the Drosophila animal model combined with extensive pretesting genetic analysis of samples taken from patients' individual tumors was used to potentially develop personalized therapeutic plans for those enrolled. In this study, the investigators will offer to treat those patients with their personalized therapeutic plan (if they were able to develop one in the prior study). This is a therapeutic clinical trial in which the investigators will provide personalized therapy to patients with medullary thyroid cancer based on a Personalized Therapeutic Plan (PTP) developed under the separate Tumor Genomic Analysis and Molecular Testing for Personalized Cancer Therapy protocol (GCO# 14-0054 (0001) MSSM). This therapeutic protocol applies only to the treatment period of Personalized Medicine. The objective is to establish superiority of Personalized Medicine in terms of efficacy (Overall Response Rate) in MTC patients, or substantially similar efficacy but with reduced toxicity, when compared to the best standard of care option for recurrent/metastatic MTC (currently cabozantinib) as was demonstrated in a phase III trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Cancer Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be offered the option to consent for enrollment to receive care based on the personalized treatment plan developed under the separate Tumor Genomic Analysis and Molecular Testing for Personalized Caner Therapy protocol. Each patient enrolled in this therapeutic study will be consented using an individualized consent form which addresses their respective personalized treatment plan and its associated risks. No genetic sequencing, and no testing involving flies or animals will be conducted under this therapeutic protocol. This protocol applies only to the treatment phase of personalized medicine. Study participation is expected to last 2-3 years. Personalized Treatment Plan Since each personalized treatment plan may, and probably will be, different from respected registration label and from FDA indication, a body of experts established as the Pharmacology Committee will review the ADMET data for the drugs from each of the selected regimens. For each case, a referring medical oncologist will provide a clinical presentation of the patient`s history of cancer and previous therapy, as well as other important medical history to a Multidisciplinary Tumor Board of Experts (MTBE) consisting of two pharmacologist scientists selected for experience in drug selection, a research clinical pharmacist, 2 medical oncologists with expertise with phase 2 clinical trials, a member of the IRB, two medical oncologists with expertise in the patient's tumor type including the treating physician and two scientists who performed the drug prediction tests. Except for clinicians and other investigators directly involved with the patient's care, the members of the MTBE will be an independent group as to avoid the risk of bias. The composition of this committee will vary and other individuals may be added as the process moves forward. A study subject will only be allowed to start the personalized therapeutic plan once the final informed consent is approved by the IRB and signed by the study subject. Once enrolled in a personalized therapy, the study subject will receive treatment based on the PTP and any dose adjustment will be according with the manufacturer label information and/or the PDR Electronic Library. Any controversial, incidental, or unexpected findings while on the treatment will be presented to the MTBE-called ad hoc, and the board will decide on continuation, dose adjustment or any modification of the study subject`s personalized therapeutic treatment plan. The Personalized Treatment Plan (PTP) will be stopped upon disease progression. However, if there is no standard therapy or no other clinical trial available at the time of progression, subjects with progressive disease will have the option of being treated with one of the graded therapies discussed at the initial MTBE meeting (there will be up to 5 therapeutic plans. They will be required to sign a separate informed consent but will not be included in statistical analysis of this protocol. All the statistics will be descriptive in nature and will be exploratory.</detailed_description>
