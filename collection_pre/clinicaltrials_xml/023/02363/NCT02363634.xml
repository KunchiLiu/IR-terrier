	<detailed_description>Efficacy Objectives: To determine the effects of 12-weeks supplementation with Magtein™ as compared to placebo on: 1. anxiety and mood as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).

To determine the acute effects and the effects of 12-weeks supplementation with Magtein™ as compared to placebo on magnesium status as measured by the sponsor's protocol for determining body magnesium status. Safety Objective: To determine if supplementation with Magtein™ is safe within the confines of this study as denoted by changes from baseline to 12 weeks in blood work (comprehensive metabolic panel, uric acid and complete blood count with differential), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), adverse events and subjective remarks.</detailed_description>
