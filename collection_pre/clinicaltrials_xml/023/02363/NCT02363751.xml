Immunocompromised patients, including known seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 18. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational drugs or excipients, 19. Pregnant or lactating women, 20. Person deprived of their liberty or under judicial protection (including guardianship), 21. Patients with significantly altered mental status prohibiting the understanding of the study or with psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule or any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this trial. Those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.</criteria>
