	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Progesterone Versus Vaginal Progesterone for Endometrial Preparation in Fresh Donated Oocytes Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exploratory study with a control group treated according to our Service's usual therapeutic regimen for the transfer of embryos with donor oocytes. The controlled ovarian stimulation protocol in oocyte donors is always calculated according to the standard protocol at the Bernabeu Institute. Endometrial preparation will be carried out following the standard protocol of the Bernabeu Institute as follows: the oestrogen will be administered transdermally and patients with maintained ovarian function undergo medical hypophysectomy with depot GnRH agonists administered in the mid-luteal phase of the previous cycle. On the day of oocyte retrieval, the patient will be randomised: Group A will be administered subcutaneous progesterone 25 mg/day (Prolutex), and Group B will be administered vaginal progesterone in capsules 200 mg/3 times a day (Progeffik). The embryo transfer will be performed on day 5 of the embryo culture (Day +5). A biochemical pregnancy test beta- hCG and the P4 analysis will be performed 14 days after oocyte retrieval. All the cycles will be monitored according to the Department's standard criteria, using transvaginal ultrasound to assess embryonic development and endometrial thickness, as well as analytical controls. The study will be blinded to the investigator. The evaluating professionals will not know if the subject has been administered vaginal progesterone or subcutaneous progesterone. The medication will be delivered by a person who does not participate in the evaluations and who is dedicated to group assignment, to data centralisation, and to delivering the medication. The aim of this study is to determine if the ongoing pregnancy rate in patients undergoing a fresh embryo transfer cycle with donor oocytes is affected by the progesterone administration route.</detailed_description>
