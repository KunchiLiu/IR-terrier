Patients who have circumstances that will not permit completion of this study or the required followup. Patients who are pregnant at the time of diagnosis and do not wish pregnancy termination prior to initiation of treatment. Patients with renal abnormalities, such as pelvic kidney, horseshoe kidney, or renal transplantation, that would require modification of radiation fields. Patients with other concomitant malignancies (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer), who had (or have) any evidence of other cancer present within the last 5 years. Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative colitis). Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus despite medication. Patients taking antiarythmic agents such as amiodarone, quinidine, rifampin, ergot derivatives such as ergotamine, St John's Wort, HMGCoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin, neuroleptic such as pimozide, sedatives such as midazolam and triazolam among other CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 substrates.
