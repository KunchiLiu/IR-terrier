	<brief_summary>The process of weaning from mechanical ventilation was decided after clinical judgment and weaning predictive index. Nevertheless, indexes predicting weaning outcome like Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) are frequently inaccurate. However the long-term involvement of respiratory muscles in critically ill patients has not been established. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship on MIP at extubation on one-year mortality in critically ill patients.</brief_summary>
