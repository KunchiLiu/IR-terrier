	<brief_summary>This study examines the effects of individualized diet and exercise plans on muscle strength, quality of life and respiratory function in Pompe disease. Subjects will be given a diet and exercise plan based on their individual needs, which will be followed for 16 weeks. Participants will also be provided with an activity tracker, such as a FitBit or Apple Watch, in order to track their diet and exercise activities, and will also come to the University of Florida for exercise tests, respiratory tests and questionnaires.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet and Exercise in Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pompe is a rare disease, which occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 births. It is a progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from a mutation in the gene for acid alpha- glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycogen. Common symptoms include skeletal and smooth muscle myopathy, resulting in respiratory insufficiency, peripheral muscle weakness and generalized fatigue. The progressive myopathy in Pompe disease seems to be influenced by increased muscle protein breakdown. The increased muscle protein breakdown leads to muscle wasting, weakness, increased resting energy expenditure and, consequently, increased fatigue. Our hypothesis is that a high protein, low carbohydrate diet associated with regular physical exercise will improve respiratory and peripheral muscle functions in Pompe disease. In this study, we will investigate the effects of 16 weeks of planned diet and exercise in adolescent and young adult (15-60 years old) individuals with Pompe disease using an activity tracker.</detailed_description>
