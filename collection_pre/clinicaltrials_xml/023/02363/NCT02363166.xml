	<brief_summary>Given that the Emergency Department (ED) has become the entry way for large populations of patients into the health care system, a strategy of sampling MRSA isolates in ED populations and merging this information with patient-level data may present a window to hypothesize and investigate CA-MRSA transmission within the community and its impact on hospital-acquired infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of CA-MRSA Transmission: An ED Population Sampling Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective cross-sectional study involving 500 patients enrolled over a one year period at the UFHealth Shands Hospital's Adult and Pediatric Emergency Department. The collected information will serve as pilot data for a future large comprehensive multi-site study. Patients will have a wound culture and a nasal swab obtained as part of the study, which will be assessed for MRSA isolates using next-generation whole genome sequencing. The principal investigator or PI designee will also survey participants and review hospital records.</detailed_description>
