	<brief_summary>Design: Level I randomized prospective outcomes study comparing two groups of patients. One group will receive 0.2% ropivacaine plus 5 mcg/mL dilaudid thoracic epidural analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. The other will receive bilateral ultrasound guided paravertebral blocks with indwelling paravertebral catheters with an infusion of 0.2% ropivicaine post-operatively and a PCA. Sample Size: 50 patients Study Duration: Approximately 12 months Population:. Patients presenting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center for elective open pancreatic surgery. Primary Objective: To determine if bilateral paravertebral catheters in patients with open pancreatic procedures result in decreased pain compared to patients treated with thoracic epidural for post-operative pain. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine whether the use of bilateral paravertebral catheters impacts the length of ICU and hospital stay for patients, compared to a thoracic epidurals in patients undergoing elective open pancreatic surgery. 2. To determine whether the use of ultrasound guided bilateral paravertebral catheters leads to lower risk of complications, compared to use of a thoracic epidural in patients undergoing open pancreatic surgery.</brief_summary>

Sample Size: 50 patients Study Duration: Approximately 12 months Population:. Patients presenting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center for elective open pancreatic surgery. Primary Objective: To determine if bilateral paravertebral catheters in patients with open pancreatic procedures result in decreased total opioids compared to patients treated with thoracic epidural for post-operative pain. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine whether the use of bilateral paravertebral catheters impacts the length of ICU and hospital stay for patients, compared to a thoracic epidurals in patients undergoing elective open pancreatic surgery. 2. To determine whether the use of ultrasound guided bilateral paravertebral catheters leads to lower risk of complications, compared to use of a thoracic epidural in patients undergoing open pancreatic surgery. 2. Synopsis and Medical Application: Specific Aims: Primary Hypothesis: Paravertebral catheters will result in improved pain control relative to thoracic epidural for post-operative pain from open pancreatic surgery. Secondary Hypothesis: Paravertebral catheters will result in fewer hospital days and improved subjective respiratory function compared to patients in the thoracic epidural group.</detailed_description>
