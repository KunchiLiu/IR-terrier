	<brief_summary>Human milk (HM) is considered the gold standard nutrient for infants, which contains a lot of beneficial nutrients such as prebiotics and lactoferrin. Previous studies have shown that both prebiotics and lactoferrin play important roles in generating a bifidobacteria-dominated colonic microflora.The purpose of this study is to investigate the stool characteristics,acceptability, and gastrointestinal tolerance in term infants fed a starting infant formula supplemented with prebiotics and lactoferrin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human milk (HM) is considered the gold standard nutrient for infants, which contains a lot of beneficial nutrients such as prebiotics and lactoferrin. Previous studies have shown that both prebiotics and lactoferrin play important roles in generating a bifidobacteria-dominated colonic microflora as well as the intestinal immune systems. The purpose of this study is to investigate the stool characteristics（including intestinal microbiota） acceptability, and gastrointestinal tolerance in infants fed a starting infant formula supplemented with prebiotics and lactoferrin, and compared these data with infants on exclusively breast feeding.</detailed_description>
