The health-related quality of life will be assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30, EQ-5D and EORTC-QLQ-LC13 in all different stages of lung cancer. An utility measure will be considered. The preference values will be assessed via discrete choice experiment. Two scenarios will be designed and the lung cancer patients will be asked about the preferences.</detailed_description>
