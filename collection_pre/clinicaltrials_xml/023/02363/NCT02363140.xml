	<brief_summary>The menisci in the knee joint are important for normal functioning of the knee. Meniscus tears are amongst the commonest of injuries to the knee. The pattern and blood supply of the meniscus tears determines the treatment plan and outcome. The surgeon identifies the blood supply to the meniscus tear area during the arthroscopy(key hole operation) and decides the treatment option ie repair versus partial meniscectomy. This study aims to identify any changes that occur in the meniscus blood supply. The following are the main aims of the 'MOVE'study- 1. Use of non-invasive methods ie MRImaging to assess meniscus vascularity to preoperatively plan treatment and advice patient on recovery. 2. The study would assess changes in meniscus blood supply depending on age of the patient. 3. The study aims to assess the alteration in meniscus blood supply following an arthroscopic(key hole) meniscal repair operation.</brief_summary>
