	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the frequency of Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL D) by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme activity assay in patients who are considered to be at risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Identify and Characterize LAL-D Patients in High-risk Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Wolman Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Nonobese** patients with elevated lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) 2. Nonobese** patients with low highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) 3. Nonobese** patients with unexplained and persistently elevated liver transaminases, 4. Nonobese** patients with hepatomegaly 5. Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis 6. Patients with biopsyproven microvesicular or mixed micro/macrovesicular steatosis without a known etiology 7. Patients with presumed Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) in which genetic analysis was performed for the genes encoding the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), ApoB and PCSK9 genes and no diseasecausing mutations were identified 8. Patients with presumed FH with unclear family history 9. Patients with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (other than homozygous FH) 10. Patients with autosomal recessive low HDL of unknown etiology Also, patient must meet the following: Patient or patient's parent or legal guardian (if applicable) consents to participate in the study and provides informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed. If the patient is of minor age; he/she is willing to provide assent where required per local regulations, and if deemed able to do so. Patient is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements. Patients who do not fall into one of the aforementioned categories (cohorts) but are considered highly suspicious for LAL D should be tested to rule out the disorder outside of the study at the discretion of the Investigator. Active viral hepatitis; Other confirmed genetic liver diseases (e.g., Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha 1antitrypsin).</criteria>
