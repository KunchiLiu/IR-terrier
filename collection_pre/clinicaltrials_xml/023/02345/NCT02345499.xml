	<brief_summary>To date, no trials have been designed to compare open Vs laparoscopic radical cystectomy in the elderly patients, both in terms of functional and clinical outcome measures. A more meaningful comparison of the two modalities is that of a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>

Patients who have previously received any pelvic irradiation 3. Patients with a synchronous upper urinary tract malignancy requiring a nephroureterectomy concomitant to cystectomy 4.
