	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate, in comparison with placebo, the efficacy of 2 dose levels of SAR156597 administered subcutaneously during 52 weeks on lung function of patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of 2 dose levels of SAR156597 compared to placebo on IPF disease progression. To evaluate the safety of 2 dose levels of SAR156597 compared to placebo in patients with IPF.</brief_summary>

Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age â‰¤40 years. IPF disease diagnosis &gt;5 years. Forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;40% of predicted value. Carbon monoxide diffusing lung capacity (DLco) corrected for hemoglobin &lt;30% of predicted value. Severe chronic obstructive bronchitis as characterized by forced expiratory volume in 1 second /forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt;0.70. Need for 24 hrs of oxygen therapy or oxygen saturation &lt;88% after 10 minutes breathing ambient air at rest. Known diagnosis of significant respiratory disorders other than IPF. Pulmonary artery hypertension requiring a specific treatment. Currently listed and/or anticipated to be listed for lung transplantation within the next 6 months (on an active list). History of vasculitis or connective tissue disorders. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or chronic viral hepatitis. Patients with active tuberculosis or incompletely treated latent tuberculosis infection. Use of any cytotoxic/immunosuppressive agent including but not limited to azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and cyclosporine within 4 weeks prior to screening. Use of any cytokine modulators (etanercept, adalimumab, efalizumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab, rituximab) within 12 weeks or 5 halflives of screening (24 weeks for rituximab and 24 months for alefacept). Use of any investigational drug within 1 month of screening, or 5 halflives, if known ( whichever is longer), or within 12 weeks for stem cell therapy.
