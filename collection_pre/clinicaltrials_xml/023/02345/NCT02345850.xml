	<brief_summary>The study is designed as a three arm randomized Phase III, multicenter trial comparing two calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free strategies for Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to standard tacrolimus and methotrexate (Tac/Mtx) in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing myeloablative conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcineurin Inhibitor-Free Interventions for Prevention of Graft-versus-Host Disease (BMT CTN 1301)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that affects many hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors; it occurs when the new cells from a transplant attack the recipient's body. The current standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT involves a combination of immunosuppressive agents given for the first 6 months after transplant. Often, patients develop GVHD and continue on these agents for much longer periods. The combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the most common GVHD prophylaxis used worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplants. This regimen demonstrates better control of acute GVHD, but is less effective against chronic GVHD. Management of chronic GVHD remains a challenge and it has become a significant health problem in transplant survivors with more frequent use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally, several issues arise with the standard approach including various toxicity symptoms and side effects, increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy due to CNI, no prevention of other infectious diseases, and no prevention for disease relapse. This standard strategy of Tac/MTX will be used as a control in comparison to two other treatment plans both utilizing CNI-free methods: CD34 selected T-cell depletion in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, and infusion of bone marrow (BM) grafts followed by post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Study participants will be randomized to one of these three treatment arms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males and females aged &gt; 1.0 year and &lt; 66.0 years 2. Patients with acute leukemia in morphologic complete remission or with myelodysplasia (MDS) with no circulating blasts and with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Patients with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) must have a white blood cell count ≤10,000 cells/µL and &lt;5% blasts in the marrow. 3. Planned myeloablative conditioning regimen 4. Patients must have a related or unrelated donor as follows: 1. Related donor must be an 8/8 match for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)A, B, and C at intermediate (or higher) resolution, and DRB1 at high resolution using DNAbased typing. Pediatric related donors must weigh ≥ 25.0 kg., must have adequate peripheral venous catheter access for leukapheresis or must agree to placement of a central catheter, must be willing to (1) donate bone marrow and (2) receive GCSF followed by donation of peripheral blood stem cells (product to be determined by randomization post enrollment) and must meet institutional criteria for donation. 2. Unrelated donor must be an 8/8 match at HLAA, B, C and DRB1 at high resolution using DNAbased typing. Unrelated donor must be medically eligible to donate according to National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) (or equivalent donor search organization) criteria. At time of enrollment, the donor should not have any known preferences or contraindications to donate bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. (Selection of unrelated donors is to be performed according to institutional practice. It is recommended that the time from collection to initiation of the cell processing be considered when prioritizing donors, as data shows better results for CD34 selection when cell processing begins within 36 hours of the end of collection) 5. Cardiac function: Ejection fraction at rest ≥ 45.0% or shortening fraction of ≥ 27.0% by echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (MUGA). 6. Estimated creatinine clearance (for patients &gt; 12 years) greater than 50.0 mL/minute (using the CockcroftGault formula and actual body weight); for pediatric patients (&gt; 1 year to 12 years), Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) estimated by the updated Schwartz formula ≥ 90.0 mL/min/1.73 m^2. If the estimated creatinine clearance is &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2, then renal function must be measured by 24hour creatinine clearance or nuclear GFR, and must be &gt; 70.0 mL/min/1.73 m^2. 7. Pulmonary function: Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 50% (adjusted for hemoglobin), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 50%; for children who are unable to perform for Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) due to age or developmental ability, there must be no evidence of dyspnea and no need for supplemental oxygen, as evidenced by O2 saturation ≥ 92% on room air. 8. Liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 2x the upper limit of normal (unless elevated bilirubin is attributed to Gilbert's Syndrome) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) / aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5x the upper limit of normal. 9. Signed informed consent. 1. Prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 2. Karnofsky or Lansky Performance Score &lt; 70% 3. Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignant cells 4. Patients with uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections (currently taking medication and with progression or no clinical improvement) at time of enrollment 5. Presence of fluid collection (ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion) that interferes with methotrexate clearance or makes methotrexate use contraindicated 6. Patients seropositive for HIV1 or 2 7. Patients seropositive for Human TLymphotrophic Virus (HTLV)I or II 8. Patients with active Hepatitis B or C viral replication by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 9. Documented allergy to iron dextran or murine proteins 10. Women who are pregnant (positive serum or urine βHCG) or breastfeeding 11. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) or men who have sexual contact with FCBP unwilling to use 2 effective forms of birth control or abstinence for one year after transplantation 12. History of uncontrolled autoimmune disease or on active treatment 13. Patients with prior malignancies, except resected nonmelanoma or treated cervical carcinoma in situ. Cancer treated with curative intent ≥ 5 years previously will be allowed. Cancer treated with curative intent &lt; 5 years previously will not be allowed unless approved by the Protocol Officer or one of the Protocol Chairs. 14. Patient unable to comply with the treatment protocol including appropriate supportive care, followup and research tests 15. Planned posttransplant maintenance therapy except for FLT3 inhibitors or TKIs 16. German centers only: Treatment with any known nonmarketed drug substance or experimental therapy within 5 terminal half lives or 4 weeks prior to enrollment, whichever is longer, or participation in any other interventional clinical study.</criteria>
