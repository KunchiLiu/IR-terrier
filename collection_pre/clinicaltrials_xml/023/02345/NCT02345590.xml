	<brief_summary>Weakening and expansion of the main abdominal artery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, AAA) is a common problem in older Australians. The majority of AAAs are small (&lt;55 mm) and affect 90,000 individuals in Australia and 4.5 million world-wide. Currently, the only treatment available for AAA is surgery. However, surgical therapies are not effective for small AAAs, and these patients undergo a program of repeat imaging and consultation to monitor the size of the aneurysm and symptoms. This proposal is aimed at addressing the urgent need to identify a medical treatment able to limit progression of AAAs. The study design and rationale are based on strong preclinical evidence supporting the value of eplerenone (an agent indicated for treatment of heart failure) in limiting AAA progression. If proved effective, this medication would: 1. Reduce the number of patients requiring costly surgery 2. Reduce the number of surgery related deaths and complications 3. Provide a therapy suitable for the rapidly expanding elderly age group who have AAAs.</brief_summary>
