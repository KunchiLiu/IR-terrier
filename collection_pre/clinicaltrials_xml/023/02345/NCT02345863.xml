	<brief_summary>A prospective, open-label, multicenter Phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen of Bendamustine followed by GA101 and Ibrutinib followed by Ibrutinib and GA101 maintenance in CLL patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Regimen of Bendamustin [B] Followed by GA101 and Ibrutinib [I] in CLL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the CLL2-BIG trial an allcomer CLL population with indication for treatment will be included. Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with bendamustin unless contraindications are existing or debulking is not indicated. Afterwards 6 cycles of induction therapy with GA101 and ibrutinib will be applied, each with a duration of 28 days. Primary endpoint overall Response rate will be assessed at final restaging. Patients benefitting from BIG treatment will enter the maintenance phase of the trial. Maintenance treatment will be continued if no unacceptable toxicity occurs until three months after negativity of minimal residual disease [MRD] is achieved in peripheral blood in patients with (clinical) complete response (CR) or (clinical) incomplete complete response [CRi] (confirmed by 2 consecutive testings of MRD within 3 months), progression of CLL, start of a subsequent therapy or up to 8 cycles of maintenance (each cycle with a duration of 84 calendar days = 3 months), whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>
