	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the operative, anatomic functional outcome as well as the subjective outcome of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy and sacropexy compared to laparoscopic hysteropexy (conserving the uterus). The investigators expect that both laparoscopic procedures are equal in regards to operation time, complication rate, anatomic and functional outcome as well as subjective outcome.</brief_summary>
