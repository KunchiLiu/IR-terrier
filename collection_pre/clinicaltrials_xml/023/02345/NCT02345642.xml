	<brief_summary>We are comparing two pneumatic compression devices, VenaFlow (stationary) and MCS (portable) in both the supine an standing position. We will start supine and will take 3 baseline measurements of venous velocity and then apply a device and take 3 measurements of the increase in peak venous velocity. We will repeat this with the second device. We will then have the subject stand and repeat the above with each device. We will randomize the order of the devices in the supine and standing position. This study will involve 10 healthy subjects of various ages and 10 THR patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase one: 10 healthy test subjects will be included of various ages. They will have each pneumatic compression device applied in the supine and then standing positions. Phase two: 10 patients following THR on postoperative day #2 will be included. These patients will agree to participate in the study and have to be able to stand for approximately 10 minutes.
