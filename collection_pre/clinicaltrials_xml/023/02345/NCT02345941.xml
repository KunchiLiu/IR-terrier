	<brief_summary>This project will utilize the first web-based program to provide tailored injury prevention education. The existing Safety in Seconds program was adapted into a smartphone platform. Parents are recruited from and engage in the program in the clinical setting (PED or PTS). Parents download the app onto their smartphone which is used to ask the questions, collect a parent's responses, assess the parents' safety needs and give tailored directions for proper car sear use. The control group parents will also engage with the smartphone app and receive immediate feedback. However, they will receive tailored educational messages about smoke alarms. Parents will also have access to the online SIS v 2.0 Parent Portal which will have educational features (e.g., tips for keeping children content in their CSSs, links to helpful websites). The investigators will use emerging technology such as push notification and email to remind parents to visit the portal and have their child's car seat reassessed. The investigators plan to conduct a cost benefit analysis of the program's expected financial benefit from the perspective of a third party payer of medical claims and an in-depth examination of program adoption and implementation using qualitative data collected from key informant interviews, direct observations of the clinic environments, and document review.</brief_summary>
