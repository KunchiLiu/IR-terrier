	<brief_title>Herbal-Based Medication vs. Placebo in Preventing Acute Otitis Media in Children at High Risk of Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, controlled parallel-group comparison for superiority of Otovowen®. Patient will be identified by screening of patient cards. Patients with recurrent AOM aged 12 to 59 months will be randomly assigned either to Otovowen® or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by age at enrolment (12-35 versus 36-59 months). The observation period per subject will be 6 months. Data collection and documentation will be performed weekly via online diary by the parents/legal representative(s) and by the investigator via eCRF. Patients will be seen by the doctor at baseline and at end of study. Unscheduled visits in case of AOM or severe URI or any other disease are initiated by the parents/legal representative(s). Study medication will be sent to the patient/parents/legal representative(s) after randomization. and will be administered at first signs or symptoms of URI (e. g. elevated temperature, common cold, influenza, coughing, sore throat, hoarse voice, frequent sneezing, running or stuffy nose, sinusitis, fever, headache, etc.) until resolved (maximally 8 weeks of continuous application). AOM will be diagnosed during unscheduled visits according to the criteria detailed in the study protocol. An AOM will be considered as resolved through confirmation by the investigator only. Compliance will be assessed by weighing contents of bottles of IMPs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children with at least 3 episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) within 12 months prior to study inclusion as documented in their medical records.

Systemic, severe as well as history of uncontrolled chronic disease or a concurrent clinically significant illness, or medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion, would contraindicate study participation or compliance with protocol mandated procedures. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial or participation in any clinical trial involving an investigational medicinal product within 30 days prior to written informed consent for this trial.</criteria>
