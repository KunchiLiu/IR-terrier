	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of intratumoral plasmid interleukin-12 DNA injection (pIL-12) with electroporation (EP) in treatment-refractory metastatic and unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Intratumoral pIL-12 EP is a gene therapy approach to directly induce a pro-inflammatory response within a tumor to initiate and/or enhance anti-tumor immunity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of SCC of head and neck with AJCC Stage III, IVA or IVB and not amenable to surgical resection or locoregional radiation therapy with curative intent. Patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 Patients must have platinumrefractory disease defined as disease progression within 12 months platinumbased chemoradiation with curative intent or any disease progression on platinumbased chemotherapy in the absence of radiation Age â‰¥ 18 years old ECOG performance status 02 Life expectancy of at least 3 months Adequate organ function Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the start of study drug Able to give informed consent Prior therapy with IL12 or prior gene therapy Concurrent ongoing administration of systemic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy), or radiation therapy Evidence of significant active infection (e.g., pneumonia, cellulitis, wound abscess, etc.) at time of study entry Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded Patients with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators are excluded Significant disease or uncontrolled disease, i.e. cardiovascular renal, hepatic, endocrine, metabolic, neurologic; or other significant disease that would limit the patients ability to participate in the study as determined by the investigator or medical monitor</criteria>
