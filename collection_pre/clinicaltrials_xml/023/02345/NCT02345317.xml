	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrial countries. Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) have been recognized as an additional phenotypic characteristic frequently observed in patients with AMD. Several studies have proven that the prevalence of RPD is associated with AMD as well as a high risk of disease progression to geographic atrophy, the late form of dry AMD. The pathogenesis of RPD is yet still incompletely understood. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that the RPD affected retinal area increases over time. Potential factors influencing progression of RPD have not been intensely studied and potentially predictive markers are yet unknown. The primary objective of this study is to characterize RPD progression in more detail and to identify predictive markers of RPD progression and development of AMD late stages.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent Men and women, any race, aged 60 years or older at the baseline visit Presence of RPD without any other type of drusen, hypo/hyperpigmentation, geographic atrophy, choroidal neovascularization Patient is willing to undergo ocular examinations once every 12 for up to 24 months Presence or history of soft drusen, hypo/hyperpigmentation, geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization in the study eye Ocular disease in the study eye that may confound assessment of the retina (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, uveitis) Any condition that would make adherence to the examination schedule of once every 12 months for up to 24 months difficult or unlikely, e.g., personality disorder, chronic alcoholism, Alzheimer's Disease or drug abuse</criteria>
