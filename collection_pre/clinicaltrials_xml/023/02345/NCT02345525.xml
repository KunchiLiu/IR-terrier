	<detailed_description>Home-based Constraint Induced Modified Therapy (hCIMT) consist of 2 hours intensive upper limb practice with shaping techniques + 2 hours ADLs supervised by a caregiver. Patients are supposed to wear a mitt on the unaffected hand for 4 hours daily. Modified Constraint Induced Modified Therapy (mCIMT) consist of 2 hours intensive upper limb practice with shaping techniques supervised by an experienced physiotherapist + 2 hours ADLs at home (supervised by a caregiver) Patients are supposed to wear a mitt on the unaffected hand for 4 hours daily.</detailed_description>
