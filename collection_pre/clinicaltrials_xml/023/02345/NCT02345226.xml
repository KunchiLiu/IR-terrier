	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/RPV/TAF) fixed dose combination (FDC) versus continuing efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) FDC in HIV-1 infected adults who have been virologically suppressed (HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL) on a stable regimen of EFV/FTC/TDF FDC for ≥ 6 consecutive months at screening.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Currently receiving EFV/FTC/TDF FDC for 6 consecutive months preceding the screening visit Documented plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL (or undetectable HIV1 RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is &gt; 50 copies/mL) for 6 months preceding the screening visit. Unconfirmed virologic elevation of ≥ 50 copies/mL after previously reaching viral suppression (transient detectable viremia, or "blip") and prior to screening is acceptable Have no documented resistance to any of the study agents at any time in the past HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at the screening visit Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm^3; platelets ≥50,000/mm^3; hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL) Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN (individuals with serum amylase &gt; 5 × ULN will remain eligible if serum lipase is ≤ 5 × ULN) Normal ECG (or if abnormal, determined by the Investigator to be not clinically significant) Adequate renal function: Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula Key Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Hepatitis C antibody positive with detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (individuals who have HCV antibody but no detectable HCV RNA are eligible to enroll) Individuals experiencing or with a medical history of decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy, etc.) Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with the individual's study compliance A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Individuals with cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have received any systemic therapy for KS within 30 days of Baseline/Day 1 and must not be anticipated to require systemic therapy during the study Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Baseline/Day 1 Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with any of the following medications in the table below, including drugs not to be used with FTC, RPV and/or TAF (refer to the individual agents Prescribing Information); or individuals with any known allergies to the excipients of FTC/RPV/TAF Note: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
