	<brief_summary>The study involved Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and more specifically computer exercises blended with game activities. It was hypothesized that ICT facilitated, game blended cognitive and/or physical exercise improves global cognition when compared to control groups; moreover, these improvements may be manifested by brain activity changes; we explored the impact of potential moderators on combined exercise-induced cognitive benefits, as well as, individual/separate training schemes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study was conducted in the Thessaloniki (Greece), in various centers. It was part of the Long Lasting Memories (LLM) project (www.longlastingmemories.eu), which was funded by the European Commission (Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Program (ICT-PSP) for a three year period (2009-2012). It used a pre-post-test design with the between-participant factor group [intervention(s) vs. passive and/or active control]. Post-test was conducted within 2 weeks after completion of the exercise period. Interventions were carried out in Thessaloniki (Greece) within day care centers, hospitals, senior care centers, a memory outpatient center, local parishes, and at participants' homes. Centers had to provide 8 exercise weeks, with a frequency of at least 2 physical and 3 cognitive exercise sessions per week, resulting in at least 16 physical and 24 cognitive exercise sessions in total. A similar trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02267499</detailed_description>
