	<brief_summary>Myocyte necrosis occurs frequently in elective percutanious percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with subsequent cardiovascular events. This study assessed the cardio- and reno-protective effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in patients undergoing elective PCI. 200 patients were randomized into 2 groups: 100 patients received RIPC (created by three 5-minute inflations of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg around the upper arm, separated by 5-minute intervals of reperfusion) &lt; 2 hours before the PCI procedure, and the control group (n = 100).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients between 18 and 85 years of age, scheduled to undergo an elective PCI and able to give an informed consent were eligible for enrollment in the study. Elective PCI was defined as any coronary revascularization in a lowrisk patient who presents to the facility for a planned PCI or for a coronary angiogram followed by ad hoc PCI. (1) emergency PCI, (2) baseline troponin value â‰¥ 0.04 ng/mL, (3) nicorandil or glibenclamide use (preconditioningmimetic and preconditioningblocking medication, respectively), (4) those who could not give informed consent, and (5) patients with severe renal impairment or on regular dialysis.</criteria>
