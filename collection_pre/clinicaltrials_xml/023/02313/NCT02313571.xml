	<brief_summary>The computer-integrated patient controlled epidural analgesia (CIPCEA) system can automatically adjust the background infusion rate during combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia based on the parturient's need as labour progresses. Analysis of parturients experiencing breakthrough pain may identify associated factors that can also be related to obstetric or foetal outcomes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Computer integrated patient controlled epidural analgesia (CIPCEA) is a novel epidural analgesic delivery system that is currently used in daily practice in KK Women's and Children's Hospital. It has enabled us to monitor the infusion pumps through wireless connection to a central monitoring system and hence, collect pump utilisation data electronically. The CIPCEA system is programmed to analyse the LA usage across the last hour and adjust the background infusion rate according to a preset algorithm. Breakthrough pain is defined as maternal complaint of pain or pressure that required and was successfully treated with supplemental epidural medications. we investigated the potential factors associated with breakthrough pain in patients who receive CSE epidural analgesia with CIPCEA, with the aim of elucidating the important associated factors.</detailed_description>
