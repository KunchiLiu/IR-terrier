	<brief_summary>Study designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of a genetically attenuated P. falciparum (GAP3KO) that arrests early in the liver stage of the parasite life cycle. Study will also confirm the attenuation of the GAP3KO parasites using peripheral blood smears. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the humoral immune responses to GAP3KO.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Attenuation and Immunogenicity of GAP3KO Administered Via A Stephensi Mosquitoes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm, open-label, phase 1 safety study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a genetically attenuated P. falciparum (GAP3KO) that arrests early in the liver stage of the parasite life cycle. The study will also confirm the attenuation of the GAP3KO parasites using peripheral blood smears. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the humoral immune responses to GAP3KO. A total of 10 healthy, malaria-na√Øve adult subjects will be enrolled to receive GAP3KO via the bite of 150-200 GAP3K0-infected A. stephensi mosquitoes under controlled conditions. Subjects will be evaluated for safety, reactogenicity, and signs and symptoms of malaria to confirm attenuation for 28 days, including monitoring in a hotel setting 8-18 days post GAP 3KO administration.</detailed_description>
