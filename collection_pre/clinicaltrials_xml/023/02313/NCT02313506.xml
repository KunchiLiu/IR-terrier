	<brief_summary>Physical activity is an essential first-line treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, a 2013 systematic review found only 13% met the activity recommendation of 150 minutes or more per week. The primary goal of this pilot randomized controlled trail is to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component intervention/model of care involving a group education session, use of the Fitbit Flex (a wireless physical activity tracking device), and weekly telephone counselling by a physiotherapist (PT) to improve physical activity and reduce sedentary time in patients with knee OA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility and Preliminary Efficacy of an Activity Tracker-driven Intervention for Promoting Physical Activity in People Living With Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is common (affecting 1 in 10), painful, and debilitating. Being physically active improves pain, mobility and quality of life for people living with knee OA; however, less than half of patients are active. Combining the best evidence in OA care and digital technology, the investigators propose a new model of care for improving physical activity in patients with OA. The investigators primary objective is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component model of care involving 1) a group education and structured goal-setting session, 2) the use of Fitbit Flex (a commercially available physical activity tracker) and 3) weekly telephone activity counselling by a physiotherapist for improving physical activity and reducing sedentary time in patients with knee OA. In this pilot randomized controlled trial the investigators hypothesize that compared to a control group (i.e. the Delayed Intervention group), participants in the Immediate Intervention Group will 1) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 2) reduce sedentary time, 3) improve OA disease status, and 4) improve abilities to self-manage their condition.</detailed_description>
