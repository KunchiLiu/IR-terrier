	<brief_title>ShearWave™ Elastography to Assess Liver Fibrosis in Chinese Patients With Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B is becoming increasingly common. The liver becomes stiffer and this is called fibrosis. A non-invasive method to accurately stage fibrosis is necessary in order to begin the correct treatment. Currently, liver biopsy is used to do this, but there are many disadvantages with this technique. ShearWave Elastography (SWE), available on the ultrasound machine Aixplorer®, is a non-invasive method to evaluate liver fibrosis. This study will evaluate how liver stiffness measurements made with SWE correspond with a biopsy result (currently the gold standard). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of liver stiffness measurements with Aixplorer to evaluate the different stages of fibrosis will be analyzed. Liver stiffness measurement made by the Aixplorer will also be compared to blood markers</detailed_description>
