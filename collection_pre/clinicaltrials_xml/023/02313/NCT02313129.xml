	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of infertility in women with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). In this study the study team will compare the differences in ovarian reserve (the ability to provide egg cells that are capable of fertilization), the frequency of ovulation and the number of pregnancies between women with and without RA. It is possible that RA activity and medications limit ovarian reserve and ovulation, which may increase infertility among women with RA. There are several suspected causes for infertility in RA, including age-related fertility decline, inflammatory changes that impact endometrial receptivity and discourage implantation, accelerated ovarian decline due to certain arthritis medications and increased frequency of anovulation (a menstrual cycle during which ovaries do not release an egg) due to RA activity. This study is the first step toward our long term goal of increasing the ability of all women with RA to build the family they desire.</brief_summary>
