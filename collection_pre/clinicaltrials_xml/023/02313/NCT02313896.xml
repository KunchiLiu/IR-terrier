	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized prospective pilot study is to decrease hospital readmissions for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Patients who were admitted at YNHH with hepatic encephalopathy will be enrolled. Patients will then be randomized to one of two groups upon discharge. The control group will receive usual standard of care for hepatic encephalopathy (encephalopathy education, cirrhosis brochure, stool chart, and routine follow up with their primary care provider and hepatologist). The intervention group will receive usual standard of care as discussed above and phone calls for a 3-month period after their hospitalization.</detailed_description>
