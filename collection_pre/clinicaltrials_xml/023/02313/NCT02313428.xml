	<brief_summary>This study is to observe the effect of application of topically administered oxygen on healing rate, cost of care and rate of amputations in diabetic patients with foot ulcer(s) (DFU). The proposed study is a pragmatic (comparative effectiveness research, CER) study, in which the effectiveness of topical oxygen (100%) administered 4 days per week, for 16 weeks, for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) will be measure and compared with standard of care (SoC) treatment. There will be a 2 patient groups (including a comparison groups and a treatment groups) including: (1) Medicaid patients who are at Wagner grade 2 and below, will only receive standard treatment (2) Medicaid patients who are at Wagner grade 2 and below, will receive standard treatment plus Topical Oxygen Therapy. All of the Topical Oxygen Therapy will be provided in a home care setting or extended care facility.100 patients will be recruited. This study is to assist the Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) and to provide efficient and effective administration of the Medicaid program. This is an observational and descriptive study that will seek to generate a hypothesis. Due to the small sample size this study will primarily be a feasibility study that will attempt to measure and evaluate differences in the relative costs of the intervention of topical oxygen therapy on this population and subsequently compare outcomes in areas such as overall health improvements and cost effectiveness. The patient population will consist of Medicaid beneficiaries with DFU at Wagner grades 2 and below who are enrolled in the United Health Care Community Plan of Ohio (UHC).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are a total of 5 study visits including the initial baseline visit were they will be randomized into one of the 2 groups (comparison or treatment). At the baseline visit the following will be collected; history of the patient, physical examination of the patient including:, digital imaging of the DFU that is input into WoundMatrixâ„¢ software, and the patient will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire. They will also be provided with teaching regarding diabetes, footwear, and wound care. Patients will return for study visits 2-5 on weeks 4, 8, 12, 16. At study visit 2-5 the research staff will collect digital imaging of the ulcer and at study visit 5 the patient will be asked to complete the quality of life questionnaire. These visits will be correlated with their regular scheduled visit at the CWC. If their ulcer heals before the end of the study, they will be asked to return for study visit 5 (week 16). The patient will complete the at home treatments, including the 90 minute treatment, 4 consecutive days a week, 3 day of no treatment). The patient will have the study personnel come to their home to provide supplies, teach, and give support for the TO device. The study personnel will also go to the patient's home weekly to give support for the treatments. Participation in this study is expected to add no additional risk to the patient. The only risk expected to occur with any frequency is irritation of the skin in the upper calf. This issue is anticipated in the protocol, which specifies appropriate treatment modifications and discontinuation of Topical Oxygen, if the problem does not improve. This problem, if it occurs, is expected to be self-limited and of minor significance. Oxygen although not combustible itself, supports combustion of other flammable materials. The use of oxygen in this protocol is essentially equivalent to that supplied by nasal cannula to patients in hospital or at home. To minimize the risk of fire the investigators will strictly enforce a no smoking and no open flame policy in any room in which Topical Oxygen is utilized. Treatment facilities will comply with local fire ordinances and study personnel will be familiar with fire safety protocols of each facility. The potential benefits however are dramatic. The disease state is highly morbid and typically involves prolonged medical care and multiple surgical procedures. Despite intensive therapeutic intervention the state of the art still results in high morbidity and mortality at a high financial cost. The application of topical oxygen to diabetic wounds has the potential to dramatically impact the effectiveness of wound healing and to therefore improve limb salvage, decrease infection rates and mortality, and generally improve the quality of life of study participants receiving topical oxygen as well as the general population if efficacy is proved. Patients enrolled in the comparison groups will benefit by close follow-up and treatment using accepted comprehensive wound cares protocol.</detailed_description>
