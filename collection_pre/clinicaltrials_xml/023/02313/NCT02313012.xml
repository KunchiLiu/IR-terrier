	<brief_summary>The CC-90003-ST -001 trial is a first-in-man, open-label study in subjects with locally-advanced or wide spread cancers to determine if CC-90003 (an oral medication) can be adequately tolerated with minimal side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and PK Study of CC-90003 in Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CC-90003-ST -001 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1a study in subjects with locally-advanced or metastatic, solid tumors who are intolerant of, resistant to, or have relapsed after at least one line of therapy and for whom no standard therapy exists. The study will be conducted in two parts: Dose Escalation (Part 1) and Cohort Expansion (Part 2). Subjects may continue CC-90003 until progression of their underlying malignancy, the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90003. In Part 1, cohorts of subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors will receive increasing doses of CC-90003 in order to assess its safety and tolerability, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and PK profile. In Part 2, cohorts of subjects with specific tumors that harbor mutations involving the Mitogen -Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway will receive CC-90003 at or below the MTD until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90003.</detailed_description>
