	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to establish a hierarchical embryo selection process by using the time-lapse imaging (TLI), combining the embryo cleavage patterns and timing parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Select Embryos by Time-lapse System for Single Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The embryos of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is cultured to blastocyst stage and observed by TLI. The association of embryo cleavage patterns/timing parameters and good-quality blastocyst rates are evaluated by logistic regression and to establish a hierarchical embryo selection. The value of the selection process is assess by single embryo transfer (SET) on Day 3.</detailed_description>
