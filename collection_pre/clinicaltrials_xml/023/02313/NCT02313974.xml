	<brief_summary>At this moment, the duration of the treatment in Proliferative Lupus Nephritis has not been determined. Almost 30 percent of patients in total remission during or after a treatment, will relapse in the first 5 years. The factors associated to Renal relapses are not completly known. The investigators think that an histological control study performed to patient with complete remission for a year at the end of a 3 years treatment could help us to know which patients are going to relapse.</brief_summary>
