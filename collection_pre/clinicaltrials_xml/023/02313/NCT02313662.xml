	<brief_summary>All patients planned for PDD guided TURB can be included in this study. Two different optics with PDD and NBI are applied to the resectoscope in addition to regular WL. First, a WL cystoscopy is made and any suspect areas are noted on the registration form, then NBI is used and any suspect areas are noted and finally the cystoscopy is made with PDD with registration of any additional findings. To adjust for bias introduced by photo bleaching, the second part of the study will be performed with PDD as the second modality. Any flat lesions will be biopsied if they appear suspicious in one of the modalities. The registration form is completed by the surgeon, once the pathology results are known. A total number of 152 patients is planned to be included.</brief_summary>
