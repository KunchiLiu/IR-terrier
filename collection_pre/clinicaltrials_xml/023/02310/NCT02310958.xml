	<brief_summary>The investigators plan a retrospective, single-center outcome analysis of laparoscopic hernia repair in children operated between March 2nd, 2010, and March 1st, 2014. Data analysis will be based on a review of hospital records and a questionnaire answered by families. Patient demographics (age, gender), affected side, type and duration of laparoscopic intervention, and outcome parameters (hernia recurrence, post-operative complications, eg. infections, length and type of postoperative pain medication, and length of the postoperative hospital stay) will be analysed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome of Laparoscopic Inguinal Herniorraphy in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hernias of the abdominal wall occur if intra-abdominal tissue or peritoneum bulges through the abdominal wall. The most frequent locations of abdominal wall hernia are the inguinal region close to the groin, the umbilicus, and scars. Congenital inguinal hernias occur more frequently in the inguinal region if the vaginal process is not closed adequately at birth. Surgical procedures for correction of inguinal hernias are frequently carried out in children. Laparoscopic procedures to correct inguinal hernias in children are gaining more acceptance. The laparoscopic closure of hernias in children is considered effective and safe and represents an accepted alternative to the open surgical hernia repair. When compared to open surgical hernia repair in children, laparoscopic hernia repair causes smaller scars, allows for a faster postoperative recovery of children, requires less pain medication, and allows for an inspection of the contralateral side, thus facilitating simultaneous hernia repair in the same operation. We aim to investigate the short-term results of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in children. The main outcome parameter of this single-center study is hernia recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral metachronous hernia. Secondary outcome measures are postoperative complications such as infections of the wound regions, the time between operation and discharge from hospital, and postoperative pain medication requirements. We chose a 4-year time interval for inclusion of patients. Data are retrieved from hospital records in a retrospective evaluation. In addition, a structured questionnaire sent to the families of children will document postoperative complaints and complications from 3 months after the operation onwards. Families not responding to the questionnaire will be offered a structured telephone interview.</detailed_description>
