	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different methods that are used for inserting the needle during paracentesis. One method is called the "coaxial insertion technique" and the other is called the "z-tract technique". Researchers would like to see which method is better and leads to less problems like oozing from the needle insertion site and pain during the procedure. Both methods are approved and currently used methods for doing a paracentesis at the University of Virginia. Which method is used generally depends on physician preference. There have been no studies done to date that compare these two methods for needle insertion.</brief_summary>
