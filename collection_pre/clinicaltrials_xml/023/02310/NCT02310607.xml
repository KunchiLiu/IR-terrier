	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate a prototype device detecting zinc protoporphyrin-IX fluorescence non-invasively from the intact oral mucosa. Zinc protoporphyrin-IX is an established indicator of iron deficiency. The prototype device is used to measure the erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme ratio for women after delivery, a study group chosen because of an elevated risk of iron deficiency. The results from the non-invasive measurements are compared to reference measurements of the erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme ratio from residual blood samples from the same patients and to other indicators of iron status, including hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor.

	<detailed_description>This trial is a proof-of-concept study using a prototype fiber optic fluorometer to acquire autofluorescence spectra from women after delivery and determine the erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX fluorescence intensity from these spectra. The non-invasively determined fluorescence spectra are evaluated to provide a quantitative measure of the erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme concentration ratio. These values are primarily compared to an erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX determined by HPLC from residual blood samples from the same subjects and secondarily to erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme ratios determined using a commercial hematofluorometer (AVIV, model 206d) and other indicators of iron status, including hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor This study could help to establish the non-invasive fluorescence measurement of zinc protoporphyrin-IX as a rapid, easy to use means for point-of-care screening for iron deficiency in resource-limited settings lacking laboratory infrastructure.</detailed_description>
