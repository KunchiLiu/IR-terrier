	<brief_title>OBE001 Phase 2 Dose-finding Study Versus Placebo in Women Undergoing Embryo Transfer in the Context of IVF-ICSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, dose-finding, randomised, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy and the safety of the oxytocin receptor antagonist OBE001 in 240 women undergoing embryo transfer following IVF or ICSI. The four-arm study (OBE001 dose 1, dose 2, dose 3, and placebo) design will allow evaluation of a possible dose-dependent pattern of action of OBE001 and, simultaneously, comparison of active compound with placebo with regard to both efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>
