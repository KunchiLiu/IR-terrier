	<detailed_description>Prevalence of depression in the postnatal period is 10% to 17 % in western world ( O 'Hara and Swain 1996; Josseffson et al 2001; Yoshida et al 2001) and 23% to 36% in the developing world (Rahman et al 2003; Patel et al 2002; Husain et al 2006). In developed countries, studies indicate that maternal depression is associated with long-term emotional, cognitive and behavioral problem in children. There is evidence of link between maternal psychopathology to physical health of child. Research evidence also indicates that long-term negative impact of postnatal depression is on the mother's mental health, on infant's development and on the marital relationship (Reay, Fisher, Robertson, Adams and Owen 2005). because of high prevalence of maternal depression in low income countries like Pakistan, the present study is designed to test the effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for women with maternal depression.
