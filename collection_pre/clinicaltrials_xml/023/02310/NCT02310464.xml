	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the clinical trial is to investigate safety and tolerability of escalating doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 in subjects with metastatic incurable solid tumors, such as gastric, lung,colorectal or breast cancer. Meanwhile, the tumor response and humoral immune responses, i.e.,anti-Globo H IgG and IgM production following administration of OBI-833/OBI-821 will be assessed as the secondary objective of this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Active Immunotherapy With OBI-833 (Globo H-CRM197) in Advanced/Metastatic Gastric, Lung, Colorectal or Breast Cancer Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The First-In-Human clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of three doses of OBI-833 (10,30 and 100μg) along with a fixed dose of 100μg OBI-821 adjuvant in a small number of patients (N=26) with late stage gastric, colorectal, breast and lung cancers. Patients will receive a total 10 doses subcutaneously over 24 weeks, and will be evaluated for safety and immune response during the 24 week treatment period and subsequently observed for additional 12 weeks post-treatment. In addition to the standard battery of safety tests, evaluations will also include immunological response, tumor markers and clinical endpoints such as disease or progression free survival (RECIST 1.1).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects ≥21 years of age 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of gastric, lung, colorectal or breast cancer on file 3. Subjects with recurrent or metastatic incurable disease that failed to respond to at least one line of anticancer standard therapy and for which standard treatment is no longer effective or tolerable. 4. Measurable disease (i.e., present with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST, version 1.1. 5. Performance status: ECOG ≤ 1 6. Organ Function Requirements Subjects must have adequate organ functions as defined below: AST/ALT ≤ 3X ULN (upper limit of normal) AST/ALT ≤ 5X ULN [with underlying liver metastasis] Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 X ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5X ULN ANC ≥ 1500 /µL Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL 7. Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods during treatment and until the end of study. Subject not of childbearing potential (i.e., permanently sterilized, postmenopausal) can be included in study. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. 8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines. 1. Patients who have not received standard chemotherapy, hormonal or targeted therapy for their underlying advanced/metastatic cancer. 2. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding at entry. 3. Subjects with splenectomy. 4. Subjects with known or clinically manifest, symptomatic CNS metastases. 5. Subjects with HIV infection, active hepatitis B infection or active hepatitis C infection. 6. Subjects with any autoimmune disorders requiring iv/oral steroids or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. e.g., Type 1 juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, antibody positive for rheumatoid arthritis, Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, lupus, scleroderma, systemic vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, immune mediated thrombocytopenia, etc. 7. Subjects with any known uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA&gt;2), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 8. Subjects with any of the following MEDICATIONS within 4 weeks prior to IP treatment, except permitted therapies as listed in section 7.1: Chemotherapeutic Agent Immunotherapy [mAbs, Interferons, Cytokines (except GCSF)] Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporin, rapamycin, tacrolimus, rituximab, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, etc.). IV/oral steroids except single prophylactic use in CT/MRI scan or other onetime use in approved indications. Another investigational drug 9. Subjects with pleural effusions and/or ascites, due to malignancy, requiring paracentesis every 2 weeks or more frequently. 10. Subjects with any known severe allergies (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any active or inactive ingredients in the study drugs.</criteria>
