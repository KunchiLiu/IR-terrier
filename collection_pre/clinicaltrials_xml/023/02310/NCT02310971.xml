	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of CVac, an investigational cell therapy, in patients with resected stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have completed surgery with or without front-line chemotherapy or radiation therapy. After confirmation of non-measurable disease patients will undergo leukapheresis for manufacture of the study agent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cvac as Maintenance Treatment Patients With Resected Stage I or Stage II Adenocarcinoma (Cancer) of the Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of approximately 40 patients at up to 30 clinical sites will be screened for eligibility into the study within 6 weeks of completing treatment, including R0 (complete resection with no microscopic residual tumor) or R1 (complete resection with no grossly visible tumor but microscopically positive margins) surgery for stage I or stage II adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with or without chemotherapy and radiation. Eligible patients must have no measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009) and tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [CA 19-9] not greater than 2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) following surgery with or without chemotherapy or radiation. Prior surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are allowed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, stage I or stage II disease 2. Postoperative confirmed R0 or R1 resection status with no evidence of residual disease based on radiographic Imaging 3. CA 199 less than 2 × the ULN by the central laboratory 4. No greater than 6 weeks since completion of prior therapy, which includes surgery with or without radiation or chemotherapy 5. Mucin 1positive tumor as determined by central immunohistopathology. Sites will be asked to submit archival tissue (patients may start the study if tissue is available at an outside hospital, but not yet requested or received) 6. Signed an informed consent form (ICF) 7. Willing and able to complete study procedures within the study timelines 8. Life expectancy of at least 6 months in the investigator's opinion 9. ≥ 18 years of Age 10. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 70%) 11. Normal organ and marrow function: serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 × ULN and serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN unless Gilbert's syndrome has previously been confirmed for the patient, white blood cells (WBCs) ≥ 3.0 K/µL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL, and platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L 12. Not pregnant, and if of childbearing potential, agrees to use a highly effective method of birth control (implanted, injectable, or oral combination hormonal method alone or in possible combinations, intrauterine device, vasectomized partner, or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of the study, and for 3 months after the last dose of Cvac. Male partners of a study patient must use a condom in addition to the acceptable method of contraception for the female partner as specified above 1. Active, acute, or chronic clinically significant infections or bleeding 2. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) or history of congestive heart failure (≥ Grade 2) 3. Active angina pectoris, stroke, or recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months) 4. Additional uncontrolled, serious medical or psychiatric illness 5. Evidence or history of central nervous system metastases 6. Inadequate renal function defined as a creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min as determined by the central laboratory 7. Additional malignancy diagnosed within 5 years of study enrollment, except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin 8. Treatment with any other investigational agent (for any condition) within 4 weeks of Screening 9. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or syphilis (Treponema pallidum [TPHA]) 10. Concurrent systemic treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressant agents at a dose considered by the investigator to be higher than a standard physiological dose 11. Active autoimmune disease; any previous autoimmune disease must not require chronic treatment in the 6 months prior to screening 12. Germany only: Oversensitivity to the substances or another component of the investigational medicinal product</criteria>
