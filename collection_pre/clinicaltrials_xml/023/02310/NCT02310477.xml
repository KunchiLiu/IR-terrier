	<brief_title>Regorafenib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer : a Cohort Study in the Real-life Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regorafenib (REG) is a multi-kinase inhibitor with survival benefits in patients with pretreated mCRC, as demonstrated in the phase III CORRECT study. As a result, REG has been made available for medical practice use in the US, and in the Europe. However, prescribing conditions in the real-life setting are known to be less stringent than selection criteria in clinical trials. The REgorafeniB in mEtastatic Colorectal cancer: a French Compassionate progrAm (REBECCA) is an ambispective cohort study designed to elucidate safety and effectiveness outcomes associated with REG as used in clinical practice for mCRC who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies. Patients were identified from the database of the French ATU (Temporary Authorization for Use), approved by the French Health Authorities to provide early access to innovative, not yet approved medicinal products such as REG. Baseline patient and tumor characteristics, REG dosing and dose-intensity, REG-related adverse events, pre- and post REG treatments, predictors of events, and effectiveness data (PFS, OS) were collected from patients who agreed, and whom physicians accepted to collaborate on the REBECCA cohort.</detailed_description>
