	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate whether walking capacity in patients with intermittent claudication is improved more by home-based 5+ exercise training than by current recommendations of daily walking. The study will elucidate if such a potential effect is dependent on changes in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, blood flow or both.</brief_summary>
