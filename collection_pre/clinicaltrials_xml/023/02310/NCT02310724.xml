	<brief_summary>The primary objective of T2P2 is to track the progression of T2D and related comorbidities and complications in the TODAY cohort as they transition to young adulthood. We hypothesize that: - Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) will progress rapidly and result in high rates of diabetes-related medical complications and comorbidities. - The rapid rate of progression is related to increased insulin resistance characteristic of puberty, worse Î²-cell function, degree of glycemic control, control of non-glycemic factors, and obesity itself.</brief_summary>
