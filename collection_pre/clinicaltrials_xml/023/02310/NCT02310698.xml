	<brief_summary>Breast tumors are often detected on mammography but may be harder to see in women with dense breasts. This is why screening breast ultrasound is sometimes used as another test in women with dense breasts. Ultrasound has been shown to detect additional cancers that are not seen on regular mammography. Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is a FDA approved form of mammography. It is essentially a routine digital mammogram performed after iodine dye (the same that is used with CT scans) is injected into a vein in the arm. Like screening ultrasound, CEDM has been shown to detect breast cancers that are not seen on a regular mammogram. The purpose of this study is to compare whether CEDM or screening breast ultrasound is better at detecting cancer. Both will be done in this study and compared to one another.</brief_summary>
