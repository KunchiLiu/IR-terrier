	<brief_summary>Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL), prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however, is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons, especially low-income minorities are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA) which the investigators hypothesize to be most effective in improving HIV clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
