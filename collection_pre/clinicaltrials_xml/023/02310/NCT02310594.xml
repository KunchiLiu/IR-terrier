	<brief_summary>This research trial studies the effect of radiation therapy on tumor immunity. Standard radiation therapy destroys tumor cells. In response to tumor cell death caused by radiation therapy, the body has an ability to stimulate an anti-tumor response (immunity), but this response is often ineffective in shrinking tumor tissue. Collecting samples of blood from patients before, during, and after radiation therapy to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the effects of radiation therapy on anti-tumor response.</brief_summary>
