	<brief_summary>Immature gastrointestinal functions increase the risk of poor growth as well as nosocomial infections and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in the preterm infant. The effects of probiotics on growth and development in premature infants have been investigated poorly. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 (S. boulardii) is a non-pathogenic probiotic yeast. Prophylactic supplementation of S. boulardii at a dose of 50 mg/kg twice a day appeared to bring preterm infants weight gain closer to that of intra-uterine growth rate, reduce feeding intolerance, and had no adverse effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Blinded Study on the Effect of Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 on Growth and Development in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate if feeding supplemented with S. boulardii can improve growth and clinical outcomes in preterm and low birth weight infants. A prospective, randomized case-controlled trial was conducted in infants with a gestational age of 30 to 37 weeks and a birth weight between 1500 to 2500 g. The study group received S. boulardii supplementation, 50 mg/kg twice daily, compared to no intervention in the control group. The primary outcomes were short term growth parameters including weight gain, linear growth, head and chest circumference, and secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes, feeding intolerance and complications. A total of 125 infants were enrolled in the study, 63 in the treatment and 62 in the control group. S. boulardii was administered for the first time at 2.63 days after birth (1 day to 6 days, 46 within 3 days, only 5 between 4 and 6 days).</detailed_description>
