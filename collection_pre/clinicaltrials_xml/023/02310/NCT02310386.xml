	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia is one the most common causes of chronic pain syndromes in women. It causes considerable costs in primary health care setting as well as specialized medical care sector.Electrotherapy and exercise therapy has shown to have short-term pain relieving effects in randomized controlled trials (RCT) among fibromyalgia patients. However, there is sparse knowledge about the effects of long-term RCTs in the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia, as there are no publications about cost-effectiveness analysis of such treatments. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the BEMER electromagnetic field therapy device has beneficial long-term effects in the treatment of pain, and whether it improves fibromyalgia patients' quality of life. In addition, this study investigates whether the BEMER device treatment is cost-effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BEMER in the Treatment of Pain in Fibromyalgia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participants of this study are working age female patients from the Central Finland Health Care District, and who have been treating because of severe pain. After eligibility has been assessed by health-related questionnaire and clinical examination, the participants will be randomly assigned into the treatment or control group. Treatment group patients will receive the loan activated BEMER-care unit, while controls will receive inactivated sham BEMER-unit. All participants will use the device regularly on a daily bases over three months. After one month treatment break, the treatment group will become a control group and control group will become a treatment group according cross-over design principle. Switching the groups will take place by changing the BEMER devices during the break. Throughout the study, both participants and researchers are unaware whether the participants are using activated or inactivated BEMER-devices. The research will be carried out and coordinated by Central Finland Central Hospital, and the research project will take place between September 2014 and December 2015.</detailed_description>
