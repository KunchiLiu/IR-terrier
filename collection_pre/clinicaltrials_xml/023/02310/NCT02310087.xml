	<brief_title>Oral Astaxanthin and Semen Quality, Fertilization and Embryo Development in Assisted Reproduction Techniques Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the study male patients diagnosed with oligoasthenozoospermia - with an abnormal sperm concentration and motility, irrespective of the morphology of spermatozoa - treated with their female partner with assisted reproduction techniques (ISCI) will be included. In the double blind study male patients will be given astaxanthin with vitamin E (study group, 40 patients) or placebo (control group, 40 patients) for three months prior to ART. In the study and the control group the quality of sperm (spermiogram), DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential of semen before and after the dietary supplementation will be evaluated. In the ART procedure (ICSI) the fertilization rate, the quality of embryos, pregnancy rates and miscarriages rates in 1st trimester will be compared between the study and control group.</detailed_description>
