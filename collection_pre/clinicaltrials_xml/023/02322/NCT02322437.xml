	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate whether psychiatric home treatment is an effective and efficient alternative to acute inpatient care in mental hospitals. A one-year prevalence cohort of psychiatric patients in need of hospitalization are randomly assigned to either treatment at inpatient wards (treatment as usual) or a new care model with the additional option of treating patients at their homes by mobile care teams. The primary focus is on checking whether optional home treatment leads to a reduction of inpatient days during a two-year follow-up period. In addition, the two service models will be compared regarding treatment cost and outcomes as well as satisfaction of patients and their relatives with psychiatric care. Furthermore, a sub-cohort of randomly chosen patients from the prevalence-cohort will be examined by a highly trained clinical assessor to test and verify the diagnoses and the clinical ratings made by the staff members of the mental hospital under routine everyday conditions.</brief_summary>

A one-year prevalence cohort of psychiatric patients in need of hospitalization are randomly assigned to either treatment at inpatient wards (treatment as usual) or a new care model with the additional option of treating patients at their homes by mobile care teams. The primary focus is on checking whether optional home treatment for crisis intervention leads to a reduction of inpatient days during a two-year follow-up period. In addition, the two service models will be compared regarding treatment cost and outcomes as well as satisfaction of patients and their relatives with psychiatric care. Furthermore, a sub-cohort of randomly chosen patients from the prevalence-cohort will be examined by a highly trained clinical assessor to test and verify the diagnoses (SCID-I and SCID-II) and the clinical ratings (HoNOS) made by the staff members of the mental hospital under routine everyday conditions.</detailed_description>
