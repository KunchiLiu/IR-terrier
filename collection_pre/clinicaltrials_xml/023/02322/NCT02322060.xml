	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators used the newly developed technique i.e. in vitro activation of dormant follicles (IVA) to promote ovarian follicle growth much more efficiently than natural, in vivo process for women with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).Firstly, the investigators remove one ovary under laparoscopic surgery. Then, we dissect ovarian cortex from the ovarian medulla. The ovarian cortex is cut into small cubes and cultured with medium containing drugs to activate dormant follicles. After 2 days of culture, the ovarian cubes are transplanted mainly beneath the membrane of Fallopian tubes under laparoscopic surgery. The ovarian cortex could be cryopreserve for future re-transplantation and in some cases, for convenience to arrange second surgery. Once frozen, the ovary can be preserved semipermanently. After transplantation, patients receive ultrasound monitoring together with measurement of serum hormone levels for 10-12 months. If growing follicles are detected, follicle growth is stimulated by injection of hormones (gonadotropins). Using the same "ovum pick up" approach used in IVF (in vitro fertilization), we pick up oocytes from the follicles and fertilize them. Fertilized eggs are cultured and then cryopreserved for future embryo transfer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Remove one ovary (maybe both ovaries depending on the condition) is performed by laparoscopic surgery. (Depending on the condition of patients, the investigators remove both ovaries to increase a chance to obtain residual follicles. Also, in some cases, the investigators need to perform laparotomy, i.e. open surgery, depending on the patient's condition). 2. Quickly dissect ovarian cortex from the ovarian medulla and cut into small stripes. Histological analyses are performed using small parts of the ovarian stripes to find residual follicles. 3. Optional: Cryopreserve the ovarian stripes by a vitrification method. Two days before the day of reimplantation, thaw the ovarian stripes. 4. The ovarian stripes are cut into small cubes (1 x1 mm2). The ovarian cubes are cultured with medium containing drugs to activate dormant follicles for 2 days before transplantation. After washing, the cubes are transplanted beneath the membrane of both Fallopian tubes and the remaining ovary under laparoscopic surgery. 5. Monitor follicle growth by ultrasound and serum hormone assays. Once follicles reach &gt;16 mm in diameter, patients receive hCG, followed by egg retrieval in ~36 hours. Then the investigators will perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using the husband's sperm. When embryos reached the four-cell stage, they were cryopreserved, waiting for frozen-thaw embryo transfer.</detailed_description>
