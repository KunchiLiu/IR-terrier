	<brief_summary>Investigators aim to assess sensitivity and specificity of transcranial doppler in determining intracranial hypertension in all patients admitted to intensive care unit for brain injury and needing Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring (according to international guidelines). Non invasive ICP measurement through the use of transcranial doppler will be carried out before and after standard invasive ICP monitoring placement; a head computed tomography (CT) scan will also be performed before and after interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Invasive Versus Non Invasive Measurement of Intracranial Pressure in Brain Injury Trial (IMPRESSIT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of intensive treatment of brain injury, intracranial pressure (ICP) should be controlled when the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) falls below 60-70 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) (depending on the cause of injury) and/or the ICP is greater than 20 mmHg. Intracranial hypertension (ICHP) occurs in approximately 40% of all patients with severe traumatic brain injury and is not infrequent in patients with non traumatic brain injury, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), and ischemic stroke (IS), and the presence of ICHP and inadequate CPP has been correlated to poor outcome. Therefore, measures to monitor ICP and CPP should be instituted as soon as possible in patients with severe brain injury. Currently, available methods for ICP monitoring include epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, parenchymal, and ventricular locations. Historically, ventricular ICP catheter has been used as the reference standard and the preferred technique when possible. It is the most accurate, and reliable method of monitoring ICP. Subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural monitors are less accurate. Unfortunately, all of the described methods are invasive, associated with a complication rate and are not inexpensive. For this reason, new methods have been developed in order to measure ICP non invasively. One of which uses Transcranial Doppler (TCD): by using a low-frequency-pulsed Doppler of 2 Mega Hertz (MHz) over the acoustic window regions—where the skull bone is thin—or at the foramen magnum, it is possible to measure flow velocities in the basal cerebral arteries. Many formulas have been described to correlate Flow Velocities and ICP: in our study, we use the method introduced and tested by Schmidt et Al. in 2000. Those authors observed a relationship among mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) diastolic flow velocity (FVd) and mean flow velocity (FVm) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) that led them to find a formula able to yield CPP (estimated CPP: ABP x FVd / FVm + 14); once CPP is estimated, ICPtcd is easily calculated (ICP= ABP- CPP). The first aim of our study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ICPtcd, compared to invasive ICP measurement, in order to exclude elevated ICP in patients with acute brain injury such as epidural hematomas (EDH), subdural hematomas (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), ischaemic strokes (IS), traumatic brain injury (TBI); the secondary outcome is the correlation of ICPtcd to ischemia on brain CT scan and to Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) at discharge and at three months. Inclusion criteria are: acute brain injury, patients requiring invasive ICP monitoring and Age &gt; 18 yrs; exclusion criteria are: inaccessible ultrasound window and patients who receive craniotomy before ICP probe placement. The sample size is about 250 patients. All patients included will have evaluation of non-invasive ICP monitoring through use of TCD (ICPtcd), and at least three TCD Measurements will be performed and correlated with non-invasive ICP. The timing for the TCD measurements and correlations will be as follows: - 1° measurement: will be performed before, and as close as possible, to ICP monitoring probe placement. - 2° measurement. Immediately following ICP monitoring probe placement; - 3° measurement: after ICP management optimization. A CT scan must be performed before the first measurement and after the third one. All patients will receive standard clinical treatment according to the international guidelines for the treatment of various types of brain injury.</detailed_description>
