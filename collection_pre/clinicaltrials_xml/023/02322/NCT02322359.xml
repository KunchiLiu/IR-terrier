	<brief_summary>Context: Chest compressions represent an important physical effort leading to fatigue and cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality degradation. Despite a known harmful effect of chest compressions interruptions, current guidelines still recommend provider switch every 2 minutes. Feedback impact on chest compressions quality during an extended cardiopulmonary resuscitation remains to be assessed. Study design: simulated prospective monocentric randomized crossover trial. Participants and methods: Sixty professionals rescuers of the pre-hospital care unit of University Hospital of Caen (doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers) are enrolled to performed 10 minutes of continuous chest compression on manikin (ResusciAnne®, Laerdal), twice, with and without a feedback device (CPRmeter®). Correct compression score (the main criterion) is defined by reached target of rate, depth and leaning at the same time (recorded continuously). Hypothesis: Feedback device delay fatigue effect arises during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</brief_summary>
