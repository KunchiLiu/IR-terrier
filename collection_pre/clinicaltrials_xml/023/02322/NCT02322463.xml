	<brief_summary>Early and appropriate pain management in the emergency department (ED) is an important aspect of child care. Studies in the adult population revealed that ethnicity might be associated with disparities in analgesia and opioid treatment in ED patients suffering from limb fractures. The investigators aim to explore if ethnicity has an influence on analgesic practice in the pediatric ED. The objective of this study is to determine whether minority population Arab children with orthopedic injuries are less likely than Jewish children to receive oxycodone for limb fracture.</brief_summary>
