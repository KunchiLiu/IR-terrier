	<brief_summary>This multistage, randomized, Phase II, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability and estimate the efficacy of cobimetinib + paclitaxel versus placebo + paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or locally advanced, triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast that have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). An open-label safety run-in stage of the combination cobimetinib + paclitaxel will undergo an Internal Safety Review before starting the enrollment of patients into the expansion double-blind stage of this study. Patients may continue on study treatment until the development of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal. The target sample size is 12 patients for the safety run-in stage and approximately 100 patients in the expansion stage.</brief_summary>
