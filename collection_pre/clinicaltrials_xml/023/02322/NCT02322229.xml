Broad VMT/sVMA &gt; 1500 microns in the study eye. History of vitrectomy in the study eye. History of laser photocoagulation to the macula in the study eye. Any relevant concomitant ocular condition in the study eye that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could be expected to worsen or require surgical intervention during the study period. Macular hole of &gt; 400 microns diameter in the study eye. High myopia in the study eye. Pseudoexfoliation, Marfan's syndrome, phacodonesis, or any other finding in the study eye that, in the Investigator's opinion, suggests lens/zonular instability. Aphakia in the study eye. History of retinal detachment in the study eye. Recent ocular surgery or ocular injection in the study eye within the past 90 days (including laser therapy). Proliferative diabetic retinopathy or ischemic retinopathies in the study eye. Retinal vein occlusions in the study eye. Exudative agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) in the study eye.
