	<brief_title>Peritonsillar Infiltration With Levobupivacaine for Posttonsillectomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>72 ASA I-II patients between 3 and 12 years of age who scheduled to undergo tonsillectomy were enrolled in this randomized, prospective and placebo-controlled study. The indications for tonsillectomy were recurrent infections and tonsillar hypertrophy leading to obstructive symptoms. The patients included to the study were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups to receive different concentrations of levobupivacaine or saline. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) of all patients were recorded during the whole anesthesia and surgical procedures. The duration of anesthesia and surgery were also recorded. Additional remifentanil 1 Âµgr kg-1 IV was administered to the patients if HR was increased by 25 % of the basal value. During postoperative period, symptoms such as pain, fever and dysphagia, adverse affects such as nausea and vomiting and hemorrhage were evaluated. Pain was evaluated by FLACC (Faces, leg, activity, cry, consolability), FPRS (Faces pain rating scale) ve Wong-Baker facies scales at postoperative 0, 30 and 60 minutes and 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Total analgesic consumption during the postoperative period were recorded. If the patients had no complication, they were discharged at the postoperative 24th hour.</detailed_description>
