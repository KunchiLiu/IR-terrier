	<brief_summary>Visceral obesity and adipose inflammation is considered a driving force of obesity-related systemic disease, e.g. liver cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Inflammatory resolution is actively regulated by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including the endogenous eicosanoid LXA4. Impairment of SPMs may underlie development of obesity-related pathology.We hypothesize that obese patients who develop obesity-related liver and kidney disease do so because they suffer from impaired endogenous production of pro-resolving lipids. This will result in aggravated adipose inflammation, which causes systemic pathologies such as kidney disease. We thus wish to investigate adipose inflammation and the pro-resolving lipid profile of obese subjects with and without CKD and liver disease. We also aim to investigate whether LXA4, LXB4 and other anti-inflammatory agents (such as AICAR) can alter the phenotype of human adipose macrophages in ex vivo tissue culture.</brief_summary>
