	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether the drugs prazosin and naltrexone will decrease alcohol cravings and drinking in individuals who have problems with alcohol and have used alcohol at risky levels in the past 90 days. Prazosin is a medication that is FDA approved for treating people with high blood pressure. Some studies have shown that prazosin may also decrease nightmares and improve sleep in Veterans suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The use of prazosin for PTSD nightmares is an off-label use. That means that the FDA has not approved prazosin for PTSD nightmares. The current study is evaluating an "off-label" use of prazosin to determine whether it is helpful in decreasing alcohol cravings and consumption among people with alcohol problems. Naltrexone is a medication that is FDA approved for treating alcohol problems. This study is sponsored by the Department of Defense and the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (DoD/CDMRP). We expect approximately 240 participants in this study, which will run over approximately 4 years. Study participants will be involved in the study for 7 weeks, or until they complete the Final Assessment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prazosin and Naltrexone (PaN) Study for Veterans With Alcohol Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the context of the proposed double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled study of prazosin and naltrexone participants will undergo two craving inductions, one oriented towards relief craving and the other towards reward craving. Daily IVR (Interactive Voice Recording System) data on craving and consumption and PTSD symptomatology will be collected during the 7 days immediately following the initial assessment visit to establish a pre-medication baseline. One hundred twenty individuals with adequate IVR compliance and whose screening lab tests indicate it is safe for them to take the study medications will enter the medication phase of the study within 14 days of the initial assessment initiating prazosin/placebo as well as 50mg naltrexone/placebo treatment. Randomization will be blocked by gender, PTSD status, and desire to abstain vs. desire to cut down. Prazosin will be titrated to three times daily dosing (9 am: 4mg; 3pm: 4 mg; 9pm: 8mg) at the end of two weeks. Naltrexone will be taken once daily 50 mg/day with no titration schedule. The stable dose of both medications will continue for four more weeks and medication compliance will be evaluated through pill counts, the IVR daily monitoring, and riboflavin trace in urine analysis. On approximately day 49 participants will come into the lab for the craving inductions (there will be a two week window after day 49 in which participants may still be seen if scheduling issues arise). The order of the craving inductions will be counterbalanced, and their administration will be separated in time by 30 minutes to minimize carry over between them. Subjective responses to the craving inductions will be obtained via relief oriented craving items and reward oriented craving items from the Desire for Alcohol Questionnaire. Participants will then be assisted in returning their craving levels to baseline prior to debriefing. They will all be offered VA or community referrals to treatment. Both prazosin and naltrexone can be safely discontinued without tapering.</detailed_description>
