	<brief_summary>HealthPROMISE is a mobile application (app) for patients that allows regular tracking of symptoms by patients and communicates them to physicians. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the impact of the HealthPROMISE application on improving patient outcomes. The trial will look at how much patients use the application, whether physicians change treatment in response to new information from patients, and how the patients quality of life change over the span of the study. The investigators hypothesize that HealthPROMISE will enhance physician-patient communication and improve clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial on Impact of HealthPROMISE Mobile App on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Care and Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will prospectively enroll about 300 patients with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis presenting at the Mount Sinai Health System. Eligible participants who complete the informed consent will fill a Tablet or Web-based questionnaire at the end of which they will be given a pin and offered to download the HealthPROMISE app or an education app. Patients who download HealthPROMISE app will then be requested to provide updates on quality metrics, a quality of life questionnaire, and emergency visits and hospitalizations. Data will be collected continuously throughout the study using the mobile health app. Study endpoints will primarily be assessed using "intention to treat" analysis. Additionally, per protocol analysis of data will be performed for patients who have logged into the application at least 4 times in 12 months. The total study duration will be 2 years (104 weeks). At 1 year (52 weeks), an interim analysis will be done to determine if study needs to be continued for full 104 weeks. Furthermore, patients in either arm who login using PIN but not completing week 52 (or week 104) exit survey will be considered as "lost to follow up".</detailed_description>
