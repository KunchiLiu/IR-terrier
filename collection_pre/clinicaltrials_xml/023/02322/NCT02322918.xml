	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if candidate polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) are predictive of psychosis disorder severity, symptomology, and resolution in patients at BCPP. A secondary objective will be to form a biorepository of blood and saliva samples from patients at BCPP so that further genetic, proteonomic and pharmacogenomic studies may be done to gain insight into the genetic basis of differences in psychosis disorder presentation and manifestation, and differences in response to antipsychotic drug treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The BC Psychosis Program Biobank and Database for Genetic Polymorphisms and Their Associations With Psychosis Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a population-based, genetic-association, candidate polymorphism study. It will involve a prospective and a retrospective component. A blood draw or saliva sample will be performed during the participant's admission to BCPP, which may occur at any point during the participant's length of stay. When a participant has been deemed 'Ready for Discharge' by his/her attending psychiatrist at BCPP, a full phenotype will be obtained via retrospective chart review. Genetic analyses and determination of protein levels will be performed after chart review. Following fulfillment of the primary study objective, the remaining blood and saliva samples will be stored in the biobank over the long-term.</detailed_description>
