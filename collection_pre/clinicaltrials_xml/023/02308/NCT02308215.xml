	<brief_title>Retinal Therapy Guided by 3D OCT Image Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study focuses on making better use of advanced three-dimensional imaging and analysis to allow physicians to know when a treatment is being effective and thus not overuse it. The study will examine how 3-D optical coherence tomography and related image analysis can be used to assess changes in the macula and retina of patients' eyes. These changes can reveal how well a person is responding to anti-VEGF treatment and thus help doctors provide proper treatment timing and care.</detailed_description>
