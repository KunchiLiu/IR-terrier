	<brief_summary>Heroin use has been related to brain dysfunction particularly in the prefrontal cortex. These effects are evident in neuropsychological impairments in attention, memory and executive functioning of heroin users. To assess these deficits and the application of a novel approach of cognitive stimulation to heroin users in treatment for opioid dependence, we have carried out a neuropsychological intervention program with mobile health technology. Patients diagnosed with opioid dependence were submitted to cognitive stimulation during four weeks in a three-day/week basis.</brief_summary>
