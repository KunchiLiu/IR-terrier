	<brief_summary>A pneumatic tourniquet is often used during total knee arthroplasty. However, its effect on postoperative outcomes as soft tissue damage resulting in delayed recovery remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to compare tourniquet use versus non-tourniquet use during total knee arthroplasty for short-term functional recovery.</brief_summary>
