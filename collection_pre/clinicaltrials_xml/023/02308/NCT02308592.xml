	<brief_title>Patient Decision Aid for Antidepressant Use in Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression in pregnancy is common, affecting up to 10% of women and represents serious risk to mother and infant. Unfortunately, antidepressant medication, a first-line treatment for depression in pregnancy, also comes with risks, making this a complex decision. Clinical care appears to be insufficient for ensuring that women make decisions that are consistent with their own values and with which they feel satisfied. Patient decision support tools can address such barriers. We have created a patient decision aid (PDA) that has the potential to improve the decision-making process for women regarding antidepressant use in pregnancy in conjunction with clinical care. The overall objective of this project is to inform the development of a larger, international RCT to assess the efficacy of our PDA for antidepressant use in pregnancy. To achieve this objective, we will assess the feasibility of our clinical trial protocol to evaluate the PDA and determine the preliminary effect size for a larger multi-site efficacy study. The primary outcome for this pilot study is the feasibility of conducting a large randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the PDA. This includes feasibility (how well the trial protocol can be implemented), acceptability (usability and tolerability of the intervention) and adherence (the degree to which the trial protocol is followed). We hypothesize that our protocol will be feasible, that the PDA will have a high degree of acceptability, and that adherence to the protocol will be high.</detailed_description>
