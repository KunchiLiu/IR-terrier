	<brief_title>Intravitreous Bevacizumab and Standard Metabolic Control for Diabetic Macular Edema - A Contrast Sensitivity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, masked and interventional study. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) 2, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) less than 11% and previously treated macular edema three months before will be randomized in two groups. The baseline examination consisted of visual acuity (VA), CS using the Pelli-Robson Charts, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Fluorescein Angiography for all eyes. The same tests will be repeated above, in both groups, again, in the week 2,6 and 12, when the data is then collected for analysis and so ended the closed phase. On the same day will start the open phase, which will be applied intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in both groups and the same tests of closed phase will be held in the week 14,18 and 24 when the study will be completed then [Table 1] . Patients will be monitored and controlled clinically including blood pressure measurements, laboratory blood tests such as blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, total cholesterol and fractions.</detailed_description>
