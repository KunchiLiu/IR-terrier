	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency is common in cardiorespiratory diseases and appears to contribute to a worse outcome. This human physiology study will examine the extent to which human skeletal muscle metabolism and exercise physiology are impaired by iron deficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Status and Human Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective double-blind randomised controlled study of the effect of endogenous iron status on skeletal muscle metabolism and exercise physiology. 32 healthy volunteers will take part, half of whom will be iron-deficient. The study involves a screening visit and two half-day visits during which assessments are performed. 50% of each group will be randomised to receive iron-repletion with ferric carboxymaltose at the end of the first experimental visit before returning to repeat identical assessments around one week later. This approach will make it possible to explore whether baseline differences in skeletal muscle metabolism are explained by differences in iron status per se, whilst controlling for any learning effect during participation in the study.</detailed_description>
