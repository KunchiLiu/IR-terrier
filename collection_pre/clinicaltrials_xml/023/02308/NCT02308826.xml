	<brief_summary>This project is intended to provide a rigorous test of the Turtle Program, an early intervention program for behaviorally inhibited preschoolers. The proposed project will extend promising pilot study findings by: (a) evaluating the integrated intervention in a larger sample (n = 150) of 45-64 month children and their parents, which will allow for an examination of mediators and moderators of treatment effects; (b) comparing the Turtle Program to the best available treatment for preschool behavioral inhibition, the Cool Little Kids (CLK) parent psychoeducation group; (c) examining heart rate reactivity and regulation as both baseline moderators of treatment response and as outcome measures; (d) examining parent anxiety disorders as a moderator of treatment response; (e) including a mid-treatment assessment and extending follow-up to one year.</brief_summary>
