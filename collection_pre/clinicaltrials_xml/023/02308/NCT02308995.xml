	<brief_title>Barbed Sutures Versus Conventional Sutures in Laparoscopic Excision of Endometrioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several authors reported the use of barbed sutures in myomectomy , hysterectomy and closure of vaginal vault. A recent meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of laparoscopic suturing using barbed suture or conventional sutures in myomectomy or hysterectomy revealed that suturing with barbed sutures was associated with less suturing time and operative time. Although numerous studies revealed the advantages of using barbed sutures , no studies have yet evaluated the use of barbed sutures in laparoscopic excision of endometrioma. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare operative data and early postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic excision of endometrioma using barbed sutures with those of laparoscopic excision of endometrioma using conventional sutures.</detailed_description>
