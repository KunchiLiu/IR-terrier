	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators want to measure the impact or effects of adding cryostimulation to the conservative care of chronic lateral epicondylitis. The rapid fall in skin temperature above the injured tissues is presume to have a positive effect in the healing process. The combination of conservative care and cryostimulation could then be appreciated. The investigators chose to measure these effects with 3 elements: visual analog pain scale, validated elbow questionnaire and pain free grip strength. This pilot study consist in a two arm design, each arm including 15 patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Adding Cryostimulation to Conservative Care Help in Managing Chronic Lateral Epicondylitis? a Pilote Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral epicondylitis is one of the most prevalent upper limb conditions that can affect up to 1-3% of the active population. Invalidity and health care costs incurred by this condition are posing a real challenge to our societies knowing that the natural history of the lateral epicondylitis can last from 1 to 2 years. Many therapies have been tested and so far none has proven conclusive when used alone so far (Blanchette and Normand 2011). The use of cryostimulation is widespread in the sport scene without strong literature supporting its evidence. The aim of this study is to quantify the effects of cryostimulation when added to conservative care in the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylitis. Thirty (30) patients will be divided randomly in two groups: - The control group (n=15) will receive conservative care including myofascial trigger points (involved forearm) and radial head mobilisations (Bergmann &amp; Peterson, 2010). - The experimental group (n=15) will receive the cryostimulation and the conservative treatment as mentioned above. A total of eight treatments will be given to each patient; the whole protocol lasting four to six weeks. The treatments will be delivered by experienced and trained clinicians in cryostimulation and myofascial treatment protocols. The effects of the two treatment protocols will be monitored by a validated elbow questionnaire (PRTEE, (Rompe, Overend et al. 2007)), a visual analog pain scale and the pain free grip strength at three moments: at inclusion, at the ninth visit and 3 months after the last treatment.</detailed_description>
