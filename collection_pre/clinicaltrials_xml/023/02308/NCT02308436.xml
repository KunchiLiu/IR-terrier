	<brief_summary>In vitro results showed a protective effect against acids for the mouthwash containing Curolox™ peptide. The goal of this in situ study is to detect the Curolox™ peptide under natural oral conditions on the tooth surface and to proof the in vitro results obtained. So far there are no effect and safety data of the Curolox™ mouthwash under natural oral conditions available.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is the detection of the Curolox™ peptide on the bovine enamel sample (proof-of-concept) under in vivo conditions after rinsing with the peptide-containing mouth wash. Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are: 1. safety and tolerance of the mouthwash in participants 2. identification of the duration the Curolox™ peptide is present on the bovine tooth surface under in vivo conditions 3. identification of the most effective mouthwash rinsing volume (2.5 mL or 5 mL) 4. prophylactic effect of multiple applications of the mouthwash confirmation of the prophylactic effect of the Curolox™ peptide obtained in in vitro study</detailed_description>
