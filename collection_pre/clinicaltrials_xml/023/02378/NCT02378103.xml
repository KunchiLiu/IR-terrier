	<brief_title>A Single-center Trial of Patients With Aortic Dissection in the Chinese XinJiang Province</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidemiological features of risk factors for aortic dissection (AD) in China were obtained from developed population in east of China, however, such information was not available for the remote population. Moreover, people in the western region have significant difference with developed population in lifestyle, diet, ethnic and so on. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate epidemiological features of risk factors for AD in Chinese remote patients. We anticipated that this analysis would provide helpful information preventing and controlling AD in Chinese XinJiang Province.</detailed_description>
