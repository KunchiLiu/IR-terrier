	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation of the Modified Rayner Monofocal Aspheric 600C (With Axis Marks) Intraocular Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Cataract</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female aged ≥21 years of age. Cataract for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior IOL implantation has been planned for the operative eye. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) projected to be better than 20/30 (+0.18 logMAR) in the operative eye after cataract removal and IOL implantation. Calculated IOL power requirement within the range +8.0 to +34.0D If present, subject must have corneal astigmatism of &lt;1.50 D in the operative eye. Expected dilated pupil size ≥ 5.0 mm in diameter to visualise the axis markings Subject must provide written informed consent. Subject must be able to return for scheduled followup examinations for 24 months after surgery. History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery in the operative eye. Microphthalmia Corneal decompensation or endothelial insufficiency Pseudo exfoliation Pars planitis Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders in the operative eye (e.g.,macular degeneration or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future visual acuity losses to a level of 20/30 (+0.18 logMAR) or worse. Inability to achieve secure placement in the designated location e.g. absence of a secure peripheral anterior capsule, zonule laxity or dehiscence; posterior synechiae to the capsular bag Active ocular disease in the operative eye, e.g., clinically significant dystrophy, chronic severe uveitis, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or chronic glaucoma. Concurrent participation in another drug or device investigation. Patients who are expected to require retinal laser treatment. Females who are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant during the study.</criteria>
