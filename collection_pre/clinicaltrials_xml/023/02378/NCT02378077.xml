	<detailed_description>This study is being done to determine whether eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) play an important role in human fat metabolism and inflammation. This study is being done to determine if fish oil supplement could play a role in reducing inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity in your fat tissue.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Lean, healthy person with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less, or you are obese, BMI between 30 and 50, and nondiabetic. Lean healthy controls will not be on any medication and will be undergoing elective abdominal surgery excluding those involving acute inflammation (i.e. acute cholecystitis, bowel perforation, or diverticulitis). Obese, nondiabetic subjects will have a BMI between 30 and 50 and be taking no medications affecting glucose metabolism or lipid metabolism. These subjects will be identified from a pool of patients undergoing an elective abdominal surgical procedure such as inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, planned cholecystectomy, but also bariatric surgery. Volunteers will not be taking corticosteroid therapy or have a history of asthma, COPD or atopic syndrome. All subjects will undergo a medical history intake and a physical examination followed by an OGTT to confirm normal glucose.</criteria>
