We propose to (1) identify the needs of medical interpreters working with cancer patients, and (2) develop and test a psychoeducational resiliency program at 3 DF/HCC cancer centers: MGH, DFCI, and BWH) intended to enhance interpreters' skills to effectively manage stressful encounters and to cope with the personal effects of encounters.</detailed_description>
