	<brief_title>Interventional Validation of an MDS-Specific Measure of Quality of Life: Assessing the Responsiveness of the Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale (QUALMS-1) to Different Hypomethylating Agent Regimens for Low and Intermediate Risk Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete questionnaires twice during your participation in the 2014-0112 study. During your first treatment visit, you will be asked to complete the QUALMS-1 questionnaire and another questionnaire that asks about your well-being. After your 4th cycle of treatment or when you stop receiving treatment, you will be asked to complete the QUALMS-1 questionnaire again and another questionnaire to rate any changes in your health since you started the study. It should take about 20 minutes total to complete the questionnaires each time. Information will also be collected from your medical record. This information will include the results of lab tests and other information relating to your health. Length of Study Participation: After you complete the questionnaires the second time, your participation in this study will be complete. This is an investigational study. Up to 240 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 40 will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
