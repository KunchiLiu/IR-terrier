	<brief_summary>This study compares the lung clearance index (LCI) in cystic fibrosis and healthy children obtained with two different multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBWN2) devices. Each participants will perform the test (LCI) in duplicate on each device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Breath Nitrogen Washout in Healthy and Cystic Fibrosis Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using nitrogen as the inert gas, there are currently two commercially available devices that offer the possibility to measure the LCI. However, comparison between them are lacking. The 2 MBWN2 devices are the "EasyOne Pro Lab" (ndd Medical Technologies, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland) and the "Exhalyzer D" (Eco Medics AG, Duernten, Switzerland).</detailed_description>
