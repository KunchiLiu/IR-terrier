	<brief_summary>Severe childhood obesity is associated with both immediate and chronic health problems and a severe impact on psychosocial development. Medical and behavioural interventions rarely result in the significant, durable weight loss necessary to improve health outcomes. This is a randomised clinical trial where 50 adolescents, 13-16 years of age, will be randomised to either early bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) or intense conservative treatment and possibly surgery as they have become 18 years.</brief_summary>
