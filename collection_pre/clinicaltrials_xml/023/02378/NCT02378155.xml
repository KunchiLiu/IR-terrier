	<brief_summary>Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique that measures regional cerebral oxygenation in a non-invasive manner. Through the use of near infrared light, the difference between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin can be measured. By applying the Lambert-Beer law, a numeric result can be calculated. Since atrial fibrillation (AF) has been linked with an increased risk for the development of neurocognitive deficits, a longer period of AF might be associated with a higher risk for neurocognitive deficits. It is hypothesized that there is an increase in the regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) of patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF after successful cardioversion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Oxygen Saturation Measurement During Cardioversion Because of Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Written informed consent by the patient is asked before cardioversion and participation in the study. Patient anamnesis is assessed by standardized questionnaire. Patients perform several standardised neurocognitive tests to obtain a general view on the neurocognitive status (auditory verbal learning test, mini-mental state examination, trail making A and B, digit-symbol coding and RAND 36 Health Survey). Cerebral oxygenation is observed during cardioversion by means of the SenSmart Model X-100 (Nonin). Additional parameters (pulse oximetry, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure, 6-lead electrocardiography (ECG), left ventricular ejection fraction) are recorded. All measurements are performed non-invasively. Patients receive standard treatment following the clinical guidelines.</detailed_description>
