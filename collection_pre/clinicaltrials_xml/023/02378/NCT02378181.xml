	<brief_summary>This study deploys a strategy to develop and evaluate a training-efficient, multimedia patient-centered Health Education Toolkit to promote shared decision making between counselors and patients. An existing evidence-based toolkit intervention will be adapted and redesigned by a patient and provider team into an engaging, narrative graphic novel curriculum useful in group and individual counseling. The proven behavioral interventions will be augmented with health education material focused on medication assisted treatment (MAT) and HIV risk reduction. We will test whether exposure to the Toolkit (TK) can reduce substance use and HIV risk, while increasing engagement with MAT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing the Effectiveness of a Graphic Novel Health Education Curriculum for Patients With Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An existing evidence-based toolkit intervention will be adapted and redesigned by a patient and provider team into an engaging, narrative graphic novel curriculum useful in group and individual counseling. The proven behavioral interventions will be augmented with health education material focused on medication assisted treatment (MAT) and HIV risk reduction. Together, these materials will comprise the Health Education Toolkit. The Health Education Toolkit (TK) will employ a shared decision making model to encourage 1) increased recovery engagement by patients, and 2) patient engagement in deciding whether to initiate and adhere to MAT. We will conduct a two-year, randomized controlled trial of 350 patients with active alcohol substance use disorders (SUDs) enrolled in outpatient treatment and will follow them over 6 months. We will test whether patients randomized to receive the TK curriculum will demonstrate larger reductions in substance use (drug and alcohol) and increases in abstinence, b) more attendance at specialty substance abuse intervention and treatment sessions, c) greater rates of initiating MAT for alcohol dependence, and d) reduced HIV transmission risk behaviors and greater rates of HIV testing over the 6-month follow-up period as compared to patients receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU).</detailed_description>
