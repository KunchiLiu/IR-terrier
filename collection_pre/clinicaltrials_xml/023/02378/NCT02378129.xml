	<detailed_description>Subjects will require to have at least two teeth in different hemiarchs with dentin hypersensitivity. Teeth will be randomized into 2 groups, receiving either Clinpro XT or the conventional glass ionomer cement Vidrion R. Prior to the desensitizing treatment (baseline), painful symptoms will be assessed by tactile and air blast tests using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Treatment evaluations will be conducted up to 2-year post-treatment.</detailed_description>
