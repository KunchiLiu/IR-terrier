	<brief_summary>Many male patients complain about their ejaculation: 21-30% of men aged between 18 and 59 have admitted suffering from a decrease in, or loss of control of, their ejaculation. The quality of life of patients and their partners is impaired compared to men not suffering from premature ejaculation. Economically, the impact of the disease are significant. In the year preceding the detection of premature ejaculation patients visit twice their physician. The majority of men interviewed anonymously, in their General Practitioner's ( GP's) waiting room, considered it important to talk with their GP about their sexual concerns. Almost half of them preferred that their GP initiate any discussions about sexuality. More than two thirds of the respondents would have liked their GP to signal his or her open-mindedness by directly addressing sexual topics during the consultation. In 2008 a qualitative study brought to the fore the strategies used by GPs to initiate the discussion on premature ejaculation . GPs who mentioned premature ejaculation with their patient described three attitude-related strategies and three investigative strategies.</brief_summary>
