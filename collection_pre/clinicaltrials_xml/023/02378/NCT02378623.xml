	<brief_summary>Patients with a patent foramen ovale in the setting of endocardially placed cardiac implantable electronic devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators, or resynchronization therapies are likely at higher risk for paradoxical embolic events from device lead thrombus. The investigators are conducting this study to determine if the anticoagulant medication Apixaban is more effective at reducing MRI detected brain lesions compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patients With Patent Foramen Ovale and Endocardial Device Leads on Apixaban for Prevention of Paradoxical Emboli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT). 400 patients who meet the study eligibility criteria and consent for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention with apixaban or control group with placebo. The randomization will be performed by a computer generated block randomization protocol. The majority of patients will begin intervention with Apixaban or placebo at the time of cardiac device placement (n approximately 300), and at least a quarter of the randomized patients (n ≥100) will include preexisting CIED (≥6 months) in place. Each patient will undergo a baseline MRI and a comprehensive cognitive screening examination. Repeat MRI and cognitive assessment will be performed at a follow-up period of two years from date of randomization (or less if clinical stroke/TIA occurs prior to this follow-up period). All subjects will receive a phone call at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months post-randomization to assess for endpoints and adverse events, as well as changes in clinical status, medications, and to assess study medication compliance.</detailed_description>
