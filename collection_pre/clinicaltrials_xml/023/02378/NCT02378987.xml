	<brief_summary>The aims of this study: 1. to investigate the difference in motor speech functions among children with cerebral palsy (CP) of different motor severities. 2. to investigate the longitudinal in motor speech functions at 6 months follow-up phase among children with CP of different motor severities. 3. the correlation between motor severity, personal factors, family factors, language ability and motor speech in children with CP. 4. to identify the variables that can predict motor speech functions in children with CP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Follow Study of Speech Functions in Preschool Children With Cerebral Palsy: Clinical Measures and Acoustic Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mental impairment, language and speech disorders are the common associated problems in children with CP. Previous studies focus on language and motor speech dysfunctions in children with CP at school-age child, adolescents and adults. Few literatures identify the determinants for predicted the motor speech performance in these children. It is important issue to follow-up the language and motor speech functions in children with CP. These data will provide clinicians for outcome prediction and goal setting.The aims of this study: (1) to investigate the difference in motor speech functions among children with CP of different motor severities, and(2) to investigate the longitudinal in motor speech functions at 6 months follow-up phase among children with CP of different motor severities, and(3) the correlation between motor severity, personal factors, family factors, language ability and motor speech in children with CP, and(4) to identify the variables that can predict motor speech functions in children with CP.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects between the ages of 48 years old children. 2. Subjects which aged 7 years or older should sign a consent form by themself. 3. In line with the assessment, the case must be able to follow simple verbal commands, and can be done in a simple sentence description. 4. were diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy. 1. physiological condition is unstable: Included in three months for surgery or infection and other major diseases 2. there is progressive or degenerative symptoms or diseases (such as degenerative epilepsy), peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury. 3. visual perception or hearing problems, after correction difficult communicators. 4. other movement disorders patterns for children with cerebral palsy (athetoid type, offset type, etc.).</criteria>
