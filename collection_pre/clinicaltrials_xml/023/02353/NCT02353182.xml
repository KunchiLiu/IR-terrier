	<brief_summary>Animal studies suggest general anaesthetics harm the developing brain. It is unclear if these findings are relevant to humans but the issue has become a major concern. Recent data have found that monkeys exposed to anaesthesia as infants grow up to have slower learning than those not exposed. The aim of the TREX pilot study is to determine the feasibility of an alternative anaesthetic regimen for lower abdominal/lower extremity surgery in infants 1-12 months of age.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Animal studies suggest general anaesthetics harm the developing brain. It is unclear if these findings are relevant to humans but the issue has become a major concern. Recent data have found that monkeys exposed to anaesthesia as infants grow up to have slower learning than those not exposed. The aim of the TREX pilot study is to determine the feasibility of an alternative anaesthetic regimen for lower abdominal/lower extremity surgery in infants 1-12 months of age. An alternative anaesthetic regimen comprises a dexmedetomidine-based anaesthetic, augmented with an opioid (remifentanil) and a regional nerve block (such as a caudal). This open label prospective single arm pilot study will enrol 60 infants aged 1-12 months scheduled for lower limb, urologic, or lower abdominal surgery. After sevoflurane induction, the infants will have a caudal anaesthetic and intravenous dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. The outcome will be need for intervention for light anaesthesia, intervention for haemodynamic changes and rate of abandoning the protocol. Recovery times will also be recorded.</detailed_description>
