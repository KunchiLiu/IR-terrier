	<brief_summary>Since high risk prostate cancer requires higher radiation, this study is being done to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation to the prostate and pelvic regions. Also to determine the feasibility and safety of each treatment fraction by using cone-beam Computed Tomography(CT) information and high speed Graphics Processing Unit based computation treatment planning systems. We also plan to determine the safety of treatment to the prostate. Health-related quality of life will be measured as part of current clinical practice. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or to safely escalate dose to the pelvic nodal using 90 day acute toxicity endpoint - Determine feasibility and safety of adaptive real time re-planning of the pelvic nodal region at each treatment fraction by using cone-beam CT (CBCT) information and high speed GPU based computation treatment planning systems - Determine the safety and tolerability of 9.5 Gy per fraction in five fractions (47.5 Gy total dose) to the prostate - To follow tumor related outcomes (i.e. PSA control, progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis (DM) free survival, and overall survival (OS) - Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured as part of current clinical practice Patients in each dose cohort will all be treated as a single group for dose escalation. There will be two levels of dose escalation—to prostate lesions and to pelvic lymph node region. Prostate/SV PTV will be treated at a fixed dose of 9.5 Gy per fraction for 5 fractions (47.5 Gy) based on our previous phase I/II study experiences. The starting dose for the dose escalation to the pelvic region PTV will be 4.5 Gy per fraction for 5 fractions (total dose= 22.5 Gy). Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive an additional 0.5 Gy per treatment (total 2.5 Gy per escalation). The starting dose for MRI-visible prostatic lesions will be 10 Gy and subsequent cohorts will receive an additional 0.5Gy per treatment (total of 2.5Gy per escalation).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be accrued in alternating dose levels. The two distinct areas of dose escalations (pelvic lymph node and prostate lesion) will take place one at a time. Minimum waiting periods will be assigned between each dose cohort to observe toxicity. The phase I portion of the study will be completed when dose limiting toxicity is reached or when a sufficiently high dose level (i.e.,5.5 Gy per fraction to a total 27.5 Gy for pelvic lymph node region and 11Gy per fraction to a total of 55Gy to the prostate lesion), is attained to consider the therapy likely to be efficacious. All patients will be treated with a total of 24 months of androgen suppression therapy (ADT). Radiation therapy will start 8-12 weeks after initiation of ADT. No. Patients for each cohort: 7-15 Cohort 1: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 4.5Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 50 / 22.5 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 2: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 50 / 25 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 3: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10.5 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 52.5 / 25 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 4: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10.5 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5.5 Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 52.5 / 27.5 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes Cohort 5: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 11 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5.5 Gy per fraction to pelvic lymph node region for 5 fractions for a total of 47.5 / 55 / 27.5 Gy to Prostate+SV /Prostate lesions/Nodes</detailed_description>
