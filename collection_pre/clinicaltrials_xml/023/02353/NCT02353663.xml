	<brief_summary>Rheumatic heart disease remains a major challenge in low and middle income countries. Early detection of clinically silent valvular lesions by screening echocardiography allows timely implementation of secondary antibiotic prevention, and may prevent progression of disease to severe valvular damage and heart failure. The objective of the study is to assess the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease among schoolchildren in Arequipa, Peru. Subsequently, the investigators will evaluate progression of disease in children with early stages of subclinical rheumatic heart disease. The investigators will perform a population-based observational survey for rheumatic heart disease using portable echocardiography among schoolchildren aged 5 to 16 years from randomly selected public and private schools. Rheumatic heart disease will be documented both according to the modified World Health Organization definition and the echocardiographic criteria suggested by the World Heart Federation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rheumatic Heart Disease in Peru: Prevalence and Cardiovascular Outcomes Among Schoolchildren</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rheumatic fever complicated by rheumatic heart disease continues to be a major contributor to morbidity and premature death in low- and middle-income countries where it accounts for up to a quarter of a million deaths every year. Rheumatic fever results from an autoimmune response to groups A streptococcal pharyngitis and may progress to rheumatic heart disease with cumulative exposure. Data on prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in Latin America is scarce and ranges from 1.3/1000 as assessed by cardiac auscultation to 4.1/1000 as assessed by echocardiography. Secondary antibiotic prevention and inclusion of patients with rheumatic heart disease in a registry with close follow-up has been demonstrated to reduce the cardiovascular sequelae associated with disease progression. The natural course of early, clinically silent stages of rheumatic heart disease is largely unknown. Disease regression has been reported in up to one third of children with early morphological valvular changes consistent with rheumatic heart disease. Objective The objective of the study is to assess the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease among schoolchildren in Arequipa, Peru. Subsequently, the investigators will investigate progression of disease in children with early stages of subclinical rheumatic heart disease. Methods The investigators will perform a population-based observational survey for rheumatic heart disease using portable echocardiography among schoolchildren aged 5 to 16 years from randomly selected public and private schools. Rheumatic heart disease will be documented both according to the modified World Health Organization definition and the echocardiographic criteria suggested by the World Heart Federation. Children diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease will be started on secondary antibiotic prevention and included into a prospective registry with longitudinal follow-up.</detailed_description>
