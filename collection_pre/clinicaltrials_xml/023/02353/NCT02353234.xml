	<brief_summary>The consumption of wholemeal cereals has been associated with the reduction of several chronic diseases. The mechanisms behind these protective effects may be linked, besides dietary fiber and micronutrients, to an increased intake of phenolic compounds, mainly, hydroxycinnamates contained in the bran. Among bran fractions, aleurone usually contains the highest concentration of ferulic acid, principally contained as monomeric form and diferulic acid esters linked to arabinoxylans, representing the most relevant subclasses. The aim of the study was to evaluate the absorption of hydroxycinnamates by measuring the urinary excretion of phenolic metabolites in humans fed with two different kind of a commercial bread, as wholegrain bread and a white bread enriched with aleurone fraction. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of the main phenolic compounds was also evaluated by measuring the circulating metabolites in plasma samples.</brief_summary>
