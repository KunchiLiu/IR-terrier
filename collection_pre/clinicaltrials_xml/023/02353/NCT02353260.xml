	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ultrasound Hyperthermia Combined With Chemotherapy on Oral and Maxillofacial-Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a non-invasive treatment, Ultrasound Hyperthermia has received increasing interest for the treatment of cancer.Many studies have shown that Therapeutic Ultrasound is safe and effective. Eligible patients were randomly assigned by using permutated blocks designed for each site to receive either Ultrasound Hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy (Arm A) or chemotherapy alone(Arm B).Chemotherapy will be conducted as follows. For Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck,it will be administrated with Docetaxel(at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area and intravenous infused in 1 hr at day 1rt), Cisplatin(at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area and intravenous infused in 1 hr at day 1rt) and Fluorouracil(at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area and intravenous infused last 5 days) . For other types of cancer,the treatments will be administrated in accord with the guideline.In addition,Ultrasound Hyperthermia will be conducted 5 times(day 1rt,3rd,5th,7th,9th) in Arm A. Patients in arm B will receive chemotherapy only. One cycle comprises a period of 3 weeks (21 days).All patients will receive 2 cycles in both arms. All the patients eligible for the operation will take surgery. After treatment，some patients with advanced unresectable cancer may be down-staged from stage IV, and will regain the opportunity of operation.</detailed_description>
