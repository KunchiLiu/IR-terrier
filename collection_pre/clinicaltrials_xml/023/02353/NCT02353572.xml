	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the safety and best dose of melphalan and bortezomib when given prior to an autologous stem cell transplant and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may help melphalan work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving chemotherapy before an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Giving melphalan together with bortezomib prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan and Bortezomib Prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of melphalan and bortezomib followed by a phase II study. Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) continuously on days -5 to -2 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days -4 and -1. Patients also receive dexamethasone IV on day -1 prior to the second dose of bortezomib. Beginning two days after completion of melphalan infusion, patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Eligible patients may undergo a second transplant 2-4 months after completion of the first transplant. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for at least 1 year and then every 3-6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
