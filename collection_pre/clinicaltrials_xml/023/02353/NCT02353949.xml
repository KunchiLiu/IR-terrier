	<brief_summary>The study examines subjects where there might be an indication for Amyloid-PET according to the Criteria defined by the Amyloid Imaging Task Force. In these subjects the impact of a Flutemetamol-Positron-Emission-Tomography -Scan (PET) on clinical management and disease course will be studied over 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Dementia expert considers an Amyloidscan appropriate according to Amyloidimaging task force criteria (AIT) after counseling by an AmyloidPET expert 1. Patients with persistent or progressive unexplained MCI 2. Patients satisfying core clinical criteria for possible AD because of unclear clinical presentation, either an atypical clinical course or an etiologically mixed presentation 3. Patients with progressive dementia and atypically early age of onset (65 years or less in age) 4. other situations where preambles of AITCriteria are fulfilled Preambles of the AITCriteria are fulfilled 1. A cognitive complaint with objectively confirmed impairment 2. AD as a possible diagnosis, but when the diagnosis is uncertain after a comprehensive evaluation by a dementia expert 3. When knowledge of the presence or absence of Abeta pathology is expected to increase diagnostic certainty and alter management Diagnosis was established in a memory clinic or by an experienced physician in dementia diagnostics The diagnostic procedures comprise in minimum MRI, neuropsychology, routine blood test for exclusion of symptomatic causes MMSE &gt;15 Competency to consent Trial partner willing to support study physician Written informed consent by both patient and trial partner Understanding of German language allowing performing neuropsychological testing Treating physician willing to collaborate with the study team Evidence for cognitive impairment mainly attributed to another underlying medical condition (e.g. medication, substance abuse, brain tumor, severe heart insufficiency, hepatic encephalopathy) Clinically significant depression MRI exclusion criteria PET exclusion criteria 1. Allergy to Flutemetamol or any of its constituents 2. History of severe allergic reactions to drugs or allergens 3. Pregnancy or lactation</criteria>
