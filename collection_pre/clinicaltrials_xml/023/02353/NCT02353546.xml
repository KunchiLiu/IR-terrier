	<brief_summary>Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully (CALM) is a brief psychotherapy designed to alleviate distress in advanced cancer. In an earlier intervention-only pilot trial, CALM was associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and death anxiety and an increase in spiritual wellbeing. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) of CALM and to identify preliminary effects in advanced cancer. This phase 2b pilot RCT employed intervention and usual care arms with 3 and 6 month follow-ups. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and secondary outcomes included diagnosis of major depression (SCID), death anxiety, attachment security and spiritual wellbeing. Multilevel regression was used to compare change over time between groups. 60 patients with advanced cancer will be recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada, and equally randomized into intervention and usual care conditions.</brief_summary>
