	<brief_summary>This is a Phase One study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of intravenous artesunate in patients with solid tumors. A rapid dose escalation design will be used, in which single patients will be enrolled to escalating dose levels until a grade 2 or higher toxicity occurs during cycle 1. Enrollment will then continue using 3 to 6 patients at each dose level until a dose is reached at which 2 or more patients out of 6 experience a treatment-related toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Intravenous Artesunate for Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A rapid dose escalation design will be used, in which single patients will be enrolled to each dose level until a grade &gt;/= 2 treatment-related toxicity occurs during cycle 1; enrollment then will proceed using a classic 3+ 3 dose escalation design. If the toxicity was grade 2, then enrollment will continue on that dose level. If the toxicity was grade 3 or 4, then enrollment will continue on one dose level below that dose. Dose escalation with the 3+3 design will continue until &gt;/= 2 patients out of 6 experience a treatment-related dose-limiting toxicity. Then, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of intravenous artesunate will be one dose level below the level at which the toxicities occurred.</detailed_description>
