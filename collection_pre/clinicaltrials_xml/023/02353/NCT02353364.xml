	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) for infertility patients of advanced maternal age undergoing assisted reproductive treatment. Half of the patients will have their embryos tested by PGS and 1 or 2 chromosomally normal embryos with the highest morphological grading transplanted back to the uterus. The other half of the participants will not have their embryos tested and 1 or 2 untested embryos with the highest morphological grading transplanted back to the uterus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PGS is an assisted reproductive technology that screens patients embryos, discriminating between embryos with a normal set of chromosomes (euploid) and those with an abnormal set of chromosomes (aneuploid). In this study, we will apply a novel validated next generation sequencing technology called copy number variation sequencing (CNV-Seq) to comprehensively screen a trophectoderm biopsy sample from patient's embryos for chromosomal abnormalities that commonly arise in human embryos. The hypothesis is that PGS performed using CNV-Seq on embryos produced by patients with a poor prognosis for pregnancy (maternal age &gt; 35), followed by transfer of chromosomally normal euploid embryos, will result in significantly higher implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates and lower miscarriage rates compared to patients having no PGS.</detailed_description>
