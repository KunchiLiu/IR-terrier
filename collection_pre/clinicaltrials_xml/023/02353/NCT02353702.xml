	<brief_summary>Upper abdominal surgery is known to induce such pulmonary complications as pneumonia, atelectasis, pleural effusion. The post operative diaphragmatic dysfunction participates to these complications and lasts for 7 days after upper abdominal surgery. The sniff-test is a recognized tool for measuring the diaphragmatic function.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of parietal analgesia with continuous infiltration of local anesthesic on diaphragmatic function after upper abdominal surgery through a subcostal incision. Our main outcome is to measure the diaphragmatic function with the sniff test in 44 patients with parietal infiltration of ropivacaine and in 44 patients with placebo. Our secondary outcomes are the evaluation of the effect of continuous parietal analgesia with ropivacaine on IPmax and EPmax, oxygen saturation, post operative pulmonary complications and post operative recovery. This prospective study will determine if the pre peritoneal local infiltration of ropivacaine is useful to decrease post operative diaphragmatic dysfunction.</brief_summary>
