	<brief_title>OcuStem Nutritional Supplement in Diabetic Patients With Mild to Moderate Non-proliferative Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of a nutritional supplement, OcuStem, on mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this condition blood vessels in the back of the eye, an area termed the retina, are deteriorating. OcuStem contains ingredients that have previously been demonstrated in clinical trials to stimulate a type of cell, called "endothelial progenitor cells" to increase in circulation. Animal studies have shown that increasing endothelial progenitor cell numbers inhibits progression of diabetic retinopathy. The hypothesis of the study is that a 6 month course of OcuStem will reduce progression of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 years One or both study eyes per subject may be enrolled. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is present: 1. Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes 2. Current regular use of oral antihyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes 3. Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria. The study eye must meet the following: 1. Presence of microaneurysms or at least mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (level 20 or higher) on clinical exam. 2. No presence of centerinvolved diabetic macular edema (DME) as evidenced by OCT central subfield thickness &lt;250 microns(or spectral domain OCT equivalent). 3. Visual acuity light perception or better. A current ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual acuity might be affected now and/or may need to be treated (e.g., DME, foveal atrophy, pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition (cataract ), epiretinal membrane or vitromacular traction) or during the course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc.). A history of a major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery including cataract removal anticipated within the next 4 months following enrollment.
