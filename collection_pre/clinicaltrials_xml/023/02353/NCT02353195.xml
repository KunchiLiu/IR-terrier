	<brief_title>Effects of Radio-frequency in Patients With Myofascial Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: University community. Patients with myofascial chronic neck pain with active MTrP in one upper trapezius muscle were involved. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: a radiofrequency group (RFG), who (14 patients) received 8 sessions of a monopolar capacitive resistive radiofrequency (MCRRF) application over the upper trapezius muscle and ten patients received 8 sessions of placebo radiofrequency (PG) over the same muscle. Main outcome measures: Visual analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI) and cervical range of motion (pre-treatment, immediately post-first session treatment and post-treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged between 18 and 60 years with myofascial chronic neck pain. The area of neck pain was defined as the cervical region, possibly with referred or radiating pain into the occiput, nuchal muscles, shoulders and upper limbs. Symptoms had to have been present for at least six months before. At least one active MTrP in one upper trapezius muscle had to be present. For bilateral neck pain, the most painful side was designated for treatment. Severe disorders of the cervical spine, such as spinal stenosis, disk prolapse, postoperative conditions of the neck and shoulder areas, history of severe trauma, whiplash, spasmodic torticollis, instability, migraine, peripheral nerve entrapment, fibromyalgia, shoulder diseases, inflammatory rheumatic diseases, severe psychiatric illness and pregnancy.</criteria>
