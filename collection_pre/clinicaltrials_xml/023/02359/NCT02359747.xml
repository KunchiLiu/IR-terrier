	<brief_summary>try to find genomic DNA in culture medium after the embryos develop on Day 3 and Day 5 also in single step culture media. using direct PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction and also WGA Whole Genome Amplification before PCR and sequencing of the samples to find the point mutation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Human Genomic DNA in Embryo's Culture Media Targeting on a Single Gene Disease and Point Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human fertilized oocytes were individually cultured from Day 1 to Day 3, and from day 3 to days 5/6, in 10 ul medium. A total of 100 samples (50 spent media from Day 3 and 50 from Day 5/6) will be use in the study. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) amplifiability will be evaluated in embryos culture media by quantitative PCR on a multicopy gene target (TBC1D3). Quantification will be made with a standard curve constructed with genomic DNA (with culture media -day 3 and day5-, to take into account media inhibitory effects) TSPY1 amplification will be use to assess the presence of Y chromosome WGA followed by PCR on a single copy gene (MTHFR gene) will be performed on a subset of some samples to monitor the C677T polymorphism (genotyping by sequencing) WGA followed by PCR on a single copy gene (MTHFR) will be also performed on blastocoele fluids</detailed_description>
