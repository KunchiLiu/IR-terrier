	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies steady state blood volume maps using ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite magnetic resonance (MRI) in imaging patients with glioblastoma. MRI is a procedure in which radio waves and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. Contrast agents, such as ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite, may enhance these pictures and increase visibility of tumor cells and the blood vessels in and around the tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steady State Blood Volume Maps Using Ferumoxytol Non-stoichiometric Magnetite MRI in Imaging Patients With Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Testing if steady state (SS)-cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are superior to dynamic susceptibility contrast-(DSC)-CBV maps in visualizing of brain tumor blood volumes. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Development of the SS-CBV mapping for quantitative CBV estimation. II. Assessment of therapeutic response. III. Association with survival. IV. Correlation of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) with histology. V. Assessment of late ferumoxytol (ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite) enhancement at various stages of disease. OUTLINE: Patients receive 2 doses of gadoteridol intravenously (IV) and undergo MRI including DSC or dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE)-CBV mapping over approximately 45-60 minutes on day 1. Within 3 days, patients receive 3 doses of ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite IV and undergo MRI including DSC and SS-CBV mapping after each dose over approximately 90 minutes. Patients undergo MRI without contrast 24 hours after ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite over approximately 30 minutes. This 3 day series of imaging repeats at different stages of disease and may be performed up to 5 times: prior to surgery, prior to chemoradiation therapy, 4-6 weeks post-chemoradiation therapy, at time of progression on gadolinium MRI per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, and again at time of progression (if the previous time of progression showed pseudoprogression). After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
