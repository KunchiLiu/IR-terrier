	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients aged 65 years or older who had undergone surgical or non operative management of odontoid nonunions were sorted and their dataset of follow up monitoring was examined for completeness and accuracy. According to our inclusion criteria, patients with complete sets of collected data and a followup examination of at least five years after treatment of the non union were finally enrolled in this study. Collected data included variables, such as age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture type, associated injuries, presence and severity of primary neurological deficits, primary treatment, clinical and neurological outcome after primary treatment, methods of treatment, clinical and radiographic outcome after treatment of the nonunion, as well as morbidity and mortality of the patients. Exclusion criteria for this study contain patients with previous or subsequent surgery at the cervical spine level, patients with incomplete data sets, as well as patients with penetrating mechanism of injury or congenital cervical spine anomalies. Incomplete data set was determined, if pertinent clinical or radiographic data of follow up monitoring (e.g. documents of clinical findings or functional results, radiographs, CTscanning, e.g.) were missing.</criteria>
