	<brief_summary>Background: The Local infiltration analgesic (LIA) technique has been widely used to reduce opioid requirements and improve the patient's mobilization after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the evidence for LIA in THA remains to be clarified. Purpose: To evaluate whether a single shot LIA in addition to a multimodal analgesic regimen reduces acute postoperative pain and opioid requirements after THA.</brief_summary>
