	<brief_title>FTIH - Single and Repeat Oral Doses of FDL169 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is the first time in human study and consists of two parts. Part 1A: Part 1 of the study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, first-time-in-human study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profiles following single oral administrations of FDL169 to healthy male volunteers. Sixty-four (64) male subjects (8 per cohort) will be included in Part 1 of the study. Up to eight dose levels of FDL169 are planned to be tested in Part 1 of the study. Part 1B: Open label. Following completion of Part 1A of the study, an additional cohort of 8 subjects will receive a single dose of FDL169 in both fasted and fed states Part 2: Part 2 of the study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profiles following multiple oral administrations of FDL169 to healthy male subjects. Forty-eight male subjects, in cohorts of twelve, will be included in Part 2 of the study. It is planned to test up to four dose levels of FDL169 in Part 2.</detailed_description>
