	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, proof of concept three-site study, to evaluate the effect of Rasagiline in the regional brain metabolism on 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rasagiline Rescue in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of two phases: a 24 week double blind placebo controlled treatment period and a 4 week follow up period. Patients will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio at baseline to receive either Rasagiline or matching placebo The study drug will be given as 0.5 mg dose once daily for the 4 weeks, then increases to 1 mg daily for the next 20 weeks. A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled: 25 will receive Rasagiline and 25 will receive matching placebo for the 24-week treatment period. Primary objective is to determine if exposure to 1 mg of Rasagiline daily is associated with improved regional brain metabolism in the treatment group compared to the placebo group in Alzheimer's Disease patients</detailed_description>
