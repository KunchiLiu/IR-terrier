	<brief_title>Shift Characteristics Affect Handover Duration and Rates.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim in this study was to analyze the independent factors affecting handover duration in Emergency Department. Our secondary aim was to identify the factors affecting the Emergency Department handover rates. To better analyze independent variables, we dichotomized the data. First, we dichotomized handover duration into two groups according to the median handoff time of 20 minutes. Second, we divided handover rates into two groups using the median rate of handovers per shift, which was 3.87%.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The day and night shift handover , which are the interactive, verbal, bedside, and facetoface interactions between the outgoing and incoming medical staff, were included. Handover locations other than bedside (n=3), handover methods except verbal communication (by paper (n=2)), and the use of information technology (n=1) were excluded to standardize the procedure.</criteria>
