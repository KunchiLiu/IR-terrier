	<brief_summary>Anti-VEGF agents are given for a variety of previously untreatable eye diseases. The last years indications for their use and consequently the number of patients needing treatment, have been increasing. Most patients require multiple injections. This has resulted in many eye departments administering thousands of injections per year, also at St Olavs University Hospital Trondheim. To cope with this increase in workload, it would be helpful if injections would be given not only by the physicians but also by the nurses. This study's objective is to compare efficiency, patient satisfaction and cost per patient of injections given by nurses and physicians.</brief_summary>
