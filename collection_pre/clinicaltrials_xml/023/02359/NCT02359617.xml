	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Sensing at the Site of Subcutaneous Insulin Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of type 1 diabetes usually comprises the measurement of glucose in blood obtained by finger pricking and the administration of insulin via subcutaneous bolus injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion. This study seeks to test a new treatment approach where glucose sensing and insulin administration are combined and performed at a single subcutaneous tissue site (single-port treatment approach). A single-port device consisting of a continuous glucose sensor and an insulin infusion cannula is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of 10 type-1 diabetes patients and used for insulin infusion and simultaneous glucose sensing over a 7-day period. The performance of the single-port device is assessed by comparing the obtained glucose readings with those of a blood glucose meter and an additionally worn control sensor.</detailed_description>
