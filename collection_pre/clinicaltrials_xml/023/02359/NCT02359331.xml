	<brief_summary>As increasing the antibiotics resistance, the effectiveness of traditional Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) therapies has been declined coincidentally. In this study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of H. pylori eradication between a 7 days personalized therapy for H. pylori infection based on the results of antibiotics resistance by using H. pylori culture and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the 14 days bismuth contained quadruple 2nd rescue regimens, and the investigators analyzed the prevalence of the antibiotic resistance after 1st eradication of H. pylori in the tailored therapy group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of the 7 Days Tailored Therapy as 2nd Rescue Therapy for Eradication of H. Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients who had shown the evidence of persistent H. pylori infection after the 1st eradication were enrolled for this study. After giving the informed consent about the method and efficacy (ITT and PP analysis) of the 14 days bismuth quadruple 2nd rescue therapy and the 7 days tailored therapy for H. pylori infection based on culture and MIC, the patients were randomly classified into the two regimen group under the patient's agreement and underwent 2nd eradication [14 days bismuth-based quadruple therapy (Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) regular dose b.i.d., tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg q.i.d. (three tablets at 30 min before meals and one tablet at 2 hours after dinner), metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d.), or 7 days tailored therapy based on H. pylori culture and MIC (select the 2nd rescue regimen between 7 days of bismuth-based quadruple therapy or 7 days moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy (PPI regular dose b.i.d., moxifloxacin 400 mg q.d., and amoxicillin 1g b.i.d.) according to antibiotics susceptibility. This study was designed to evaluate the success of eradication for enrolled participants by methods of an open labelled randomized prospectively.</detailed_description>
