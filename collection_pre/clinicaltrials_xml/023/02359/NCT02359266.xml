	<brief_title>Vitamin D Improves Depression in Liver Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic liver diseases regularly suffer from vitamin D deficiency and depression. A recent meta-analysis reported an inverse correlation between depression and vitamin D levels. Indeed, vitamin D receptor is present and genomic and nongenomic vitamin D receptor-mediated signalling has been described in brain. This intervention study investigates whether vitamin D therapy ameliorates depressive symptoms in chronic liver disease patients. The investigators hypothesise that depressive symptoms will improve upon vitamin D replacement therapy.</detailed_description>
