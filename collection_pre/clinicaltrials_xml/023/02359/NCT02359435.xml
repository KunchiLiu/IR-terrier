	<brief_summary>Reverse hybrid therapy is a one-step two-phase treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection with less cost than standard triple therapy. Whether reverse hybrid therapy can replace standard triple therapy as the recommended first-line treatment is unknown. The investigators compared the efficacy of 12-day reverse hybrid therapy and 12-day standard triple therapy in first-line treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For this multicentre, single-blind, and randomized-controlled trial (REHYTRI study), the investigator recruited patients with H pylori infection. Using a computer-generated randomization sequence, the investigator randomly allocated patients to either 12-day reverse hybrid therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg for the first 7 days, followed by pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g for another 5 days; with all drugs given twice daily) or a 12-day standard triple therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1 g for 12 days; with all drugs given twice daily) at a 1:1 ratio. Our primary outcome was the eradication rate by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.</detailed_description>
