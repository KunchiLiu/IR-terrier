	<brief_summary>The current project was designed to examine dynamic changes in muscle wasting during sepsis. Researchers will focus the mitochondrial dysfunction of muscle cells and investigate the role of HO-1 in it. Researchers interested in identifying factors involved in the pathology of muscle wasting during sepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HO-1 and Muscle Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid muscle atrophy or muscle wasting occured to septic patients.Sepsis induced muscle wasting has become a severe, frequent, and persistent complication among critically ill patients. Multiple factors including ubiquitin-proteasome system, proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress contribute muscle proteolysis. It is known that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) possesses a variety of functions like anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-apoptosis effects. In order to investigate the mechanisms under the condition, researchers are going to examine the role of HO-1 in muscle atrophy during sepsis.</detailed_description>
