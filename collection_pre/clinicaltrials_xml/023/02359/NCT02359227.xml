	<brief_summary>Planned enrollment is approximately twelve subjects with stable chronic heart failure. Enrolled subjects will receive up to eight sequential days of continuous, stepwise, dose increasing, subcutaneous (SQ) infusions of open-label cenderitide via the Insulet Drug Delivery System. Planned infusion rates of cenderitide will be administered to subjects continuously during four, 48-hour infusion periods.</brief_summary>
