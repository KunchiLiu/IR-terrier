	<brief_title>Administration of Pre-Operative Gabapentin to Patients Undergoing Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the influence of immediate pre-operative gabapentin administration on acute postoperative pain. We hypothesize that immediate post-operative pain will be improved with pre-operative administration of gabapentin. We plan to conduct a prospective randomized trial to assess the effect of a single immediate pre-operative dose of gabapentin 300mg on immediate post-operative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopy for gynecologic indications. This concept has been studied in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. We aim to study the effect on patients undergoing laparoscopy.</detailed_description>
