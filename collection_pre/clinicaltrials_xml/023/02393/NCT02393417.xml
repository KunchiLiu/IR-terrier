	<brief_summary>This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind (subject, Investigator, and site staff with the exception of unblinded dedicated staff to handle study medication), phase 2a study with 3 dose cohorts, randomized (concealed) to CANDIN or placebo (3:1). Main study will be up to 20 weeks (10 doses administered every other week) or until a subject has complete resolution of all injectable common warts. Subjects who cannot tolerate dosing every 2 weeks due to a local tolerance issue may be injected at 3-week intervals for up to 10 doses, increasing the length of the study to 29 weeks. Subjects will be followed for 4 months after final injection(s) for evidence of new or reoccurring warts and for safety evaluation.</brief_summary>
