	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a self-administered vibration therapy treatment on neck pain, disability and pressure pain thresholds in patients with non-specific neck pain and myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). The investigators hypothesized that patients receiving vibration therapy would report less perceived neck pain, disability and present higher PPTs after receiving vibration therapy when compared to a control no-treatment group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Vibration Therapy Over Neck Myofascial Trigger Points</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are a common source of (regional) pain in patients presenting with musculoskeletal pain. Mechanical vibration has been suggested as a treatment for pain relief. In this study, the effects of vibration therapy on people with non-specific neck pain and MTrPs were investigated. Seventeen chronic non-specific neck pain patients were randomly assigned to a treatment (vibration group, n = 9) or control group (n = 8). Vibration group received 10 self-administered sessions of vibration therapy (45-50 Hz for 15 minutes with the subject laying in supine). Perceived neck pain and disability and pressure pain thresholds over MTrPs of the upper trapezius and levator scapulae bilateraly were measured at baseline and after the first, five and 10 treatment sessions.</detailed_description>
