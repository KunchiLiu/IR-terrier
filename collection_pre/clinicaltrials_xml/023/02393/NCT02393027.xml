	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is a degenerative disease affecting the dopaminergic system. Clinical symptoms of IPD commonly begin after the loss of at least 40 to 50% of striatal dopaminergic terminals (specially putaminal terminals). The Dopamine neuronal transporter (DAT) is a highly expressed protein in the membrane of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals. The use of a DAT's radioligand in the initial stages of the disease would lead to an early detection of nigral cell loss. Currently, only one DAT's radioligand has obtained marketing authorization in France, the 123I-FPCIT, for use in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Otherwise, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a more sensitive technology than SPECT with higher resolution has become for a few years the new gold standard for visual analysis and quantification of neurotransmission systems (including the dopaminergic system). A DAT tracer labelled with Carbon 11 ([11C] PE2l) have been developed and is currently used as a reference in various research centers. However, in order to enable a clinical use of this tracer (which currently can't be because of the too short period of Carbon 11), the unit INSERM U930 "Imaging and Brain" in collaboration with the CERRP (Center for Studies and Research on Radiopharmaceuticals) developed a new version of this tracer, labelled with 18-fluor: the [18F] LBT-999. The main goal of this study is to compare the [18F] LBT-999 uptake between a group of patients suffering from a Parkinsonien syndrome to a group healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
