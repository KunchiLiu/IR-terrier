	<detailed_description>Having developed many tools to determine fall risk of 65 years and older patients, Angers University Hospital plans to develop a corrective action to prevent the occurrence of falls in this population. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a physical activity program with 3 difficulty levels (depending on the patient's risk of falling): easy (low fall risk), moderate (average fall risk) and difficult (high fall risk). The implementation process should be simply and fastly applicable in practice for routine care by paramedics.</detailed_description>
