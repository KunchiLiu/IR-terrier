	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effect of selected antioxidant vitamins and minerals supplement B-Carotene (6 mg) + Vit.C (200 mg) + Vit.E (200 mg) + Vit. Nicotinamide (20 mg) + Selenium (200 mic.)+ Zinc oxide (8 mg) + Copper oxide (1mg) +Mangeneschloride (1.8 mg) in patients with mild Graves' orbitopathy according to EUGOGO classification.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of a New Antioxidant Combination (ASTED) on Mild Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To determine total eye score (NOSPECS severity score) before and after treatment in each of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well as an inter-arm comparison. 2. To determine Score of thyroid eye disease Quality of life questionnaire (TED-QOL) before and after treatment in each of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well as an inter-arm comparison. 3. To determine clinical activity score (CAS Score) before and after treatment in each of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well as an inter-arm comparison. 4. To determine Serum thyroid auto-antibodies (Anti thyroid peroxidase (TPO), Anti-thyrogluboline) and Thyroid function test (Free T4, T3, and TSH) level before and after treatment in each of the three arms of the study and make a before - after as well as an inter-arm comparison. 5. To determine the rate of side effects in each arm and make a comparison.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Mild TED of less than 18 months duration (as recorded by the patient). 2. No active state (Clinical activity score of less than 3). 3. No previous specific therapy for TED, except for local measures (artificial tear, head elevation, low salt diet). 4. Euthyroidism as a result of remission after a course of antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy, or euthyroidism for at least 2 months since commencing ATD or after thyroidectomy, or euthyroidism for at least 6 months after radioiodine therapy. Hypothyroid patients after thyroidectomy or radioiodine were replaced with levothyroxine. Euthyroidism was defined as normal serum free thyroxine, total or free triiodothyronine concentrations, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels below 4 mU/Liter Patients were kept euthyroid for the whole duration of the study. 5. Age 1870 years. 1. TED severity of more than mild TED. 2. Pregnancy 3. Drug and/or alcohol abuse 4. Severe concomitant illness 5. Inability to comply with the study protocol 6. No informed consent 7. Use of selenium or vitamin/mineralscontaining preparations in the last 3 months. 8. Developing more severe TED in the course of the trial so that requires steroid treatment.</criteria>
