	<brief_title>Retroprospective Real Life Observatory of Eribulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one third of patients treated for localized breast cancer will present a metastatic evolution and 5% of patients are metastatic immediately. At this stage, the malignancy is incurable with a median survival from 2 to 3 years. Metastatic breast cancer treatment is part of a multidisciplinary approach. These two objectives are to prolong survival and improve quality of life. At present, there is no standard after the first line of chemotherapy, with fe strategy studies Eribulin is now a new therapeutic option to consider. Many patients have benefited from this treatment option and it seems interesting to evaluate in real life the effecacy and tolerance of chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
