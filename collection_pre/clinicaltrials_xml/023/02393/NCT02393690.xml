	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well iodine I-131works with or without selumetinib in treating patients with thyroid cancer that has returned or has spread from where it started to other places in the body. Many thyroid cancers absorb iodine. Because of this, doctors often give radioactive iodine (iodine I-131) alone to treat thyroid cancer as part of standard practice. It is thought that the more thyroid tumors are able to absorb radioactive iodine, the more likely it is that the radioactive iodine will cause those tumors to shrink. Selumetinib may help radioactive iodine work better in patients whose tumors still absorb radioactive iodine. It is not yet known whether iodine I-131 is more effective with or without selumetinib in treating thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iodine I-131 With or Without Selumetinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rate at 6 months following treatment with 131I (iodine I-131) in combination with placebo or selumetinib for radioactive iodine-avid (RAIA) recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the best overall response following treatment with 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib for RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer. II. To compare the progression-free survival of patients with RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib. III. To compare serum thyroglobulin changes for patients with RAIA recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib. IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib for patients with RAI-avid recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of RAIA tumors for signatures that correlate to therapeutic benefit achieved with 131I in combination with placebo or selumetinib. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) starting on week 1, day 1 and continuing through 2 days after iodine I-131 therapy has been administered. Approximately 3 weeks after beginning treatment with selumetinib, patients receive iodine I-131 PO. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID starting on week 1, day 1 and continuing through 2 days after iodine I-131 therapy has been administered. Approximately 3 weeks after beginning treatment with placebo, patients receive iodine I-131 PO. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer Histological or cytological confirmation of thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin (including papillary, follicular, or poorly differentiated subtypes and their respective variants); note: medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers are excluded; Hurthle cell carcinomas are excluded (defined as having an invasive tumor composed of &gt; 75% oncocytic [Hurthle] cells lacking the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma, tumor necrosis, and marked mitotic activity); patients with oncocytic (Hurthle cell) variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma (defined as a tumor composed of a majority of oncocytic [Hurthle] cells having the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma) are eligible to participate RAIavid lesion on a radioiodine scan (a diagnostic, posttherapy, or postablation scans) performed =&lt; 24 months prior to registration, which suggests that therapy with 131I is justifiable in the judgment of the investigator At least one measurable site of disease; (NOTE: a malignant lymph node is considered measurable if 1) it is noted to be RAIavid on radioactive iodine imaging [diagnostic or posttherapy whole body scans acceptable] and it measures &gt;= 1 cm in the long axis, 2) it is pathologically proven to be involved with thyroid cancer [by cytology or pathology] and it measures &gt;= 1 cm in the long axis, or 3) its short axis is &gt;= 1.5 cm when assessed by computed tomography [CT] scan) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2 Able to swallow and retain orallyadministered medication with no clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/mm^3 Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt;

NOTE: patients with less archival tumor tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with the Study Chair; receipt of archival tumor tissue is not required for study registration and initiation of therapy Willing to provide mandatory blood samples for correlative research purposes 131I therapy =&lt; 6 months prior to registration; Note: 131I administered solely for diagnostic purposes is not considered 131I therapy External beam radiation therapy =&lt; 28 days prior to registration; note: previous treatment with radiation is allowed if the investigator judges it will not compromise patient safety on the study Having been treated with a total cumulative (lifetime) 131I therapeutic activity &gt;
