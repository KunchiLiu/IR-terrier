	<brief_summary>Factors affecting the success of the treatment of infertility can evaluate before and after embryo transfer in two stages. Most of the patients reach the embryo transfer stage. Unfortunately, the investigators are able to intervene very few of the factors that will affect the success of the post-transfer. All factors and treatments that affect the implantation is vital to identify. Basically, healthy vasculature is essential for a successful implantation. The investigators will try to understand relationship between vascular resistance and type of infertility. The investigators will examine whether the effect of the ovarian uterine and spiral artery resistance over infertility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparative Analysis of Arterial Blood Flow in Unexplained Infertility, Tubal Infertility and Fertile Groups</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the investigators will examine whether the alterations of doppler indices in the uterine, ovarian and spiral arteries can help to explain tubal or unexplained infertility as a standard screening method. Patients in unexplained-tubal infertility groups were treated in our IVF clinic. Patients will be invited to the hospital according to the criteria of the study. Fertile patients will be selected according to the criteria for patients who have come for the annual smear control. The study hypothesis is that the resistance in ovarian, uterine and spiral artery doppler will be higher in cases with tubal and unexplained infertility as opposed to low resistance in fertile women.Ovarian, uterine and spiral artery pulsatility index (PI = (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) / time averaged velocity and resistance index ( RI= (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) / peak systolic velocity ) will measure with doppler ultrasonography in the mid-luteal phase ( 21th day). Measured values are to be compared.</detailed_description>
