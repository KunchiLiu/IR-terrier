	<brief_title>Romidepsin Plus Cisplatin in Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related death in American women. Despite recent improvement in the treatment of breast cancer, 40,000 women per year still die in the U.S.as a result of breast cancer. Once the disease has gotten worse (progressed) after standard chemotherapy treatments, there are limited treatment options and the likelihood for patients to recover is very small. The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of romidepsin combined with cisplatin that results in no serious side effects. The safety and efficacy of romidepsin combined with cisplatin will be assessed, along with the determination of how long this drug combination will keep the disease from getting worse. The study will be done in two phases: Phase I will determine the highest dose of romidepsin that is safe and tolerable to take in combination with cisplatin. Phase II will determine if taking romidepsin (at the dose determined in Phase I) in combination with cisplatin is safe and effective in treating patients with breast cancer. Phase I will complete before Phase II begins.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet at least one of the following two criteria: 1. Histologically proven TNBC 2. Confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, regardless of subtype of breast cancer Breast cancer that is either stage III disease not amenable to curative therapy or stage IV Have at least one measurable lesion of ≥ 2 cm by conventional methods or ≥ 1 cm on spiral CT No limit to prior therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Prior treatment with cisplatin is excluded, unless prior cisplatin treatment was given in the neo/adjuvant setting. All other platinum compounds are allowed as long as it has been 6 months since last platinum exposure. All patients should have received at least one line of chemotherapy in either the advanced or adjuvant setting and hormonal therapy (where appropriate). Participants who have previously been treated with endocrine therapy only, and later develop triple negative disease are eligible as long as they have had one line of chemotherapy in either the advanced or adjuvant setting.

Women of child bearing potential and their partners must use contraception prior to study entry, continuing for 5 weeks after treatment. Subject has received any anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, targeted therapy, or any investigational therapy within either 14 days or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter), prior to study drug administration. Subjects who have not recovered to within one grade level (not to exceed Grade 2) of their baseline following a significant adverse event or toxicity attributed to prior treatment. Other medical or psychiatric disorder placing the subject at undue risk for treatment complications Subject is pregnant or lactating Subject has previously been treated with a Histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor Subject has inflammatory breast cancer Subject has a known hypersensitivity to cisplatin or romidepsin Subject has a concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years of study enrollment (with the exception of adequately treated, basal or squamous cell carcinoma, nonmelanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer or prior ovarian/breast cancer in patients with BRCA associated breast cancer). Subject is classified into ChildPugh Class C Subject has a known history of HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection (testing is not mandatory) Subject has active, uncontrolled infection Subject has symptomatic/untreated CNS disease Subject has active or a history of cardiac disease including: Congenital long QT syndrome Corrected QT interval (QTc) interval ≥ 500 ms on the screening ECG (using the corrected QT interval to Fridericia's formula [QTcF]) Myocardial infarction within 6 months of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).
