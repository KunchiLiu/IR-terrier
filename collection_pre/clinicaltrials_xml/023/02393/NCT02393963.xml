	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial in patients undergoing elective Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) and Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The study group will receive intra-articular Tranexamic Acid (TXA) while the control group will receive normal saline placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-articular Tranexamic Acid in the Reduction of Blood Transfusions in Primary Total Hip and Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine if intra-articular administration of low dose TXA following THA and TKA results in a clinically relevant reduction in blood loss. The secondary purpose is to determine if there is an increased risk of thromboembolic phenomena with the use of TXA following elective THA and TKA. The primary outcome metric will be - drop in hemoglobin following surgery; secondary metrics include blood loss, transfusion rate, d-dimers, troponin levels, symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke), major and minor bleeding, and death.</detailed_description>
