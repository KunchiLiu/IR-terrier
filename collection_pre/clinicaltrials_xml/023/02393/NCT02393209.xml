	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MLN1117 when administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MLN1117 administered alone and in combination with docetaxel at the RP2D in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With or Without MLN1117 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being evaluated in this study is called MLN1117. MLN1117 is tested in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study consists of 2 phases: - Phase 1b - dose escalation phase - Phase 2 - expansion phase. Approximately 15 patients with NSCLC who have been treated with multiple prior lines of therapies will be enrolled for Phase 1b. The participants will receive docetaxel (36 mg/m2) intravenous (IV) and MLN1117 tablets, orally administered, once daily in 21-day dosing cycles. The MLN117 dose will be escalated until recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. Up to 140 adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC refractory or resistant to 1 prior line platinum-based, non-docetaxel containing systemic chemotherapy or have previously failed 1 second line therapy with an immune-checkpoint inhibitor will be enrolled for Phase 2 (dose expansion). Phase 2 expansion study uses a sequential, multistage Bayesian adaptive design and will consist of up to 3 parts evaluating the following patient populations: - Part 1: NSCLC (inclusive of both squamous and nonsquamous histology and all PIK3CA genotypes) - Part 2: Histology-specific NSCLC (either squamous or nonsquamous) - Part 3: Histology- and genotype-specific NSCLC (PIK3CA MUT/AMP positive squamous NSCLC if squamous histology is selected in Part 2) Each part of the adaptive Phase 2 portion of the study is designed as a stand-alone, randomized study evaluating PFS as the primary efficacy measure in a total of 60 patients between the 2 treatment arms: MLN1117 plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. An event-driven analysis of PFS will be performed after each part of Phase 2. On the basis of the PFS analysis of the preceding part of the study, the study may be stopped for efficacy or futility, or proceed to the next part. Study drug will be administered in 21-day dosing cycles. During each phase of the study, patients will be treated with a maximum of 9 cycles of either docetaxel alone or docetaxel plus MLN1117. Subsequently, pPatients treated with docetaxel plus MLN1117 may continue to receive MLN1117 monotherapy until progression of disease, occurrence of unacceptable toxicities or death. The maximum duration of treatment for patients will be 12 months unless it is determined that a patient would derive benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months. Patients will continue to be followed after discontinuation of study drug to collect PFS and OS data. Patients may withdraw from therapy at any time. This multicenter trial will be conducted in North America and in Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous). For Phase 2 of the study:, has a diagnosis of mixed squamous and nonsquamous (or adenosquamous) NSLC. Has locally advanced or metastatic disease (Stage IIIb or Stage IV) with radiographically or clinically evaluable lesions. Has experienced failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen: For Phase 2 of the study: Participants must have received 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen (excluding a docetaxelcontaining regimen) for advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIb or Stage IV) disease followed by documented PD. A drug provided as maintenance therapy following cytotoxic chemotherapy will be considered to be part of that regimen. Participants who received prior therapy with paclitaxel as a part of the platinumbased doublet frontline regimen without PD on therapy. Participants who, after the frontline, platinumbased, nondocetaxelcontaining chemotherapy, have been treated with 1 line of nivolumab or other immunecheckpoint inhibitors but progressed on or after the therapy. For Phase 1b of the study: Participants who have experienced failure of multiple lines of prior chemotherapy are eligible. For Phase 2, has archived or fresh tumor biopsy samples (obtained during screening) sufficient for genotyping. Has adequate organ function, before the first dose of study drug. Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. Female participants who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit or are surgically sterile, or are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 30 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling) after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence. Female participants must agree to not donate eggs (ova) during the course of this study and for 30 days after receiving their last dose of MLN1117 and, for docetaxel, for as long as is mandated by local labeling. Male participants agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of MLN1117 and, for docetaxel, for as long as is mandated by local labeling, or agree to practice true abstinence. Male participants must agree to not donate sperm during the course of the study and for 120 days after receiving their last dose of MLN1117 and, for docetaxel, for as long as is mandated by local labeling. Has suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling. Has recovered (ie, &lt;= Grade 1 toxicity or eligibility per this protocol is met) from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.
