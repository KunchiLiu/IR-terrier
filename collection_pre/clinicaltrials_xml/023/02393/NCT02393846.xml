The study interventions are 2 gr of 2.5% ketoprofen gel versus placebo applied to the sprain area. The study drugs are identical in colour, form and smelling. After an eligible patient presented to the ED, the drug number from an opaque bag is determined by a nurse and then another nurse applies the study drug to the patient.
