	<brief_title>ERCP Mechanical Simulator (EMS) Practice for Training Endoscopic Sphincterotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Usual clinical ERCP training is supervised hands-on practice and the number of procedures is used as a surrogate for trainees' experience. At least 180 cases are required to achieve ERCP competence. A major limitation is lack of suitable patients. Alternative supplemental training includes simulator practice using computer simulators, live animal models, and ex-vivo porcine organ. Our previous study has showed that the mechanical simulator training improves trainees' clinical performance in terms of success of deep CBD cannulation. In this study, we aim to evaluate the usefulness of ERCP mechanical simulator for training endoscopic sphincterotomy.</detailed_description>
