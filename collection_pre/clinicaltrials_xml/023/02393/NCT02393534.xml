	<brief_summary>Doctors frequently speak with their patients over the telephone. Having a visit with a doctor over the telephone rather than face-to-face can be convenient for patients and allow them to save time and money on transportation and missed time from work. However, some patients may prefer seeing the doctor in person. In this study, we will study two groups of patients - some who have their visits with their doctor over the telephone and some who have them face-to-face. Using surveys and interviews, we will study if the groups differ in their satisfaction with their visit with their doctor after participating in the study for 6 months. We will also look at doctor satisfaction with telephone visits, use of clinic resources and if patients received recommended care such as laboratory tests and vaccines during the study period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of Telephone Follow-up Visits in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two arm randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of telephone follow-up versus standard in-person follow-up (usual care) on patient satisfaction among a sample of 360 primary care patients followed at the Gouverneur Ambulatory Care Practice. All primary care patients will be considered eligible at the outset. Providers will determine patient's study eligibility at the baseline visit based on the ability to safely follow-up the patient's health issue over the telephone in subsequent visits. Eligible patients that are randomized to the telephone follow-up arm will have their next medical visit with their primary care provider via a telephone call. Eligible patients that are randomized to the usual care arm will have a standard in-person clinic visit with their primary care provider. In both study arms, the timing and frequency of follow-up appointments will be determined by the patient's primary care provider. Regardless of group assignment, outcomes will be assessed at the baseline and 6-month study visit.</detailed_description>
