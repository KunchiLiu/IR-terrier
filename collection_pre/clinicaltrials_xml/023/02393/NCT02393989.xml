	<brief_summary>Background: This 3-year clinical trial compared the performance and post-operative sensitivity of a posterior resin composite with that of bonded-amalgam in large sized cavities. Additionally, it was evaluated whether resin composite could be an alternative for bonded amalgam. Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial. Patients in need of at least two posterior restorations were recruited. Authors randomly assigned one half of the restorations to receive bonded-amalgam and the other half to composite restorations. Forty bonded-amalgams and composites were evaluated for their performance on modified Ryge criteria and post-operative sensitivity using VAS for 36-months.</brief_summary>
