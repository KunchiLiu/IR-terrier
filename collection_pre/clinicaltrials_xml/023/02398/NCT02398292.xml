	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a 6-week nutrition, movement, and mindfulness program (M³ Program) for youth with a recent diagnosis of psychosis. Program effects on metabolic and mental health outcomes compared to wait-list control will also be assessed. Participants will be 15-25 years of age, and have a recent diagnosis of psychosis. Twenty participants and their study partners (20 study partners) will be equally divided into two cohorts. Participants will sign up for one of the two series on a rolling enrollment basis until both of the program date frames are filled. Participants that signed up for the second series will serve as a wait-list control; outcomes from the participants in the first series will be compared to this group. M³ will be a combination of didactic and experiential training. The course will meet once-a-week for six weeks. Participants will learn how to prepare healthy snacks and meals, make healthy choices when eating out, and interpret food packaging and labels. They will also learn about different forms of mindfulness exercises and movement, such as yoga, martial arts, and a Japanese style of drumming. Feasibility will be assessed throughout the program.</detailed_description>
