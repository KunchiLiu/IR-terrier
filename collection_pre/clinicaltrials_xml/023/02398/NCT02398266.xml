	<brief_summary>The measurement of limb skeletal muscle perfusion and perfusion reserve during exercise is an approach that can assess the total impact of the complex pathophysiologic processes in patients with limb ischemia, particularly in those with diabetes in whom distal arterial disease and abnormal microvascular functional responses are common. This trial is designed to: (a) optimize methods for assessment of limb perfusion at rest and during stress using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (normal subjects) and a microbubble contrast agent that is able to provide non-linear signal without destruction at medium acoustic pressures, and (b) to test whether perfusion imaging provides incremental information on the severity of disease in patients with peripheral artery disease.</brief_summary>
