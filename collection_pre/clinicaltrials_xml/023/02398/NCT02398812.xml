	<brief_title>The Interprofessional Medication Assessment for Older Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging increases the risk of adverse effects and interactions caused by medication. Medication reconciliation and medication review are well-known practices to optimize medicines use. Both interventions usually require a team-based approach to be effective. Medication reconciliation is the process of obtaining and documenting a complete and accurate list of current patient medications and comparing this list with medication orders at each point of care transition to identify and rectify any discrepancies before patient harm occurs. Medication review is the process of evaluating current medication treatment to manage the risk and optimize the outcomes of medication treatment by detecting, solving, and preventing medication-related problems. The present study focuses on medication assessment including both medication reconciliation and review combined to clinical assessment of an individual patient. According to a systematic review there is a need for research focusing on medication management in community settings and especially to assess the impact of medication assessment on clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
