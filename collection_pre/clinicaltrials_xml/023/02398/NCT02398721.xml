	<brief_summary>Ideally randomized controlled trials should be carried out to compare the cost-effectiveness between FNAC and watchful waiting but such studies are very difficult to conduct in practice because they require following up very large number of subjects for a long period of time. The aims are to determine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and HRQOL preference (utility) of patients undergoing watchful observation (no FNAC) and routine FNAC, and to determine the cost-effectiveness of two strategies in managing small incidental thyroid nodules for the Chinese population in Hong Kong.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 18 or above Have life expectancy of at least 6 months Have an incidental nodule which measures between 1.0 to 2.0cm in the largest dimension on ultrasound guidance (USG) and has benign ultrasonographic features such as spongiform or honeycomb appearance, purelycystic, egg shell type calcification, isoechoic or hyperechoic in relation to the rest of the thyroid tissue and peripheral vascularity on Doppler USG. For subjects with more than one nodule on USG, provided that the other nodules are not &gt;2.0cm or have suspicious features (see below), they will still be eligible. Normal thyroid function (both serum thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels within normal range) Given consent to take part in the study Have suspicious ultrasonographic features such as microcalcifications, marked hypoechogenicity, irregular margins and / or taller than wide and intranodular vascularity on transverse view on Doppler USG that warrant a FNAC Nodule size &gt; 2.0cm Insisting or refusing FNAC or surgical intervention despite medical reassurance Inability to understand or communicate in Cantonese or Chinese Significant cognitive impairment judged by the doctor to be unable to answer the questionnaire Too ill to carry out interview Refusal to give consent</criteria>
