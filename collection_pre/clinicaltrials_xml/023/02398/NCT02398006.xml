	<brief_summary>Background: Fracture of the clavicle is common accounting for 2.6% to 4 % of all fractures, with an overall incidence of 36.5 to 64 per 100,000 per year. Around 80% of clavicle fractures occur in the middle third of the clavicle. There is a lack of evidence of randomised controlled trials assessing the best treatment of these fractures. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions: figure-of-eight bandage versus sling for the treating middle third clavicle fractures. Methods/Design: this project has been designed as a single-centre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial that will compare figure-of-eight bandage versus sling. The investigators aim to recruit 110 adults, aged 18 years or older, with an acute (less than 10 days) middle third clavicle fracture. Primary outcomes will be function or disability measured by DASH questionnaire; the secondary outcomes will be: modified UCLA score pain, treatment failure, adverse events and numbers returning to previous activities. Data analysis: the chi-square test will be used to analyse the results of categorical variables, and Student t-test will be used to compare groups with respect to the numerical variables. The Student t-test is used to compare the clinical outcome of each group at 1, 2 and 4 weeks and at 6 and 12 months after the intervention. The significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05) is used for all statistical tests such that tests have a value of less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant. Discussion: According to current evidence there is very limited evidence from two single trials only regarding the effectiveness of different methods of conservative interventions for treating clavicle fractures. This study is one of the first randomised controlled trials following the CONSORT statements designed to compare two conservative methods for treating clavicle fractures (figure-of-eight versus sling).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conservative Interventions for Treating Clavicle Fractures in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whilst there are several options for conservative treatment for middle third clavicle fractures, only two randomised controlled published in the 80s attempted to determine the effects of different methods for conservative treatment for middle third clavicle fractures. Thus, a pragmatic trial design has been chosen as it can directly inform clinical practice; our inclusion criteria will reflect the variety in patient presentations that would be encountered by general orthopaedic surgeons in the clinical setting. The current trial includes design characteristics known to minimise bias. Participants will be assigned using a concealed random procedure, assessments and data analysis will be blinded and we will use the intention-to-treat analysis.</detailed_description>
