	<brief_summary>A research project funded by the Reiss-Davis Child Study Center of Vista Del Mar (RDCSC/VDM) will be conducted on the Vista Del Mar campus of the RDCSC/VDM to evaluate the effectiveness of the Listening Project Protocol (LPP) in children who have difficulties with autonomic and behavior regulation in the classroom. The LPP is designed as a "neural exercise" to reduce auditory hypersensitivities, to improve auditory processing of speech, and to improve behavioral state regulation. The LPP uses acoustic stimulation to exercise the neural regulation of the middle ear structures to rehabilitate and to normalize the acoustic transfer function of the middle ear structures. The current study is being conducted to evaluate efficacy and feasibility of the LPP with emotionally disturbed and learning challenged young people and will use objective measures to evaluate changes in acoustic transfer function of the middle ears structures, auditory processing skills, physiological state regulation, sensory symptoms, and academic pre and post testing.</brief_summary>
