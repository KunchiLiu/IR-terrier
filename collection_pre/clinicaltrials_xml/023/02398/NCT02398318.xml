	<brief_summary>Refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens is the most tested therapeutic avenue for refractory OCD. However, large scale randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach are rare.</brief_summary>
