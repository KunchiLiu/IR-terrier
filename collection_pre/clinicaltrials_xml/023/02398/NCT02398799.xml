	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of an integrated dyad care program with education and psychosocial support to patients with chronic heart failure and their partners during a post-discharge period after acute deterioration of heart failure. Methods: One hundred fifty five patient-caregiver dyads has been randomized to usual care or a psycho-education intervention delivered in three modules through nurse-led face-to-face counseling, computer-based education and other written teaching materials to assist dyads develop problem-solving skills. Follow-up assessments has been completed after 3, 12 and 24 months to assess perceived control, perceived health, depressive symptoms, self-care, knowledge, caregiver burden and health care utilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supporting Dyads Affected by Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a serious condition with a poor prognosis. It is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmissions for worsening heart failure remains high. Treatment aims to reduce symptoms and morbidity and to improve quality of life and survival. Counseling and education is an important part of treatment, but despite the fact that most patients receive education, many are not able to adequately engage in self-care activities. Non-adherence to self-care recommendations is high which may be a contributing factor for worsening heart failure and to the high number of readmissions. Having support of a partner is important for patients with heart failure. Supportive others have the potential to improve self-care outcomes and increase adherence to treatment. At the same time, it should be acknowledged that the disease can also affect the partners negatively. However, emotional reactions of burden and stress decrease when partner's experiences control over the heart disease. Despite the fact that heart failure has a number of negative consequences for patients and the partners, research addressing self-care barriers from a family perspective is rare, and until now contemporary care has remained patient focused. Previous studies have indicated the importance of partner support but have not found the appropriate methods for involving and encourage partners. Therefore, studies focusing on the heart failure patient-partner dyad are needed, but to date, most studies have only evaluated short term effects of intervention programs, while long term effects might be of equally importance. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the effects of an integrated dyad care program with education and psychosocial support to patients with chronic heart failure and their partners during a post-discharge period after acute deterioration of heart failure. Methods: One hundred fifty five patient-caregiver dyads has been randomized to usual care (n = 71) or a psycho-education intervention (n = 84) delivered in three modules through nurse-led face-to-face counseling, computer-based education and other written teaching materials to assist dyads develop problem-solving skills. Follow-up assessments has been completed after 3, 12 and 24 months to assess perceived control, perceived health, depressive symptoms, self-care, knowledge, caregiver burden and health care utilization.</detailed_description>
