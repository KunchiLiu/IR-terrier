	<brief_summary>Sunitinib given at 50 mg/day on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off) is the standard care for first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the schedule was reported with a high rate of dose reduction and dose discontinuation because of the safety profile. So investigators conducte this randomized, multi-center phase II study to determine whether a sunitinib regimen of 50 mg/day 2-weeks on/1-week off could provide the same efficacy in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and overall survival, while reducing drug-related toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trila of Sunitinib Schedule 4/2 vs. Shedule 2/1 as First Line Therapy in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sunitinib given at 50 mg/day on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off) is the standard care for first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the schedule was reported with a high rate of dose reduction and dose discontinuation because of the safety profile. Sunitinib 50mg/day on schedule 2/1 (2 weeks on treatment, 1 weeks off) was reported to be associated with significantly decrease toxicities in patients who initially experienced grade 3 or greater toxicity on the schedule 4/2 and could extend treatment duration considerably. Through this research, we would like to explore whether the schedule 2/1 of sunitinib 50 mg/day as first line therapy could provide the same efficacy as standard schedule 4/2 in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and overall survival, while reducing drug-related toxicity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.</detailed_description>
