As a requisite of crossover design, half of the participants started with L-Arginine and the other half with placebo and switched over after a three weeks use and one week of a washout period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>L-arginine add-on Therapy in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>L-arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), a neuromodulator of dopamine, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate systems. Nitric oxide donors which increase NO levels at the cellular level could improve N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction. Using L-arginine could bypass the blocked NMDA receptors and improve the therapeutic efficacy by reversing the dysfunction. The investigators proposed that using L-Arginine, a dietary supplement in most cultures, might constitute a safe option as an add-on treatment which may display beneficial effects on positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms associated with schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
