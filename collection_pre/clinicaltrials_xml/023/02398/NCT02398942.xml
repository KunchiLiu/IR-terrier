	<brief_summary>Aim: The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients with a proximal pole fracture of the scaphoid Primary null hypothesis: There are no factors associated with nonunion of a proximal pole fracture of the scaphoid. Secondary null hypothesis: Patients with an acute proximal pole fracture of the scaphoid have QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) scores at or above the population norm (a score of 13 in the Norway and 10.9 in the United States), 2 to 6 months after injury.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or greater Proximal pole fracture of the scaphoid on computed tomography scans made in the planes defined by the long axis of the scaphoid. The proximal pole will be defined as the proximal fifth of the scaphoid, excluding small scapholunate ligament avulsion fractures. Interval between injury and diagnosis of less than 2 weeks.
