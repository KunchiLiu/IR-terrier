	<brief_title>The Effect of Anticoagulation After Endoscopic Therapy in Cirrhotic Patients With Portal Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of cirrhotic patients with PVT (portal vein thrombosis) is clearly recommended in guideline now. Several published studies has confirm the effect and safety of anticoagulation therapy in cirrhotic patients with PVT.The present studies are most observation studies with small sample size and low quality.We need more high-quality research such as randomized controlled trials. This is a Zelen-designed randomized controlled trial. Patients will randomly enter into two groups:the anticoagulation group or the control group and then we will make sure wether their are fond of the group and make decision by themselves. The recanalization rate and complications will be analyzed</detailed_description>
