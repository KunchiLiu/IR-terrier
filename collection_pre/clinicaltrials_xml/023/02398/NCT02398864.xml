	<brief_title>Accuracy and Safety of Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) in Suspected Non-malignant Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no single method to investigate mediastinal LN invasion. Hence, a patient may have to undergo several tests and procedures. Noninvasive and invasive approaches are employed. Within the invasive techniques, endoscopic ultrasonography with needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasonography with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are gaining importance in mediastinal staging. Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) is a procedure that is performed via flexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation for visualization of lymph nodes in the chest and biopsy under real-time guidance usually for the staging of lung cancer or evaluation of enlarged lymph nodes. In addition, lung lesions or masses can be visualized and biopsied in the same sitting. The use of EBUS has enhanced the safety and diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy. It provides ultrasonographic images and permits needle aspiration under direct vision for cytology specimen analysis. As more evidence is being accumulated on these staging approaches, the number of cervical mediastinoscopies, considered as the gold-standard for mediastinal staging, is diminishing.</detailed_description>
