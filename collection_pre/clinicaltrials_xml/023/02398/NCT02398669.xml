Secondary (chromosomal, endocrine, or metabolic) causes of obesity (eg, PraderWilli syndrome, Down's Syndrome, untreated hypothyroidism, or Cushing's syndrome). 4. Any history of abdominal surgery that may affect PK evaluations (eg, hepatectomy, nephrotomy, digestive organ resection or any gastrointestinal procedure for the purpose of weight loss, which would slow gastric emptying). 5. Any clinically relevant symptom or organ impairment found by medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) finding, or laboratory test results that require medical treatment at Screening. 6. Special needs subjects who are unable to comprehend trialrelated instructions (eg, mild to profound mental retardation, moderate to severe cognitive developmental delay, pervasive developmental disorders, autism). 7. Females who are sexually active. 8. Ongoing epilepsy or other seizure disorder, or use of medications for a seizure disorder within 6 months of the Screening or between Screening and Day 1. 9. History of congestive heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, congenital heart disease, or organ transplantation. 10. Resting heart rate less than 50 or greater than 120 beats/min at Screening or predose on Day 1. 11. Systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 140 mmHg or less than 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg or less than 60 mmHg at Screening or predose on Day 1. 12. Hypersensitivity to the study drug or any of its excipients. 13. Significant change in diet or level of physical activity within 1 month prior to dosing or change in weight of greater than 5 kg within 3 months prior to dosing. 14.

Enrolled in another clinical trial that involved pharmacotherapy, or medical device, within 30 days before informed consent. 18. Use of drugs with serotonergic activity within 4 weeks before dosing, including but not limited to selective serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), bupropion, triptans, and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], linezolid), dextromethorphan, lithium, tramadol, antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists. 19.
