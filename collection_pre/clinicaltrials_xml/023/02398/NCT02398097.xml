	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown poor immune response to conventional influenza vaccines in HIV-infected individuals. This study was conducted expecting the more potent immunogenicity of intradermal vaccine compared with conventional intramuscular vaccine in HIV-infected adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Vaccine and Intradermal Vaccine Among HIV-infected Young Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the 2011/2012 pre-influenza season, three vaccines were used in HIV-infected adults (18 to 60 years): inactivated intramuscular vaccine (Agripal), reduced-content intradermal vaccine (IDflu9μg) and standard-content intradermal vaccine (IDflu15μg). Serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies and INF-γ ELISpot assay were measured at the time of vaccination and 1 month after vaccination. Adverse events were recorded for 7 days.</detailed_description>
