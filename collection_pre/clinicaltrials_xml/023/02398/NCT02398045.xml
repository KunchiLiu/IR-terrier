	<brief_summary>The study aims to pilot a new computerised cognitive behavioural therapy programme for a small case series of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The investigators hypothesise that the findings will demonstrate improvements in symptomatology following the programme. The programme will have longer-term aims of being rolled out over a number of IAPT services within the NHS, reducing waiting lists and increasing therapist time.</brief_summary>

The patient describes their OCD as their main problem and scores between 14 and 30 on the YBOCS (Goodman et al, 1989). A score above 30 is in the severe range and indicates that the CBT should probably be therapist delivered. Able to use selfhelp materials in English and answer written questionnaires. Able to access the internet (either at home or in a public library or drop in centre or at the clinic). Have a current episode of OCD of more than 6 months in duration. Significant and complex comorbidity (e.g. significant personality disorder, severe depression or alcohol dependence, which requires longer therapy or is more difficult to treat). Such patients are likely to be part of a Community Mental Health team or be funded by the Department of Health's National Specialist Commissioning Team scheme for severe treatment refectory OCD. Current active suicidal intent or severe selfneglect that requires hospitalisation. The patient has a primary problem of compulsive hoarding (as such patients are more complex or are more likely to be under a Community Mental Health team). Continuing to receive another form of psychotherapy. Has received CBT for OCD in the past year. A participant may be taking an antidepressant for OCD but must be on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to entry in the trial with no plans to alter the dose during the trial period. There must also be no plan to commence on an antidepressant or antipsychotic medication. (Participants excluded because of their current or planned medication may be offered a further assessment for the trial after being on a stable dose</criteria>
