	<brief_summary>This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of treatment with ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who are in a chronic phase and who previously received treatment with imatinib but resulted to be resistant to it.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity and Risk Profile of Ponatinib in Chronic Phase Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Resistant to Imatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 2, single-arm, multicentre, open label. No interim analysis is planned, but a monitoring committee will evaluate the data every 6 months. Ponatinib is given orally 30 mg daily, with dose adjustment to 15 mg daily once a BCR-ABL1 level smaller or equal to 0.1% (MMR) has been achieved and confirmed in the next test, 4 weeks apart. A return to prior, 30 mg, dose is due in case of return of BCR-ABL1 transcripts level to &gt; 1%. Dose adjustments for toxicity are detailed in the protocol. Treatment time will be 52 weeks, during which study drug will be provided free-of-charge by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, upon approval of the protocol. Treatment is discontinued at any time in case of failure or treatment-related SAEs. After one year of treatment, upon request of the local investigator and upon confirmation of the Treatment Advisory Committee (TAC, see section 23), ARIAD Pharmaceutics, Inc. will continue to provide ponatinib for the study patients who will benefit from treatment continuation, for at least 2 years, until the drug will be approved with that indication.</detailed_description>
