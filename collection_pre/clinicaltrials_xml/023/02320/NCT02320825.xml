	<criteria>Histologically diagnosed metastatic cancer (Diagnosis made or confirmed at MSKCC for MSKCC participants. Institutional pathologic determination accepted from participating multicenter sites.) Age ≥18 years Life expectancy ≥3 months ECOG ≤ 3 Spinal surgery carried out with the goal of spinal cord decompression and spinal stabilization within 8 weeks Postoperative CT myelogram or MRI perfusion with evidence of separation of tumor and the spinal cord It should be noted that patients with multiple lesions will be eligible as long as there are no overlapping fields of radiation, including at various time frames. Primary spine tumor Age &lt; 18 Pregnancy Lack of adequate (≥ 2 mm) separation between the spinal cord and the tumor on postoperative CT myelogram or MRI perfusion Radiosensitizing chemotherapy (taxol, taxotere, cisplatin, gemcitabine, 5fluorouracil) given within one week of radiation treatment</criteria>
