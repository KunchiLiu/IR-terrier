	<brief_summary>The investigators want to characterize high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial recordings, which may occur as markers of epileptogenic tissue and also under physiological stimulation. The investigators want to show that recording of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) is feasible in our project population both intraoperatively and during presurgical physiological conditions.</brief_summary>
