	<brief_summary>Interval training is superior to continuous training for improving glycemic control, hereunder glycemic variability and -spikes. However, the underlying mechanisms and the clinical impact is at present unknown. The overall objective of this project is to determine the mechanisms underlying aeroic interval-training-induced reductions in glycemic variability and -spikes, and the impact on levels of systemic inflammation in type 2 diabetes patients. It is hypothesized that aerobic interval training reduces glycemic variability and -spikes more than continuous training due to larger improvements in both peripheral insulin sensitivity and the mass action effect of glucose. Moreover, it is hypothesized that these reductions in glycemic variability and -spikes also reduces systemic inflammation.</brief_summary>
