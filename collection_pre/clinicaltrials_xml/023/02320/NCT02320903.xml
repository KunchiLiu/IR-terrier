	<brief_summary>The goal of the current trial is to assess the feasibility of a newly developed prototype of a cell phone app called VillageWhere. VillageWhere is designed to improve clinical outcomes of youth with externalizing behavioral problems by improving parental monitoring of youth whereabouts and activities while increasing the delivery of rewards to teens for good behavior. This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposal seeks to develop and conduct initial feasibility testing of the VillageWhere prototype. The primary features of the prototype include location monitoring via smartphones' global positioning system (GPS) functionality as well as facilitating teen self-appraisal of meeting behavioral expectations. Good behavior is rewarded with points that are tracked by the app and can be used to redeem for real-world rewards. The investigators will conduct an 45-day open trial (N=20 caregiver/teen dyads) to assess use, feasibility and acceptability for teens involved in the juvenile justice system or otherwise struggling with externalizing behavioral problems. Caregivers and teens will be assessed at baseline, before receiving the app, and at the end of the app use period (45 days). The therapist of each caregiver/teen dyad will also be assessed at the end of the app use period. Primary outcomes include: use of app features, monitoring of teen behavior and whereabouts, delivery of real-world rewards, and feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes include: parenting behaviors, externalizing teen behaviors and internalizing teen behaviors.</brief_summary>
