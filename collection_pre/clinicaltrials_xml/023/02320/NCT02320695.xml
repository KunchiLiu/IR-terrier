Heavily pigmented subjects who could heal with abnormal darkening at the test sites on the inner forearms 11. Presence of excessive hair on the inner forearms which could interfere with the test procedures 12. Presents with skin disorders on the inner arms (cuts, scratches, scars, etc), which in the opinion of the Investigator or qualified designee, will interfere with the study assessment or will create undue risk for the subject 13.
