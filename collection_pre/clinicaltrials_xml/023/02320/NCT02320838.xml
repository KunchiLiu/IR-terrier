	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the transcutaneous application of unmodulated 5 Kilohertz (KHz) alternating currents are effective in decreasing the thermal and mechanical experimental pain and cause changes in peripheral nerve conduction. Moreover evidence whether the effect and comfort of this current is greater than Conventional TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) commonly used for the treatment of clinical pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unmodulated 5 Kilohertz Currents Versus TENS: Effect on Pain Thresholds, Tactile Threshold, and Nerve Conduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last years several animal experimental studies have evidenced that high frequency unmodulated currents about 5 KHz can cause a peripheral nerve block. However electric currents with these high frequencies that are usually used for the treatment of pain in humans are interrupted or modulated (i.e. interferential currents) This evidences in animals could have application in pain treatment, characterized by overactive nervous system. For this reason it was decided to compare the effects on experimental pain and peripheral nerve conduction of this new electric current versus sham stimulation and TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation). The scientific literature on transcutaneous electrical stimulation in humans and changes in nerve conduction and / or somatosensory thresholds focuses mainly on TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation). Therefore TENS is a good reference standard to compare the effect of this new currents.</detailed_description>
