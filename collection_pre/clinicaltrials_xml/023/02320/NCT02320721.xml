	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of H0E901-U300 to Lantus, in change of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Secondary Objectives: To demonstrate the superiority of H0E901-U300 in comparison with Lantus in: - Percentage of patients with at least one severe and/or confirmed (by plasma glucose ≤70mg/dL [3.9mmol/L]) hypoglycemia event from 22:00 to 08:59 next morning - Percentage of patients with at least one nocturnal (from 00:00-05:59) severe and/or confirmed (≤70mg/dL [3.9mmol/L]) hypoglycemia event - Percentage of patients with at least one severe and/or confirmed (by plasma glucose ≤70mg/dL [3.9mmol/L]) hypoglycemia event occurring at any time of day - HbA1c change</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Safety and Efficacy of HOE901-U300 With Lantus in Older Patients With Type2 Diabetes Insufficiently Controlled on Their Current Antidiabetic Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 26-week treatment period comparing HOE901-U300 to Lantus, and a 2-day safety follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients ≥65 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled on antidiabetic regimens either including no insulin, or with basal insulin as their only insulin. Signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria: HbA1c at screening visit: &lt;7.0% or &gt;10.0% for patients taking basal insulin. &lt;7.5% or &gt;11.0% for insulinnaïve patients. History of type 2 diabetes mellitus for less than 1 year before screening. Patients not on stable basal insulin dose (±10% in the last 8 weeks prior to screening visit). Change in dose of antidiabetic treatment or initiation of new glucoselowering medications in the last 8 weeks prior to screening. Chronic (&gt;10 days continuous use in previous 6 months) use of bolus insulin injections, whether given separately or as part of a combination with basal insulin, eg, premix insulin; For insulinnaïve individuals: current or previous insulin use except for a maximum of 10 consecutive days (e.g. acute illness, surgery) during the last year prior to screening. Cognitive disorder and dementia assessed clinically and by MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) score &lt;24, or any neurologic disorder that will likely affect the patient's ability to follow the study procedure. The patient will be eligible despite an MMSE score &lt;24 if the investigator determines that the low score reflects educational or cultural background and not dementia as long as the patient is otherwise able to meet the study requirements. Patients who have endstage renal disease (&lt;15 mL/min/1.73m^2, per estimated Glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] measurement by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
