	<brief_summary>The investigators propose implementing a bundle of communication interventions - Patient and Family-Centered I-PASS - to improve the quality of information exchange between physicians, nurses, and families, and to better integrate families into all aspects of daily decision making in hospitals. The investigators believe that doing so has the potential to substantially improve both patient safety and patient and family experience. The specific aims of the project are - To test the hypothesis that a) rates of serious medical errors (including both preventable adverse events and near misses), determined both by an established, systematic daily hospital surveillance methodology (primary outcome) and family reports (secondary outcome); as well as b) poor verbal handoffs during family centered rounds (FCRs - assessed through direct observation - secondary outcome); rates of discordant understanding of the care plan between healthcare providers and families (assessed through survey instruments - secondary outcome); and rates of family (primary outcome) and nurse and physician dissatisfaction (secondary outcomes) will decrease following implementation of Family-Centered I-PASS, as compared with current practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bringing I-PASS to the Bedside: A Communication Bundle to Improve Patient Safety and Experience</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bundle includes changes to family centered rounds, written communications with families and further communications throughout the day. Data will be gathered pre vs. post intervention using a well established surveillance process for measuring rates of medical errors and adverse events, as well as survey instruments and direct observational methods.</detailed_description>
