	<brief_summary>Dosing guidelines for liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) in (morbidly) obese patients are not available. Subsequently, the pharmacokinetic profile of AmBisome in this specific patient population is still largely unknown. To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, obese patients with a BMI ≥ 40 undergoing endoscopic gastric bypass surgery will receive a single dose of 2 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg AmBisome (besides standard anti-bacterial prophylaxis) and a PK-curve will be drawn. These PK-values can then be compared to the pharmacokinetics of a normal-weight group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The overall trial design is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-centre, single-dose, multiple dose level trial, (2 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg). - A total of sixteen patients with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 undergoing bariatric surgery who receive a pre-surgery dose of AmBisome 2 mg/kg (n=8) or 3 mg/kg (n=8) will be enrolled. - After enrollment of group 1 (2 mg/kg), an interim analysis on the safety of AmBisome will be performed before proceeding to group 2 (3 mg/kg). - Infusion time and concentration of AmBisome will be 60 minuten (2 mg/kg group) and 90 minutes (3 mg/kg group) - A PK curve will be determined after administration of a single, pre-surgery dose of AmBisome at t = 0.5, 1 (end of infusion), 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 and (if feasible) 72 hours post infusion (n=12 samples) for group 1 (2 mg/kg), 8 patients.The PK curve of group 2 (3 mg/kg, 8 patients) will be similar to group 1, except for the t=1.5 hour sampling point, which will be end of infusion due to the infusion time of 90 minutes. - Patients are considered to have completed the study if at least 9/11 samples of the PK curve up until 48 hours have been collected. - Patients will be selected by the research team to have a good spread in weight bands.</detailed_description>
