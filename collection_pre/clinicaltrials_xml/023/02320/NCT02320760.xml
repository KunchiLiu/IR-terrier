	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of individualized physical activity on prescription (PAP) in older overweight adults. The primary hypothesis is that an individualized prescription of physical activity increases physical activity level in overweight older adults after 6 months. Secondary hypothesis are that the increased physical activity level will improve cardio metabolic risk factors and quality of life. 200 women and men, aged 65 with low physical activity level, overweight, and abdominal obesity, will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group. The control group receives general information about physical activity and registration of physical activity level for one week. The intervention group receives in addition an individualized physical activity on prescription with patient-centered counseling. After six months both groups go through the same health check-up as at baseline and follow-ups take place after 12 and 24 months.</brief_summary>
