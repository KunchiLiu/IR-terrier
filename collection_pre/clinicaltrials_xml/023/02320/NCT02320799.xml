	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to conduct a 12-week IPT+TAU versus wait list TAU in a cohort of HIV+GBV+ women in Nyanza Province to relieve depression and PTSD and improve ARV adherence. This pilot study will provide data on the efficacy trends, acceptability and feasibility of our IPT intervention and will generate preliminary findings for an R01-funded intervention to test the intervention's efficacy for remediating the effects of GBV trauma on mental health and HIV-related outcomes. Hypothesis 1: IPT+ TAU will be more effective for reduction of depression and PTSD than TAU alone. Hypothesis 2: IPT+TAU will be acceptable and feasible.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression and PTSD Among HIV+ Women in Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will use a parallel design with FACES Treatment as Usual (TAU) control to provide IPT once per week for twelve weeks to HIV+GBV+ women meeting CIDI diagnostic criteria for depression (MDD, dysthymia, minor depression) and PTSD secondary to GBV. Blocked randomization will be used to evenly distribute 120 participants to (1) IPT + TAU or (2) TAU for 12 weeks. The TAU group will be offered IPT treatment following the initial 12 week trial. Thus, all study subjects will receive TAU throughout the study and they will all receive IPT in either the first or second half of the study. My research team at FACES will be recruited for IPT training as potential therapists in the IPT pilot. A run-in study design will be used, assigning one training case apiece to each of the 8 therapists to practice IPT skills. Both IPT + TAU and TAU groups will be measured at baseline and weeks 12, 24 and 36 by blinded assessment. At FACES, TAU resources for HIV+GBV+ women include medical professionals, counseling, community elders, church leaders, police, and a pro-bono legal aid, all of who have all been involved with past FACES GBV interventions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>.(1) HIV+ women enrolled at FACESKisumu; (2) Diagnosis with depression (MDD, dysthymia, minor depression) and PTSD secondary to GBV* on the CIDI; (3) Ability to attend weekly therapy sessions and repeated measures; (4) Age greater than 18 years; (5) Ability to give informed consent. (1) Cognitive dysfunction requiring a higher level of care or compromising ability to participate in IPT**; (2) severe thought or mood disorder symptoms requiring a higher level of care or interfering with ability to participate in IPT; (3) current drug and alcohol dependence requiring substance use treatment. Although PTSD is associated with substance abuse in EuroAmerican populations, a recent study of 5175 FACES patients found that over 80% of this LMIC population use no alcohol.</criteria>
