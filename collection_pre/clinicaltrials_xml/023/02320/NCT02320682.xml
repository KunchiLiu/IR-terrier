	<brief_title>Bone Metabolism Adjacent to Hip Prosthetic Surfaces. A Clinical F-PET/CT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical study of 32 patients, age 50-69 years, healthy unless osteoarthritis in one hip, randomized in two groups (16 each) plus a reference group of same 32 patient´s contralateral healthy hip. Intervention will be surgery with a total hip arthroplasty. The four studied endoprosthetic components are: - Cemented Exeter stem (Stryker Warsaw, USA) with a ceramic 32 mm head and Palacose cement with gentamycin, applied with 3:rd generation cementation technique. - Uncemented Lubinus SP-CL stem (Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany) with a ceramic 32 mm head. - Uncemented Delta PF cup (Limacorporate spa, Udine, Italy). - Uncemented fibrous metal Delta TT cup (Limacorporate spa, Udine, Italy). Both cups will have cross linked Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHWMP). Clinical score, radiography and uptake of Fluoride tracer will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
