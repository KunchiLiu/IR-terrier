	<brief_title>Sleep Position May Reduce Acid Reflux Symptoms at Night</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MedcineTM Sleep Assist Device was recently developed by Amenity Health, Inc and is designed to elevate the head and torso and maintain a patient in the left-lateral position in order to decrease night-time/nocturnal acid reflux. The MedcineTM Sleep Assist Device is composed of a 9-inch incline base and a wrap-around body pillow. Traditionally wedge pillows have been recommended for patients with acid reflux. The addition of the body pillow helps to maintain the patient in the left-lateral position (LLP) during sleep, which has been shown to reduce night-time reflux compared to wedge alone, right lateral position and/or sleeping flat. In healthy controls, sleeping in the left-lateral position with this device system significantly decreased esophageal acid exposure and overall episodes of acid reflux. To date, there has been no study in patients with extra-esophageal reflux (EER) and nocturnal heartburn. Primary Objectives The primary objective of the this study is to evaluate the effect of a reflux pillow on esophageal acid exposure in patients complaining of nocturnal EER. Secondary Objectives To evaluate the effect of the reflux pillow on nocturnal EER symptoms, sleep quality, daytime EER symptoms, and overall quality of life.</detailed_description>
