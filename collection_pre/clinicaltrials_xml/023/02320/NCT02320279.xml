	<brief_summary>The objective is to contribute data to ongoing research activities focused on identification of EKG waveform changes in the context of clinical conditions and maternal medication use. Additionally, to develop the capacity to measure contractions more accurately and more reliably using skin-surface electrodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Fetal EKG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To develop a technique for the quantitative analysis of fetal heart-rate (FHR) data recorded during labor using advanced mathematical techniques, including pattern-recognition analysis. - Specific Aim 2: To develop the capacity to measure fetal cardiac data using EKG sensors applied to the maternal abdomen during labor. - Specific Aim 3: To validate prenatal non-invasive measurement of the fetal QTc interval. - Specific Aim 4: To develop and validate the capacity to measure uterine contractions using the uterine EMG signal recorded from maternal skin-surface electrodes. - Specific Aim 5: Collect clinical data related to medication usage and hypoxia.</detailed_description>
