	<brief_summary>The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) aims to contribute with relevant information regarding the development and progression of clinical and subclinical chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The investigators enrolled 15,105 civil servants from predefined universities or research institutes. Baseline assessment (2008-2010) included detailed interviews and measurements to assess social and biological determinants of health, as well as various clinical and subclinical conditions related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental health. For the ascertainment of incident events, annual telephone surveillance is being conducted since 2009, and a second visit of interviews and exams is under way (2012-2014). Long-term biological sample storage is provided for sera, plasma, urine and DNA. Baseline data is available for analyses, and collaboration via specific research proposals directed to study investigators is welcome. This multicenter study is chaired by a steering committee, made up of the coordinators and vice-coordinators of each of the six centers. No individual center coordinates the study. The six institutions listed in the contact details all sponsor the study.</brief_summary>
