	<brief_summary>Circadian rhythms, which play crucial roles in physiology, are emerging as important regulators of specific immune functions. Hospitalization in intensive care unit leads to a deep impairment of circadian rhythm. Infection is a frequent event during ICU hospitalization. The investigators hypothesis is that in trauma patients the lack of circadian rhythm variations is associated with the occurrence of infection. The primary aim of the study is to assess the circadian variations of plasma Bmal1 in the occurrence of healthcare related infection during the 30 days after inclusion. The secondary aims are to assess the plasma expression of circadian genes (Clock, Cry1, Per3, and Rev-erba), the production of cytokines in plasma, and the concentration of cortisol, according to the occurrence of an infection.</brief_summary>
