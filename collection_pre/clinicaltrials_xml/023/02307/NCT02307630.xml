	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out how an antibody called Hu3F8 travels through the body and to tumors. Antibodies, like Hu3F8, are proteins that help attack tumors or fight infections. Antibodies can be made by your own body or in a laboratory. The target of an antibody is called an antigen; antibodies fit their antigen like a lock fits a key.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Neuroblastoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with the diagnosis of neuroblastoma must meet both of the following criteria: Diagnosis confirmed by histological assessment by MSKCC Department of pathology or by the presence of BM metastases PLUS elevated urinary catecholamines Relapsed or refractory stage 4 disease or relapsed or refractory stage MYCNamplified 2B or 3 disease. Patients with tumors other than neuroblastoma must meet both the following criteria: Have one of the following diagnoses (these tumors are known to express GD2 on cell surface): Melanoma Osteogenic sarcoma Leiomyosarcoma Ewing sarcoma Liposarcoma Fibrosarcoma Malignant fibrous histiocytoma Spindle cell sarcoma Small cell lung cancer Medulloblastoma metastatic to extracranial sites Paraganglioma Have refractory or relapsed or metastatic disease Patients with solid tumors with diagnoses OTHER than neuroblastoma or those listed above will be eligible if they meet both of the following criteria: Immunohistochemical demonstration of GD2 expression on cell surface (Tumor assessment by immunohistochemistry is required for this group of patients) Have refractory or relapsed disease or metastatic disease. All patients must have measurable or evaluable disease Age 390 years Prior treatment with antiGD2 monoclonal antibody is permitted only if human antihuman antibody titer is ≤1300 assay developed by Dr. NaiKong Cheung. Negative serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential must be willing to practice an effective method of birth control while on study Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this study. Existing major organ dysfunction &gt; grade 2, with the exception of myelosuppression (neutrophil count &gt; or = 500/μl and platelet count &gt; or = 25,000/μl are acceptable) and hearing loss. Acute life threatening infection Requirement for sedation for PET/CT scans Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Inability to comply with protocol requirements. Hypersensitivity to potassium iodide or Lugols products Prior development of positive human antimouse antibody response (HAMA) or human antihuman antibody response (HAHA) Positive human antihu3F8 antibody titer.</criteria>
