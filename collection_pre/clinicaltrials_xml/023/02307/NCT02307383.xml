	<brief_summary>The combination of Lactitol and Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus Biphidus) administered orally is an effective strategy of intestinal decolonization of Enterobacter produced OXA-48-type carbapenemase. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Lactitol and Probiotics for the intestinal decolonization of people who carried Klebsiella pneumoniae produced OXA-48-type Carbapenemase.</brief_summary>
