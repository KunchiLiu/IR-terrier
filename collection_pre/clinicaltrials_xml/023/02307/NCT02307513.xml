	<brief_summary>Behcet's disease, is a rare disorder that causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout the body. The signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease may include mouth sores, eye inflammation, skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores that vary from person to person and may come and go on their own. The exact cause of Behcet's is unknown, but it may be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy cells. This study will test whether apremilast is better than placebo (inactive substance in the same form as the drug) for the treatment of oral ulcers in subjects with active Behçet's disease. Other manifestations of the disease will also be assessed, such as, pain and tenderness in joints, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, and skin disease. This study also will test how well the body tolerates apremilast. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. About 204 subjects will participate. The placebo-controlled period will be 12 weeks long and patients will receive apremilast or placebo. After the 12-week placebo-controlled period, all subjects will receive apremilast for 1 year. All subjects will have their final study visit 4 weeks after stopping apremilast treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures being conducted. 2. Male and female subjects ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document. 3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 4. Diagnosed with Behçet's disease meeting the International Study Group (ISG) criteria 5. Oral ulcers that occurred at least 3 times in the previous 12month period, including oral ulcers at the Screening Visit. 6. Subjects must have at least 2 oral ulcers at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), and: a. at least 2 oral ulcers at Visit 2 (day of randomization), when Visit 2 occurs at least 14 days after Visit 1. OR b. at least 3 oral ulcers at Visit 2 (day of randomization), when Visit 2 occurs at any time between 1 day and 42 days after Visit 1. 7. Have prior treatment with at least 1 nonbiologic Behçet's Disease therapy, such as, but not limited to, topical corticosteroids, or systemic treatment. 8. Candidate for systemic therapy, for the treatment of oral ulcers. a. A candidate for systemic therapy is a subject judged by the study Investigator as someone whose mucocutaneous ulcers are considered inappropriate for topical therapy based on the severity of disease and extent of the affected area, or whose oral ulcers cannot be adequately controlled by topical therapy. 9. Laboratory Measures: Must meet the following laboratory measures: Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL White blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 3000 /L(≥ 3.0 X 10^9/L) and ≤ 14,000/L (≤ 14 X 10^9/L ) Platelet count ≥ 100,000 /L (≥ 100 X 109/L) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (≤ 132.6 μmol/L) Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Aspartate transaminase (AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, SGOT]) and alanine transaminase (ALT [serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase, SGPT]) ≥1.5 X ULN. Subjects who fail screening due to ≥ 1.5 X ULN AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT will be allowed to repeat AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT tests within the Screening Phase. Repeat test results should be ≤ ULN (within reference range) to be eligible. Laboratory tests will be allowed to be repeated 1 time if, in the Investigator's clinical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility of the repeat tests not meeting the exclusion values, and with concurrence from the Medical Monitor. Contraception Requirements: All Females of Child Bearing Potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved contraceptive options as described below while taking apremilast and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the apremilast. At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a FCBP's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy. All FCBP must have a negative pregnancy test at Visits 1 and 2. All FCBP subjects who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive options described below: Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]); PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (latex or nonlatex condoms NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on IP and for at least 28 days after the last dose of IP. The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from the study enrollment: Disease Specific Exclusions: 1. Behçet's diseaserelated active major organ involvement pulmonary (eg, pulmonary artery aneurysm), vascular (eg, thrombophlebitis), gastrointestinal (eg, ulcers along the gastrointestinal tract), and central nervous systems (eg, meningoencephalitis) manifestations, and ocular lesions (eg, uveitis) requiring immunosuppressive therapy; however: 1. Previous major organ involvement is allowed if it occurred at least 1 year prior to Visit 1 (Screening Visit) and is not active at time of enrollment. 2. Subjects with mild BDrelated ocular lesions not requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy are allowed. 3. Subjects with BDrelated arthritis and BDskin manifestations are also allowed. 2. Previous exposure to biologic therapies for the treatment of BD oral ulcers Previous biologic therapy exposure is allowed for other indications, including other manifestations of BD 3.
