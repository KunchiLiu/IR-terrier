The upper limb apraxia syndrome affects the performance of skilled movements carried out by the upper limbs and provoke that many patientsÂ´activities have to be made by their main caregiver or carers.

Few data are available on the effectiveness of interventions in caregivers that informally works with that kind of patients. The specific prevention health program is based on improving the awareness of the assistance that the caregivers provide, and knowing the process of the information that carer has to give to the patient while the patients have their activities made.</detailed_description>
