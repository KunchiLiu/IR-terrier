	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Insulin Therapy Between Inner and Outer Upper Thigh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most common injection site is the abdomen (or stomach). The back of the upper arms, the upper buttocks or hips, and the outer side of the thighs are also used. These sites are the best to inject into for two reasons: They have a layer of fat just below the skin to absorb the insulin, but not many nerves - which means that injecting there will be more comfortable than injecting in other parts of your body. But while the needle for insulin therapy is becoming shorter, it is possible to inject insulin at the inner thigh site.</detailed_description>
