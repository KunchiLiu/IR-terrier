	<detailed_description>The main objective of the trial is to evaluate for the first time, how long an antipsychotic relapse-prevention should be continued and to which time a patient is protected enough, so that a guided withdrawal or reduction of the medication seems appropriate. Relapse is defined as primary outcome. We include patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in remission for at least 3 years under a stable antipsychotic medication.</detailed_description>
