	<brief_summary>This study collected follow-up data on approximately 90% of participants who were randomized and received one dose of study drug in FTY720D2201 (D2201). No study drug was given or required. Participants were required to be assessed at one or two visits, preferably at the original study site, but the option to be interviewed via phone or seen at home was provided. Information was gathered also on deceased participants. Assessments were performed only once within an 8 week period and included medical history, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Multiple Sclerosis Disease Modifying Therapy (MS DMT) history, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up of Fingolimod Phase II Study Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter follow-up study of patients originally enrolled in the Phase 2 D2201 study. Patients did not receive any protocol specified treatment. The original D2201 study sites who agreed to participate in this study were required to locate their patients who were randomized in Study D2201 and asked them to return for a 10-year assessment, regardless of their current treatment status. Locating the patient may have required the use of search and advertising strategies to find those patients currently lost to follow-up, in accordance with local privacy legislation. Patients currently being followed within Study FTY720D2399 (NCT01201356) were asked to participate in Study FTY720D2201E2 and if patients gave consent, were enrolled concurrently in both studies.</detailed_description>
