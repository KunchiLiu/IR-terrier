	<brief_title>Bioequivalence of Duvelisib and Food Effect on Pharmacokinetics of IPI-145</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1, randomized, open-label study of IPI-145 will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will be conducted in 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of 32 healthy subjects, and Cohort 2 will consist of 52 healthy subjects. Subjects in each cohort will receive 2 doses of IPI under fasted conditions in a 2-period, 2-sequence crossover design. Dosing in Period 1 and Period 2 will be separated by at least 7 days. Part 2 is a 2-period, 2-sequence crossover design to assess the effect of a high-fat meal on the PK of the IPI-145 in 20 subjects. Subjects will receive single oral doses under fed (high-fat meal) and fasted conditions, separated by at least 7 days.</detailed_description>
