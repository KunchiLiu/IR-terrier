	<brief_summary>The BLaStM clinical trial extends the Phase I LEAD trial and compares the LEAD upfront technique for increasing dose to the MP-MRI defined GTVs to the HEIGHT method of using a moderate hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost to the MP-MRI defined GTVs through the course of radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that alternate mechanisms of cell death, including bystander effects, are put in place when doses above 8 Gy per fraction are used in a lattice and that the effects on local tumor eradication will be greater using this strategy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI-Guided Prostate Boosts Via Initial Lattice Stereotactic vs Daily Moderately Hypofractionated Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy (RT) is a commonly applied primary (initial definitive) treatment alternative to prostatectomy that allows for preservation of anatomy and the potential for improved functional outcome with better tumor targeting and normal tissue sparing. About 30-50% of men ultimately develop biochemical failure (BF) after RT. Persistence of disease in the dominant lesion is indicated to be a common mechanism responsible for progression. Prostate cancer has a long natural history. BF typically precedes clinical progression to metastasis by many years and local persistence has been implicated. While survival at 10 years is high overall, quality of life is affected by failure of any kind. Pathologic complete response (PathCR) by standard ultrasound guided systematic prostate biopsies at 2-3 years after RT is the strongest post-treatment (post-Tx) predictor of patient outcome yet identified. Multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) parameters identify dominant tumor areas in the prostate with a fairly high sensitivity and specificity, and MP-MRI directed biopsies should, therefore, further strengthen the association between prostate biopsy results and patient outcome. The proposed research compares two previously explored methods (LEAD and HEIGHT) for escalating dose to MP-MRI defined prostate regions directly and addresses the goals of 1) improving local control via targeted radiotherapy (RT) dose escalation to the MP-MRI defined high risk (dominant) tumor areas using PathCR based on MP-MRI-directed biopsies at 2-2.5yr after treatment as the primary endpoint; 2) preserving quality of life by minimizing dose to the nearby organs at risk around the prostate; and 3) establishing the relationship of pre- and serial post-Tx MP-MRI parameters to PathCR.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria: A. Biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma (including ductal) of the prostate. B. T1T3 disease based on digital rectal exam. C. No evidence of metastasis by any clinical criteria or available radiographic tests (N0M0 by clinical or imaging criteria). D. Gleason score 610. E. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is at the discretion of the treating physician; but, must be decided (none, shortterm or longterm as counted from the luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist injection) prior to enrollment. An antiandrogen (e.g., bicalutamide at 50 mg per day po) is recommended to start prior to LHRH agonist injection (not recommended for LHRH antagonist injection) and is recommended to not be administered for more than 4 months. However if it is planned, the following restrictions apply: i. It may be initiated no more than 3 months prior to the signing of consent ii. It must be started prior to the start of radiotherapy and iii. The total length planned must be ≤ 30 months F. Prostatespecific Antigen (PSA) ≤ 100 ng/mL within (+/) 4 months of signing of consent. If PSA was above 100 and drops to &lt; 100 with antibiotics, this is acceptable for enrollment. G. Subjects with T3 disease based on digital rectal exam (DRE), Gleason 810 or a PSA of &gt;15 ng/ml, should have a bone scan within (+/) 4 months of signing of consent that is without evidence of metastasis. A questionable bone scan is acceptable if additional imaging studies (e.g., plain xrays, CT, or MRI) do not confirm for metastasis. H. Suspicious peripheral zone or central gland lesion on MPMRI i. Peripheral zone: Distinct lesion on dynamic contrastenhanced MRI (DCEMRI) with early enhancement and later washout (Note: contrast not required for enrollment), and/or distinct lesion on the ADC map (Value &lt;1000). ii. Central gland: A suspicious central gland lesion on MPMRI must have a distinct lesion on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (Value &lt;1000) I. No previous pelvic radiotherapy. J. No previous history of radical/total prostatectomy (suprapubic prostatectomy is acceptable). K. No concurrent, active malignancy, other than nonmetastatic skin cancer or early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (welldifferentiated small cell lymphocytic lymphoma). If a prior malignancy is in remission for ≥ 5 years then the patient is eligible. L. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. M. Zubrod performance status ≤ 2. (Karnofsky or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status may be used to estimate Zubrod). N. Willingness to fill out quality of life/psychosocial forms. O. Age ≥ 35 and ≤ 85 years at signing of consent.</criteria>
