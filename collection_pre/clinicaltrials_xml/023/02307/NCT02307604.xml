	<brief_summary>The SPECTAbrain protocol describes a structure for screening patients with brain tumors to efficiently allocate eligible patients in relevant therapeutic biomarker-driven clinical trials. Efficiency is promoted through the creation of a clinical database of brain tumor patients and the respective human biological material biobank for molecular characterization. The main objectives are to: - Allocate patients to clinical trials according to the clinical characteristics and molecular profile of their tumor; - Identify or validate new molecularly defined subgroups of tumors; - Investigate the prevalence of novel biomarkers to plan future clinical trials; - Enable exploratory/future research; - Facilitate establishment of quality-assured and validated tests for Central Nervous System (CNS) tumor biomarkers;</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed newly diagnosed primary CNS tumors, with a focus on diffuse gliomas of grades II, III and IV, meningiomas from patients who are candidates for pharmacotherapy, and rare CNS tumors; Availability of adequate Human Biological Material (HBM): FFPE tissue sample from the primary and/or recurrent tumor and/or metastasis, obtained at the time of surgery or biopsy; minimal amount requested is detailed in the HBM guidelines. Inclusion of samples taken at any recurrence diagnosed during followup is strongly encouraged but optional; At least three months life expectancy; Written informed consent according to ICH/GCP and national/local regulations; Absence of exclusion criteria, such as active hepatitis B/C or HIV, second malignancies, severe organ dysfunction, or other comorbidities that will prevent inclusion into clinical trials.</criteria>
