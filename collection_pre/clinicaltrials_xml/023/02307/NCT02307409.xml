	<brief_summary>This study attempts to clarify the pathophysiology of haemostasis and haematopoiesis in relation to the evidence of sepsis in liver disease, and compares the accuracy of various available laboratory tests in assessment of these patients. Further research is needed for proper understanding of the influence of sepsis on coagulation disorders in ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure) patients in particular, to correctly identify the type and optimal quantity of blood product requirement in at risk patients. Thromboelastography (TEG) /Sonoclot have been proposed as a superior tool to rapidly diagnose and help guide resuscitation with blood products. Secondly, the study of derangement in coagulopathy after the onset of sepsis is of paramount importance because of increased mortality after the onset of sepsis. In the present study, patients with ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure) without evidence of sepsis on admission will be included in the study cohort, and will undergo a baseline diagnostic workup as described. They will be followed for development of any signs of infection after hospitalization. Then the effect of sepsis on their coagulation and haematopoietic cellular responses will be assessed. Thus the effect of sepsis on the progression and outcome of patients with ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure) will be studied.</brief_summary>
