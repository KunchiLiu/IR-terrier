	<brief_title>Occipital Transcutaneous Stimulation in Chronic Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic migraine is a disabling neurological condition affecting 0.5-2% of the population. CM is difficult to treat and preventive treatment options are limited. Due to the inefficiency of available and the lack of new preventive anti-migraine drug, neurostimulation methods have raised great interest in recent years. The ONSTIM study showed a reduction in headache frequency in 39% of patients treated with active ONS during 12 weeks, compared to no improvement in the "non-effectively" stimulated or medically treated groups.</detailed_description>
