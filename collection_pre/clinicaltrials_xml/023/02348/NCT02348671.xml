	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if wound dressings are capable in reducing the effects of shear- force at the skin. With our own shear- force model we are able to apply 19 Newton shear- force combined with 9 newton pressure at the skin of the non- dominant forearm. After half an hour we measure IL-1alpha/ total protein- ratio, cutaneous blood flow (Laser doppler, Moor LDI) and the erythema index (DSMIIColormeter) which occurs as an effect of shear- force application at the skin. Then, we apply 19 Newton shear- force combined with 9 Newton pressure at the dominant fore-arm but this time we put a wound dressing between the skin and shear- force model. After half an hour we measure the IL-1alpha/total protein-ratio, cutaneous blood flow and the erythema index. This research consists of three research day, each day we are going to investigate a different wound dressing</brief_summary>
