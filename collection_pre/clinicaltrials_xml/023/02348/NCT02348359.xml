	<brief_title>X-82 to Treat Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following dose groups: - X-82 50 mg plus ivt anti-VEGF prn - X-82 100 mg plus ivt anti-VEGF prn - X-82 200 mg plus ivt anti-VEGF prn - Placebo plus ivt anti-VEGF prn Subjects will be treated for a total of 52 weeks with one of three doses of X-82 or placebo. Primary Efficacy Outcome: The primary efficacy outcome is the change in visual acuity score from Day -1 to 52 Weeks after randomization. Safety Outcomes: Systemic and ocular safety will be evaluate by assessing ECG, laboratory analyses, adverse events and serious adverse events. Approximately 132 subjects will be randomized into one of the four arms (33 subjects per dose group).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants mush have wet AMD which has been diagnosed and treated with antiVEGF in one or both eyes for at least 6 months prior to joining the study and has required at least two prior injections of intravitreal (ivt) antiVEGF at intervals of not greater than 6 weeks for the past two injections in the eye that is selected to be the study eye. Must have demonstrated a reduction in macular fluid or macular thickness in the study eye 14 days following an antiVEGF injection at Screening Visit 1 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of 25 letters (20/320) or better in both eyes Previous vitrectomy to the study eye within 30 days of Screening Visit 1 Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to causes other than AMD Proliferative diabetic retinopathy in either eye</criteria>
