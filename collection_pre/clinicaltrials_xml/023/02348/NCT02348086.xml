	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), has on pain and functionality in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SVF contains multiple cellular components, including stem cells, with both regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties. This therapy has shown promise for ameliorating the symptoms of RA. This study is designed to evaluate changes in pain and functionality in individuals with RA for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.</brief_summary>
