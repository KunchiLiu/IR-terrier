	<brief_summary>U.S. Army Medical Research &amp; Materiel Command Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) is sponsoring the HF2 (Healthy Families, Healthy Forces) Study. This is a randomized trial comparing two different interventions for sustainable weight loss. Specifically, the investigators will compare a "current best practice(CBP)" intervention that includes standard dietary advice with a new, "Healthy Weight for Living (HWL)" intervention that includes recommendations to eat a diet rich in protein, dietary fiber, low glycemic index carbohydrates and low calorie foods. The objective of this study is to compare the CBP and HWL interventions when delivered to adult dependents of active duty (AD) military personnel and measure weight loss effects in both the adult dependents and the AD military personnel they live with.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized trial comparing two different interventions for sustainable weight loss. Specifically researchers will compare a current best practice (CBP) intervention that includes standard dietary advice with a new Healthy Weight for Living (HWL) intervention that includes recommendations to eat a diet rich in protein, dietary fiber and low glycemic index carbohydrates. The population will be adult dependents of Active Duty (AD) military personnel or retired military personnel (direct intervention participants) and the AD or retired military personnel they live with (indirect intervention participants). The primary outcome will be weight change from baseline to 2 years in the adult dependents. The objective of this study is to compare the CBP and HWL interventions when delivered to adult dependents of AD or retired military personnel and measure weight loss effects in both the adult dependents and the AD or retired military personnel they live with. The working hypothesis is that that the HWL intervention will result in significantly greater weight loss over 2 years than the CBP intervention in an intent-to-treat analysis in adult dependents and their AD or retired military personnel, and that the greater weight loss in HWL will be associated with improved management of hunger and greater adherence to the goal of reducing energy intake. The researchers plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the study objectives with the following technical objectives: 1. Conduct a randomized trial comparing the HWL intervention to the CBP intervention over 2 years in adult dependents of AD or retired military personnel. The primary outcome will be weight change from baseline to 2 years. The working hypothesis is that randomization to the HWL intervention will result in significantly greater weight loss over 2 years than randomization to the CBP intervention, and that greater weight loss in the HWL intervention will be associated with greater adherence to the goals of reducing energy intake and hunger. 2. Examine the effects of the interventions delivered to adult dependents of AD or retired military personnel on the weight of AD or retired military personnel themselves. The working hypothesis, based on preliminary data, is that there will be a "ripple" effect of program benefits from intervention participants to the AD or retired military personnel they live with; specifically, overweight and obese AD or retired military personnel will lose more weight if their partner is randomized to the HWL intervention compared to the CBP intervention, because the weight loss of AD or retired military personnel indirectly exposed to the intervention will be proportional to the weight loss of their adult dependent who is directly exposed. 3. Compare the effects of the two interventions on changes in cardiometabolic risk factors. The working hypothesis is that there will be significantly greater improvements between baseline and 2 years in key cardiometabolic risk factors in adult dependents enrolled in the HWL intervention compared to the CBP intervention, and differences between groups will be predicted by differences in weight loss.</detailed_description>
