Participant has a clinically significant ECG abnormality at Screening or prior to study drug administration in Period 1. 19. Participant has abnormal laboratory values at Screening or prior to study drug administration of Period 1 that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is &gt;1.5fold the upper limits of normal range. 20. Participant who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.</criteria>
