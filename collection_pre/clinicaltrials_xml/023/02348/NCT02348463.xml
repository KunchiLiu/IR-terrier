	<brief_summary>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a known risk factor for preterm delivery. This study was conducted in an attempt to investigate if treatment of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy could reduce the risk for preterm delivery. Women were screened for bacterial vaginosis during the first visits at the maternal health care unit with a vaginal sample that were taken by the midwife or by herself. After the vaginal samples was air dried it was sent to the gynaecological department and was investigated using Hay/Ison classification. Eligible women were those who had lived in Skaraborg and delivered at Skaraborg hospital.</brief_summary>
