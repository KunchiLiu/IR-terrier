	<brief_summary>The main purpose this study is to analyze the effects of isometric handgrip training on cardiovascular risk in hypertensive. For this, approximately 60 hypertensive, under anti-hypertensive medication, will be selected and randomly distributed into three groups: home-based isometric handgrip training (HBT), supervised isometric handgrip training (ST) and control group (CG).Subjects assigned to the HBT and ST will train three times per week for a total of 12 weeks, will perform a bout of isometric handgrip exercise: four sets of 2-min isometric contractions (using alternate hands) at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction. However, the subjects of the HBT group conduct the training without daily supervision. Subjects randomized to the CG will be encouraged to increase the level of physical activity and make healthy eating, without, however, receive specific recommendations.Baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention, the following cardiovascular risk indicators will be obtained: blood pressure, arterial stiffness, cardiac autonomic modulation, vasodilatory capacity and oxidative and inflammatory stress markers, in addition to microalbuminuria. For data analysis, in addition to descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA for mixed model will be applied for within and between groups comparison. If the premises of this test are met. The level of significance that will be adopted is p&lt;0.05.</brief_summary>
