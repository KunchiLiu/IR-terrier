	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), has on the quality of life of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SVF contains multiple cellular components, including stem cells, with both regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties. This therapy has shown promise for ameliorating the symptoms of COPD. This study is designed to evaluate quality of life changes in individuals with COPD for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.</brief_summary>
