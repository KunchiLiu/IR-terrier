	<brief_summary>The investigators designed a prospective randomized, controlled clinical trial then recruited 149 consecutive advanced gastric cancer patients. Further divided into a ERAS group (n=73) and a conventional pathway group (n=76). Surgical technique in both groups was same laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Compared outcomes included clinical parameters and serum indicators.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enhanced recovery after surgery combined with laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy was successfully carried out in this study. Recovery parameters such as the length of time to return to normal diet,mean hospital stay (d) were recorded.</detailed_description>
