	<brief_summary>60% of the patients hospitalized in intensive care and sedated suffer from insufficient inferior eyelid occlusion. Thus, they are at risk for corneal damage (estimated risk 20% to 57%). The prevention of such corneal damage can be done using several techniques (artificial tears, eyelid occlusion dressing, aqueous gel). The efficacy of these techniques has never been compared in a rigorous study. Therefore it is not yet possible to determine an evidence-based strategy to prevent corneal damage in intensive care patients. This study aims at assessing the efficacy of primary prevention of corneal lesions in intensive care patients, in order to elaborate an evidence-based nursing protocol.</brief_summary>
