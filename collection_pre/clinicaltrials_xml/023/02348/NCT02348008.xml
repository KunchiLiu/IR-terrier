	<brief_title>Phase Ib and Phase II Studies of MK-3475 in Combination + for Renal Cell Carcinoma:</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. The phase Ib dose escalation study will evaluate MK-3475 in combination with bevacizumab in subjects with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma after failure of at least one systemic therapy for metastatic disease. The phase II trial will determine the activity of the combination of MK-3475 and bevacizumab in first line therapy for subjects with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma. PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Cohort 1 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive MK-3475 200mg and bevacizumab 5mg on day 1 of the 21-day cycle. The drugs are administered 15-30 minutes apart in separate intravenous infusions. Cohort 2 will consist of 3-9 patients who will receive MK-3475 200mg and bevacizumab 10mg on day 1 of the 21-day cycle. The drugs are administered 15-30 minutes apart in separate intravenous infusions. If none of the 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of therapy, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all three subjects in dose level 2 complete the first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be enrolled to ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no further escalation beyond dose level 2. PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: The maximum safe dose of MK-3475 in combination bevacizumab (as determined in the phase 1b cohort) will be given on day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes. Subjects who voluntarily stop the study, have progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followed for a total of 24 months. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70% within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. Life Expectancy: 6 months or greater The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy: Hematopoietic: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L - Platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9/L - Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Renal: - Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) - OR, if serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40 mL/min Hepatic: - Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN - OR, AST and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy Coagulation: - INR &lt; 1.5 × ULN - OR for subjects receiving warfarin or LMWH, the subjects must, in the investigator's opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy. The INR for these subjects may exceed 1.5 × ULN if that is the goal of anticoagulant therapy.</detailed_description>

The INR for these subjects may exceed 1.5 × ULN if that is the goal of anticoagulant therapy.

Examples may include but are not limited to: Hemoptysis (defined as &gt; ½ teaspoon of blood) Preexisting bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy or hemorrhage Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to study registration Any drugs or supplements that interfere with blood clotting can raise the risk of bleeding during treatment with bevacizumab. These drugs include vitamin E, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), warfarin (Coumadin), ticlopidine (Ticlid), and clopidogrel (Plavix).These agents should be used with caution. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment in this study. Presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to study registration. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize the safety of the subject or interfere with protocol compliance. Any mental or medical condition that prevents the subject from giving informed consent or participating in the trial. No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, Gleason ≤ grade 7 prostate cancers, or other cancer for which the subject has been diseasefree for at least 5 years. Received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways).
