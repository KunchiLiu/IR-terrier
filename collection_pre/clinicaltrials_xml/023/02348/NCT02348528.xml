	<brief_summary>CC5013-MM024 is a multicenter, open-label, Extended Access Program (EAP) of lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone regimen in Chinese subjects with relapsed or refractory MM who participated in Study CC-5013-MM-021. For subjects who remained progression free under Rd treatment of Study CC-5013-MM-02 1, this LAP offers the option to continue lenalidomide treatment for subjects who have shown therapeutic benefit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label Extended Access Program on Lenalidomide Plus Dexamethasone in Chinese Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Who Participated in CC-5013-MM021 for at Least 1 Year</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After subjects who are still on treatment have completed at least 1 year of therapy in Study CC-5013-MM-021 (from the start date of lenalidomide treatment), the EAP will allow consented subjects who (1) have remained progression free under Rd treatment in Study CC-SO I3-MM-02 I to roll over to the Treatment Phase of the LAP to continue Rd treatment, and (2) have discontinued Rd therapy and are currently in the Long-Term Follow-up Phase in Study CC-5013-MM-021 to roll over to the Safety Follow-up Phase of the EAP for survival and SPM outcomes. The maximum duration of this LAP program is at least 5 years from the time the last on-study</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who discontinued treatment but remained for longterm followup in the CC5013MM021 study are required to sign an informed consent document (ICD) to roll over to the Safety Followup Phase of the Extended Access Program (EAP). These subjects do not require screening for eligibility but must agree to be followed for survival and Second Primary Malignancy (SPM) at a minimum of every 4 months (Â± 7 days) intervals for at least 5 years from the time the last onstudy subject enrolled in Study CC5013MM021. Subjects who are consented for the Treatment Phase of the EAP must meet the following criteria to continue the same therapy as they received in the Study CC5013MM021: 1. Completed at least 1year of lenalidomide plus lowdose dexamethasone (Rd) treatment and remained progression free under Rd treatment in Study CC5013MM021 at the time of screening visit of this EAP. 2. Able to adhere study visit schedule, compliance with study drug and other protocol requirements in Study CC5013MM024. 3. Consented to the EAP protocol. 4. Must agree to comply with all Pregnancy Prevention requirements. 5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1: Must agree to use, and be able to comply with, at least 2 forms of reliable contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse without interruption, from transferring/rolling over from the CC5013MM021 study, at the screening visit for eligibility, throughout study drug therapy (including dose interruptions) and for 28 days after the end of study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhea. This applies even if the subject practices complete and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. Must agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/mL (i.e., negative pregnancy test) at screening for eligibility and then every 28 days while on study. For any FCBP, pregnancy testing must continue at the same frequency as during the MM021 study. If regular or no menstrual cycles, she must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study (every 28 days), during dose interruptions, at study discontinuation and 28 days following study drug discontinuation. If menstrual cycles are irregular, pregnancy testing must occur every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation and at 14 and 28 days following study drug discontinuation. This requirement also applies to females of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued sexual abstinence. Must agree not to breastfeed during study drug therapy and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation. 6. Male subjects: Must agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP, even if they have had a vasectomy, throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation. Must agree to not donate semen or sperm during study drug therapy and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation. Subjects who have a positive finding of pregnancy testing at screening will not be eligible for the Treatment Phase of the EAP but will be consented for the Safety Followup Phase in the EAP. Subjects will not continue treatment at the discretion of the physician if any of the following criteria occurred during treatment in the CC5013MM021 study or during the Screening Phase. All subjects that are not eligible to continue treatment will enter the Safety Followup Phase: 1. Serious hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to lenalidomide or dexamethasone. 2. Serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent document. 3. Any other condition, including the presence of serious laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 4. Previously discontinued lenalidomide treatment due to toxicity. 5. Newly diagnosed malignancy other than Multiple Myeloma (MM), except the following: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Carcinoma in situ of the cervix Carcinoma in situ of the breast Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b using the tumor, nodes, metastasis [TNM] clinical staging system) or prostate cancer that is curative</criteria>
