	<brief_title>Comparison of SensaScope Intuboscope and McGrath Series 5 for Endotracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of videolaryngoscopy is increasing as a technique for rescue intubation as well as for elective intubation. Current airway management guidelines recommend video-assisted laryngoscopy as a choice for basic airway management. This is a proposed comparison study of a video laryngoscope, use in the daily anesthesia practice, and its likely increased success compared to semi-rigid stylet. An national, mono center, prospective randomized comparative trial (RCT) is proposed testing the superiority of oral tracheal intubation with the McGrath® Series 5 versus SensaScope in adult patients under general anaesthesia.</detailed_description>
