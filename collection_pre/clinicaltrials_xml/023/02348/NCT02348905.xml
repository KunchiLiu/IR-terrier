	<brief_title>ACTHAR Gel for Cutaneous Sarcoidosis: An Open Label Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown cause. Although sarcoidosis most commonly affects the lung3, it may affect any organ. Although corticosteroids are recognized as the drug of choice for sarcoidosis, ACTH is the only drug that is FDA-approved for this disorder. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of ACTH for this condition. Presently, corticosteroids as considered the drug of choice for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis. However, ACTHER GEL not only has obvious anti-inflammatory effects by resulting in corticosteroid production, but it may also activate melanocortin receptors. The melanocortin system has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis.</detailed_description>
