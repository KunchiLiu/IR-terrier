	<detailed_description>Intrauterine adhesions following gynaecological surgery is a major complication which may cause a range of severe clinical symptoms in women. IUA's can result in menstrual abnormalities, dysmenorrhea and infertility. In pregnancy, adhesions are related to miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, abnormal placentation, premature labor and delivery and possibly birth defects. CollaGUARD adhesion barrier is a transparent bioresorbable film approved in Europe for the prevention of postoperative adhesions in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic laparotomy or laparoscopy. This study will assess the feasibility of using CollaGUARD adhesion device in hysteroscopic surgery.</detailed_description>
