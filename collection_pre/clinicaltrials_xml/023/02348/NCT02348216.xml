	<criteria>Key Inclusion Criteria 1. Histologically confirmed: Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Primary Mediastinal Large B Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) Transformation Follicular Lymphoma (TFL) 2. Chemotherapyrefractory disease, defined as one of more of the following: No response to last line of therapy i. PD as best response to most recent therapy regimen ii. SD as best response to most recent therapy with duration no longer than 6 month from last dose of therapy OR Refractory postASCT i. Disease progression or relapsed less than or equal to 12 months of ASCT (must have biopsy proven recurrence in relapsed subjects) ii. If salvage therapy is given postASCT, the subject must have had no response to or relapsed after the last line of therapy 3. Subjects must have received adequate prior therapy including at a minimum: antiCD20 monoclonal antibody unless investigator determines that tumor is CD20negative and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen for subjects with transformed FL must have received prior chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma and subsequently have chemorefractory disease after transformation to DLBCL 4. At least one measurable lesion per revised IWG Response Criteria 5. Age 18 or older 6. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 7. ANC ≥ 1000/uL 8. ALC &gt;100/uL 9. Platelet count ≥ 75,000/uL 10. Adequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary and cardiac function defined as: Creatinine clearance (as estimated by Cockcroft Gault) &gt; 60 mL/min Serum ALT/AST &lt;2.5 ULN Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dl, except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome Cardiac ejection fraction &gt;50%, no evidence of pericardial effusion as determined by an ECHO, and no clinically significant pleural effusion Baseline oxygen saturation &gt;92% on room air 11. All subjects or legally appointed representatives/caregivers, must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC approved consent form before initiating any study specific procedures or activities. Key Exclusion Criteria 1. History of malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast) or follicular lymphoma unless disease free for at least 3 years 2. History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation 3. Prior CAR therapy or other genetically modified T cell therapy 4. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled or requiring IV antimicrobials for management. Simple UTI and uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis are permitted if responding to active treatment 5. Known history of infection with HIV or hepatitis B (HBsAG positive) or hepatitis C virus (antiHCV positive). A history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C is permitted if the viral load is undetectable per quantitative PCR and/or nucleic acid testing 6. Subjects with detectable cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells, or brain metastases, or with a history of CNS lymphoma, cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells or brain metastases 7. History or presence of CNS disorder such as seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement</criteria>
