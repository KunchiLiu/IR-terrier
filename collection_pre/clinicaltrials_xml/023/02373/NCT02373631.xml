	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness of conventional physical therapy (manual physical therapy, exercise, range of motion, and stretching) versus conventional physical therapy combined with dry needling in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Physical therapists commonly use conventional physical therapy techniques and dry needling to treat knee OA, and this study is attempting to find out if the addition of dry needling to conventional physical therapy has an equal, greater, or lesser effect than conventional physical therapy alone.</brief_summary>
