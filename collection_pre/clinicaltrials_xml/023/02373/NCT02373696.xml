	<brief_summary>Incidence and risk factors for persistent post surgical pain after Caesarean section are investigated. Demographic, psychophysical testing and genetic screening factors are performed in the perioperative period. Phone survey is performed to investigate the incidence of persistent post surgical pain after Caesarean section.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persistent post surgical pain after Caesarean section may lead to functional limitation and pain during activities of daily living. Demographic factors, psychophysical factors (mechanical temporal summation, diffuse noxious inhibitory control, state trait anxiety inventory) and genetic screening are used to predict the association with persistent post surgical pain. Phone survey follow up is performed to investigate the incidence of persistent post surgical pain and functional limitations due to pain experienced.</detailed_description>
