	<brief_summary>Trachoma is a blinding disease caused by ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. The Carter Center and Proctor Foundation have been jointly conducting trachoma research in the Goncha Siso Enese woreda of Amhara for the past 8 years, through a series of clinical trials. We have found that repeated mass administration of oral azithromycin can greatly reduce the prevalence of trachoma, but mass antibiotics have been unable thus far to eliminate infection. The World Health Organization recommends not only antibiotics for control of trachoma, but an entire SAFE strategy (Surgery for in-turned eyelids, Antibiotics, Facial hygiene promotion, and Environmental improvements such as latrines and water points). Trachoma is more common in villages and households with poor access to water and latrines, so improving the public health infrastructure is thought to be important for limiting transmission of trachoma. However, there is very little evidence to support the efficacy of installing new water points for trachoma. There has been only one previous attempt to study the role of hand dug well installation for trachoma control, and this study, conducted in Niger, found that installing wells was not effective. We now propose a project to improve the public health infrastructure of Goncha Siso Enese woreda by helping with the construction of water points (e.g., hand-dug wells) and providing hygiene education, in order to determine whether improving access to water and hygiene information will be effective for control of trachoma and soil-transmitted helminths.</brief_summary>
