	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept monotherapy compared to methotrexate monotherapy on maintenance of remission in subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis who were on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy. This is a multicenter, randomized withdrawal, double-blind controlled study in subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy who are in very good disease control for 6 months prior to study entry. The study will consist of a 30-day screening period, a 24-week open label run-in period, a 48-week double-blind treatment period and a 30-day safety follow-up period. Approximately 465 subjects will be enrolled and approximately 325 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups: etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral placebo for methotrexate (n = 130), oral methotrexate 10 to 25 mg weekly plus placebo for etanercept (n = 130) and etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral methotrexate 10 to 25 mg weekly (n = 65).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must be adults with a history of moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis; Subjects must be in very good Rheumatoid Arthritis disease control for ≥ 6 months and be in remission as defined by a Simplified Disease Activity Index ≤ 3.3 at screening and at the end of the runin period. Subjects must be on etanercept 50 mg per week plus methotrexate therapy for ≥ 6 months prior to the start of the runin period. The methotrexate dose must be 10 to 25 mg per week for ≥ 6 months prior to the start of the runin period and the dose must be stable for ≥ 8 weeks prior to the start of the runin period. Subject has no known history of active tuberculosis, and has a negative test for tuberculosis during screening. Subject has used biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug other than etanercept OR has used an oral janus kinase inhibitor ≤ 6 months prior to runin visit 1 Subject has any active infection (including chronic or localized infections) for which antiinfectives were indicated within 4 weeks prior to runin visit 1. Subject has known alcohol addiction or dependency or uses alcohol daily. Subject has one or more significant concurrent medical conditions per investigator judgment, including the following: poorly controlled diabetes chronic kidney disease stage IIIb, IV, or V symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV) myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris within the past 12 months prior to randomization uncontrolled hypertension severe chronic pulmonary disease (eg, requiring oxygen therapy) multiple sclerosis or any other demyelinating disease major chronic inflammatory disease or connective tissue disease other than Rheumatoid Arthritis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus with the exception of secondary Sjögren's syndrome)</criteria>
