	<brief_summary>Postoperative pulmonary complications are main cause of overall perioperative morbidity and mortality in the patients following general anesthesia. A protective ventilation strategy refers to the use of low VT (in the range of 4-8 ml/kg of the predicted body weight) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with or without recruitment maneuver. Protective ventilation has been considered the optimal practice in patients suffering from the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, few human studies have assessed how to ventilate healthy lungs in patients undergoing general anesthesia, especially in prone position. Prior studies reported that in the patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in supine position, intraoperative lung protective ventilator settings had the potential to protect against pulmonary complications. Therefore, the investigators planned this study to better specify the effect of intraoperative protective ventilation in surgical patients in the prone position.</brief_summary>
