	<brief_title>Characterization of Methylation Patterns in Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lots of information about the relationship between changes in methylation patterns and various diseases are accumulated in recent years. Characterization of methylation changes that occur in cancer may contribute to the development of methods for early detection of cancer by detecting cancer cells in liquids. Early detection of such changes and their correlation examining different cancers may lead to a diagnostic tool for the early detection of cancers and improve the treatment of these patients. Detection by molecular analysis can be a sensitive method and non-invasive early diagnosis of the disease In this study the investigators will collect Blood,sputum and saliva samples for Characterization of Methylation Patterns in lung Cancer.</detailed_description>
