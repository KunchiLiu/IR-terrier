	<brief_title>Effect of SVV Guided Fluid Therapy on Blood Loss and Postoperative Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of stroke volume variation(SVV) guided fluid therapy on the blood loss and postoperative outcomes in radical cystectomy. Patients were randomized to fluid management to maintain &lt;10% SVV (group A), or to undergo fluid management during radical cystectomy to maintain SVV 10-20% (group B). Intraoperative blood loss and hemodynamic parameters, perioperative laboratory data, and postoperative complications were compared between two groups.</detailed_description>
