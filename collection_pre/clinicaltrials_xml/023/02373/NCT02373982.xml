	<brief_summary>This is a Multicenter Observational 1-year retrospective cohort study evaluating the predictive value of the Left Atrial Sphericity on the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation after pulmonary vein ablation procedure. Inclusion of consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation during 2013 in whom a 3D-imaging of the left atrium (Cardiac CT or MRA) was acquired prior to the procedure and when procedural/follow-up data was prospectively collected.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Validation of the predictive value of the Left Atrial Sphericity for AF recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a pulmonary vein ablation procedure in an external, multicenter cohort. In total, 9 centers will include consecutive patients who underwent AF ablation from january to december 2013 in whom a 3D-imaging of the left atrium (Cardiac CT or MRA) was acquired prior to the procedure and when procedural/follow-up data was prospectively collected.</detailed_description>
