	<brief_summary>Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection requires daily oral administration of a combination of antiretroviral drugs to reduce the patient's HIV levels. Dolutegravir (DTG), a HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), and Rilpivirine (RPV), a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), are approved for the treatment of HIV infection. This study is aimed to evaluate the relative bioavailability and food effect of single doses of several experimental fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of Dolutegravir 50 milligrams (mg) and Rilpivirine 25 mg (DTG/RPV 50 mg/25 mg) relative to co-administration of a single dose of the reference single entity products (DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg) in healthy adult subjects. This is a 2-part study. Part 1 will be conducted as a randomized, open label, 3-way, crossover design in 24 subjects. Part 1 will evaluate the relative bioavailability of up to 4 test formulations relative to the reference single entity products administered in fed state. Part 2 will be conducted as a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover design in 3 distinct cohorts each with 12 subjects. Part 2 will evaluate the relative bioavailability of up to 3 most promising FDC formulation selected from Part 1 (DTG/RPV FDC-1, DTG/RPV FDC-2, DTG/RPV FDC-3) administered in fasted and fed state. Subjects will also receive the reference treatment from Part 1 co-administered under fasted conditions. This study will consist of a screening visit, three treatment periods each with a single dose of study drug separated by a washout of at least 9 days and a follow-up visit. The total duration of participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 10 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac evaluation (history, electrocardiogram [ECG]). A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) (110 pounds [lbs]) for men and &gt;=45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.531.0 kg/square meter (m^2) (inclusive). Male or Female Female: Female subject of nonreproductive potential : is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Premenopausal females with one of the following: documented tubal ligation, documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, documented bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea; in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of reproductive potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until at least five terminal halflives (10 days) after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. GSK Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) This list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis. Intrauterine device that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label. Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. Male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository). These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Male: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until [at least five halflives of study medication OR for a cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal halflives] after the last dose of study medication. 1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. 2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label. Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label. Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestrogen alone. Injectable progestrogen. Contraceptive vaginal ring. Percutaneous contraceptive patches. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label.
