	<brief_summary>[14C]PRC-4016 (Icosabutate) - A Phase I, Open-Label Study of the Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion Following Oral Dosing to Healthy Male Subjects. Objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of total radioactivity in blood and plasma and PRB-01022 (icosabutate) (unchanged drug) in plasma following a single oral administration of [14C]PRC-4016 to healthy male subjects. To obtain a mass balance of oral [14C]PRC-4016 by quantifying the urinary and faecal excretion of radioactivity. To examine the profile of metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces. To further assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of [14C]PRC 4016 in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
