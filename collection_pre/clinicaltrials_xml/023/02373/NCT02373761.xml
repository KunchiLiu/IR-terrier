	<brief_title>A Prospective Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) and Clinical Evaluation of the Triathlon Tritanium Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis: The investigators expect the tibial and patellar components of the Stryker Triathlon Tritanium knee to achieve adequate fixation to the underlying bone. Secondary Hypotheses: The investigators expect that there will be no continuous migration between one and two years post-operative in the Triathlon Tritanium components. The investigators expect to see a correlation between radiolucent lines and migration characteristics using RSA. The investigators expect that inducible displacement exams taken at 2 years post-operative will be able to distinguish between patients identified by RSA measurements as having inadequate fixation. The investigators expect to see a significant difference in health status and functional outcomes before and after total knee replacement using the Triathlon Tritanium knee.</detailed_description>
