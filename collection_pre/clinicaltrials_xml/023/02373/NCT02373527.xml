	<brief_title>Strict Versus No Fasting Prior to Cardiac Catheterization: A Prospective Evaluation of Safety and Clinical Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For years it has been common to have patients fast before a cardiac catheterization. It is believed that fasting may lower the risks of upset stomach, vomiting, and aspiration (stomach contents going to the lungs). New findings show that fasting before the procedure may not be needed. This study will look at the safety and possible benefits of not fasting.</detailed_description>
