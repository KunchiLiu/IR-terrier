	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Prognostic Value of the Antithrombin III in the Acute Pancreatitis (AT-PROPANC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an epidemiological, observational, prospective, multicentric study in 400 adult patients admitted to hospital for mild acute pancreatitis to to assess the prognostic value of the antithrombin III in the development of moderate or severe acute pancreatitis. In the context of clinical practice of general surgery and apparatus digestive services, patients entering with mild acute pancreatitis will be asked to participate in the study and if so, they will sign the informed consent. On admission, demographic and anthropometric data of the patient will be recorded, as well as medical history, patient's admission data and vital signs. Patient's blood will be drawn for analysys and the risk of organ failure will be measured by modified Marshall and Apache II scales. The assessments and procedures performed are the standard practice at the center. At 24 hours (± 3 hours) and at 7 days (or nine days to avoid weekends) after admisison, vital signs will be recorded, laboratory tests will be performed and the risk of organ failure will be measured by modified Marshall and Apache II scales. At discharge of the patient (regardless of when it occurs), the outcome of the acute pancreatitis will be recorded. . Those patients discharged within the first month after admission will be visited or called (according to standard practice at the center) one month after arrival, to record follow-up data, including health condition, readmissions and abdominal pain evaluation by visual analog scale.</detailed_description>
