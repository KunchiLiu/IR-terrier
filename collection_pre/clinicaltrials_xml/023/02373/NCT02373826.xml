	<brief_summary>During coronary angiography, the lumen of the arteries is imaged but intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is necessary to determine the plaque extension and its composition, lesion length and luminal reference diameter. We aimed to investigate the accuracy, feasibility, safety and value of a novel method for co-registration of IVUS and coronary angiographic images.</brief_summary>
