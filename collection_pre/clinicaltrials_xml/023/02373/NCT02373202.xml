	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), according to the American College of Rheumatology/The European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria with ≥3 months disease duration. Moderately to severely active RA defined as: At least 4 of 68 tender joints and 4 of 66 swollen joints at screening visit. High sensitivity CReactive Protein (hsCRP) ≥4mg/L or Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥28 mm/hr at screening visit. For the combination stratum: Patients who had continuous treatment with nonbiologic DMARDs other than MTX for at least 12 weeks prior to the randomization. OR Patients who per investigator judgment were any of inappropriate, intolerant or inadequate to MTX treatment. Exclusion criteria: Patients &lt;20 years of age. Prior treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists or any other RAdirected biologic agents without the appropriate offdrug period prior to screening. Prior treatment with antiinterleukin6 (antiIL6) or antiinterleukin6 receptor (IL6R) antagonist therapies, including but not limited to tocilizumab or sarilumab.
