	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are (1) to validate a self-screening method for cardiovascular (CV) risk that does not require the supervision of a health professional (including self-measurement of blood pressure, lipid profile evaluated by dry chemistry, and self-administered questionnaires on sex, age, diabetes, and tobacco consumption). (2) From these data, the investigators will generate personalized recommendations based on the best available evidence. The investigators will also analyze whether this innovative approach improves adherence to preventive recommendations for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-screening of Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary prevention activities based on some admittedly blunt screening instruments such as cardiovascular (CV) risk functions must be addressed to the whole population, prioritizing certain sectors of the population. However, the main limitation of current risk screening procedures is related to the natural history of cardiovascular disease, whose expression depends on the cumulative exposure to cardiovascular risk factors throughout a person's lifetime. Early prevention of cardiovascular disease is key to reduce this cumulative risk, thereby reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events. The objectives of this study are (1) to validate a self-screening method for cardiovascular risk that does not require the supervision of a health professional (including self-measurement of blood pressure, lipid profile evaluated by dry chemistry, and self-administered questionnaires on sex, age, diabetes, and tobacco consumption). (2) From these data, the investigators will generate personalized recommendations based on the best available evidence. The investigators will also analyze whether this innovative approach improves adherence to preventive recommendations for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Cardiovascular risk measured with the self-screening method will be compared with the gold standard (cardiovascular risk supervised by health professional). Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention (communication of cardiovascular risk and recommendation of personalized preventive actions) or control groups (communication of cardiovascular risk). Subjects will be reexamined one year after recruitment for assessing adherence to the preventive recommendations in terms of improvement in the control of cardiovascular risk factors.</detailed_description>
