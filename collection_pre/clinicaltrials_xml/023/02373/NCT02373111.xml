	<brief_summary>Photoaging is caused by the superposition of chronic ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage on the intrinsic aging process, and accounts for the majority of age-associated changes in skin appearance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in UV-induced skin damage and diminish skin matrix protein levels, leading skin aging. Strategies utilizing endogenous skin antioxidants as well as plant-derived or synthetic compounds have been examined. Astaxanthin mainly from marine algae and crustaceans is a kind of carotenoids which were well-known photo-protective agents with strong antioxidant activity. Several studies have revealed that supplementation of astaxanthin effectively protect skin against UV damage through free radicals. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase-1 induced by UV irradiation is an important step toward skin aging. Recently, many studies pointed out that phytoestrogens exhibit agonistic and antagonistic estrogen activities, suppressing activity of MMP-1 in skin. Isoflavone is a kind of phytoestrogen from soybean and mainly act on skin and bones, inhibiting MMP-1 effectively. The present study is designed to take isoflavone combined with astaxanthin to maximize their anti-aging ability and objectively measure the effects of the mixture on facial wrinkles, hydration, and elasticity.</brief_summary>
