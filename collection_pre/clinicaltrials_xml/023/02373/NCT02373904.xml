	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria 1. Skeletally mature adult males and females 18 years of age or older. 2. Impending or actual pathological fracture of the humerus, secondary to metastatic bone disease. 3. Females: neither pregnant nor intending to become pregnant during the course of the study, defined as: 1. Postmenopausal for at least 1 year OR 2. Documented oophorectomy or hysterectomy 3. Surgically sterile OR 4. If of childbearing potential, must be practicing doublebarrier method of birth control, be willing to avoid pregnancy for the period of study participation and have a negative pregnancy test at screening 4. Able to understand and provide informed consent. 5. Willing and able to comply with postoperative treatment protocol and followup visit schedule. Impending FractureSpecific Inclusion Criteria 6. Documented presence of solitary metastatic lesion. 7. Mirels Criteria Score â‰¥ 8. 8. Destruction of cortical bone at impending fracture site &gt; 50%. Actual FractureSpecific Inclusion Criteria 9. Radiographconfirmed diagnosis of acute, single isolated fracture of the humerus. AO classification 11A1, 11A2 and 11B1, 11B2 and 12A1,12A2 and 12B1, 12B2 and 13A1,13A2 and 13B1, 13B2. 10. Fracture is closed, Gustilo Type I or IIA. General Exclusion Criteria 1. Primary tumor (osteogenic origin, etc.) at site. 2. Impending fracture or actual fracture location other than humerus. 3. Current concomitant traumatic fracture of any other location. 4. Active or incompletely treated infections that could involve the device implant site. 5. Distant foci of infection that may spread to the implant site. 6. Allergy to implant materials or dental glue. 7. Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease at implant site. 8. Uncooperative patients, or patients who are incapable of following directions (for example, as a consequence of a neurological or psychiatric disorder). Impending FractureSpecific Exclusion Criteria 9. Mirels Score &lt; 8. 10. Destruction of cortical bone at impending fracture site &lt; 50%. 11. Prior surgery and/or prior fracture of affected site. 12. Any articular component to impending fracture site. Actual FractureSpecific Exclusion Criteria 13. Index treatment is greater than 28 days post fracture. 14. Open fractures with severe contamination. 15. Extremely comminuted fractures where insufficient holding power of the balloon on the intramedullary canal is probable. 16. Delivery sheath is unable to cross fracture site after proper fracture reduction and realignment 17. Patients whose intramedullary canal at site of fracture measures smaller than the diameter of the sheath provided.</criteria>
