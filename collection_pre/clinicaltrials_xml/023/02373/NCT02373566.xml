	<brief_summary>In this study the efficacy of an acellular dermal template (Novomaix), combined with split thickness skin grafts, for use in patients with full thickness skin defects, is tested. Results will be compared intra-patient with those obtained after conventional treatment with split thickness skin grafts. The investigators expect this treatment to provide better outcome regarding scar quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of an Acellular Dermal Template for the Treatment of Full Thickness Skin Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using dermal substitutes in combination with a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is a well acknowledged therapy in burns and reconstructive surgery. Nevertheless, the ideal substitute is not available yet. We therefore want to investigate the use of an acellular dermal template (Novomaix), in combination with STSG, to treat these defects. Patients with with full thickness skin defects will be included in this study. This phase II study aims to investigate the efficacy of the use of this dermal matrix, with regard to scar quality as determined for elasticity at 3 months after treatment. Moreover, graft take (5-7 days after treatment), epithelialisation (5-7 days and 2-3 weeks), and scar quality (3 and 12 months after treatment, as determined for elasticity, colour/pigmentation, and using a subjective scar assessment scale) will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age ≥18 years (for Zurich: ≤ 18 years) Full thickness skin defects configured in such a way that two comparable and measurable areas can be grafted, both of minimally 3x3 cm ≤ 50% TBSA full thickness skin defects at time of intervention Informed consent by the patient and/or legal representatives. Patients with infected wounds Full thickness skin wounds located in face and/or genitals will not be included Pregnant or breast feeding females Patients with known concomitant medical conditions that may interfere with normal wound healing (e.g. immune deficiency, HIV, uncontrolled diabetes, treatment with corticoid therapy, collagenoses, cancer) Known allergy against porcine collagen or elastin Patients that are expected (according to the responsible medical doctor) to be noncompliant to the study protocol. (This includes patients with severe cognitive dysfunction/impairment and severe psychiatric disorders) Previous enrolment of the patient into the current study</criteria>
