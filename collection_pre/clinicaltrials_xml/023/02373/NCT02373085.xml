	<brief_summary>Antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) is controversial. The investigators performed a comparative, parallel-group, randomized, open-label study to assess, in a real clinical setting, the feasibility of and benefit derived from systematic search and antimicrobial treatment of all episodes of AB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Comparative Study About Treatment of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Kidney Transplant Recipients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients undergoing KT between January 2011 and December 2013 in a tertiary-care center with an active transplantation program were systematically searched for AB within the first 2 years after transplantation on a regular basis. During the first 2 months after transplantation all episodes of AB were treated. Thereafter, patients were assigned, according to a computer-generated randomization sequence, to group A (systematic antimicrobial treatment of all episodes of AB) or group B (no treatment). Treatment was chosen according to the results of the urine culture.</detailed_description>
