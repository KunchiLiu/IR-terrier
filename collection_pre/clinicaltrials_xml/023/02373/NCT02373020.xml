	<brief_summary>Despite the characterization of many aetiologic genetic changes. The specific causative factors in the development of sporadic colorectal cancer remain unclear. This study was performed to detect the possible role of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in developing colorectal carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteropathogenic Escherichia Coli (EPEC): Does it Have a Role in Colorectal Tumourigenesis?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fresh biopsy specimens have been obtained from the colonic mucosa overlying the colorectal cancer as well as from the colon of the healthy controls. Culture, genotyping and virulence of EPEC were done using (nutrient broth culture, and PCR). Strains biochemically identified as E. coli were selected from the surface of a MacConkey's plate and were serogrouped by slide agglutination tests</detailed_description>
