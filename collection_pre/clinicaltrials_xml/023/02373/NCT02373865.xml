	<brief_title>Risk of Nocturnal Hypoglycemia and Arrhythmias With Sitagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 Diabetes is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among patients insufficiently controlled with metformin multimorbidity and polypharmacy is common that makes the patients frail for cardiovascular complications related to hypoglycemic events. This exploratory double blind randomized active controlled study is designed to assess the effects of a treatment with therapeutical dosage of sitagliptin versus therapeutical dosage of glimepiride as add on therapy in patients with T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Examinations will be performed as a 5 day recording of subcutaneous glucose concentration (CGMS) and holder ECG (AMEDTEC) at baseline and after a 12 weeks treatment with sitagliptin or glimepiride as active comparators used in combination with metformin. With recording of nocturnal hypoglycemia and arrhythmias it is aimed to evaluate favorable glycemic profile under treatment with sitagliptin compared to glimepiride. The primary objective is risk of serious HE for both drugs. The glycemic profile of sitagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin seems to be favorable compared to sulfonylureass such as glimepiride. Treatment with sitagliptin as add-on to metformin therapy causes less glycemic fluctuations and may be associated with lower oxidative stress and down regulation of low grade inflammation. This hypothesis will be tested as an explorative double blind study.</detailed_description>
