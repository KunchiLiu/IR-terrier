	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies how well website application (web app) based education and text messaging works in improving skin wound care in patients undergoing Mohs surgery (a surgical procedure used to treat skin cancer). Website application and text messaging based education may help patients stick to wound care instructions before and after surgery, lower anxiety level, and may help monitor their activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Website Application Based Education and Text Messaging in Improving Skin Wound Care in Patients Undergoing Mohs Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To create a web application which will educate dermatologic surgery patients prior to their operations with educational videos. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To create and evaluate a web based system to send wound care instructions to patients by text message after their operation. II. Qualitative comments from participants and research staff concerning the feasibility of this approach and the use of Fitbit activity trackers as a means to monitor movement restriction. III. The rate of adverse events. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups. GROUP I: Patients watch an educational video about Mohs surgery before their surgery, a video about wound care after the surgery and receive text messages about wound care on days 1-5 after the surgery. Patients also receive instructions to reduce movement and use a Fitbit activity tracker. Beginning 48 hours after surgery, patients are instructed to apply petroleum jelly twice daily (BID) to the wound area. GROUP II: Patients watch an educational video about Mohs surgery before their surgery, an educational video about wound care after the surgery and receive instructions to reduce movement and use a Fitbit activity tracker. Beginning 48 hours after surgery, patients apply petroleum jelly BID to the wound area. GROUP III: Patients receive text messages about wound care on days 1-5 after the surgery and receive instructions to reduce movement and use a Fitbit activity tracker. Beginning 48 hours after surgery, patients are also instructed to apply petroleum jelly BID to the wound are. GROUP IV: Patients receive no video or text messages. Patients receive instructions to reduce movement and use a Fitbit activity tracker. Beginning 48 hours after surgery, patients are also instructed to apply petroleum jelly BID to the wound area. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 week.</detailed_description>
