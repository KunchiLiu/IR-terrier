	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to compare patient outcomes following treatment of plantar fasciitis with conventional physical therapy (stretching, strengthening, ultrasound, manual therapy, and cryotherapy) and conventional physical therapy plus dry needling. Physical therapists commonly use conventional physical therapy techniques and dry needling to treat plantar fasciitis, and this study is attempting to find out if the addition of dry needling to conventional physical therapy is more effective than conventional physical therapy alone.</brief_summary>
