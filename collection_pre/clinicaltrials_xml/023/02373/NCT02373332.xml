	<brief_summary>This study investigates the potential protective effects of altering fatty acid in the platelet as a method for prevention of platelet activation and thrombosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) and their oxidized lipids will be evaluated for protection from agonist-mediated platelet activation in platelets from type 2 diabetics and healthy controls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>12-lipoxygenase and essential fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6 have been shown to play important roles in regulating platelet activation, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated as well as their true protection from thrombosis. 12-lipoxygenase inhibition prevents platelet activation in part by inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase oxidation of free fatty acids in the platelet. These oxidized fatty acids are known to play both a pro- and anti-thrombotic effect on platelets depending on the fatty acid. oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-lipoxygenase results in a pro-thrombotic bioactive lipid whereas oxidation of the omega-6 fatty acid DGLA found in plant oil results in formation of a potent anti-thrombotic bioactive lipid. Determining the extent of protection from this and other bioactive lipids produced through 12-lipoxygenase will allow for a better understanding of which fatty acid supplementation may best protect from thrombosis. Essential fatty acids such as omega-3 (DHA/EPA) and omega-6 (DGLA) appear to be protective. However the underlying mechanism for this potential protection is not well understood. Identifying the mechanism by which these supplements protect from platelet activation may identify new approaches to preventing thrombotic events in this high risk population.</detailed_description>
