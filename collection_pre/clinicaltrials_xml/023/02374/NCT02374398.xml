	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine if the use of iv TXA or Aquamantys system improve the postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit after primary TKA and what is the effect of the simultaneous use of iv TXA and Aquamantys on the postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit. The assumption is that the combination of iv TXA and Aquamantys system will enable an improvement in the postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit equal or larger than the improvement generated by the use of Aquamantys system alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Tranexamic Acid (TXA) With Aquamantys Sealer in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is randomized, placebo controlled. The study population includes patients older than 18 years of age undergoing elective total primary knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. All patients enrolled in the study will undergo TKA performed by the same orthopedic surgeon. Since controversies exist regarding the effect of different types of anesthesia (general anesthesia versus spinal or epidural anesthesia) on intraoperative blood loss, in order to eliminate an important confounding variable we decided to exclusively enroll for our study patients that qualify for and agree with spinal anesthesia to be used as the main anesthetic technique for their TKA. All clinical trial procedures will be performed by personnel blinded to study treatment assignment. Unblinding is only allowed for safety concerns in an emergency situation.The only other exception is represented by the surgeon, who can't be blinded in regards to using Aquamantys system and the bipolar sealer. Once a subject becomes eligible for the trial, the investigator or the designee will access the randomization system. Enrolled subjects will be assigned to one of the 4 groups by block randomization of alternating 4 and 8 and 12 patients per block. The Pharmacy Department will provide the iv placebo or the iv TXA according to the randomization process. This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance to this protocol, Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements</detailed_description>
