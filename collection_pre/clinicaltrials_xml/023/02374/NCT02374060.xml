	<brief_summary>To evaluate the relative efficacy of three commonly utilized regional corticosteroids for the regional treatment of uveitic macular edema: periocular triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal dexamethasone implant. The primary efficacy measure will be percent change in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT at 8 weeks. Participants will continue in the study for 24 weeks in order to evaluate relative effects of the 3 treatment strategies on the duration of treatment effects, requirement for additional injections, and adverse effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PeriOcular and INTravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macular edema is the most common structural complication and leading cause of visual loss in patients with uveitis. Regional injections of corticosteroids are the most frequently used treatments specifically for uveitic macular edema but there is a lack of high quality evidence to guide choice of drug (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone) and route of administration (e.g. periocular, intravitreal). The question of how to approach regional treatment of uveitic macular edema is a key question for ophthalmologists treating these patients. The Periocular and Intravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema (POINT) Trial is a randomized trial designed to compare the relative efficacy of three regional corticosteroids commonly utilized for the initial regional treatment of uveitic macular edema, periocular triamcinolone (Kenalog® , Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), intravitreal triamcinolone (Triesence™, Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Fort Worth, TX), and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®, Allergan, Irvine CA) will be conducted by the MUST Research Group clinical centers throughout the U.S. and one each in Australia and the UK. After signing informed consent and undergoing eligibility evaluation, eligible patients will be randomized to one of the three study treatments to be administered at the first study visit. Randomization is by participant, if both eyes meet eligibility requirements then both eyes receive assigned treatment. The design outcome is the percent change in central subfield macular thickness on OCT from baseline to the 8 week visit. After assessment of the primary outcome at 8 weeks, second injections and best medical judgment will be used if macular edema has not improved as follows: Eye(s) meeting trial eligibility criteria receive initial injection of assigned treatment at P01 visit. Second injection of assigned treatment permitted at 8 week visit for periocular triamcinolone and intravitreal triamcinolone and at 12 week visit for intravitreal dexamethasone if - Eye does not meet the improvement definition (a 20% decrease in central subfield thickness of the macula) or - Eye has a normal central subfield thickness but has cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central subfield or - ME is worse after initial improvement And the following repeat injection criterion are met: • IOP of ≤21 or mm Hg and treatment with ≤3 IOP-lowering agents; Eyes demonstrating no improvement or worsening of ME as measured by the central submacular thickness on OCT (at week 12 for periocular and intravitreal triamcinolone arms and at week 20 for intravitreal dexamethasone arm) are considered primary treatment non-responders.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eye level inclusion criteria at least one eye must meet all of the following conditions: Noninfectious anterior, intermediate, posterior or panuveitis; either active or inactive uveitis is acceptable; Macular edema (ME) defined as the presence of central subfield macular thickness greater than the normal range for the OCT machine being used, regardless of the presence of cysts, as assessed by study ophthalmologist; Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 5/200 or better; Baseline intraocular pressure &gt; 5 mm Hg and ≤ 21 mm Hg (current use of 3 or fewer intraocular pressurelowering medications and/or prior glaucoma surgery are acceptable); Baseline fluorescein angiogram that is gradable for leakage in the central subfield Pupillary dilation sufficient to allow OCT testing. Patient level exclusion criteria: History of infectious uveitis, or of scleritis, keratitis, or infectious endophthalmitis in either eye; History of central serous retinopathy in either eye; For women of childbearing potential: pregnancy, breastfeeding, or a positive pregnancy test; unwilling to practice an adequate birth control method (abstinence, combination barrier and spermicide, or hormonal) for duration of trial; Use of oral acetazolamide or other systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor at baseline; Oral prednisone dose &gt; 10 mg per day (or of an alternative corticosteroid at a dose higher than that equipotent to prednisone 10 mg per day) OR oral prednisone dose ≤ 10 mg per day that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks(note that if patient is off of oral prednisone at baseline (P01 visit), dose stability requirement for past 4 weeks does not apply); Systemic immunosuppressive drug therapy that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks; Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs; Eye level exclusion criteria at least one eye that meets all inclusion criteria cannot have any of the following conditions: History of severe glaucoma as defined by optic nerve damage (cup/disc ratio of ≥ 0.9 or any notching of optic nerve to the rim); Media opacity causing inability to assess fundus or perform OCT; Presence of an epiretinal membrane noted clinically or by OCT that per the judgment of study ophthalmologist may be significant enough to limit improvement of ME (i.e., causing substantial wrinkling of the retinal surface)81; Torn or ruptured posterior lens capsule; Presence of silicone oil; Periocular or intravitreal corticosteroid injection in past 8 weeks; Injection of dexamethasone intravitreal implant in past 12 weeks; Placement of fluocinolone acetonide implant (Retisert) in past 3 years;</criteria>
