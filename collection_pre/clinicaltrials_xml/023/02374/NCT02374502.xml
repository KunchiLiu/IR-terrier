	<brief_summary>Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that mostly affects the spine. This results in back pain and stiffness, and causes difficulty with daily activities. Physical activity and exercise are key components of the management of ankylosing spondylitis, however many adults with ankylosing spondylitis do not meet physical activity recommendations. This study aims to investigate the effects of a twelve week intervention designed to increase physical activity and exercise in adults with ankylosing spondylitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increasing Physical Activity in Ankylosing Spondylitis: a Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. An intervention group will receive individual consultations with a physiotherapist. The aim of the meetings will be to motivate and support participants on an individual basis, with the goal of increasing weekly physical activity. The second group, the control group, will continue with their current management strategies. All participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (after twelve weeks) and after a three month follow-up period. The primary outcome measure will be free-living physical activity over one week.</detailed_description>
