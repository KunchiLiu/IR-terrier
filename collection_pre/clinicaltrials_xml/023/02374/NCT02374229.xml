	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition, the severity of which is often underestimated. About 10% of significant mitral heart disease complicated by high pulmonary hypertension (more than 60 mm Hg). Up to 70% of patients retain this level of pulmonary hypertension after successful treatment of heart valve disease.The quality of life of patients with persistent high pulmonary hypertension is significantly lower than in patients with mild to moderate degree. Risks of recurrent tricuspid insufficiency and right ventricular dysfunction is much higher. Despite the use of modern drug therapy of pulmonary hypertension in patients with valvular heart disease satisfactory clinical effect is achieved only in a small number of patients. Our team proposed a new original method of ablation of the pulmonary artery with simultaneous open cardiac surgery correction of mitral heart disease in patients with high baseline pulmonary hypertension.</detailed_description>
