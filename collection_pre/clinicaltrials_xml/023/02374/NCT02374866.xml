	<brief_summary>The literature data show that long-term monitoring has an effect on weight loss, comorbidity and on improving the quality of life. However, there are still no studies on monitoring obese patients after taking initial multidisciplinary approach. The recommendations of the HAS 2011 advocated "continuous monitoring needed to prevent weight regain, monitor the consequences of overweight and treat comorbidities. This requires a long-term support. "The frequency of follow-up consultations is not specified and "must be adapted to achieve a weight loss target and maintain." Having no specific recommendations on the frequency of monitoring, the investigators chose to experiment closer monitoring than our current monitoring to assess what is the best frequency monitoring, in terms of: weight loss, quality of life, feeding behavior, changes in physical abilities, evolution of comorbidities associated with obesity. The recommendations of the HAS 2011 advocate support of a multidisciplinary obesity for weight loss of 5% to 10 %, which, if maintained, can reduce comorbidities associated with obesity (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, pain associated with osteoarthritis).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2 groups of randomized patients will be followed: - The control group will follow the current center: every four months for a year, combined with monitoring by email or regular mail during the year. - The experimental group will be a follow-up every two months for one year HDJ more of the same followed by email or postal mail. Follow by email or mail is identical to the control group, as well as HDJ 12 months.</detailed_description>
