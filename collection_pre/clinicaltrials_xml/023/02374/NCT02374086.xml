	<brief_summary>Angina in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in women, and leads to increased risk for major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. Annual mortality rates are ten-fold higher than mortality from breast cancer, and the lifetime cost of health care for women with non-obstructive chest pain is close to $1 million. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is a major etiological feature of this disease, and may contribute to disease progression. Despite our general understanding, effective treatment remains elusive. This pilot study will test whether regular exercise training can improve/reverse coronary microvascular dysfunction in women with angina but no obstructive coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits of Exercise Training in Women With Ischemic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will study 10 women with signs and symptoms of ischemia but no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Procedures: Aerobic fitness: Incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a exercise bike to assess the maximal rate of oxygen consumption. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: To assess cardiac morphology and function. Cardiac perfusion imaging: Using MRI, we will assess the rate of uptake of a contrast media (gadolinium) at rest and in response to a vasodilating substance (adenosine) to evaluate myocardial perfusion reserve. Protocol: Participants will undergo aerobic fitness testing, cardiac MRI and perfusion imaging at baseline and following 8-weeks of regular exercise training.</detailed_description>
