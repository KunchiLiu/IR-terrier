	<brief_summary>Globally, there is increasing focus on optimization of health system quality. International austerity, concerns regarding health care safety and effectiveness, and underlying aspirations to continually improve patient experience and outcomes are among the factors driving interest in measuring, rewarding, and optimizing quality of care. Care for cardiovascular diseases is of particular importance as a leading cause of premature death in the UK and across the world. With this as a backdrop, recent studies reveal the persistence of significant variations in risk‐adjusted health outcomes across English AMI populations, suggesting widespread application of ineffective care. In spite of this evidence, little is known on the extent to which modifiable, care‐related factors explain observed variations in risk‐adjusted AMI mortality rates. Set in this context, a recent conceptual model - emphasizing the influence of in‐hospital care on health outcomes - offers a new opportunity to 1) re‐examine the quality of acute treatment for AMI, and 2) reveal the extent to which care delivery influences and explains variations in mortality following acute admission. This study seeks to use data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) within a retrospective, observational paradigm to examine the relationship between primary care, pre‐hospital patient status, acute clinical management and patient outcomes. Findings are expected to give a new perspective to quality of integrated AMI care in England.</brief_summary>
