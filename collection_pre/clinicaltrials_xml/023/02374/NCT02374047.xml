	<brief_summary>This is a 2-part, Phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, single and multiple ascending dose study. CAT-2054 will be administered either as an uncoated capsule (CAT-2054) or a coated capsule (CAT-2054-C). In Part A, CAT-2054 or placebo is administered as a single dose in a fasting state at 4 dose levels; at 3 dose levels, subjects will return for a second dose of the study drug after a high-fat meal. Additionally, at 1 dose level, CAT-2054-C or placebo will be administered as a single dose in a fasting state, and subjects will return for a second dose of the study drug after a high-fat meal. In Part B, CAT-2054 will be administered as multiple ascending doses at 4 dose levels for 14 consecutive days. In selected cohorts, CAT-2054, CAT-2054-C or CAT-2054 with atorvastatin will be dosed to assess safety in anticipation of future clinical trials.</brief_summary>
