	<brief_title>Topical Use of Vancomycin in Reducing Sternal Wound Infection in Cardiac Surgery (SWI Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During open-heart surgery, an incision is made along the chest and the sternum (breastbone) is divided. The sternum is held open throughout the surgery so that the doctors can reach the heart. Sternal wound infection is an uncommon but serious complication of cardiac surgery that occurs when an infection develops at this site of entry. Sternal wound infections are associated with increased hospital stays, subsequent surgical procedures, and higher mortality rates. The purpose of this research is to determine if using the antibiotic vancomycin as a preventative topical (on the surface of the skin) treatment during open-heart surgery will reduce the risk of developing a sternal wound infection. The results of this study could provide important information to guide new standards of practice in cardiac surgery. The ultimate goal of this research project is to improve patient care by reducing the number of sternal wound infections at our hospital.</detailed_description>
