	<brief_summary>This study investigated the impact of Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy on the adenoma detection rate at colonoscopy. This study involved patients undergoing elective screening or surveillance colonoscopy. Patients were randomized to undergo Endocuff or regular, high-definition colonoscopy before undergoing a second colonoscopy by the alternate method. The primary outcome measure was the detection rate for adenomas between patients who underwent Endocuff first and patients who underwent regular colonoscopy first.</brief_summary>
