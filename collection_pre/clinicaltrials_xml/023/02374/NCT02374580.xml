	<brief_summary>For more than a decade, Uganda's Ministry of Health has led a community health worker program model in which Village Health Teams (VHTs), cadres of unpaid volunteers, are assigned the task of delivering preventative health services and education to their local communities. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Uganda's VHTs in improving certain health outcomes; however it is known that VHTs are not optimally supported, and there has been VHT attrition in recent years. The Ministry of Health has recognized the inadequate support of VHTs thus far and is aiming to "expand VHTs to all local governments and explore ways of sustaining VHTs." The objective of this study is to evaluate the extent to which material support is a deciding factor in the efficiency and durability of Uganda's VHT initiative. Material support may take the form of monetary stipends, regular payment, transportation assistance, or nonfinancial materials such as bicycles or mobile phone airtime. This study will review existing literature and gather novel data through surveys of VHT members and VHT stakeholders. The quantitative and qualitative survey data will be analyzed for trends that may point to a conclusion in the context of existing health policy discourse on community health worker remuneration. The purpose of this study is to strengthen the knowledge base on whether or not the current absence of material support significantly limits the potential for Uganda's VHTs to be sustained and expanded. This information can be used by governmental and non-governmental organizations in their work to strengthen and sustain VHTs throughout the country.</brief_summary>
