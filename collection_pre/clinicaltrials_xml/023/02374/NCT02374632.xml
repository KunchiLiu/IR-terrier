	<brief_summary>After gastric bypass, 10-20% of patients will obtain a suboptimal weight loss, often defined as &lt;50% of the excess body weight. Exaggerated meal related secretion of gut hormones seem important for appetite reduction and subsequent weight loss after gastric bypass, however it is not clear whether different gut hormone responses are responsible for different postoperative weight loss responses. The purpose of the study is to investigate gut hormone secretion, vagal integrity and the effect of octreotide on ad libitum food intake in patients with suboptimal weight loss after gastric bypass and compare results to a matched group of gastric bypass operated patients with high postoperative weight loss but similar age, sex and preoperative BMI.</brief_summary>
