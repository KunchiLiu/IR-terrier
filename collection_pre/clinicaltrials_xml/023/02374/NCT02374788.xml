	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of two levels of primary care physical activity interventions on metabolic control and cardiovascular risk factors, compared to usual care in patients with pre- and type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that both levels of interventions have effect on HbA1c with the more intense Group intervention having superior effects.</brief_summary>
