	<brief_summary>The PREACT Registry aims to see whether data from Pharmacogenomic Testing (PGx) can help healthcare providers manage patient medication regimens and assess if the testing has an effect on reducing medication side effects, hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The way an individual processes a drug is in part determined by their genes, and there is known to be genetic variation between humans in the way drugs are metabolized. The study of the way genes affect a person's response to drugs is known as "Pharmacogenomics."</brief_summary>
