	<criteria>2 to 12 weeks after first ever stroke according to the World Health Organisation criteria (previous transient ischaemic attack or clinically silent infarct on computerised tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not counted as previous stroke) Stroke confirmed by CT/MRI scan and classified as ischaemic/haemorrhagic stroke Presence of spasticity, either symptomatic, based on symptomatic spasticity criteria (i.e. at least one of the following items: impacted passive/active function, involuntary movements and pain ≥4 on a numeric pain rating scale [NPRS]) or not symptomatic in the relevant upper limb Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) diseases, or any other neurological disorders (including prior local joint, tendon, and intrinsic muscle disorders) that could potentially interfere with assessment of spasticity in the primary targeted muscle group selected by the Investigator and in agreement with the subject Currently receiving drugs affecting NMJ transmission e.g. aminoglycosides, aminoquinolines, cyclosporine, D penicillamine Previous surgery of the affected muscles/ ligaments/tendons Severe comorbidities (e.g. congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, multiple organ failure, hepatic renal failures, severe infections)</criteria>
