	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an innovative preventive strategy, consisting of early salpingectomy upon completion of childbearing with delayed oophorectomy beyond current guideline age, improves menopause-related quality of life without significantly increasing ovarian cancer incidence in comparison to current standard salpingo-oophorectomy in female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.</brief_summary>
