	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of the RehaARM-robot and to determine the feasibility of including robotic therapy in daily rehabilitation programmes, after stroke. Additionally, we aim to investigate the acceptance of this intervention from patients and therapists. A total of 10 patients will be recruited in this study, all the patients will receive 1 hour of standard therapy together with 45 min of robot therapy every day. The robot therapy will last 45 minutes, for 15 consecutive days within a maximum period of four weeks. Additional 15 minutes are required for placing surface electrodes on the shoulder and patient preparation. The study will include passive and active shoulder training of four movements: Horizontal abduction/adduction, abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation and flexion/extension. The passive part lasts 10 minutes and the active part 35 minutes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients suffering from stroke, ischemic and / or hemorrhagic Stroke in the left hemisphere Score between 1 and 3 in the upperlimb subitem of the Italian version of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (ITNIHSS) (Pezzella et al. 2009) Score of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale (Keith et al., 1987) less than 100 out of a total of 126. This scale is used as a reference to indicate the degree of autonomy in carrying out activities of daily living (ADLs) Score of the upperlimb FuglMeyer scale (FMA) (FuglMeyer et al., 1975) less than 60. This scale measures the residual motor function of a person after stroke Nonstabilized fractures Diagnosis of depression Traumatic brain Injury Pharmacologically uncontrolled epilepsy Ideomotor apraxia Neglect Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &lt;20/30 Severe impairment of verbal comprehension, defined by a score in the Token Test (Tau points&lt;58/78) Patients participating in other rehabilitation treatments for the upperlimb (e.g. virtual reality treatment, motor imagery, etc)</criteria>
