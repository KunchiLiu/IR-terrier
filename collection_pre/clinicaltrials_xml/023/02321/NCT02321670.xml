	<brief_summary>A multicentre, prospective, randomized study comparing bulbar urethroplasty with excision and primary anastomosis or with an onlay grafting procedure using buccal mucosa.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scandinavian Urethroplasty Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, randomized study to compare two common techniques of urethroplasty used to treat bulbar urethral strictures. One technique is excision of the stricture and end-to-end anastomosis of the urethra. The other technique is an onlay grafting procedure with buccal mucosa where the corpus spongiosum is not divided. The study is designed to compare complications of sexual and penile function, and is not powered to compare the success rates of the two techniques. The primary endpoint will be degree of erectile dysfunction and penile complications. The secondary endpoint will be restricturing leading to reoperation, and other complications.</detailed_description>
