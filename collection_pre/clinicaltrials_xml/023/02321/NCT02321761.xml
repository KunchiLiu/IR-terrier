	<brief_summary>Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the drugs given at rehabilitation programs to people who suffered Acquired Brain Injury in order to expedite recovery and improve functioning. A previous study examined the spatially asymmetric allocation of attention in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients demonstrated significantly worse performance with leftward than with rightward cross-hemi field shifts of attention. This is reminiscence of neglect patients. This difference was significantly reduced during and following treatment. Our objective is to investigate whether Amantadine Hydrochloride is effective in improving allocation of spatial attention and improving function in people with Traumatic Brain Injury.</brief_summary>
