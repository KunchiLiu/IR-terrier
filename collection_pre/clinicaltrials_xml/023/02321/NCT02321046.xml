	<brief_title>An epidemiOlogy Study to deteRmine the Prevalence of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) muTations in RUSsian Patients With Advanced NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective study to be carried out in representative oncology departments / institutions in order to determine the prevalence of EGFR mutations in treatment-naive Russian patients with cytologically verified advanced NSCLC in Russia. No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice. It is planned to enrol approximately 300 subjects in Russian Federation. Approximately 60 EGFR m+ (mutation-positive) patients will be followed for 1.5 years. EGFR mutations rate before treatment in cytology and plasma samples in treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC in Russia is considered as the primary outcome variable in this study.</detailed_description>
