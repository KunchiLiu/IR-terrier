Male subjects, with reproductive potential, who are sexually active must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study. 5. Opioidtolerant. 6. Subjects must have established a favorable response to opioid therapy in reducing pain. 7. Subjects must require a minimum dose of 4 mg (1 JURNISTA tablet) and a maximum dose of 16 mg (1 EXALGO tablet) after determining 66% of the converted dose of hydromorphone HCl per day from an established conversion table. 8.

History of renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory conditions that would contraindicate participation in this study. 6. Plan to undergo a surgical procedure within 3 days of Day 1 and for the duration of subject participation in the study. Subjects undergoing minor surgical procedures (eg, central line insertion, biopsies) will be eligible for participation in the study. 7. Exhibit hemodynamic instability. 8. Have dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing whole tablets. 9. Narrowing of the digestive tract, Short gut syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, Meckel's diverticulum, or past GI surgery. 10.
