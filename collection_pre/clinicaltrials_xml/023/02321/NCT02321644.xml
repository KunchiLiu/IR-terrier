	<brief_summary>This is a two-part, phase 1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of CC-90001 and the effects of food and formulation on the pharmacokinetics of single dose CC-90001 in healthy subjects. Part 1 involves the exposure of subjects to the minimum amount of UV-B light that causes minimally perceptible skin reddening. This will take place before dosing (baseline) and 3 times more while on increasing doses of CC-90001. Punch biopsies of the exposed areas will be taken and assessed for c-Jun terminal kinase activity. Part 2 involves evaluation of changes in pharmacokinetics of 2 formulations of CC-90001 when administered in the fasted state and after a high-fat meal.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of UV Exposure on the PD of Multiple Doses of CC-90001 and Pilot Food Effect Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 is an open-label, multiple-dose, 3-period, fixed-sequence study, to evaluate the effect of CC-90001 on JNK activity following UV irradiation. On the first day prior to dosing (baseline), and on the 6th day of each dosing period (Days 6, 12, and 18), twice the MED intensity of UV light will be administered to delineated sites on the subjects' buttocks. The irradiation at baseline (Day -1) should be administered at approximately the same time that irradiation is scheduled on Days 6, 12, and 18, which is at 2 hours post dose. Eight hours after UV irradiation, a skin punch biopsy will be taken from the UV exposure site. The end of confinement will be Day 19. The follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days (ie, Day 25 to Day 28) following the last dose in Period 3. An early termination (ET) visit will occur within 10 days of the day of discontinuation. The MED will be determined within 10 days of dosing in Period 1. All subjects will receive the following doses of CC-90001 in the fixed sequence below: Treatment A: 60 mg CC-90001 as AIC, QD x 6 days; Treatment B: 160 mg CC-90001 as AIC, QD x 6 days; and Treatment C: 400 mg of CC-90001 as AIC, QD x 6 days. Subjects will be confined at the unit from Day -1 until discharge on Day 19 after all safety assessments. In Part 2 subjects will be assigned randomly to one of three dosing sequences during which they will receive one of the following dosing regimens: - Treatment D: 2 x 100 mg CC-90001 as AIC, single oral dose administered under fasted conditions. - Treatment E: 1 x 200 mg CC-90001 [formulated tablet(s)] single oral dose administered under fasted conditions - Treatment F: 1 x 200 mg CC-90001 [formulated tablet(s)] single oral dose administered under fed conditions (standard high fat breakfast).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Must understand and voluntarily sign a written Informed Consent Document (ICD) prior to any studyrelated assessments/procedures being performed 2. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator and to understand and adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 3. Must be a male or female*, aged 18 years of age to 65 years of age (inclusive) at the time of signing the ICD * Women of childbearing potential (WCBP)*must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and at the end of the study. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact 1. The female subjects must either commit to true abstinence** from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with, 2 highly effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting study drug, during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of study drug 2. Females not of childbearing potential should have been either surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to screening (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation) or be postmenopausal (defined as 24 months with no menses prior to Screening, AND with a plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 IU/L at screening). Documentation will be required in cases of tubal ligation 4. Males must practice true abstinence** or agree to use a condom (a latex condom is recommended) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a WCBP while on study drug, or while participating in this study, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy ** True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception] 5. Has a body mass index (BMI = weight [kg]/(height [m2]) between 18 and 33 kg/m2 (inclusive) 6. Must be healthy as determined by the Investigator on the basis of medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12lead ECGs Must be afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38 °C or 100.3° Fahrenheit) Systolic blood pressure must be in the range of 80 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure must be in the range of 40 to 90 mmHg, and pulse rate must be in the range of 40 to 110 bpm QTcF value ≤ 430 msec for male subjects and ≤ 450 msec for female subjects.
