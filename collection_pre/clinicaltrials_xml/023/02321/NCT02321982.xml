	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether separate- versus same-day preoperative consultation affects time to treatment (start to finish), utilization rate of Mohs, rate of case cancellations, cost, and patient satisfaction. The investigators hypothesize that patients with same-day preoperative consultation will have a shorter time between cancer diagnosis and removal but, only when coordination of care is needed, longer time between removal and consultation with other specialists, as compared to patients with separate-day consultation. The investigators anticipate that patients with same-day preoperative consultation will have a decrease in travel cost as compared to patients with separate-day consultation. The investigators expect that there will be no difference in various satisfaction matters between groups, with the exception of potentially greater convenience reported by patients in the same-day preoperative consultation group. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference between groups in regards to rates of surgery cancellation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedure: Prospective trial which randomly assigns patients to either separate- or same-day preoperative consultation for Mohs surgery. A phone consultation will take place, which will assist in determining whether the patient is appropriate for enrollment into the study. If so, the patient will be randomized to either separate-day or same-day preoperative consultation. Materials: Patient survey Methods of data collection: The patient-specific data obtained from the medical record will include: Patient age, number of previous skin cancers, preoperative size, history of cutaneous surgery, employment status, and distance between home address and dermatology facility. Outcome measures that will be obtained from the medical record will include: Time between cancer diagnosis, removal and defect repair, rate of proceeding with Mohs as opposed to other treatment options, and rate of cancelling surgery (due to site discrepancy, anticoagulation issues). A survey will be used to assess patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
