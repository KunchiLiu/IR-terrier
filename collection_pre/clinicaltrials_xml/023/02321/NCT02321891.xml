	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Determine a Candidate Protocol for Transcranial Electrical Stimulation in the Treatment of Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators examine the efficacy of two different transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) stimulation protocols in the treatment of anxiety in an open-label pilot study in patients with chronic pain. The investigators also seek to detect autonomic nervous system changes induced by the tDCS, and develop new methods for the measurement of autonomic nervous system functions.</detailed_description>
