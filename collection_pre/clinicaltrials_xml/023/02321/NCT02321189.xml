	<brief_title>The Effect of Resveratrol Based Nutritional Supplement on Choroidal Thickness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>34 young, healthy participants were included in this study; They were randomly divided into two groups by age and gender matched.100 mg Longevinex® capsule was given to the study group and 100mg placebo capsule to the control group. All participants underwent OCT scanning with spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at baseline and 1 h following Longevinex® or placebo administration. The choroidal thickness was measured manually by the Heidelberg Eye explore software(version 5.3.3.0, Heidelberg Engineering) with a vertical line to the retinal pigment epithelial layer.</detailed_description>
