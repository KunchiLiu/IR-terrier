	<detailed_description>HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN IPCRR Step One. Complete the IPCRR forms which are now available online. The Consent Form protects the patient's privacy. The Questionnaire gathers important details that distinguish PC from other conditions and helps to identify specific characteristics of each type of PC. Step Two. Take photos as shown in the Questionnaire sample photo page. You can upload the images online with the Questionnaire. If you prefer, you may email the photos. You may stop and start as often as needed before completing the forms. Since the physicians will not meet you in person, the photos of your PC are very important. Step Three. When the Consent Form, Questionnaire and Photos are received by PC Project, a telephone consultation will be scheduled with one of the PC physicians. The physician will review the photos and questionnaire responses, and will discuss any questions. There is no cost to patient/family for this consultation. Step Four. If genetic testing is requested, the physician will discuss it on the call and will make the referral for free testing. The patient will then be sent the special saliva test kit (no travel required). Usually only saliva is needed and from only one affected family member. The sample is collected by spitting into the vial in the kit and mailing it in the envelope provided. Genetic testing is complex and time-consuming. It is not like a sugar test or pregnancy test and can take many months to be completed, but the testing begins as soon as the sample arrives. In some cases, a second test must be completed before the testing results are finalized and a report can be sent. If the second test is needed, the family will be advised and a simple mouth swab kit will be sent for the testing. This requires simply swabbing the inside of the cheek with a soft brush from the kit and mailing to the laboratory. When the results are finalized, a full genetic testing report is provided to the patient with precise information and suggestions specific to their condition. Patients may find the report very valuable with physicians or other medical providers as well as for school personnel, employers, disability hearings or other special needs. All information is held confidential by PC Project and the research reported anonymously. There is no cost to the patient/family for any of these tests or for the consultation.</detailed_description>
