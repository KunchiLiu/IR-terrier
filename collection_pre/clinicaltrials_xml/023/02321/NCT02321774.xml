	<brief_title>Validation of a Wearable Sensor for Stress Response in a Virtual Reality Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wearable sensor technology is being developed that may allow, for the first time, the ability for individuals to better recognized their level of stress in any given situation on a continuous basis. A major focus of many of these wearable sensors is being able to accurately analyze and track heart rate variability (HRV), which is indicative of primarily parasympathetic/vagal tone and emotional state.3 However there is a need to validate the reliability of this measured response and understand any inter-individual variability. The present study will take advantage of virtual reality scenarios to expose healthy volunteers to controlled stressful situations during monitoring with several standardized lab-based non-invasive physiological sensors as well as a novel wrist band sensor device to track individual response to stress.</detailed_description>
