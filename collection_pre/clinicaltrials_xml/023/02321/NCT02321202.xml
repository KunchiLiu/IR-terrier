	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acid-Based Parenteral Nutrition Improves Postoperative Recovery for Cirrhotic Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new lipid emulsion enriched ω-3 fatty acid was manufactured, and was reported avoid hyperinflammatory situations in patients followed major surgery. However, the role of ω-3 fatty acid-based parenteral nutrition for postoperative patients with cirrhosis-related liver cancer is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ω-3 fatty acid-based parenteral nutrition for cirrhotic patients with liver cancer followed hepatectomy. A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted for cirrhotic patients with liver cancer underwent hepatectomy between March 2010 and September 2013 in the investigators institution. For postoperative parenteral nutrition, 20% Structolipid and 10% Omegaven were applied to the trial group, while only Structolipid to the control group for 5 consecutive days postoperatively.</detailed_description>
