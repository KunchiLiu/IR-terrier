	<brief_title>A Study of Efficacy/Safety of Intravenous S-649266 Versus Imipenem/Cilastatin in Complicated Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous S 649266 versus intravenous imipenem/cilastatin in hospitalized adults with complicated urinary tract infections with or without pyelonephritis or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis caused by Gram-negative pathogens.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hospitalized male and female patients ≥ 18 years Clinical diagnosis of either complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) with or without pyelonephritis or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis cUTI diagnosed with a history of ≥ 1 of the following: indwelling urinary catheter or recent instrumentation of the urinary tract, Urinary retention (caused by benign prostatic hypertrophy), urinary retention of at least 100 mL or more of residual urine after voiding (neurogenic bladder), obstructive uropathy, and azotemia caused by intrinsic renal disease (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values greater than normal laboratory values) At least 2 of the following signs or symptoms: chills or rigors or warmth associated with fever (temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees Celsius), flank pain (pyelonephritis) or suprapubic/pelvic pain (cUTI), nausea or vomiting, dysuria, urinary frequency, or urinary urgency, and costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination Urinalysis evidence of pyuria demonstrated by dipstick analysis positive for leukocyte esterase or ≥10 white blood cells (WBCs) per μL in unspun urine, or ≥ 10 WBCs per high power field in spun urine Positive urine culture within 48 hours prior to randomization containing ≥10^5 colony forming unit (CFU)/mL of a Gramnegative uropathogen likely to be susceptible to imipenem (IPM) Patients who were treated with an effective antibiotic for no more than 24 hours during the previous 72 hours Patients who failed treatment, both clinically and microbiologically, and have an identified uropathogen which is nonsusceptible to the empiric treatment and is a Gramnegative uropathogen likely to be susceptible to IPM Subjects receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for UTI who present with signs and symptoms consistent with an active new UTI Urine culture identifies only a Grampositive pathogen and/or a Gramnegative uropathogen resistant to IPM Urine culture at study entry isolates more than 2 uropathogens or patient has a confirmed fungal UTI Asymptomatic bacteriuria, the presence of &gt;10^5 CFU/mL of a uropathogen and pyuria but without local or systemic symptoms Patient is receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis</criteria>
