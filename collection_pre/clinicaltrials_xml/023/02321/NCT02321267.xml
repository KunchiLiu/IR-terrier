	<brief_summary>Macular diseases often cases severe visual impairment. Recent clinical introduction of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents may change the clinical course of various macular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), and so forth. The advance in vitrectomy improve visual outcomes in some maculae diseases, including epiretinal membrane (ERM), macular hole (MH), vitreomacular traction syndrome (VMTS). Patients with such macular diseases are registered and are followed up for 5 years with appropriate treatment for each patient. By the analysis of the correlation between initial examinations and final visual acuity, factors associated with good visual prognosis will be elucidated.</brief_summary>
