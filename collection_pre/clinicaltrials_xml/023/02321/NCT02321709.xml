	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the tolerability and safety of SAR113244 in male and female lupus patients after every 4 (Q4) weeks repeated ascending subcutaneous doses of SAR113244. Secondary Objectives: To assess in male and female lupus patients: - The pharmacokinetics of SAR113244. - The pharmacodynamics of SAR113244 for the following disease-related parameters: - Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score, British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) score (if applicable), BILAG-Based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) (if applicable), systemic lupus erythematosus responder index (SRI) (if applicable), Lupus-quality of life (QoL) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue, anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (anti-dsDNA Ab) and anti-nuclear antibody levels (ANA) and plasma complement levels (C3, C4), erythrocyte sedimentation (SED) rate and C-reactive protein. - Peripheral blood B and T cells subsets.</brief_summary>
