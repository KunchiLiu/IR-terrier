	<brief_title>Evaluation of a New Coating in Cement Less Femoral Stems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients eligible for total hip replacement will be randomized in to two groups, receiving either femoral stems with plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coating or stems with electrochemically deposited hydroxyapatite. This patients will be followed for at least 5 years. The outcome is evaluated by comparing stability measured by RSA and periprosthetic bone remodeling measured by bone densitometry.</detailed_description>
