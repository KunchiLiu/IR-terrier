	<brief_title>A Open-label Prospective Cohort Trial of Curcumin Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) for EGFR -Mutant Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1 open prospective cohort study to assess the safety and feasibility of using curcumin in conjunction with an EGFR-TKI in patients with advanced NSCLC. The investigators will use an enhanced bioavailable formulation of curcumin (CURCUViva TM at 80 mg/ 1 capsule per day) approved and licensed by Health Canada (NPN 80027414) that has been shown to have 2-3 times higher curcumin concentration in the blood as compared to previous clinical trials. As primary objective, the investigators will recruit 20 patients for a duration of 8 weeks to monitor adverse effects according to the the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria.Exploratory objectives would include assessing changes in health-related quality of life using the standardized FACT-L questionnaire and evaluating anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin by measuring CRP. If tolerable safety data is obtained, an expanded phase II trial will be designed.</detailed_description>
