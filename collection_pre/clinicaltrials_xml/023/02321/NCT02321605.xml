	<brief_title>Efficacy of Best Possible Self Intervention Over Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the last fifteen years, research in the field of positive psychology has increased exponentially (Bolier, Haverman, Westerhof, Riper, Smit &amp; Bohlmeijer, 2013; Sin &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2009). These studies have shown that positive moods and positive emotions lead people to think, feel, and act in favor of their approach goals, promoting their involvement in them (Lyubomirsky, 2001). One of the main arms of this framework, is the development of exercises and treatment protocols aimed to promote the appearance of different positive emotions and states, called Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs). In this sense, Best Possible Self (BPS) has been included as a PPI, since is aimed to enhance wellbeing. Specifically, BPS is a positive future thinking technique, which requires people to envision themselves in the future, after everything has gone as good as it possibly could. This exercise has shown efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control condition, in general population (Meevissen, Peters &amp; Alberts, 2011; Sheldon &amp;Lyubomirsky, 2012; Peters, Flink, Boersma &amp; Linton, 2010). Furthermore, the progress of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), has allowed the development of technology applications and devices that could enhance the quality of experience and the wellbeing levels. This approach is called Positive Technology (PT) and it can be used as a complement to PPIs. PT can be defined as the scientific and applied approach to improve the quality of our personal experience trying to increase wellness and generate strengths (Riva, Ba√±os, Botella, Wiederhold &amp; Gaggioli, 2012). Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate the findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in young general population. The exercise will be applied through a Positive Technology system and the effects will be analyzed during four months. The design employed in this study is similar to the used in other studies (Meevissen et al, 2011; Renner, Schwarz, Peters &amp; Huibers, 2014; Sheldon &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2006).</detailed_description>
