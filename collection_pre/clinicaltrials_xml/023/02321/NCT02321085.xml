	<brief_summary>Prospective randomized (rhythm control or rate control in heart failure patients with new onset atrial fibrillation) Objective of study 1. To analyze long term outcome of patients with heart failure with new onset atrial fibrillation according to the rhythm control 2. To analyze remodeling of atrium and ventricle by the new onset AF in heart failure patients 3. To analyze the change of LV function and functional capacity according to the rhythm in patients with HF and new onset AF</brief_summary>
