	<brief_summary>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) therapy is a promising treatment for several degenerative diseases, including retinopathies and glaucoma, however no previous safety study involving humans has been conducted. The objective of this study is to evaluate effects of autologous bone marrow-derived MSC transplantation in the worst eye of 10 patients with legal bilateral blindness due to glaucoma. Primary outcome are types and severity of adverse effects. Secondary outcomes are changes in visual field, visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, and retinal ganglion cells function.</brief_summary>
