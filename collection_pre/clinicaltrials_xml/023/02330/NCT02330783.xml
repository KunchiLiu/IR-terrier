	<brief_summary>There is no standard treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma that was previously treated with VEGF targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors.So investigators conducted a randomized, open-label, multi-center phase II study to compare bevacizumab plus sorafenib versus sorafenib for the third-line treatment of patients with Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab Plus Sorafenib for the Third-line Treatment in Metastatic Renal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapies targeting VEGF and mTOR signalling pathways represent standard first-line and second-line treatment options for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. There is no standard treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma that was previously treated with VEGF targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors.To the best of the investigators knowledge, GOLD study is the first phase 3 trial in the third-line setting after both VEGF-inhibitor and mTOR-inhibitor drugs.From this study,Sorafenib may be option for the third-line treatment.The Best trial demonstrated that Bevacizumab/sorafenib had best efficacy in advance renal cancer canrcinoma and the VEGF/VEGFR co-inhibition strategy may warrant further investigation possibly with more selective VEGFR inhibitors.So investigators conducted a randomized, open-label, multi-center phase II study to compare bevacizumab plus sorafenib versus sorafenib for the third-line treatment of patients with Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.</detailed_description>
