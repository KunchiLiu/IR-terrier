	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate a new combination of drugs, marizomib (MRZ) and bevacizumab (BEV; Avastin®), for the treatment of WHO Grade IV malignant glioma. The study population includes subjects who are in first or second relapse and who have not previously received any bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenic agent or proteasome inhibitor for treatment of malignant glioma. Phase 1 evaluates the combination of MRZ and BEV, while Phase 2 evaluates single-agent MRZ.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One of the few treatment options currently FDA approved for recurrent WHO Grade IV malignant glioma is BEV. Additional treatment options are needed for these subjects. Published literature indicates that targeting the proteasome in glioma cells has shown significant anti-tumor activity. MRZ is a novel, second generation proteasome inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of proteins involved in signal transduction which blocks growth and survival of cancer cells. In-vitro studies of multiple glioma cell lines were highly sensitive to MRZ. MRZ had relatively little effect on neural stem/progenitor cells suggesting minimal neurotoxicity while significantly affecting both malignant glioma stem cells and glioma cell lines. Phase 1 of this trial has been completed with the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) established at 0.8 mg/m2. Phase 2 of this trial is enrolling at the MRZ RP2D determined in Phase 1 to assess single-agent activity and safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Understand and voluntarily sign and date an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures are conducted. 2. Males and females at least 18 years of age at the time of signing of the informed consent document. 3. All subjects must have histologic evidence of G4 MG (including glioblastoma and gliosarcoma) and radiographic evidence of recurrence or disease progression (defined as either a greater than 25% increase in the largest bidimensional product of enhancement, a new enhancing lesion, or significant increase in T2 FLAIR). 4. Subjects must have previously completed standard radiation therapy and been exposed to temozolomide. Patients must be in first or second relapse. 5. Subjects with archival tumor tissue suitable for proteasome activity and genetic testing must give permission to access and test the tissue; subjects without archival tumor tissue are eligible. 6. No prior treatment with MRZ or any other proteasome inhibitors or any other antiangiogenic agents. 7. No investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. 8. At least 4 weeks from surgical resection and 12 weeks from end of radiotherapy prior to enrollment in this study, unless relapse is confirmed by tumor biopsy or new lesion outside of radiation field, or if there are two MRIs confirming progressive disease that are 8 weeks apart. 9. Subjects with a history of seizures must be on a stable dose of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and without seizures for 14 days prior to enrollment in patients enrolled prior to Amendment 2. Subjects enrolled after Amendment 2 is approved with a history of seizures must be on a stable dose of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for 7 days prior to enrollment. 10. All AEs resulting from prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, must have resolved to at least NCICTCAE (v. 4.03) Grade 1 (except for laboratory parameters outlined below). 11. Laboratory results within 7 days prior to MRZ administration (transfusions and/or growth factor support may not be used to meet this criteria): Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin at least 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at least 1,500/mm3 Serum bilirubin at least 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or at least 3 × ULN if Gilbert's disease is documented Aspartate transaminase (AST) at least 2.5 ULN Alanine transaminase (ALT) at least 2.5 ULN Serum creatinine at least 1.5 × ULN Urine protein: creatinine ratio ≤ 1.0 at screening 12. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score at least 70%. 13. For women of childbearing potential and for men with partners of childbearing potential, subject must agree to take contraceptive measures for duration of treatments and 6 months after the last dose of BEV. 14. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 1. Comedication that may interfere with study results, e.g., immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids. (Steroid therapy for control of cerebral edema is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects should be on a stable dose of steroids for at least 1 week prior to first dose of MRZ.) 2. Evidence of CNS hemorrhage on baseline MRI or CT scan (except for postsurgical, asymptomatic Grade 1 hemorrhage that has been stable for at least 3 months for subjects enrolled prior to Amendment 2 and for at least 4 weeks in subjects enrolled after Amendment 2 is approved). 3. History of thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months. 4. Chemotherapy administered within 4 weeks (except 6 weeks for nitrosoureas, 12 weeks for an implanted nitrosoureas wafer, and 1 week from metronomic chemotherapy, like daily temozolomide and etoposide) prior to Day 1 of study treatment, unless the subject has recovered from all expected toxicities from the chemotherapy. 5. Pregnancy or breast feeding. 6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring IV antibiotics &amp; psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, or disorders associated with significant immunocompromised state. 7. Known previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within ≤ 3 years except for cervical carcinoma in situ, squamous or basal cell skin carcinoma, and superficial bladder carcinoma. 8. Any comorbid condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study as judged by the Investigator or Medical Monitor. BEVSpecific Concerns (Note: These exclusion criteria apply to the Phase 2 portion of the study even though BEV is not administered so that the patient populations between Phase 1 and Phase 2 are similar): 9. Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 10. Systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg. 11. Unstable angina. 12. New York Heart Association Grade ≥ II congestive heart failure. 13. History of myocardial infarction within 6 months. 14. Subjects with mean QTcF interval &gt; 500 ms. 15. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease 16. Evidence of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy as documented by an elevated (≥ 1.5 x ULN) prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), or bleeding time. The use of fulldose oral or parenteral anticoagulants is permitted as long as the PT or aPTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard of the enrolling institution) and the subject has been on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment. 17. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during course of the study. 18. Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 1. 19. History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 1. 20. Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture requiring surgical intervention.</criteria>
