	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial with a split mouth design. Patients with an indication of lower dental extraction will be asked to join this research project at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at University of Damascus Dental School. Each patient whose case requires bilateral extraction, one side will serve as an experimental side, whereas the other side will serve as a control. Participants should have symmetric teeth that need extraction in the lower jaw. Hyaluronic acid will be injected following extraction in one of the two sides with random allocation. cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) images will be taken for each participant immediately post-extraction and at six months post-operatively.</brief_summary>
