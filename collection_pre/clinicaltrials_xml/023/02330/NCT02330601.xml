	<brief_summary>The recurrent rate of CBDS in patients with recurrent CBDS is high. It was reported that up to 60% of patients had stone recurrence within two years after stone retrieval by ERCP. Although EPLBD is useful for for extraction of large CBDS with less operation time and mechanical lithotripsy.It is not known whether EPLBD could prevent the recurrence in patients with recurrent CBDS.Although Harada et al found that EPLBD might reduce the short-term recurrence of CBD stones in patients with previous ES. It is a retrospective study with a small sample size (n=94). Here a prospective, randomized controlled study including two tertiary centers was designed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether EPLBD could reduce the recurrence rate in patients with recurrent CBDS.</brief_summary>
