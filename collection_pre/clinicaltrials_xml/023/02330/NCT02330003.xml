	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to evaluate the safety of IL-YANG Inactivated Split Influenza Vaccine (IL-YANG FLU Vaccine Prefilled Syringe INJ.) in comparison with Fluarix Prefilled Syringe (inactivated split influenza vaccine) after single-dose intramuscular administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study to Assess the Safety of Inactivated Split Influenza Vaccine and Control Vaccine in Korean Volunteer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical study. After providing voluntary written informed consent, subjects underwent protocol-specific assessments and tests within the 4 weeks prior to administration of the study vaccine, and those who met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized sequentially to the test group or the comparator group according to the pre-generated randomization code. To investigate the safety of the study drug with a two-dose regimen in children, the test group received another dose 28 days after the first dose. The investigator evaluated the safety and immunogenicity for each subject throughout the study. Safety assessments were performed 28 days after the first dose (Visit 4, End-of-Study Visit) for the comparator group receiving a single-dose regimen of Fluarix Prefilled Syringe, and for the test group receiving a two-dose regimen of the test drug, 28 days after the first dose (Visit 4) and 28 days after the second dose (Visit 6, End-of-Study Visit). Subjects were instructed to record any adverse event occurring after vaccination in the Patient Diary Card. For the immunogenicity assessment, an antibody titer test was performed prior to dosing at Visit 2 (baseline) and 28 days (Visit 4) after the first vaccination for both the test group and comparator group.</detailed_description>

Subjects who had previously received immunoglobulin or bloodderived products within the last 3 months prior to administration of the study vaccine, or are expecting to be treated with immunoglobulin or bloodderived products during the study Subjects who had received, or are scheduled to receive, systemic immunosuppressive therapy, radiation therapy or highdose corticosteroid therapy within the last 6 months prior to administration of the study Subjects with a history of, or suspected, drug abuse based on subject interview and physical examination. Subjects with excessive consumption of caffeine and alcohol and excessive smoking Subject with a known allergy to eggs, chicken, or any components of the study vaccine Subjects who in the investigator's opinion, may not be suitable for vaccination or who may interfere with the objective assessment of the study outcomes.</criteria>
