	<brief_summary>Studies suggest that some laboratory tests ordered for hospitalized patients are duplicative or have limited value. This study will evaluate a normative feedback intervention to reduce overuse of laboratory tests for hospitalized patients by internal medicine physicians-in-training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Norms on Laboratory and Imaging Testing (ENLITen)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Past research has shown that 25% of diagnostic testing is duplicative or has limited value. Academic medical centers that employ physicians-in-training may find it particularly challenging to reduce low value testing due to a historical emphasis on extensive workups by trainees. Despite the increased emphasis on cost-consciousness in medical education, there is little existing research evaluating ways to optimize ordering behaviors of physicians-in-training. This study will evaluate a normative feedback intervention for internal medicine physicians-in-training to reduce overuse of routine laboratory tests for hospitalized patients. Physicians-in-training will be cluster-randomized into two arms: (1) those who receive report cards (intervention group), (2) those who will not receive report cards (control group). We will study the use of routine laboratory tests over a pre-intervention period of 1 week and a post-randomization period of 1 week. We will study physician attitudes about the real-time feedback dashboard with qualitative assessments in focus groups after the completion of the intervention.</detailed_description>
