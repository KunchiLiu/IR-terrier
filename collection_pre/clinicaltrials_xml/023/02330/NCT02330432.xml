	<brief_summary>Recent evidence suggests that sepsis continuum includes an immune paralytic state, which may play a significant role in sepsis. Mycobacterium w by its TLR4 agonist activity may help in restoring immunity, thereby improving outcomes in patients with severe sepsis. In this randomized trial, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of Mw in patients with severe sepsis.</brief_summary>
