	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized approach/avoidance training (AAT) procedure on behavioral, affective, and brain mechanisms that are important for reward sensitivity and well-being in individuals diagnosed with major depression. The training procedure is designed to modify automatic approach responses for positive social stimuli. The primary aim is to determine the effects of approach/avoidance training on the functioning of brain systems during reward processing in individuals diagnosed with major depression. A secondary aim will determine whether brain activation patterns following approach/avoidance training predict subsequent affective and behavioral responses during reward processing. An exploratory aim will test whether completing the approach/avoidance training procedure in combination with a brief computer-delivered behavioral activation program for depression will produce larger changes in depression symptoms, positive emotions, and social relationship functioning from pre- to post-intervention compared to the control training procedure.</brief_summary>

Concurrent psychosocial treatment: Participants completing ongoing psychosocial treatment will be required to meet a 12week stability criteria so that symptom changes as a result of other psychosocial treatments are not confounded with changes due to the research. Inability to complete the initial assessment battery or behavioral training sessions. Clinical conditions assessed by the interviewer that necessitate more imminent clinical care (e.g., active suicidal ideation). These criteria are in place so participants with these other, more several symptoms can be referred for appropriate mental health services.</criteria>
