	<brief_summary>AC0010 is a novel, potent, small molecule irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively targets mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while sparing wild-type (WT) EGFR. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of oral AC0010; to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral AC0010; to assess the safety and efficacy of AC0010 in previously treated mutant EGFR in NSCLC patients with EGFR T790M mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Preliminary Efficacy Study of AC0010 in Patients With EGFR T790M Positive NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remains the most common cancer worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of cases. Molecularly targeted therapies have proven to be superior to chemotherapy for NSCLC patients whose tumors have mutations in EGFR. Recent studies have established tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the gold standard for treating EGFR-mutation-positive NCSLC. However, patients on TKIs eventually progress, and in approximately 50% of cases, progression is due to development of an additional mutation called T790M. AC0010 may provide an effective therapy for a patient population with few alternative treatment options. Pre-clinical data demonstrated that AC0010 inhibits T790M. It is anticipated that AC0010 may promote cell death in tumor cells with the T790M mutation, thus providing possible therapeutic benefit in patients who have developed T790M-mediated resistance to previous TKIs. This is a two-part, open-label study of oral AC0010 administered twice-daily in previously treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an activating mutation in the EGFR gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib. This study will include 2 parts: Stage 1 : Dose-escalation Period with 28-day cycles; Optional Treatment Extension Period starting on Day 29 Stage 2 : Evaluation of activity and safety in patients with the EGFR T790M mutation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients of either gender, aged from 18 years older to 75. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic, or unresectable locally advanced, recurrent NSCLC. At least one measurable disease by CT or MRI, according to RECIST Version 1.1. Documented evidence of definitely EGFR T790M state in the tumor tissue. Have undergone or are able to undergo a biopsy of either primary or metastatic tumor tissue within 28 days of dosing of AC0010, and have tissue available to send to central lab for further genetic profiling especially the status of T790M. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0 to 1. Adequate hematological and physiological functions of heart, lung, liver, and kidney according to definitions given in Appendix D. Disease progression under at least one treatment with current marketed EGFR TKI therapy for at least 30 days (e.g. Erlotinib, or Gefitinib, or Afatinib) with intervening treatment after most recent EGFR TKI therapy. The washout period for an EGFR TKI (Erlotinib, or Gefitinib) is at a minimum of 7 days. The washout period for an irreversible EGFR inhibitor (Afatinib) and chemotherapy is at a minimum of 14 days. Any toxicity related to prior EGFR inhibitor treatment must have resolved to Grade 1 or less. NSCLC patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis or drugcontrollable brain metastasis. Signed consent on an Independent Ethics Committeeapproved Informed Consent Form prior to any studyspecific evaluation. No pathology confirmation History of interstitial lung disease related to prior EGFR inhibitor therapy. Symptomatic brain metastases or uncontrollable or unstable brain metastasis. Positive to HCV or HIV antibody. Treatment with prohibited medications (e.g., concurrent anticancer therapy including other chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, or immunotherapy) â‰¤14 days prior to treatment with AC0010. Clinically significant abnormal 12lead ECG, QT interval corrected using Fridericia's method (QTcF) &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt;470 msec (females). Family history of long QT syndrome. Treatment with any Category 1 and 2 drugs (See: www.crediblemeds.org/ or www.qtdrug.org). Presence of any serious or unstable concomitant systemic disorder incompatible with the clinical study (e.g., substance abuse, uncontrolled psychiatric condition, uncontrolled intercurrent illness including active infection, arterial thrombosis, and symptomatic pulmonary embolism). Any other reasons for the investigator to consider the patient should not participate in the study</criteria>
