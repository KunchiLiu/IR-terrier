	<brief_title>Effects of Dexmedetomidine and Propofol on Pulmonary Mechanics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare the effects propofol and dexmedetomidine on pulmonary mechanics. Sixty patients mechanically ventilated in intensive care unit are included in this study. Patients are divided into two random groups, Group P (propofol) and Group D (dexmedetomidine). Propofol infusion 0.5-2 mg/kg/h is given to Group P patients and dexmedetomidine infusion 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/h is given to Group D patients for sedation. Initial blood gas analysis, airway resistance (cmH2O/L/sec), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, cmH20), frequency (breath/min), tidal volume (mL/min), minute volume (mL), peak airway pressure (cmH20), compliance (mL/cmH20), endtidal CO2 (mmHg), SvO2 (%) values are recorded. This parameters are evaluated with Drager Evita 4 ventilator and recorded on 5th,15th,30th,45th ve 60th minutes . Sedation is observed using Riker and Ramsey Sedation-Agitation Scale. Compliance of patients to mechanical ventilation is observed and recorded. The primary outcome measures are airway resistance and peak airway pressure. Secondary outcome measure is sedation score.</detailed_description>
