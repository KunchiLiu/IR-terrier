	<brief_summary>This is a prospective longitudinal observational pilot study of psoriasis patients on continuous standard-of-care systemic therapeutics to determine the level of change in established (plasma/serum) and investigative (cellular) biomarkers that are associated with increased risk of CVD events. The final endpoint of the proposed study will be a ranking of the examined biomarkers based upon an integrated assessment of biomarker behavior over time. Secondary outcomes will assess changes in coronary artery calcification scoring, PET-MRI, skin biopsies, and clinical improvement.</brief_summary>
