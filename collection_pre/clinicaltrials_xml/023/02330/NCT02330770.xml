	<brief_summary>Comparing the reproductive outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in women at risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) subjected to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol followed by trigger with concomitant GnRH agonist (GnRHa) and low-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration (dual trigger), GnRHa trigger with single luteal low-dose HCG or GnRHa trigger with multiple luteal low-doses HCG</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Trigger Versus GnRHa Trigger Combined With Luteal HCG Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The GnRH antagonist fixed protocol will be used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be performed regularly for monitoring of the follicular growth (folliculometry). When there will be at least 3 leading follicles &gt; 18 mm in diameter, women will be randomized into 3 groups; group A (dual trigger group), group B (single low-dose HCG group) and group C (multiple low-doses HCG group). In group A, final oocyte maturation will be triggered by dual administration of 0.2 mg of GnRHa preparation (Triptorelin) SC and 1500 IU of HCG preparation IM. In group B, final oocyte maturation will be triggered by administration of 0.2 mg Triptorelin SC then a single IM bolus of 1500 IU HCG will by administered 35-37 hours after GnRHa trigger (1 hour after oocyte retrieval). In group C, final oocyte maturation will be triggered by administration of 0.2 mg Triptorelin SC then 3 IM boluses of 500 IU HCG will be administered day 1, day 4 and day 7 after oocyte retrieval. In all women, oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 hours after trigger and endometrial preparation for embryo transfer (ET) will be started on the day of oocyte retrieval by giving 400 mg vaginal natural progesterone supplement once daily plus 4 mg oral estradiol valerate once daily.</detailed_description>
