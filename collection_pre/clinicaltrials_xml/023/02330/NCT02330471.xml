	<brief_summary>In a randomized clinical trial of 120 women undergoing large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ)-conization for cervical dysplasia, two coagulation modes, spray versus forced coagulation, will be compared. The primary outcome of the study is time to complete hemostasis, secondary outcomes are intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, and postoperative bleeding complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Forced Versus Spray Coagulation in Women Undergoing LLETZ-conization for Cervical Dysplasia: a Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoperative bleeding during large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ)-conization can be achieved by two modes of electrocoagulation, spray coagulation and forced coagulation. Spray coagulation is a superficial coagulation mode, whereas forced coagulation is a deep tissue coagulation mode. It is unknown, whether spray or forced coagulation is superior regarding intraoperative hemostasis and other outcome Parameters such as postoperative bleeding and postoperative pain. Therefore, the investigator designed a randomized clinical trial of 120 women undergoing large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ)-conization for cervical dysplasia, comparing the two coagulation modes, spray coagulation and forced coagulation, The primary outcome of the study is time to complete hemostasis measured in seconds, secondary outcomes are intraoperative blood loss measured as difference in serum hemoglobin pre- and postoperatively, postoperative pain according to a 10 step VAS scale, and postoperative bleeding complications, defined as necessity to intervene surgically for vaginal bleeding up to 14 days postoperatively. The study Population consists of women undergoing LLETZ-conization for histologically proven cervical dysplasia. The study hypothesis states that the difference in the mean time until complete hemostais will be at least 1/3 shorter in women randomized to spray coagulation. With a study Population of 120 women, this study has a power of &gt;80% to detect a difference of 1/3 of the mean coagulation time until complete hemostais based on an anticipated mean time of 85 seconds.</detailed_description>
