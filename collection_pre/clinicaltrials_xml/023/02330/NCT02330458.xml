	<brief_summary>Goal is to prospectively determine if stool calprotectin and change in bowel wall thickness and hyperemia, as seen on small bowel ultrasound, at week 0, 14, and 54 can be used to predict response at week 54 to infliximab in pediatric patients with small bowel Crohn's Disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Small Bowel Ultrasound in Initiation of Infliximab in Crohn's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will examine whether non-invasive disease monitoring tools such as bowel wall thickness as measured by small bowel ultrasound (SBUS) and mucosal inflammation as measured by fecal calprotectin, are independently associated with infliximab durability.</detailed_description>
