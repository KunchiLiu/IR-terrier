	<brief_title>Evaluation of Interference Between Cell Phones and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrograms of ICDs will be analyzed during wireless telemetry and during exposure to an activated cell phone. ICD therapy will have been temporarily inactivated before exposure to cell phones to avoid inappropriate shocks, and the sensitivity level of the ICD will be set to maximum. The cell phones will be held over the ICD generator, as well as in the parasternar region (close to the ICD lead, which senses the signals). Interference will be assessed by the presence of visible artefacts on the real-time electrogram, with ICD marker annotations showing atrial and/or ventricular sensed episodes. The outcome measure will be the number and proportion of patients who have electromagnetic interference of the ICD when exposed to cell phones. The procedure will take approximately 5-10minutes, with reprogramming of the device at the end of the test. No further follow-up in the context of the study will be performed.</detailed_description>
