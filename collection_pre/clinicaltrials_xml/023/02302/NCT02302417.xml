	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to identify demographic and non-spirometric clinical features predictive of the asthma-COPD overlap population. The study aims to explore and identify characteristics of the Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) patient's clinical profile that enable clinical differentiation from subjects with a primary diagnosis of either asthma alone (without persistent obstruction) or COPD alone (without reversibility). The study is designed as a targeted medical history survey which consists of a 41-item questionnaire, which will be administered by a qualified health care practitioner at the time a subject's medical history is taken. The questionnaire has been developed to elicit specific details of the respiratory history, including the following: bronchodilator use, disease progression, variation in symptoms, atopic history, symptom triggers, vagal bias, burden of disease, symptom presentation, co morbidities and age of onset. In addition, demographic information, standard medical history, co morbidity and spirometric results will also be obtained and analyzed in conjunction with the questionnaire results. Approximately 1000 subjects are required for the study.</brief_summary>
