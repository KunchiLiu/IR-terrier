	<brief_summary>This study is carried out to determine if laparoscopic inguinal TEP repair of the hernia using a mesh carried out with only 1 port (hole) results in the reduction of post- operative pain and use of painkillers, shorter hospital stay and lesser complications than that carried out using conventional 3 ports.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SIngle Port vs Standard TEP for Primary Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 patients undergoing laparoscopic TEP ( Total extraperitoneal repair) inguinal hernia repair under general anaesthesia will be randomized into 2 groups by the closed envelope method. In case of difficulty in Single port TEP inguinal hernia repair, the procedure will be converted to conventional 3 port repair for patient safety. 2 groups of participants: Group A will undergo laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair with 3 ports (10 mm , and 2 ports of 5 mm ). Group B will undergo laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair with a single port (12 to 15 mm transumbilical). Patient will be informed at consenting that 3 wound plasters will be applied to their abdomen regardless of whether they are in the single port or 3- ports group so that they would not know which group they have been randomized to. The blind will only be lifted after pain score and area of pain has been recorded before discharge.</detailed_description>
