	<brief_title>Cabozantinib for Malignant Pheochromocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take cabozantinib tablets by mouth 1 time each day. You should take your dose of study drug at about the same time each day, at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after eating a meal, with about a cup (8 ounces) of water. Do not crush the tablets. If you forget to take your dose of cabozantinib and it has been less than 12 hours since the scheduled dose time, take your dose as soon as you remember. If it has been more than 12 hours, do not take the drug that day, and wait for your next scheduled dose. Study Visits: On Day -4 (4 days before you start taking the study drug): - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.This routine blood draw may include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. - You will have an EKG. - You will answer 1 questionnaire about any symptoms you may be having. It should take about 10 minutes to complete. You will complete this questionnaire 1 time every week after you start the study drug . The study staff will tell you how to complete this questionnaire. - If you can become pregnant, urine may be collected for a pregnancy test. On Day 1 of Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, and then every 4 weeks after that until Week 24 (Weeks 13, 17, 21, and 24) and then every 8 weeks after that: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This routine blood draw may include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. - If you can become pregnant, urine may be collected for a pregnancy test. Every 4 weeks until Week 24 and then every 8 weeks after that, you will have an EKG. Every 8 weeks: - You will have an MRI, CT, or PET scan to check the status of the disease. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone scan and/or a fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) scan to check the status of the disease. Starting after Week 24, you will be called by the research nurse every 8 weeks (at the 4-week midpoint between your every 8-week study visits) to ask about any symptoms you may have and if you have started any new medications. This call should last about 15 minutes. During the study, leftover tissue from a previous biopsy or surgery will be collected for biomarker testing. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have photographs taken of any skin lesions or rashes you may develop during the study. Your private areas will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of your face will not be taken unless there are lesions on your face. Length of Treatment: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. If the disease appears to get worse, but the study doctor and those who monitor the safety of this study think you are still receiving benefit from the study drug, you may be able to continue to receive the drug. This will be discussed with you. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit. Follow-Up Visit: About 30-37 days after your last dose of study drug, you will have a follow-up visit. At this visit: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have an EKG. - If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. If you are having side effects at the follow-up visit, you may have additional follow-up visits until the side effects get better or the doctor thinks you no longer need them. This is an investigational study. Cabozantinib is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. It is investigational to give cabozantinib to patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 22 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
