	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diet Treatment Adjunctive to Radiation and Chemotherapy in Glioblastoma Multiforme: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aims of the study will be to 1) To evaluate efficacy of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. 2) To evaluate the safety of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. Secondary aim will be to evaluate tolerability of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. Participants will be seen at one, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after KG diet initiation, and then monthly until month 6 after diet initiation, then every 2 months until 2 years after treatment initiation or death, then every 3 months until 3 years after treatment initiation or death. KD treatment will last for 6 months or until exit criteria are met, whichever comes first. Exit criteria are the primary outcome measures, the first of either (a) MRI tumor progression or (b) death. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment compliance, hunger scale scores, fasting serum glucose and BOH levels and occurrence of adverse events. Patients with documented tumor progression will receive standard care for progressive GBM as directed by their treating oncologist, independent of the study.</detailed_description>
