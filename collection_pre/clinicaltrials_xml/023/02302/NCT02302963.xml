	<brief_title>USS Virginia Closed-Loop Versus SAP Therapy for Hypoglycemia Reduction in T1D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the control system in reducing hypoglycemia by comparing, in a randomized study, 24 hour control with USS Virginia versus sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy in subjects with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness and/or risk for hypoglycemia. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the control system to improve hypoglycemia counterregulation, hypoglycemia awareness, and overall glycemic control. To achieve this goal, we will conduct pre- and post-intervention inpatient assessments of hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptom awareness. Subjects randomized to USS Virginia will participate in two training visits at a monitored outpatient setting for the step-wise deployment of the cell phone based Artificial Pancreas (AP) System at home. The first training visit includes training on the study pump and AP System followed by 1 week use of AP System at home in Pump mode. The second training visit includes additional training on USS Virginia+AP System and confirmation of independent use by the subject followed by 4 week use of the AP System at home in Closed Loop mode. Subjects randomized to sensor-augmented pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM with the home pump.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year. For an individual to be enrolled at least one criterion from each list must be met: Criteria for documented hyperglycemia (at least 1 must be met): 1. Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL (confirmed) 2. Twohour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose ≥200 mg/dL (confirmed) 3. HbA1c ≥6.5% (confirmed) 4. Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms 5. No data at diagnosis is available but the participant has a convincing history of hyperglycemia consistent with diabetes or in the opinion of the investigator participant has history consistent with type 1 diabetes. Criteria for requiring insulin at diagnosis (at least 1 must be met): 1. Participant required insulin at diagnosis and continually thereafter 2. Participant did not start insulin at diagnosis but upon investigator review likely needed insulin (significant hyperglycemia that did not respond to oral agents) and did require insulin eventually and used continually 3. Participant required insulin at diagnosis but continued to be hyperglycemic, had positive islet cell antibodies consistent with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and did require insulin eventually and used continually thereafter Use of insulin for the last 12 months or more Use of an insulin infusion pump for the last 6 months or longer Age 1270 years old HbA1c &lt;10.0% as measured with DCA2000 or equivalent device; if HbA1c &lt;6.0% then total daily insulin must be ≥0.5 U/kg Risk of hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness as defined by any of the following: Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness questionnaire score of ≥4. Average Daily Risk Range (ADRR) &gt;40 as assessed from SelfMonitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) readings from the prior month. Subject must have a glucometer that can be downloaded for this assessment. The subjects may alternatively provide a spreadsheet of their past 30 days of blood glucose values. Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI) &gt;2.5 as assessed from SMBG from the prior month or LBGI &gt;1.1 as assessed from 1 week of CGM readings from the prior three weeks. Subject must have a glucometer or CGM that can be downloaded for this assessment. For the glucometer data, the subjects may alternatively provide a spreadsheet of their past 30 days of blood glucose values. Subject reports no recognition of hypoglycemia until the glucose is &lt;60 mg/dL and no adrenergic symptoms at glucose of 60 mg/dL (shakiness, palpitations, diaphoresis). Able to speak and read English and use basic technology such as a cell phone. Currently using an insulintocarbohydrate ratio to calculate meal bolus sizes. Access to Internet or cell phone service in the subject's local environment. Willingness to maintain uninterrupted availability via personal cell phone at all times during the study. Willingness to perform SMBG testing 46 times daily (before meals, about 2 hours after meals and at bedtime, before driving, before exercise, and as indicated) during the interventional phases of the study. Living with a diabetes care partner ≥18 years old who meets the following inclusion criteria: Committed to potentially (if randomized to DiAs) participating in all training activities involving DiAs components and emergency procedures, Knowledgeable at all times of the participant's location during the day when closed loop is in use, Committed to maintaining uninterrupted availability via personal cell phone, Being present and available to provide assistance when the closed loop system is being used at night, Able to speak and read English and use basic technology such as a cell phone, and Absence of known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere with the completion of the protocol such as the following examples: Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months, Current or recent abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs by history A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication, or disease in the judgment of the investigator will affect the completion of the protocol. The presence of any of the following is an exclusion for the study: 1. Admission for diabetic ketoacidosis in the 12 months prior to enrollment. 2. Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness in the 3 months prior to enrollment. 3. Hematocrit less that the lower limit of normal for the assay. 4. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or intention of becoming pregnant over time of study procedures; If female and sexually active, must agree to use a form of contraception to prevent pregnancy while a participant in the study. A negative urine pregnancy test will be required for all premenopausal women who are not surgically sterile. Subjects who become pregnant will be discontinued from the study. 5. Conditions which may increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia such as: known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of any cardiac arrhythmia (benign premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions allowed), history of seizure disorder, history of cerebrovascular event or transient ischemic attack, hypoglycemiainduced migraine within the last 6 months, or neurological disease. 6. Cystic fibrosis 7. A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere with the completion of the protocol such as the following examples: 8. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months for either the subject or the subject's diabetes care partner 9. Presence of a known adrenal disorder 10. Abnormal liver function tests (transaminase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal); testing required for subjects taking medications known to affect liver function or with diseases known to affect liver function 11. Abnormal renal function test results (estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2); testing required for subjects with diabetes duration of greater than 5 years post onset of puberty 12. Active gastroparesis 13. If on antihypertensive, thyroid, antidepressant or lipid lowering medication, lack of stability on the medication for the past 2 months prior to enrollment in the study 14.
