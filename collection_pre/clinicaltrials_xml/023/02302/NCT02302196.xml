	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of breast reconstruction using Autologous Fat Grafting (AFG) for women post lumpectomy that have contour defects. The study hypothesis is that AFG has emerged as a less invasive alternative to breast reconstruction post mastectomy. AFG could be used to treat breast contour defects with much less invasive outpatient surgery, using the patient's own cells and tissues, which overall reduces risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Fat Grafting of the Breast in Women With Post Lumpectomy Contour Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 200 women at Kaiser Permanente Northwest will be in this study. The study will include about 100 women who have had a lumpectomy and consent to be in the research arm and have AFG and 100 from the control arm (retrospective chart review). Autologous Fat Grafting Arm: Breast-Q survey of patient satisfaction will be collected before and after AFG. Assessments will be done 3 months post grafting for efficacy (excellent 100% correction of defect), good (75% correction of defect), fair (50% correction of defect), poor 25% or less correction of defect) result will be recorded. AFG may be repeated x 2 at a 3-6 month interval if deemed necessary by the treating surgeon, then reassessed again 3 months later in the same way. A mammographic assessment of the breast, scored by radiologist in a 6 step scoring system (BIRADS score) will be done 1 year after AFG. BIRADS scores and new physical finding will continue to be collected for a 5 year period post AFG post lumpectomy group. Control (non-Autologous Fat Grafting) arm: Retrospective chart review for women who have undergone standard treatment to treatment to reconstruct their breasts. Data collected will include; BIRADS scores as well as frequency of subsequent surgical intervention (as necessitated by increased BIRADS scores or by new physical findings on exam) over a 5 year period post lumpectomy.</detailed_description>
