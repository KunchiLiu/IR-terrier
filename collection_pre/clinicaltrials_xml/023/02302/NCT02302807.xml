	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized, controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) who have progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. The anticipated time on study treatment is based on continued clinical benefit, i.e., until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The target sample size is 932 participants.</brief_summary>
