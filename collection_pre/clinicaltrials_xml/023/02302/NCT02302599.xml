	<detailed_description>Between umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells secrete a variety of cytokines, improve insulin target tissue insulin resistance, improve the body state of high blood sugar, reduce the metabolic disorder of islet progressive damage, ease or regeneration of the islet beta cells;Improve the micro environment, induced damage alpha cells into beta cells in the islet transformation, realize the islet beta cells in situ regeneration, reduce high blood sugar;Between mesenchymal stem cells have immunosuppressive effect, inhibition of T cell mediated immune response to beta cells, improve the micro environment of nutrition, promote islet cell repair and regeneration.</detailed_description>
