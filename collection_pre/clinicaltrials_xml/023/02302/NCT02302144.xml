	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effects of a theoretically driven, highly challenging exercise program (balance and strengthening exercises) in reducing fall rate, improving balance and reducing fear of falling in persons with Parkinson's disease. In this pilot, randomized, cross-over study, 32 participants with Parkinson disease will be randomly assigned to either an early start (immediately following enrollment) or late start (3 months after enrollment) multifactorial exercise program which will meet 2 times per week for 1.5 hours over 3 months. The exercise program will consist of balance and strengthening exercises which will be individualized depending on the ability of each participant. Fall rate, balance, walking ability, fear of falling, mood, anxiety, and quality of life will be measured prior to the start, at 3 months and 6 months after enrollment. Subjects will be enrolled for 6-7 months.</brief_summary>
