	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of Different Schedules of Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV) in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV). TDV is being tested to assess how different dosing schedules of the vaccine effect immunity to dengue fever in dengue endemic countries. This study will look at the number of antibodies to dengue fever formed in people who are administered different dosing schedules of TDV. The study will randomize approximately 1800 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups in a 1:2:5:1 ratio—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Group 1 - TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection Days 1 and 91 - Group 2 - TDV 0.5 mL SC injection Day 1 - Group 3 - TDV 0.5 mL SC injection Days 1 and 365 - Placebo (dummy SC) - this is a liquid that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient In order to keep the treatment arms undisclosed to the patient and the doctor, participants will receive a placebo injection at any study visit where TDV is not being administered (Days 91 and/or 365). Participants will be asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card for 28 days after each vaccination. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Asia and Latin America. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 18 months. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic including a final visit 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the vaccine components; b. Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding; c. Individuals with any serious chronic or progressive disease according to judgment of the investigator (e.g. neoplasm, insulindependent diabetes, cardiac, renal or hepatic disease, neurologic or seizure disorder or GuillainBarré syndrome); d. Known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, including: i. Chronic use of oral steroids (Equivalent to 20 mg/day prednisone ≥ 12 weeks / ≥ 2 mg/kg body weight / day prednisone ≥ 2 weeks) within 60 days prior to Day 1 (use of inhaled, intranasal, or topical corticosteroids is allowed); ii. Receipt of parenteral steroids (Equivalent to 20 mg/day prednisone ≥ 12 weeks / ≥ 2 mg/kg body weight / day prednisone ≥ 2 weeks) within 60 days prior to Day 1; iii. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first administration of the investigational vaccine or planned administration during the trial; iv. Receipt of immunostimulants within 60 days prior to Day 1; v. Immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 6 months preceding (first) vaccination; vi. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or HIVrelated disease; vii. Genetic immunodeficiency. 3. Individuals who received any other vaccines within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 28 days (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this trial or who are planning to receive any vaccine within 28 days of investigational vaccine administration. 4. Individuals participating in any clinical trial with another investigational product 30 days prior to first trial visit or intent to participate in another clinical trial at any time during the conduct of this trial. 5. Individuals who are first degree relatives of individuals involved in trial conduct. 6. If female of childbearing potential, sexually active, and has not used any of the "acceptable contraceptive methods" for at least 2 months prior to trial entry: a. Of childbearing potential is defined as status post onset of menarche and not meeting any of the following conditions: menopausal (for at least 2 years), bilateral tubal ligation (at least 1 year previously), bilateral oophorectomy (at least 1 year previously) or hysterectomy; b. Acceptable birth control methods are defined as one or more of the following: i. Hormonal contraceptive (such as oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant, cervical ring); ii. Barrier (condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) each and every time during intercourse; iii. Intrauterine device (IUD); iv. Monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner. Partner must have been vasectomized for at least six months prior to the participants' trial entry. 7. If female of childbearing potential, sexually active and refuses to use an "acceptable contraceptive method" through to 6 weeks after the last dose of investigational vaccine. 8.
