	<detailed_description>Rationale Although fertility success rates are rising due to improved techniques and patients are usually highly motivated at their first visit of the clinic, dropout rates are high. Research has shown that fertility treatment is a cause for physical, psychological and economic burden. Objective The aim of this study is to examine the rate of patient drop out during any type of subfertility work up or treatment. Furthermore, the investigators want to determine what the reasons for discontinuation are and to identify the demographic characteristics of these couples and the prognostic factors for drop out during assessment or treatment at a fertility clinic.
