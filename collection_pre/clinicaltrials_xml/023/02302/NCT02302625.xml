	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis (AD)is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by itching, dry skin and recurrent inflammatory eczema. It is one of the most common skin diseases and is associated with reduced quality of life, functional impairment and sleep difficulties. There are currently no pharmacological treatments that are effective in curing the disorder in the longer-term. Itching is one of the core symptoms in AD and it has been shown that the behavioral response to itching, scratching, has a maintaining function in AD. Reducing scratching may therefore play an important role in alleviating AD. Although behavioral aspects play a significant role in AD only a few studies have investigated the effect of psychological treatment for AD. These studies have shown promising results and the present study aim to add to the body of knowledge by testing a new form of cognitive behavioral treatment for AD. This new treatment is based on the idea that patients could benefit from training in exposure to events that could lead to increase in itching while refraining from scratching. To enable this the treatment incorporates more recently developed cognitive behavioral components such as mindfulness training. The present study aims to investigate a new exposure-based cognitive behavioral psychological treatment for the disorder. The trial is a small scale open trial (n=25) with assessments at baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome is the SCORAD.</detailed_description>
