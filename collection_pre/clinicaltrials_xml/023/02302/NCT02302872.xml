	<criteria>1. Is ambulatory, able and willing to comply with the study protocol and has provided written informed consent 2. Age ≥ 18 3. Transseptal catheterization is determined to be feasible by the treating physician 4. NYHA class IIIV heart failure of any etiology 5. Symptomatic with MR grade ≥ 2+ 6. LVEF ≥20% ≤ 50% 7. LVEDD &gt; 50 mm and ≤ 70 mm 8. No anticipated change in patient's cardiac medication regimen anticipated throughout the course of the study. 9. In the opinion of the investigator, the use of the ARTO System is both technically feasible and clinically indicated 1. In the opinion of the Investigator, the femoral vein and internal jugular vein cannot accommodate a 16 F catheter or the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter would interfere with advancement of the catheter or ipsilateral DVT is present 2. Significant structural abnormality of the mitral valve (e.g., flail, prolapse, leaflet calcification) 3. Significant mitral annular calcification 4. Hemodynamic instability (systolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg without afterload reduction or cardiogenic shock or the need for inotropic support or intraaortic balloon pump) 5. Prior mitral valve surgery or valvuloplasty or any currently implanted prosthetic valve or VAD 6. History of, or active, rheumatic heart disease 7. History of Atrial Septal Defects (ASD), whether repaired or not 8. History of previously repaired PFO or PFO associated with clinical symptoms (e.g., cerebral ischemia) within 6 months of the planned investigational procedure 9. In the opinion of the investigator, an atrial septal aneurysm is present that may interfere with transseptal crossing 10. Biventricular pacing initiated or anticipated within 6 months of the planned investigational procedure</criteria>
