	<criteria>Major Sensorimotor complete, traumatic SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale A) for cohorts 1,2,3 Sensorimotor incomplete, traumatic SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale B) for cohorts 4,5 Last fully preserved single neurological level (SNL) from C5 to C7 From 18 through 69 years of age at time of injury Single spinal cord lesion on a poststabilization magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, with sufficient visualization of the spinal cord injury epicenter and lesion margins to enable postinjection safety monitoring Informed consent for this protocol and the companion long term followup protocol must be provided and documented (i.e., signed informed consent forms) no later than 25 days following injury Able to participate in an elective surgical procedure to inject ASTOPC1 1430 days following SCI Major SCI due to penetrating trauma Traumatic anatomical transection or laceration of the spinal cord based on prior surgery or MRI Any concomitant injury that interferes with the performance, interpretation or validity of neurological examinations Inability to communicate effectively with neurological examiner such that the validity of patient data could be compromised Significant organ damage or systemic disease that would create an unacceptable risk for surgery or immunosuppression History of any malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) Pregnant or nursing women Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 or weight &gt; 300 lbs.
