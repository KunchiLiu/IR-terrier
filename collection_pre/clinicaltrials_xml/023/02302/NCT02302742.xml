	<brief_summary>PROGECT is a registry for patients with Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC) or patients who have an identified germline mutations (such as a mutation on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Germline Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Mutation Carrier Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being done to collect cancer-related information from patients with triple negative breast cancer and patients with hereditary genetic mutations. This information will help us better understand the link between genetic changes and cancer outcome in patients with triple negative breast cancer.</detailed_description>
