	<brief_summary>This study attempts to identify the psychological, behavioral, physiological, and hormonal predictors and mechanisms of an individual's ability to develop cohesion in a group working together as a team; and examine if administration of the prosocial neuropeptide oxytocin enhances the development of team cohesion. Through a deeper understanding of the underlying psychobiological predictors and mechanisms of team cohesion, the prospective identification of individuals whose unique characteristics promote or inhibit the development of group cohesion will become possible.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will study three hundred and sixty subjects who will be randomized into teams of three. Teams will be randomized to receive oxytocin or placebo. The investigators will first measure baseline personality traits including prosocial orientation. Cohesion will then be measured using a cooperative, virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying mission. All online behavior will be recorded within the task and all offline, real world, behavior will be video recorded throughout the study by digital cameras for later behavioral coding. To measure biobehavioral synchrony, autonomic physiology will be recorded and saliva samples will be taken throughout behavioral testing.</detailed_description>
