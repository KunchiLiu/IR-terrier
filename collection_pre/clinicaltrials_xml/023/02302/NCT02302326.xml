	<brief_summary>The main objective of the present project is to evaluate the relevance of reticulum stress in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), focusing particularly on the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance, which is the origin of metabolic comorbidities. Furthermore, the investigators will assess the potential of insulin sensitizers as a treatment to control endoplasmic reticulum stress markers in PCOS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Involvement of Reticulum Endoplasmic Stress in the Physiopathology of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To do this, the investigators will evaluate anthropometric, biochemical and hormone parameters, lipid profile and cardiovascular risk markers (using enzymatic and biochemical techniques, nephelometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, radioimmunoassay), and markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the insulin pathway and inflammatory and apoptotic parameters (by means of Western blot, Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Luminex® xMAP® Technology ) in patients with and without PCOS. The investigators' second objective is to evaluate (using the abovementioned methodology) the efficacy of different insulin sensitizers (myoinositol and metformin) administered to PCOS patients during a 3-month period after which the investigators will analyze different parameters of oxidative stress and mitochondrial function (using Clark electrode and fluorometric techniques).</detailed_description>
