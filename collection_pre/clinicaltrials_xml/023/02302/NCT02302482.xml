	<brief_summary>The Alzheimer's disease or related disorders (ADRD) are among the most disabling diseases because of their main features such as cognitive impairment, loss of functional autonomy and behavioural disorders. In absence of current curative treatment, the identification of the predictive risk factors of progression of the disease, evaluated through its main symptoms, represents a major stake of public health. The investigators aimed at developing a database, which includes the patient medical records on a prospective basis, in collaboration with the medical and administrative personal and with the University hospital computer science department. The main objective is to study the predictive factors associated with the change of functional autonomy level, measured every 6 months to 12 months by phone, in a Memory Clinic. The study population would consist in about 1000 patients with ADRD. The length of follow-up of each patient will be 3 years.</brief_summary>
