	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of ASP8232 in subjects with diabetic macular edema (DME). This study will evaluate the percent change from baseline in excess central subfield thickness (CST) in the study eye as assessed by spectral domain-optical coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) for ASP8232 monotherapy at Month 3.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have a documented diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ≤ 12.0% at Screening Subject has definite retinal thickening due to diffuse diabetic macular edema (DME) involving the central macula based on evaluating investigator's clinical evaluation and demonstrated by spectral domainoptical coherence tomography (SDOCT) Subject has central subfield thickness (CST) of at least 375 μm by SDOCT with presence of intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid at screening visit and at the randomization visit Subject has early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score ≤ 73 (Snellen 20/40) and ≥ 24 (Snellen 20/320) at screening visit Subject's study eye has macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than DME Subject's study eye has a decrease in BCVA due to causes other than DME that is likely to be decreasing BCVA by 3 lines or more Subject's study eye has significant macular ischemia as shown on angiography Subject's study eye has any other ocular disease that may cause substantial reduction in BCVA Subject has active periocular or ocular infection Subject's study eye has a history of noninfectious uveitis Subject's study eye has high myopia (8 diopter or more correction) Subject's study eye has a history of prior pars plana vitrectomy Subject's study eye has a history of any ocular surgery within 3 months prior to Day 1 Subject's study eye has a history of YAG capsulotomy within 3 months prior to Day 1 Subject's study eye has a history of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) or focal laser within 3 months prior to Day 1 or anticipated need for PRP during the course of the study through the Week 12 visit Subject's study eye has a history of prior IVT, subtenon, or periocular, nonsustained release, steroid therapy within 3 months prior to Day 1 Subject's study eye has a history of intravitreal sustained release dexamethasone therapy within 6 months prior to Day 1. Subject's study eye has a history of intravitreal sustained release fluocinolone within 3 years prior to Day 1. Subject's study eye has a history of prior treatment for DME with IVT antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment within 8 weeks prior to Day 1 Subject has a history of prior treatment with any other (than previously listed) approved treatment which is not labeled for DME within 1 year prior to Day 1 Subject's study eye has highrisk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) Subject has uncontrolled glaucoma Subject has media clarity, papillary constriction (i.e., senile miosis), or subject lacks cooperation that would interfere with any study procedures, evaluations or interpretation of data</criteria>
