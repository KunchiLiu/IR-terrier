	<brief_summary>To evaluate Ranibizumab as prophylaxis against the conversion to neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Ranibizumab for Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, prospective, randomized study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab 0.5 mg in subjects with unilateral neovascular AMD in which the fellow (study) eye is at high-risk for also developing conversion to neovascular AMD. The Study will determine the efficacy of a quarterly injection of Ranibizumab to prevent the conversion of dry age-related macular degeneration to neovascular AMD in high risk eyes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults over 50 years old Able to sign informed consent and comply with the study protocol for the duration of the two years. Nonexudative agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) in one eye (study eye) •At time of enrollment, fellow nonstudy eye must have recently diagnosed (not more than 2 years prior to enrollment), angiographically documented, previously untreated prior to diagnosis, CNV lesion (i.e., leakage on fluorescein angiography AND subretinal, intraretinal, or subRPE fluid on OCT) secondary to agerelated macular degeneration. Previous treatment with verteporfin PDT, Macugen®, Lucentis®, intravitreal Avastin®, intravitreal Eylea®, thermal laser, external beam radiation or other AMD therapy in the study eye. History of macular hole in study eye. History of vitrectomy in study eye. Lens extraction or implantation within the last 3 months. Capsulotomy within the last 1 month. Lens or other media opacity that would preclude good fundus photography or angiography within the next 2 years. Nevus &gt; 2 disc areas within 3000 microns of the foveal center or with fluid or leakage on fluorescein angiography. Macular edema or signs of diabetic retinopathy more severe than 10 red dots (microaneurysms or blot hemorrhages). Retinal changes related to high myopia and no myopic correction greater than 8.00 diopters spherical equivalent [sphere + ½ cylinder]. Any progressive ocular disease that would affect visual acuity within the next 2 years. Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs likely to have ocular effects within 30 days preceding the initial study treatment. Concurrent use of systemic antiVEGF agents. Active or recent (within 4 weeks) intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye. Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either eye. For subjects who have undergone prior refractive or cataract surgery in the study eye, the preoperative refractive error in the study eye cannot exceed 8 diopters of myopia. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure &gt; 25 mmHg) despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication). Patients who are unable to be photographed to document CNV due to known allergy to fluorescein dye, lack of venous access or cataract obscuring the CNV. Patients with other ocular diseases that can compromise the visual acuity of the study eye such as amblyopia and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Current treatment for active systemic infection. Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as cardiovascular disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders. History of recurrent significant infections or bacterial infections. Inability to comply with study or followup procedures. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. The following are considered effective means of contraception: surgical sterilization or use of oral contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial</criteria>
