	<brief_summary>Objective: To compare the effectiveness of EEG biofeedback mental attention-neuromuscular training (AT-NMT), neuromuscular training (NMT) alone, EEG biofeedback mental attention training (AT) alone, and no intervention for improving reactive balance performance among children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sample: 172 children with DCD. Interventions: AT-NMT, NMT, AT, or no intervention for 12 weeks. Major outcomes: Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. A motor control test (MCT) will give a composite latency score, prefrontal cortex EEG recordings during MCT will measure the mental attention level, and surface electromyography recordings during MCT will indicate the lower limb muscle onset latency.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The Investigators hypothesize that the reactive balance performance in children with DCD can be best improved by treating both their mental attention and neuromuscular deficits. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of AT-NMT, NMT alone, AT alone, and no intervention for improving reactive balance performance among children with DCD. Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sample: 172 children with DCD. Interventions: AT-NMT, NMT, AT, or no intervention for 12 weeks. Major outcomes: Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. A motor control test (MCT) will give a composite latency score, prefrontal cortex EEG recordings during MCT will measure the mental attention level, and surface electromyography recordings during MCT will indicate the lower limb muscle onset latency. Anticipated results and clinical significance: Children with DCD who receive AT-NMT will have the best reactive balance performance outcomes. If the results are positive, this novel training regime can be readily adopted in clinical practice. AT-NMT will improve overall well-being in these children and have positive socio-economic implications such as shorter rehabilitation periods and reduced healthcare costs.</detailed_description>
