	<brief_title>Effect of AF-219 on Cough Reflex Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 30 subjects who meet all entry criteria will be randomly assigned to AF-219 or matching placebo. There will be a Screening Period, a Baseline Visit (cough subjects only), and four Treatment Periods, with a washout period between treatments. Subjects will return after their last Treatment Visit for a Follow-up Visit. At the Screening Visit and during the Treatment Periods, cough sensitivity will be measured by standard clinical methodology incorporating two cough challenges (capsaicin and ATP). The ATP challenge will only be performed during the study treatment period. The Baseline Visit (cough subjects only) will occur prior to Treatment Period 1. Day time cough monitoring will be performed at the Baseline Visit and during each of the four Treatment Periods (cough subjects only).</detailed_description>
