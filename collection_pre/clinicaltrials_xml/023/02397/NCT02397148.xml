	<brief_summary>This study compares the morphological concordance between CT (computed tomography) and cone beam in sinus on 26 validated items. CT and cone beam is performed on each patient. Performances of these two imagery technics seem to be closed. Nevertheless, the exposure of the ionizing radiations is lower with the cone beam.</brief_summary>
