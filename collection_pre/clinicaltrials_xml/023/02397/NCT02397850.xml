	<brief_summary>There is a high risk for relapse in people suffering from depression. Studies indicate that the continuation of an acute psychotherapeutic treatment can reduce the likelihood of relapse. Therefore, this pilot study is aimed to investigate the feasibility of a continuation psychotherapy over 6 months, to support people suffering from chronic forms of depression in their daily life. The investigated continuation therapy itself includes about one telephone call per month (therapist - patient), focussing on the integration of strategies into the patient's daily routine. The patients receive either 30 minutes or 50 minutes phone calls. On the one hand, these phone calls are supported by a workbook for patients containing psychoeducative elements, strategies and exercises. On the other hand, the therapist's work is based on a manual containing several modules and strategies. Both tools (workbook, manual) are understood as a framework, using the appropriate sections according to the patient's needs. As a result, the patients receive a continuation treatment which is appropriate and adapted to their individual situation. The main purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a telephone based psychotherapeutic continuation treatment with a small sample of 20 patients suffering from chronic depression. In case of promising results the effectiveness of this kind of treatment is going to be investigated within a comparative trial (including face-to-face intervention, no intervention).</brief_summary>
