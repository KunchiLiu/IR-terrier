	<brief_summary>The aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of coronally advanced flap (CAF)+connective tissue graft(CTG)+platelet-rich fibrin(PRF) combination in Miller I and II recession treatment by comparing with CAF+CTG. 40 patients were surgically treated either with CAF+CTG+PRF (test group) or CAF+CTG (control group). Clinical parameters of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), vertical recession (VR), probing depth (PD), attachment level (AL), keratinized tissue width (KTW), horizontal recession (HR), MGJ localization (L-MGJ), tissue thickness (TT) were recorded at baseline, 3 months (PS1) and 6 months (PS2) post-surgery. Root coverage (RC), complete RC (CRC), attachment gain (AG), and keratinized tissue change (KTC) were also calculated.</brief_summary>
