	<brief_title>CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. has developed a device for heart valve replacement, the CorMatrix® ECM® Tricuspid Valve, which can be implanted to replace dysfunctional tricuspid heart valves. This Early Feasibility Study is proposed to obtain initial insights into the ability to successfully implant the Tricuspid Valve, the clinical safety of the device, and whether the device performs its intended use.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patient with a regurgitant or absent tricuspid valve including those patients having concomitant cardiac procedures 2. Patient/authorized legal guardian understands the nature of the procedure, is willing to comply with associated followup evaluations, and provides written informed consent and the pediatric patient (if applicable) provides written assent (if able) prior to procedure 3. Patient/patient's authorized legal guardian is geographically stable (or willing to return for required study followup) and understands and is willing to fulfill all of the expected requirements of this clinical protocol 1. Tricuspid annulus too small (&lt; 12mm) to accommodate the CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;= 30% 3. Mean pulmonary pressure &gt;= 50mm Hg 4. Emergency cardiac procedureor patient requires mechanical cardiac support (e.g., balloon pump, ECMO) 5. Acute myocardial infarction within 7 days of enrollment unless cardiac enzymes have returned to normal 6. Patients with a single ventricle where the CorMatrix Tricuspid Valve would be the systemic AV valve 7. Documented primary coagulopathy or platelet disorder, including thrombocytopenia (absolute platelet count &lt;60k) 8. Documented evidence of intrinsic hepatic disease (defined as liver enzyme values (AST, ALT or total bilirubin) that are &gt; 5 times the upper limit of reference range within 30 days of enrollment, except in association with acute decompensation as determined by the Investigator) 9. Documented evidence of significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt; 3.0mg/dl) or on any form of dialysis at time of screening 10. Patient with an infection treated with antibiotics &lt; 7 days prior to enrollment 11. Stroke within 90 days prior to enrollment, or a history of cerebral vascular disease with significant (&gt; 80%) extra cranial stenosis (patients with CVD history documented by a carotid Doppler study) 12. Known cancer (cancerfree &lt; 1 year; does not include nonmetastatic basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma) and/or undergoing treatment including chemotherapy and radiotherapy 13. Hematological disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia) or patients taking bone marrow suppressant drugs 14. Patients with a planned lead or wire through the CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve following implant. Note: No wires or leads should be inside the CorMatrix ECM Tricuspid Valve following implant. Alternative ways of placing leads are not exclusions (e.g. epicardial) 15. Psychiatric or behavioral disease (including drug or alcohol abuse and antisocial disorder) that is likely to impair compliance with the study protocol 16. Known sensitivity to porcine materials 17. Contraindication to anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy (ASA and/or Plavix) 18. Patients who are pregnant (method of assessment Investigator's discretion) 19. Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that would directly impact the treatment or outcome of the current study, without CorMatrix written approval</criteria>
