	<brief_title>Reference Values for Gastric Emptying</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a clinical study for establishing reference values in a 13C-octanoate breath test and a 13C-sodium acetate breath test. Healthy volunteers (n=75) will eat a solid test meal of scrambled eggs and toast containing 13C-octanoate. 13C-content of exhaled air will be measured at baseline and followed for the next 4 hours. One week later, the healthy volunteers (n=75) will drink a standardized nutritional shake (Ensure Plus Vanille, Abbott) containing 13C-sodium acetate. 13C-content of exhaled air will be measured at baseline and for the next 4 hours. Estimated gastric emptying time will be calculated using established algorithms.</detailed_description>
