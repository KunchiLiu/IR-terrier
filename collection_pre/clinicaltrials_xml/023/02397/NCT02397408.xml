	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2 study to assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline to detect and localize prostate cancer within the prostate gland in patients with unfavorable intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer (CAPRA 5-10). Secondary objectives will assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph nodes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection, to assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect the specific location of metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph node regions in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection, to determine the agreement of 11C- and 18F-choline PET imaging in the detection and localization of local and metastatic disease with other imaging techniques/methods (bone scan, CT, multiparametric 1H MRI, advanced body NaF PET/CT), and to determine the temporal distribution of 11C- and 18F-choline radiotracer in patients. The tissue uptake, retention, and clearance will be determined. An exploratory objective comparing regions of uptake from the 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR and sentinel lymph node imaging will be performed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age: Patients must be ≥18 years of age Diagnosis: Patients must have a diagnosis of prostate cancer by histologic verification and a hypoechoic lesion seen on ultrasound. Disease Status: Unfavorable intermediate to highrisk prostate Cancer (CAPRA 510) Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70 Metastatic workup: Whole Body Sodium Fluoride (NaF) PET/CT or 99mTc Bone Scan Planned to undergo radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection Adequate bone marrow and organ function defined as follows: Adequate bone marrow function: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Adequate renal function: Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it Participation would significantly delay the scheduled standard of care therapy Karnofsky performance status of &lt; 60 Inadequate venous access Administered a radioisotope within 5 physical half lives prior to study enrollment Have a medical condition or other circumstances which, in the opinion of the investigator would significantly decrease the chances of obtaining reliable data, achieving the study objectives, or completing the study.</criteria>
