	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS ) -guided fine needle aspiration (EUS -FNA ) of focal pancreatic lesions is an essential diagnostic procedure with high therapeutic effect in clinical routine. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of serum lipase, serum amylase and the tumor marker CA 19-9 prior and after EUS-FNA. In animal experiments on dogs, an increase of all three parameters was observed after surgery on the pancreas. For humans, these clinically important data are not yet available . It is assumed that the probability of pancreatitis with increased activity of lipase and amylase will rise with the number of puncture procedures as well as the size of the puncture needle. In addition, the post-interventional assessment of the tumor marker CA 19-9 could result in a false positive assumption of malignant neoplastic pancreatic lesion.</brief_summary>
