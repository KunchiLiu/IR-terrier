	<brief_title>The Impact of Pentoxifylline and Vitamin E on Radiotherapy-induced Toxicity in Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled prospective study of pentoxifylline and vitamin E given on daily basis throughout the period of concurrent chemoradiotherapy to patients with carcinoma of the head and neck. All patients will be followed up to 90 days since the first day of treatment. The incidence and severity of adverse events will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.</detailed_description>
