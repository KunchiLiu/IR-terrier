	<brief_summary>Cow's milk (CM) allergy is the most common food allergy in children, affecting 2-3% of infants. In formula-fed infants with CM allergy, extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based infant formulas are typically recommended. These formulas are expensive and not palatable. For older patients with CM allergy, the standard of care is avoidance of all CM products. The investigators cared for a CM allergic patient who was able to tolerate partially hydrolyzed whey formula (pHWF), which tastes better and is less expensive than extensively hydrolyzed or amino-acid based formulas. There are likely other subjects who could similarly tolerate pHWF. Furthermore, it is possible that taking pHWF could accelerate tolerance of CM. The investigators aim to identify characteristics of CM allergic subjects who can tolerate pHWF and assess the degree to which taking pHWF accelerates CM tolerance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specifically, subjects who have CM allergy will be enrolled. The investigators will perform an oral food challenge (OFC) to pHWF in each subject. Subjects who pass the challenge will be placed on pHWF for 2 years. Subjects who do not pass the challenge will receive routine care. The investigators will perform allergy skin testing, specific IgE measurement, other serologic assays, and longitudinal OFCs to profile subject characteristics in the two groups at baseline and over time.</detailed_description>
