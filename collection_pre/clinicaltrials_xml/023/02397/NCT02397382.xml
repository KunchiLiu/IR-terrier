	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of a single dose of 200 milligram (mg) guselkumab on the plasma concentrations of a cocktail of representative probe substrates of Cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2) in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate the Effect of a Single Dose of Guselkumab (CNTO 1959) on CYP 450 Enzyme Activities After Subcutaneous Administration in Participants With Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-center study. The total duration of study will be approximately 17 weeks per participant, including Screening phase (up to 4 weeks prior to first probe cocktail administration). Participants will have 4 in-patient periods on Day 1, 8, 15 and 36 (3 periods consisting of 3 days and 2 nights each and 1 consisting of 2 days and 1 night) followed by follow up period (up to Day 92). All Participants will receive a single 200 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection (2*100 mg) of guselkumab on Day 8 and probe cocktail on Days 1, 15 and 36. Blood samples will be collected for the evaluation of pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
