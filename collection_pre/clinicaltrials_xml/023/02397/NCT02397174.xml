	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy of reproductive-aged women that manifests itself with chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Available guidelines recommend lifestyle intervention although they do not suggest the best dietetic regimen for the treatment of PCOS. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two nutritional protocols, namely Mediterranean Diet and Hypocaloric Diet in PCOS women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mediterranean Diet Versus Hypocaloric Diet in PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive age women, that is often associated with chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. The central importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been established by several in vivo and in vitro studies. No data are available for the best therapeutical approach for metabolic dysfunction of PCOS. The new guidelines for the management of metabolic risk in PCOS strongly recommended that overweight/obese women with PCOS should lose weight changing their lifestyle. Although calorie-restricted diets are currently recommended to reach the healthy weight, there are still unsatisfied data regarding the best dietetic regimen that should be suggested. In this study, our purpose is to compare two nutritional protocols in order to find the best dietetic approach for improving clinical, metabolic and hormonal outcomes in pcos women.</detailed_description>
