	<brief_summary>200 patients with insufficient great saphenous veins will be randomized to either radiofrequency ablation or high ligation/stripping (open surgery). They will be examined according to standardized examination protocol Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), with duplex ultrasound and plethysmography pre- and postoperatively (1-month, 1-, 3 and 5 years). They are to fill questionnaires EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and disease specific Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ).</brief_summary>
