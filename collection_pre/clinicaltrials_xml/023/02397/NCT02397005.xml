	<brief_summary>The first-in-man study are designed as below to assess safety, tolerability, and preliminary pharmacokinetics of ZL-2102. - Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled ascending single oral doses (Part 1, ZL-2102-SAD); - Open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover (Part 2, ZL-2102-FED); - Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending repeated oral doses for 14 days (Part 3, ZL-2102-MAD). A total of 104 subjects will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic of ZL-2102 With an Investigation of Food Effect in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 3 parts to the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive ZL-2102 or matching placebo (3: 1 ratio) in Parts 1 and Part 3 of the study. Subjects in Part 2 will be randomized 1:1 to receive ZL-2102 in each possible treatment sequence (fed/fasted or fasted/fed). In Part 1 (ZL-2102-SAD), the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug or placebo will be tested after a single dose in the form of a capsule when given after an overnight fast. There will be 7 groups. Groups 1 to 7 will have a total of 8 participants in each group, with 56 participants total in all 7 groups. Each group will receive a different dose of the study drug or placebo in the following order of strength: 5, 20, 60, 150, 300, 500, 750 mg. Plasma samples will be collected in 0H,0H30M,1H,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,8H,10H,12H,16H,24H,48H and on Day 8. Urine samples will be collected at 0-4,4-8,8-12,12-24,24-28H intervals. Subjects will be confined to the unit for 3 days and the follow-up observation period is 7 days after the administration. Part 2 of the study (ZL-2102-FED) will test the effect of a high-fat meal on safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug after a single dose in 12 healthy male subjects. Choice of dose of ZL-2102 will be made based on review of the blinded preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics data in Part 1. No subjects will receive placebo in Part 2. Two single doses separated by at least a 7-day wash-out period. One dose will be given under fed (standardized high-fat breakfast) and one will be under fasted conditions. Part 3 of the study (ZL-2102-MAD) will test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug after repeated doses of the study drug. Three dose level groups (9 active and 3 placebo) with 12 healthy male subjects will be enrolled.Choice of the actual daily ZL-2102 doses will be made based upon a review of the blinded preliminary safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics data in Part 1. Three ascending once-daily repeated doses of ZL-2102 or placebo for 14 days or, alternatively, twice daily for 14 days if indicated by pharmacokinetics parameters from Part 1 (ZL-2102-SAD). If the dose needs to be twice daily, the total daily doses will be given half in the morning and half in the evening 12 hours later. Dose will be administered either under fed or fasted conditions depending on blinded Part 2 (ZL-2102-FED) results. The trial will be conducted in Linear Clinical Research Ltd.by Principle Investigator Janakan Krishnarajah,MD and his team.</detailed_description>
