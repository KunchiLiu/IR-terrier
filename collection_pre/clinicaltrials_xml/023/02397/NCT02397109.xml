	<brief_summary>The dysthyroid orbitopathy (DO) is a chronic disease, evolving during 2 to 3 years, with a hypertrophy and a variable degree of inflammation of the eyelid muscles, the oculomotor muscles and the orbital fat. If the diagnosis of OD is primarily clinical and laboratory, MRI is an additional contribution to the clinic, guiding the therapeutic management by detecting inflammatory lesions not found on clinical examination in 1/3 of cases. The three MRI sequences conventionally practiced ((T2, T2-fat-sat, T1) allow muscles signal analysis oculomotor abnormalities as well as the orbital fat. Compared to these sequences, the main advantage sequences DIXON is a faster acquisition. In addition, DIXON type of imaging overcomes most of these artifacts and to obtain a homogeneous fat removal.</brief_summary>
