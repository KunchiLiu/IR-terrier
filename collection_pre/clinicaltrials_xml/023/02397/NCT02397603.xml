	<brief_title>Peri-neural Dexmedetomidine as an Adjuvant to Bupivacaine Induced Paravertebral Block in Patients Undergonig Thoracotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracotomy is associated with severe postoperative pain that could be reduced with an aggressive analgesic therapy in the early postoperative period. The use of thoracic paravertebral block is an effective analgesic approach for post-thoracotomy pain. Several local anesthetic adjuvants have been reported to extend the duration of paravertebral block. Alpha-2 agonists including dexmedetomidine appear to be the most effective in this context. The study will include an intervention group which will receive a combination of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% and dexmedetomidine 0.5 ml (50 microgram). The control group will receive 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus 0.5 ml normal saline perineurally. Thoracic paravertebral catheter will be inserted preoperatively. Visual analogue pain score will be assessed at different intervals.</detailed_description>
