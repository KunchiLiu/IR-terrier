	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a switch to MK-1439A (MK-1439 [doravirine] plus lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in HIV-1-infected participants virologically suppressed on a protocol-specified antiretroviral regimen. The primary hypothesis is that a switch to MK-1439A will be non-inferior to continuation of the regimen at Screening for 24 weeks, as assessed by the proportion of participants maintaining HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL. The Base Study will last up to 50 weeks. An optional Extension Study will evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the switch to MK-1439A for an additional 2 years.</brief_summary>
