	<brief_summary>The specific aim of the proposed study is to address the efficacy of conventional full-fat dairy products as part of the normal routine diet for improving vascular function and reducing blood pressure in middle-aged and older adults with elevated blood pressure. The investigators hypothesize that dietary intervention including whole milk and full-fat milk products will induce significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness. The investigators also test the hypothesis that the reductions in blood pressure will be associated with the corresponding decreases in arterial stiffness and/or increases in endothelial vasodilatory function as well as improvements in arterial baroreflex sensitivity. If our hypotheses are supported by the results, the information could be used as a basis for recommendations for the use of whole milk and full-fat milk products in the secondary prevention of elevated blood pressure and vascular dysfunction.</brief_summary>
