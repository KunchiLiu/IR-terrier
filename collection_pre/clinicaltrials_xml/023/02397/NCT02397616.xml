	<brief_title>Effects of Position and a Test Meal on Esophago-gastric Junction Morphology and Function Assessed by High-resolution Impedance Manometry (HRM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will retrospectively analyze all patients referred to hour unit for high-resolution esophageal manometry. These patients have been tested using liquid swallows and a test meal. We will analyze the HRM measurements for presence of manometric signs of hiatal hernia and determine predictive factors for hernia presence. We will correlate hernia description versus presence of acid reflux, clinical complaints and HRM measurements.</detailed_description>
