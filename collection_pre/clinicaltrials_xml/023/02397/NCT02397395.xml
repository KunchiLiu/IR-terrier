	<brief_title>An Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of 12 Weeks Treatment With Simeprevir and Daclatasvir in Participants With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1b or 4 Infection and Either Severe Renal Impairment or End-stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital work on a medical research study) study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 12 weeks treatment with Simeprevir (SMV) and Daclatasvir (DCV) in participants with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b or 4 infection and either severe renal impairment or End-stage Renal Disease on hemodialysis. The study consists of a Screening Phase of 4 weeks, an Open-label Treatment Phase of 12 weeks, and a post-Treatment Follow-up Phase of 24 weeks. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 40 weeks. All participants will receive a treatment regimen consisting of SMV 150 mg and DCV 60 mg co-administered once daily for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks. Participants who experience inadequate virologic response at Week 8 (defined as confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to [&gt;=] lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) or viral breakthrough at any on-treatment visit (defined as confirmed increase in HCV RNA of &gt;1 log base 10 from nadir, or confirmed HCV RNA &gt;100 International unit per milliliter [IU/mL] in participants whose HCV RNA had previously been &lt;LLOQ while on treatment) should discontinue all study drugs. Participants will be primarily evaluated for sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the actual end of study treatment (SVR12). Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the study duration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Man or woman, between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive, at screening Hepatitis C Virus (HCV genotype): HCV genotype 1b or 4 (determined at screening) Plasma HCV RNA: Greater than (&gt;) 10,000 international unit per milliliter (IU/mL) (determined at screening) HCV disease status: FibroScan less than (&lt;) 14.5 kilopascal (kPa), performed within 3 months prior to screening, or between screening and baseline (Day 1), and no history or signs or symptoms of decompensated liver disease. In participants with FibroScan &gt;12.5 kPa, absence of findings suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma documented by an abdominal ultrasound, performed within 3 months prior to screening, or between screening and baseline (Day 1) HCV treatment history: HCV treatmentnaive participants, defined as never having received HCV treatment with any approved or investigational drug (including vaccines); OR HCV treatmentexperienced, defined as having received previous HCV treatment with any (pegylated) interferon ([Peg]IFN)based drug regimen (with or without ribavirin [RBV] and not including a directacting antiviral agent [DAA]). Last dose in this previous HCV treatment course should have occurred at least 2 months prior to screening Infection/coinfection: HCV genotype other than 1b or 4, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 Liver disease of nonHCV etiology: Any evidence of liver disease of nonHCV etiology. This includes, but is not limited to, acute hepatitis A, hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen positive), drug or alcoholrelated liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or any other nonHCV liver disease considered clinically significant by the investigator Hepatic decompensation: History or evidence of clinical hepatic decompensation (presence of ascites, bleeding varices or hepatic encephalopathy) Organ transplantation/renal replacement therapy: Prior organ transplant (other than cornea, hair transplant or skin graft), except for history of kidney transplant with subsequent renal failure requiring hemodialysis and for which use of immunosuppressants has been discontinued; Considered for kidney transplant or imminent renal replacement therapy (including intermittent hemodialysis; continuous hemofiltration and hemodialysis; and peritoneal dialysis) for participants with severe renal impairment within a time frame that overlaps with study participation Key protocol defined laboratory abnormalities</criteria>
