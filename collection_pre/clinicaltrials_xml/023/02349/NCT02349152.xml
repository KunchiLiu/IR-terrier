	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of using remifentanil during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery to supress the hyperglycemic response in perioperative period. Half of the participants will receive continuous intravenous remifentanil during surgery, while the other half will receive intermittent intravenous fentanyl during surgery. Intermittent intravenous fentanyl administration is this institution's standard of care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stress-induced hyperglycemia is a well-known phenomena that occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Hyperglycemia increases the incidence of major adverse events and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Remifentanil, an ultra-short acting opioid analgesic, has been shown to reduce the stress response to cardiopulmonary bypass when compared to intermittent fentanyl and inhalation anesthesia. This in turn, will reduce the occurence of perioperative hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and insulin requirements in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
