	<brief_summary>In an ageing population, the need for interventions to help older people remain healthy, active and independent for as long as possible, increases. Although several studies suggest a beneficial effect of vitamin D3 on maintaining or improving muscle strength and physical functioning, particularly in vulnerable populations, results are contradicting. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to further establish the effect of vitamin D on muscle strength in the frail elderly population.The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of daily supplementation with two different forms of vitamin D on muscle strength in frail elderly people over a period of 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>25(OH)D levels 2050 nmol/L. age 65 or older. physically frail (prefrail or frail, based on the criteria designed by Fried et al.) (30). Frailty will be defined as a clinical syndrome in which one or more of the following criteria are present: unintentional weight loss (4.5 kg in past year), selfreported exhaustion (CESD questionnaire), weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed and low physical activity (Minnesota questionnaire). More details on these criteria are described in chapter 6.3.2. body mass index between 18.5 and 35 kg/m2. willingness and ability to comply with the protocol, including performance of the knee extension strength test. Medical Illness: malabsorption syndrome: known intestinal malabsorption, celiac diseases, inflammatory bowel disease; diseases that may enhance serum calcium concentration: sarcoidosis, lymphoma, kidney stone in the last 10 years, primary hyperparathyroidism; abnormal indices of calcium metabolism, uncontrolled hypocalcaemia; diagnosed renal insufficiency; diagnosed cancer; currently diagnosed or undergoing treatment. Hypercalcemia: serum calcium adjusted for albumin of &gt; 2.6 nmol/L. Medication: interfering with vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D supplementation (bisphosphonate, PTH treatment, tuberculostatica, antiepileptica). Subject not able (when medically necessary/ advised) or not willing to stop the use of vitamin D containing supplements during the study. (Expected) increase in exposure to sunlight (e.g. travelling to a sunny resort) during intervention period. Patient heavily consumes alcohol containing products defined as greater than &gt; 21 drinks of alcoholic beverages per week. Planned surgery which can affect study measures (taking into account duration of hospitalisation and recovery). Participation in another clinical trial.</criteria>
