	<brief_summary>1:1 active treatment: placebo, blinded trial, evaluating the effect of a 4-week treatment period with topical C-82 on skin expression of two gene biomarker surrogates (THBS1 and COMP) for the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS). Study subjects will be randomized to apply the active study medication daily for 4 weeks to either the right or left forearm and placebo to the contralateral forearm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Topical C-82 in Systemic Sclerosis - A Phase I/II Biomarker and Safety Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1:1 active treatment: placebo, blinded trial, evaluating the effect of a 4-week treatment period with topical C-82 on skin expression of two gene biomarker surrogates (THBS1 and COMP) for the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS). Study subjects will be randomized to apply the study medication daily for 4 weeks to either the right or left forearm. All subjects will apply placebo (i.e., a topical gel without C-82) to the contralateral forearm. Both physician and subject will be blinded to treatment arm assignment. Skin biopsies will be taken from the mid-forearm of both arms at baseline and after four weeks of study drug to test for biomarker gene expression; instructions and supplies will be provided to each site. Safety assessments will extend to 4 weeks after the final dose of study drug/placebo.</detailed_description>
