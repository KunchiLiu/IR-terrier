	<brief_title>A Clinical Research of CAR T Cells Targeting CEA Positive Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have demonstrated great successes in treating even late stage cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) positive B cell malignancies. But it has not yet been fully explored in solid tumors. The carcino-embryonic antigen(CEA) is widely expressed in cancers like gastric cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. To confirm if CAR T cells still function in solid tumors, we have developed anti-CEA CAR-modified T cells. Preclinical studies have demonstrated effective killing of CEA target cells. In this study, the CEA CARs, will be evaluated in CEA positive gastric cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer patients. The primary goal is to confirm its adverse effects including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.</detailed_description>
