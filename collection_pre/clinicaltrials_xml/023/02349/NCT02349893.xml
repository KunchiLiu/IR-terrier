	<brief_summary>The United States is currently experiencing an increase in the incidence and prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). With prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2 to 4% of the population, untreated OSA has been implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure, daytime sleepiness, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. This study was design in order to evaluate the CelonProSleep plus for multi-level radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the palate and base of tongue as a treatment for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).</brief_summary>
