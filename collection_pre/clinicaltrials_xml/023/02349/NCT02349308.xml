	<brief_title>Post Marketing Surveillance of the CentrosFLO™ Tunneled IJ Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CentrosFLO™ Tunneled Dialysis Catheter is a 15F dual-lumen, double-D shaped catheter similar to other "split tip" catheters in the market: outflow ("arterial") and return ("venous") lumens that separate, a subcutaneous Dacron® cuff, extension sets with clamps and caps, and construction from Carbothane® material. The CentrosFLO™ catheter contains two small pressure-relief holes near the tips. The main difference of the CentrosFLO catheter is in the design of the tip. Current "split tip" catheters have two free ends that diverge, but are each essentially straight segments. In the CentrosFLO catheter the arterial lumen bends in an arc back towards the venous lumen, and the venous lumen bends towards the arterial lumen. As a result, the catheter has two curved surfaces that will rest against the vena cava wall to automatically "center" the catheter within the vein. The contact points of the catheter against the vena cava wall should be smaller and more disperse than with current straight-tip or split catheters. The following drawing demonstrates the design of the catheter, showing the current recommendation that the arterial port always be to the left. The goal of the study is to demonstrate the stability of blood flow with the CentrosFLO catheter, during intermittent dialysis over a period of 6 months after placement. The investigators plan to enroll 10 patients in the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients who are initiating or continuing incenter intermittent hemodialysis who are scheduled to receive a tunneled dialysis catheter in the right or left internal jugular vein The patients may have had a prior tunneled catheter for dialysis in the right IJ site. Patients will be expected to need use of the catheter for more than 45 days Patients in whom the catheter is planned to be placed into the same site as an existing catheter, by overthewire catheter exchange Patients unable to give informed consent</criteria>
