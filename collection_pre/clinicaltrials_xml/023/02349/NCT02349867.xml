	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 study of concurrent chemoradiation using a regimen of sorafenib and vorinostat with gemcitabine and radiation following chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer to find the RP2D of the concurrent chemoradiation combination. A traditional 3+3 dose-escalation design will be conducted for the sorafenib and vorinostat dose escalation. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas without distant metastasis that has been treated with ≥ 1 prior therapy (not including radiation) encompassing at least 2 months. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Ability to take oral medication. To determine the doses and schedule appropriate for phase 2 study of sorafenib and vorinostat with concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer following chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiation With Gemcitabine, Sorafenib and Vorinostat in Resectable, Borderline Resectable or Unresectable Non-metastatic Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the doses and schedule appropriate for phase 2 study of sorafenib and vorinostat with concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer following chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiation using a regimen of sorafenib, vorinostat, gemcitabine, and RT following chemotherapy. II. To observe the antitumor effects of this regimen. III. To evaluate the percentage of patients able to undergo resection after neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation). IV. To calculate the R0 (complete removal of all tumor) resection rate following chemoradiation. V. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). VI. To evaluate overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility of analyzing pancreatic patient circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for enumeration and caspase 3 cleavage before and after concurrent chemoradiation. II. To characterize pancreatic tumors (when sufficient tissue samples are available) for expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)95, myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)1, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) by evaluating archived tumor tissue from diagnostic biopsies and comparing this to tissue obtained at the time of resection after chemoradiation. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation trial employing a standard "3+3" schema of sorafenib and vorinostat. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2-3 months up to 2 years or until death.</detailed_description>
