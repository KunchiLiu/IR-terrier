	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M PET/CT with that of [111In]-capromab pendetide as an immuno PET tracer in the detection of prostate cancer pre-prostatectomy as confirmed by pathology. Individuals participating in this study will have a [111In]-capromab pendetide scan, as well as a PET scan following the injection of [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of PET With [89Zr]-Df-IAb2M and [111In]-Capromab Pendetide in the Detection of Prostate Cancer Pre-Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IAB2M is an approximately 80 kDA molecular weight antibody fragment (a "Minibody") chelated with Desferroxamine and radiolabeled with 89Zr. [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M targets the extracellular domain of Prostate Membrane Specific Antigen (PSMA) expressed on most primary and metastatic prostate cancer lesions. [111In]-capromab pendetide (Prostascint®) is an FDA approved imaging agent targeting the intracellular domain of PSMA. It is anticipated that [89Zr]-Df-IAB2M will outperform Prostascint® because of this targeting difference.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet ALL criteria listed below for entry: Age ≥ 18 years Signed, written IRBapproved informed consent Patients newly diagnosed with biopsyproven prostate cancer, thought to be a candidate for prostatectomy after standard diagnostic evaluation (e.g. chest xray, CT scan or MRI) who are at highrisk for pelvic lymph node metastases. High Risk defined as: Gleason score ≥ 8 or Gleason 4+3 with a PSA &gt; 10 or PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL or T3a Patients scheduled for a [111In]capromab pendetide scan or had a recent [111In]capromab pendetide scan within 28 days of screening visit or would be willing to undergo a [111In]capromab pendetide scan Karnofsky Performance status of ≥ 60 Life expectancy of at least 6 months Patients with any previous history of another malignancy (other than insitu cancer, basal or squamous cell skin cancer) must be disease free for a period of three years. Acceptable liver function: Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal or &lt;3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal (if liver metastases are present, then ≤ 5 x ULN is allowed) Acceptable renal function: Serum creatinine within normal limits, OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Acceptable hematologic status: Granulocyte ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 150,000 (plt/mm3) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL For men of childproducing potential, the use of effective contraceptive methods during the study Patients will be excluded from entry if ANY of the criteria listed below are met: New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months Unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on ECG Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy Treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy for prostate cancer. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C Serious nonmalignant disease (eg, hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the investigator and/or the sponsor Previous [111In]capromab pendetide image test</criteria>
