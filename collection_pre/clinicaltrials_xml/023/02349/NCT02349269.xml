	<detailed_description>The material of this retrospective study consist patients without preoperative history of atrial fibrillation, participated in three different randomized controlled trials previously . A total of 519 consecutive patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, aortic valve replacement or combined aortic valve with coronary bypass surgery in Kuopio University Hospital from 2004 to 2008.
