	<detailed_description>Primary prevention of intimate partner violence among young men and women requires an intervention which addresses the underlying driving factors of such violence operating at different ecological levels.That is, interventions need to address factors impacting directly on youth and their family relationships, school as an institutional setting. In the school, holistic interventions strengthen the curriculum and teaching, but also the broader environment of learning, including addressing positive discipline and the culture of the school. In order to prevent violence, interventions need to build gender equality, challenge the normative use of violence in schools and homes (e.g., corporal punishment), strengthen teen-adult relationships and communication, and build negotiation and conflict resolution skills, as well as addressing stress and coping. A three-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial based in high schools in Gauteng, South Africa is evaluating such a multi-faceted primary prevention intervention. This intervention includes school strengthening components for learners and educators, which includes providing a teaching materials for the grade 8 life orientation (LO) curriculum (which covers gender and violence), training teachers in LO teaching, training staff on positive discipline and establishing learner clubs. A second intervention seeks to strengthen families and is a workshop based intervention delivered over 4 day long sessions for a parent or caregiver and their grade 8 adolescent. The intervention is being evaluated in a three arm randomised controlled trial, with school-level randomisation involving 24 schools. One is a delayed intervention control arm, two arms have the school strengthening intervention and one arm additionally have the family strengthening intervention. The outcomes will be addressed using qualitative and quantitative methods with data collected from Grade 8 learners (the primary outcome group), school educators and administrators, and parents/caregivers of Grade 8s. These measures will be conducted pre-intervention and at 6, 12, and 18 month follow up periods. In addition, an economic costing evaluation will be conducted.</detailed_description>
