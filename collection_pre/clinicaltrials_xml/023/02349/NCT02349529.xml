	<brief_summary>Children and young people with epilepsy are at increased risk of poorer outcomes related to emotional and psychological adjustment, peer relationship problems, lower academic attainment and mental health problems across the lifespan. Despite the well understood risks, there continues to be a lack of psychological and psychosocial support for young people with epilepsy, and a corresponding lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions. This study aims to evaluate a manualised psychosocial group intervention for adolescents with epilepsy. A cognitive behaviour therapy approach is used, aimed at increasing awareness of how epilepsy may impact upon thoughts, feelings and activities and to develop strategies for improved psychological adjustment. In addition, an epilepsy knowledge component aimed at improving a sense of control and epilepsy self-management is included. A group delivery format allows an opportunity for social modelling, and social problem solving, helping others and relating to other young people with similar experiences. The social learning context and availability of knowledgable facilitators (an epilepsy nurse specialist and clinical psychologist) are also key aspects of the intervention. The study will allow us to establish a standard manualised group intervention that can be used throughout the UK which aims to余 establish the effectiveness and desirability of this approach余 improve the overall quality of life, psychological health and social integration of young people with epilepsy余 and to improve epilepsy knowledge and selfmanagement skills aimed at maximising seizure control and overall management.</brief_summary>
