	<brief_summary>Subjects were randomized into 3 treatment groups (15 subjects per group): 1) Control - received no treatment 2) Placebo - received a sham Astym速 treatment 3) Astym速 Treatment - received Astym速 treatment to the lower extremity. Subjects were blinded to whether they received the Astym速 treatment or placebo treatment intervention. After a 5-minute warm-up on a lower body ergometer the subjects were familiarized to the operations of a computerized leg press machine that measured the maximum force output (Newtons) during a unilateral isometric squat test. A baseline measure of maximal force output (pre-test) was determined by the average of 3 trials with a 30 second rest period between the trials. The subjects then received the designated treatment intervention. Immediately following the treatment intervention (0 minutes following treatment intervention) the subjects were retested (post-test) using identical testing procedures by an investigator blinded to the treatment intervention received by the subject. Maximum force output measured in Newtons for the post-test was subtracted from the maximum force output (Newtons) pre-test and then converted to a percentage of change [(post-test - pretest)/pretest X 100). The percent change of maximal force output from pre-test to post-test measures was compared using a one-way analysis of variance with alpha set at 0.05. A Tukey's post-hoc analysis determined statistical differences between the groups.</brief_summary>
