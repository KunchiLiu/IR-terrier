	<brief_title>Somatoform Disorder in British South Asians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"Somatoform" or "functional" syndromes are those that present with physical symptoms, not explained by well-recognized medical illness. Such symptoms are common in all settings and studies have reported that they accounted for one-fifth of all new presentations in primary care. Literature suggests that they are associated with significant levels of psychological distress, disability, impairments in quality of life and high levels of healthcare utilization. Research also suggests that medically unexplained symptoms cause similar (or higher) levels of disability than medically explained symptoms in primary care settings. There have been a number of studies that have looked at the cognitive and behavioural basis of somatisation, and treatment strategies have been trialed based upon a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-led approach for these patients. In British South Asian patients the difficulties in managing this condition are further compounded as culture can have an important role in shaping the experience, interpretation &amp; clinical presentation of emotional distress. Patel reported that GPs found it very challenging to manage South Asian patients with chronic pain due to the way they present with pain, and a greater likelihood of psychosomatic presentations. Language differences as well as cultural differences contributed to the challenges, especially among first- generation South Asians. Further, they felt that self-management strategies were difficult to address. The author concludes by saying 'cultural influences play an important role in the consultation process where patients' behaviour is often bound in their cultural view of health care. (South Asian) patients' presentation of their condition makes diagnosis difficult but can also lead to miscommunication'.</detailed_description>
