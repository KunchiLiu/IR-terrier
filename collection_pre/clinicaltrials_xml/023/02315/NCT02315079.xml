	<brief_summary>To evaluate the use of a point of care device to measure markers of inflammation in various eye conditions. In particular, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) will be measured. MMP-9 is an enzyme that plays a role in inflammation. The value obtained with the point of care device will be correlated with values obtained using gel electrophoresis to measure MMP-9 from the same sample. These data will be compared to clinical exam findings and questionnaires to help the investigators better understand the role of this marker of inflammation in eye diseases and possibly improve diagnostic abilities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Point of Care Testing of Inflammatory Markers in Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a participant in the study a sample of tears will be collected in a non-invasive manner by sitting comfortably at the slit lamp (a slit lamp is the standard device used to examine the eye and merely requires the participant to sit upright and place their chin on a chin rest and their forehead up against the slit lamp apparatus). The participant will then be asked to look upwards and while gently lowering the lower eyelid, a sterile blunt glass pipette will be used to collect tears from the natural tear lake (the tear lake is a reservoir of tears that sits on the surface of the eye and above the lower eyelid). Collected tears will then be taken for analysis of inflammatory markers. In addition, a survey to evaluate the symptoms and the symptoms impact daily life (Ocular Surface Disability Index Survey of National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire- 25).</detailed_description>
