	<brief_summary>The proposed study is designed to evaluate (i) the effects of saxagliptin, with or without acarbose, on gastric emptying, postprandial glycaemia, and plasma intact GLP-1, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon after a high carbohydrate meal, and (ii) whether the magnitude of the effects of saxagliptin and/or acarbose is related to the rate of gastric emptying, in patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
