	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify potential markers for curve progression in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Despite its prevalence and impact on child health, the etiology of AIS and molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain poorly understood. Clinical criteria and features cannot adequately predict which children, diagnosed with mild disease, will undergo subsequent curve progression requiring intervention. The investigators hypothesize that alterations in specific genetic markers will be correlated with the progression of AIS curves over time. Thus, these markers could be used in the future to develop a reliable, inexpensive and relatively non-invasive cell based diagnostic test to (1) predict spinal curve progression in AIS, (2) select patients likely to benefit from early surgical intervention, and (3) potentially screen for asymptomatic children at risk of developing idiopathic scoliosis.</brief_summary>
