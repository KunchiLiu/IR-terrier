	<detailed_description>NA-1 is being developed as an emergency drug aimed at reducing global disability in patients with acute cerebral ischemia if administered early after symptom onset. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of NA-1 in reducing global disability in patients with acute stroke. The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of NA-1 in reducing functional dependence, improving neurological outcome, increasing the proportion of subjects whose symptoms fully return to baseline function within 24 hours of symptom onset, and improving activities of daily living.The leading safety objectives are to determine the effect of administering a target dose of 2.60 mg/kg IV infusion of NA-1 early after symptom onset by paramedics in the field on serious adverse events and 90-day mortality. This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study initiated prehospital in the ambulance. It is being conducted using the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) of Toronto and Peel Region, ON and Vancouver, BC, Canada. Subjects with suspected acute stroke will be identified in the field by trained paramedics using the approved stroke protocol in use by the local EMS system, and further screened for eligibility and approval by an on-call trial physician. The paramedics will administer the study drug. Upon arrival at the emergency department, subjects will receive standard-of-care. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that administration of NA-1 will result in a lower proportion of subjects with global disability at Day 90 as assessed by the Modified Rankin Scale. An independent, central adjudication committee will be responsible for arriving at a final diagnosis of acute cerebral ischemia versus an alternate diagnosis. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will perform safety reviews of the clinical data.</detailed_description>
