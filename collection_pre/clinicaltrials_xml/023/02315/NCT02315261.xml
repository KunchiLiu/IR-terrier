	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Epidural Anesthesia for Thoracic and Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidural analgesia is the recommended perioperative analgesia in patients having major surgery in order to significantly reduced pain scores, minimize patient distress and can accelerate postoperative recovery especially with the major operation This technique has been reported to provide better pain control and less postoperative fatigue compared with patients receiving general anesthesia alone.Additionally, it is recommended in patients having major surgery to allow patients to mobilize quickly and have effective mobilization.This technique has been shown to be highly efficient at preventing postoperative ileus and various complications. Moreover, epidural analgesic technique is demonstrated to be safer and have fewer side effects than using intravenous opioids alone. However, the epidural technique is not universally successful and the number of patients experiencing inadequate analgesia with this technique is approximately 12-32%. The failure of epidural analgesia is still a frequent clinical problem and needs active management including a new block or other analgesic medication in order to rescue postoperative pain. Previous study showed that the incidence of patients having epidural analgesia with postoperative moderate pain was 20.9% and that with severe pain was 7.8%. In Siriraj Hospital, recent study showed that 19.6% of patients having elective upper abdominal surgery under general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia reported severe first pain scores in post anesthetic care unit.27 As a result of severe pain, patients needed a number of intervention and management from acute pain service, and finally spent longer time in post anesthetic care unit. Inadequate pain control in patients receiving epidural analgesia frequently occurred in clinical practice but the number of the success rate or the failure rate have not been reported in our hospital. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the epidural analgesia in patients having elective thoracic and abdominal surgery under general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia in Siriraj Hospital.</detailed_description>
