	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation has shown promising results in stroke patients. This study is a double blind, sham-controlled clinical trial aiming to compare the long-term effects of stimulation in two different cognitive regions after a stroke. Sixty patients who suffer from chronic strokes will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulo-opercular network and motor primary cortex (control). Each group will receive transcranial direct current stimulation for 20 minutes for 10 consecutive working days (2 weeks). Patients will be assessed with a Dysexecutive Questionnaire, Semantic Fluency test, categorical verbal fluency and Go-no go tests, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, Letter Comparison and Pattern Comparison Tasks at baseline, after their tenth stimulation session (week 2) and endpoint (week 4). Those who achieve clinical improvement with neurostimulation will be invited to receive treatment for 12 months as part of a follow-up study.</brief_summary>
