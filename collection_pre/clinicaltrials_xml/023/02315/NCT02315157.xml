	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify a maximum tolerated dose of bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) in patients with multiple myeloma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety of escalating doses of bendamustine in patients with multiple myeloma. II. To describe the response after bendamustine OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60-180 minutes on days 1 and 2.</detailed_description>
