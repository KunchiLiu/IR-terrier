	<brief_title>Evaluating Possible Improvement in Tinnitus Severity After 28 Days Dosing of the Study Drug AUT00063 Compared to Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced activity at certain sites in the brain (called "voltage-gated potassium channels") has been linked to hearing problems, like age-related loss of hearing or tinnitus (a 'ringing' or buzzing noise in the ears). AUT00063 is an experimental new medicine that has been developed to improve the action of these specific channels and so treat the brain component of these hearing problems. The main purpose of this study is to try to demonstrate an improvement in the severity of tinnitus after 4 weeks of treatment with the study medicine or the placebo (dummy drug which does not contain the medication). Subjects will undergo a safety follow-up after the treatment period. Safety and efficacy will be determined by looking at a number of assessments (physical examinations, blood sampling, hearing assessments, questionnaires, etc.) and in case of any serious medical event during the study. The amount of drug in the blood will also be measured. It is expected that up to 152 people with tinnitus may take part in the study. The study participants will be recruited at around 16 Hospital sites in the UK.</detailed_description>
