	<brief_summary>The study compares anatomic outcomes of Intra Ocular Lens(IOL) placement with two methods of centration of the capsulorhexis- scanned capsule centration and pupil centration. It is hypothesized that scanned capsule centration provides more uniform(25% better) overlap of capsulorhexis margin over IOL optic compared to pupil centration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Centration of Intraocular Lens With Two Settings for Capsulorhexis With Femtosecond Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 consecutive eyes undergoing cataract surgery will be studied. 25 eyes will have scanned capsule centration and 25 will have pupil centration. Retroillumination slitlamp photographs will be taken 10-30 days after surgery with dilated pupils. The amount of capsule overlapping the IOL will be documented. The horizontal, vertical and symmetricity of overlap will be calculated. Each group will have 20 eyes with an additional 5 eyes in each group to account for drop outs or poor quality images.</detailed_description>
