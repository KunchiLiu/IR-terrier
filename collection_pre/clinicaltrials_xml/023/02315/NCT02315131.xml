	<criteria>Stage 1 Inclusion Criteria (healthy volunteers): The subject is a male or female 20 to 75 years of age, inclusive, weighing 50 to 80 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 kg/m2. Note: Every effort should be made to enroll approximately equal numbers of men and women in each group. The subject is in good health as determined by medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information Stage 2 Inclusion Criteria (COPD patients): Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of ≥10 pack years at the SV (number of cigarette packs smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked; eg, 2 packs/day for 3 years equals a 6 pack year history). Diagnosis of COPD as defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. Male or female; 40 to 75 years of age, inclusive. Patient is free of any other medical conditions or concomitant treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the study. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information Stage 1 Exclusion Criteria (healthy volunteers): History or current evidence of a clinically significant or uncontrolled disease. Any disorder that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drugs. History of severe allergy to milk protein. Active smokers or former smokers who quit within 3 months of the first dose of study drug. Former smokers with greater than fivepack years (ie, the equivalent of one pack per day for five years) are also excluded. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information Stage 2 Exclusion Criteria (COPD patients): Recent history of hospitalization due to an exacerbation of airway disease within 3 months. Need for increased treatments of COPD within 6 weeks prior to the SV. Occurrence of a COPD exacerbation, which is not resolved by 4 weeks or more prior to the SV/informed consent. (Note: An exacerbation of COPD is defined as any worsening of the patient's baseline COPD symptoms requiring any treatment other than rescue albuterol or the patient's regular maintenance therapy. This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and/or emergency room visit or hospitalization.) History of and/or current diagnosis of asthma. Known α1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis or pneumonia), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. A patient who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other significant respiratory condition in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples may include clinically significant noncystic bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease. Allergic rhinitis is not exclusionary. Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
