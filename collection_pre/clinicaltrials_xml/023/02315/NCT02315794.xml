	<brief_summary>Different studies have proposed the use of zirconia abutments to improve the aesthetic outcomes in the anterior sextant, however the results have been inconclusive. A tendency towards a better aesthetic result with the use of zirconia instead of titanium abutments was observed, although more technical complications were also recorded.The use of zirconia abutments in the anterior maxillary region showed a tendency towards better matching, although differences were not significant. In addition, with these abutments more technical complications were observed, what increased the cost and time. More studies with larger samples and longer observations periods are needed to recommend the use of zirconia abutments for this clinical situation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aesthetic Outcomes of Single Tooth Implant Using Metal Ceramic Restorations With Either Zirconia or Titanium Abutments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and aesthetic outcomes of single tooth implant restorations, where different abutment materials were used (zirconia vs titanium) associated with metal-ceramic crowns. The evaluation was carried out by means of an aesthetic composite index combined with patient evaluation</detailed_description>
