	<brief_title>The Peripheral Mobilized Mononuclear Cell-based Therapy in Patient With Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic painful neuropathy a prevalent, disabling disorder. Currently, the only effective treatments are glucose control and pain management. Diabetic neuropathy is characterized by reduction of vascularity in peripheral nerves and deficiency in neurotrophic and angiogenic factors. Recent studies have shown that bone marrow (BM)-derived stem or progenitor cells have favorable effects on the repair of cardiovascular diseases. Since these BM-derived stem or progenitor cells contain various angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, these cells have been attempted for treating experimental diabetic neuropathy, and turned out to be effective for reversing various manifestations of experimental diabetic neuropathy. However, stem-cell therapy was not proven in human study. Therefore, we will investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous peripheral blood stem cell injection in diabetic neuropathy.</detailed_description>
