	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that has effects on both movement and mental health. One of the most common mental health complications of PD is depression. Up to 30% of Parkinson's patients will experience depression at some point. We aim to investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a type of electrical stimulation for the brain, can improve depression in PD as well as improve motor function in PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS in Parkinson's Disease With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this double-blind, randomized control design study is to investigate the efficacy of 15-sessions of tDCS (versus 15-sessions of sham tDCS) to treat depression in PD. We will also assess dopamine function in a smaller cohort of participants before and after their 15 sessions of tDCS by using PET scanning.</detailed_description>
