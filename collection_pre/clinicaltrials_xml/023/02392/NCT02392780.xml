	<brief_summary>Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major obstacle to successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic ingredient of Cannabis sativa possesses potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. In a recent phase 2 study, CBD has been shown to be safe and reduced significantly the incidence of acute GVHD compared to control patients with a hazard ratio of 0.3. Based on these results the investigators propose a phase 2 study to explore the efficacy of oral CBD in the treatment of severe (grades III/IV) acute GVHD, a pathology with a dismal prognosis.</brief_summary>
