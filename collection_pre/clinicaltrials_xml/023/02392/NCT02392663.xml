	<brief_summary>This study aims to analyze whether the hypertonic saline nebulization enhances sputum clearance effects, reduces the impact on cough severity and their level of safety and tolerability in a population with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE). In addition, this trial aims to compare these health outcomes among 3 nebulized solutions: hypertonic saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline (0,9%).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sputum Clearance Effects of Hypertonic Saline in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study will be a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Each nebulized solution [hypertonic saline (7%); hyaluronic acid + hypertonic saline (7%); isotonic saline (0,9%)] will be administrated during 4 days. After each inhalation, all patients will carry out a bronchial drainage session (autogenic drainage technique). All patients recruited will perform the three arms of intervention. In this way, each patient will be able to act as his/her own control. A 7 days washout period will be required among the different solutions to avoid carryover effects. During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged.</detailed_description>
