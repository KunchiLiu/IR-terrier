	<brief_title>Hemosonics- VCU Cardiac Surgery Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HemoSonics is developing a novel POC diagnostic device, the Quantra System, to perform whole blood coagulation analysis and which is suitable for use in surgical and intensive care settings. The Quantra System employs a patented technology named sonorheometry, which was invented at the University of Virginia. Sonorheometry uses ultrasound pulses to characterize the dynamic changes in viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during coagulation and clot lysis. The initial assay performed on the Quantra System will be the surgical assay for monitoring hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. A clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the analytical performance as well as provide a preliminary evaluation of the performance comparability of the HemoSonics' device as compared to existing coagulation monitoring technology in heart surgery. This study will be performed at HemoSonics and the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and will involve patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring bypass.</detailed_description>
