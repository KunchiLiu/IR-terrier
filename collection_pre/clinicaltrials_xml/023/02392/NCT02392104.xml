	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of implementing an extended interval of INR follow-up in Veterans on a stable dose of warfarin in the Anticoagulation Clinic at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital. All participants will be provided usual care from the anticoagulation clinic, except for the interval between INRs. If the participant continues to be on a stable dose of warfarin and the INRs are within the goal range of 2-3 (including lab variation), follow-up visits will be scheduled following an extended interval protocol. Patient satisfaction will be evaluated at various points throughout the study. Additionally provider satisfaction, confidence, and knowledge of the extended interval protocol will be analyzed. Bleeding and thromboembolic events will be evaluated to ensure the safety of an extended follow-up interval.</brief_summary>
