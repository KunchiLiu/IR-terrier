	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit for patients implanted with the Nucleus® CI532 cochlear implant and to demonstrate the atraumatic nature of the electrode design. Nucleus® CI532 has a pre-curved, perimodiolar array, the EA32, which is introduced into the cochlea through a straightening sheath.</brief_summary>
