	<brief_summary>The effect of a combination product (Verum ) with L-arginine, Pycnogenol, vitamin K2, R-(+)-alpha-lipoic acid and vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid is investigated in a double blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. Volunteers with hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia are randomly assigned to the dietary supplement or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of L-Arginine and Pycnogenol on Light to Moderate Hypertension and Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>25 patients were included in the trial. Intervention period was 4 weeks with 2 months wash out phase. The screening visit of all volunteers before study start included volunteer information, signature of informed consent, anamnesis, medical history, ECG and blood routine analysis. Efficacy parameters were measured at visit 1, 2, 3, and 4. Endothelial function and postprandial endothelial Reaction was tested using EndoPAT (validated diagnosis tool). Blood pressure was measured by volunteers over a period of 7 days before each visit. As additional parameters homocysteine and ADMA (assymmetric dimethyl arginine) were determed. For safety evaluation AEs (Adverse Events), CC (compliance control), tolerability, blood routine parameters and vital signs were assessed.</detailed_description>
