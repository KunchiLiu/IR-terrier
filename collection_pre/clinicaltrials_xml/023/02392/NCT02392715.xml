	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a frequent disease, with increasing prevalence. Pulmonary rehabilitation through general exercise training (GET) is a corner stone of COPD care. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) as a stand-alone therapy decreases dyspnea and improves exercise capacity. Whether IMT combined with GET adds a supplementary benefit in the rehabilitation of COPD patients is however uncertain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Combined With General Exercise Training in COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial 80 COPD patients will be randomized into two groups. One group will receive general exercise training combined with inspiratory muscle training, 3 times a week, for a total of 36 sessions. The other group will receive general exercise training combined with shame inspiratory muscle training, 3 times a week, for a total of 36 sessions. We will assess the difference of improvement in exercise capacity between the 2 groups with the 6 minute walking test. We will also assess the difference of improvement in quality of life with St-George's respiratory questionnaire. Finally the difference of improvement in maximal inspiratory pressure will be determined. Patients and investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group allocation. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject. The data will be treated anonymously.</detailed_description>
