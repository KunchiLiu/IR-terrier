	<brief_summary>Patients presenting to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath and (suspected) heart failure will be screened and randomized to either a standard of care or a procalcitonin-guided arm. Procalcitonin-guided arm: a procalcitonin level (cutoff 0.2 ng/ml) will be used to support decision on antibiotic therapy initiation. Standard of care arm: the decision on antibiotic therapy will be based on the physicians intent to treat. The patients will be followed up 30 and 90 days after randomization to evaluate the survival status, re-hospitalizations and further antibiotic therapies.</brief_summary>
