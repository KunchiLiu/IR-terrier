	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to explore if any of the biomarkers assessed are sensitively linked to the asthma phenotypes. This would potentially alone or in addition to other clinical or biofluid markers indicate if and how asthma endotypes are linked to phenotype such as eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. Further exploratory markers will be analysed for better understanding of physiological levels of proteins and markers playing a role in regard to disease characterization in asthma. As a basis for further development of a biomarker for asthma, The sponsor plans to conduct this exploratory biomarker trial to determine levels and reference ranges of biomarkers potentially associated with asthma phenotypes. The trial aims at generating a panel of serum biomarkers that can be evaluated in subsequent interventional studies. The longitudinal design will be used to ascertain stability and test-retest reliability.</brief_summary>
