	<criteria>Heterozygous for F508delCFTR and a second allele with a CFTR mutation predicted to have residual function Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) greater than or equal to (≥) 40 percent (%) and less than or equal to (≤) 90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and height during screening. Sweat chloride value ≥60 millimole per liter (mmol/L) from test results obtained during screening OR as documented in the subject's medical record. Sweat chloride value less than (&lt;) 60 mmol/L must have documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease Stable CF disease as judged by the investigator History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrating corrected QT interval (QTc) greater than (&gt;) 450 milliseconds (msec) at the Screening Visit History of solid organ or hematological transplantation History or evidence of cataract, lens opacity, Ysuture, or lamellar rings determined to be clinically significant by the ophthalmologist during the ophthalmologic examination during the Screening Period Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study (including studies investigating VX661, lumacaftor [VX809], and/or ivacaftor) within 30 days of screening Use of restricted medications or foods within the specified window before the first dose of study drug Pregnant and nursing females (females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1). Sexually active subjects of reproductive potential who are not willing to follow the contraception requirements Colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status</criteria>
