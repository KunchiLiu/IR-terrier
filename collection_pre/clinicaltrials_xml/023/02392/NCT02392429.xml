	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies fluorothymidine F 18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in measuring response in patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia. FLT is a radioactive substance that may "light up" where cancer is in the body. FLT is injected into the blood and builds up in cells that are dividing, including cancer cells. Diagnostic procedures, such as PET/CT, may help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLT PET/CT in Measuring Response in Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of post-treatment FLT PET/CT imaging for complete remission (CR) in patients receiving induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) of post-treatment FLT PET/CT imaging for complete remission. II. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of FLT PET/CT at complete remission detection. III. To evaluate pre-treatment FLT PET/CT activity as a predictor of complete remission. IV. To evaluate the change between pre-treatment and post-treatment FLT PET/CT activity as a predictor of complete remission. V. To correlate post-treatment FLT PET/CT imaging parameters with day 28 bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and minimal residual disease assessment by flow cytometry. VI. To correlate FLT PET/CT imaging parameters (maximum FLT uptake across the total bone marrow compartment [SUVmax], mean FLT uptake across the total bone marrow compartment [SUVmean], heterogeneity) with biologic correlates (minimal residual disease [MRD] assessment). OUTLINE: Patients receive anthracycline intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV on days 1-7 for up to 2 courses. Patients then undergo FLT PET/CT within 3 days before or after the nadir bone marrow biopsy (between days 10-17 after initiation of first induction cycle and prior to reinduction). Patients may undergo an optional FLT PET/CT prior to induction chemotherapy if it does not interfere with commencement of treatment. After completion of study, patients are followed up at day 28-35.</detailed_description>
