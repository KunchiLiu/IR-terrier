	<criteria>Key Group 1: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced malignant solid tumor or lymphoma (any subtype) that is refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available Group 2: Postmenopausal women with advanced stage estrogen receptor positive breast cancer who are candidates for exemestane or fulvestrant Group 3: Individuals with lymphoma are limited to diffuse large Bcell lymphoma and peripheral Tcell lymphoma that are refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 1 Adequate organ function defined as follows: Hematologic: Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/ dL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (without platelet transfusion or any growth factors within previous 7 days of the hematologic laboratory values obtained at screening visit). Patients in the Group 3 lymphoma expansion may be enrolled with an ANC of ≥ 1.0 x 10^9 /L; Platelets ≥ 75 x 10^9 /L. Hepatic: Aspartate transaminase (AST) / Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (if liver metastases are present, ≤ 5 x ULN); Total or conjugated bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Renal: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 60 ml/min as calculated by the cockcroftgault method Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.2 Key Known brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease Myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification &gt; Class II), unstable angina, or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia within the last 6 months of study Day 1 Major surgery, defined as any surgical procedure that involves general anesthesia and a significant incision (ie, larger than what is required for placement of central venous access, percutaneous feeding tube, or biopsy) within 28 days of first dose of study drug History of long QT syndrome or whose corrected QT interval (QTc) measured (Fridericia method) at screening is prolonged (&gt; 450 ms for males and &gt; 470 ms for females). Individuals who screenfail due to this criterion are not eligible to be rescreened Clinically significant bleeding within 28 days of study Day 1 Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection HBsAG positive Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive No active anticoagulation within 7 days of study Day 1; including acetylsalicylic acid, low molecular weight heparin, or warfarin.
