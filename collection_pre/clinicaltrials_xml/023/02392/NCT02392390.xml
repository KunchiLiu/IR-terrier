	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: - To estimate changes in several microbiological parameters over three time periods (before treatment, after applying the MetvixiaÂ® and after irradiation during a single TDP session). - Describe the evolution of the size and appearance of the wound 7d after the start of treatment - Describe the potential adverse events associated with a TDP session</detailed_description>
