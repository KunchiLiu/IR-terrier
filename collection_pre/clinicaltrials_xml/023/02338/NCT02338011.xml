	<brief_summary>1. Compare the effect and safety of gefitinib alone with gefitinib plus concomitant WBRT(whole-brain radiotherapy ) in treatment of NSCLC patients harboring an EGFR mutation with multiple BM. 2. Verify the failure pattern of NSCLC patients harboring an EGFR mutation with multiple BM. 3. Explore the rescuable therapy after progression of disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparator-Controlled Study for EGFR(+) Patients With Multiple BMs From NSCLC (BROKE) (EGFR-epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;BM-brain Metastases)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will be randomized to receive gefitinib or gefitinib concurrent WBRT until progression of disease. Gefitinib concurrent WBRT, patients were given gefitinib 250mg per day concurrently with WBRT(whole-brain radiotherapy ). Dose reduction was allowed for intolerable adverse effects such as rash(grade 4)、diarrhea(grade 3-4) or non hematological toxicity(grade 3-4) from 250mg per day to 250mg every other day then to 250mg every three days if needed. WBRT was delivered in 3.0 Gy(Gray)fractions once per day 5 days per week to a total dose of 30Gy (10 fractions). Radiation was delivered as opposed lateral 6-MV(Micro Voltage) beams with Varian linear accelerator.</detailed_description>

Patients were not permitted to receive oral medicine such as CoumadinTM、Warfarin. If anticoagulant therapy is needed,low molecular heparin is suggested to instead of Coumarin drugs; Organs function in patients with meet the following criteria: Diagnose with interstitial lung disease、drug induced interstitial disease、hormone dependent radiation pneumonia previously,et al; Any unstable system diseases: including active infection, moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, within the last 6 months of the onset of myocardial infarction, need serious mental disorder drug treatment, liver, kidney or metabolic diseases; mental / spiritual diseases such as Alzheimer's disease; Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or active peptic ulcer; With immunodeficiency disease, or suffer from other acquired, congenital immunodeficiency disease, or a history of organ transplantation; Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Without full control of ocular inflammation or eye infections, or any may cause the eye disease situation; Any disease, metabolic disorders, or physical examination or laboratory suspicion or treatment of complications in patients at high risk of drug.</criteria>
