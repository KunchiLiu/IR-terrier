	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria 1. Skeletally mature adult males and females 18 years of age or older. 2. Impending or actual pathological fracture of the humerus, secondary to metastatic bone disease. 3. Females: neither pregnant nor intending to become pregnant during the course of the study, defined as: 1. Postmenopausal for at least 1 year OR 2. Documented oophorectomy or hysterectomy 3. Surgically sterile OR 4. If of childbearing potential, must be practicing doublebarrier method of birth control, be willing to avoid pregnancy for the period of study participation and have a negative pregnancy test at screening 4. Patient, or his/her legally authorized representative, is able to understand and provide informed consent. 5. Willing and able to comply with postoperative treatment protocol and followup visit schedule. 6. VAS Pain Score &gt; 60mm on 100mm scale. Impending FractureSpecific Inclusion Criteria 7. Documented presence of at least one metastatic lesion of the humerus. 8. Mirels Criteria Score â‰¥ 8. (specific to the target humeral lesion and subject to minimum VAS score requirements) 9. Destruction of cortical bone at impending fracture site &gt; 50%. Actual FractureSpecific Inclusion Criteria 10. Fracture is closed, Gustilo Type I or II. General Exclusion Criteria 1. Primary tumor (osteogenic origin, etc.) at site. 2. Impending or actual fracture at any other location that, in the Investigator's opinion, would preclude ability to assess pain and/or function in the target humerus. 3. Active or incompletely treated infections that could involve the device implant site. 4. Distant foci of infection that may spread to the implant site. 5. Allergy to implant materials or dental glue. 6. In the investigator's judgment, functional deficit in the target humerus with an etiology other than bone metastases (e.g. due to vascular insufficiency). 7. In the investigator's judgment, focal neurologic deficit as a result of metastases in the brain, spine, or other central nervous system disorders. 8. Uncooperative patients, or patients who are incapable of following directions (for example, as a consequence of a neurological or psychiatric disorder). 9. Prisoner Impending FractureSpecific Exclusion Criteria 10. Mirels Score &lt; 8 (specific to target humeral lesion). 11. Destruction of cortical bone at impending fracture site &lt; 50%. 12. Prior surgery and/or prior fracture of affected site. 13. Any articular component to impending fracture site. Actual FractureSpecific Exclusion Criteria 14. Open fractures with severe contamination. 15. Extremely comminuted fractures where insufficient holding power of the balloon on the intramedullary canal is probable. 16. Patients whose intramedullary canal at site of fracture measures smaller than the diameter of the sheath provided.</criteria>
