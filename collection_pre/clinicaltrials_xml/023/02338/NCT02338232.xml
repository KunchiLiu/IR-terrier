	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Telmisartan (Micardis) For the Prevention of Acute Graft vs. Host Disease Post Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is single-center, open-label, prospective study of telmisartan for the prevention of acute GVHD in approximately 60 subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT for treatment of a hematologic malignancy. Subjects will receive 160 mg Micardis brand telmisartan once daily, starting 2 days prior to HCT (day -2). Once the patient is discharged post-HCT, treatment will continue through Day +98 post-HCT for a total of 101 days. After treatment discontinuation on or before day +98 post-HCT, subjects will be followed for up to 6 months for primary and secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of: Acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia in remission, Myelodysplastic syndrome, Chronic lymphoid leukemia, NonHodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase, Myeloproliferative disorder, or Multiple myeloma Undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation from a related or unrelated donor matched at least at 7 of 8 of the HLAA, B, C, and DR loci ("8/8" or "7/8" match) Undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation after a myeloablative TBI, busulfan, or (nonmyeloablative) melphalanbased pretransplant conditioning regimen. Regimens for transplantation will include at one of the following agents, given in conjunction with fludarabine or cyclophosphamide: Busulfan 130 mg/m2 iv daily x 2 (reduced intensity) or 4 days TBI 150 cGy bid x8 doses (1200 Gy) Melphalan 140 mg/m2. (Although melphalan is not a myeloablative regimen, it results in clinically significant mucositis and patients receiving this medication will be of considerable interest in the analysis of these data.) Male or female patient age 18 years or older Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% at time of initiation of pretransplant conditioning Transplantationspecific comorbidity score of &lt;3 at time of initiation of pretransplant conditioning Patients taking antihypertensive medications (including telmisartan) are eligible but the patient must discontinue treatment at least 48 hours prior to first dose of study medication Capable of giving informed consent and having signed the informed consent form Inability to provide informed consent Subjects with known heart failure, advanced renal impairment requiring renal replacement therapy, or liver failure although these patients would most likely not be eligible for HCT. Subjects taking ACE inhibitors, potassium supplements, or spironolactone (or any other potassiumsparing diuretics) who cannot discontinue use prior to initiation of study treatment OR who require a highpotassium diet Patient unable to discontinue current hypertension medication for medical or other reasons for two days prior to starting telmisartan Chronic symptomatic hypotension, volume depletion.</criteria>
