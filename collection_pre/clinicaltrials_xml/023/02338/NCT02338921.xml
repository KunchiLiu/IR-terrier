	<brief_title>Triple Combination Therapy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Who Had Inadequate Glycemic Control With Combination Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea is the most commonly used combination regimen to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. But, treatment with the dual combination therapy is often unsuccessful at achieving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recently, various oral hypoglycemic agents were developed including dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitor, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists. But, there have been few studies about the glucose lowering effect of these drugs in Type 2 diabetes patients on the dual combination therapy with a sulfonylurea agent and metformin. Hence, the researchers plan to investigate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in combination with a sulfonylurea agent and metformin in type 2 diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
