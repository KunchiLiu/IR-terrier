	<brief_summary>Amyloidosis is involved in many rare diseases in relation to the diversity of amyloid proteins involved in the formation of abnormal tissue deposits. There are approximately 30 proteins involved in amylose's constitution. The therapeutic management varies depending on the type of amyloidosis observed. The application of conventional techniques immunolabeling of amylose does not allow the comprehensive characterization of amylose forms, due to failures of the technic, the false positivity of some results, or lack of frozen tissue available for typing light chain (lambda, kappa). In this study, the main objective is the comparison of two capacity of amylose characterisation: immunohistochemistry and proteomics analysis. The purpose of this study is to validate the superiority of proteomic analysis by demonstrating the improvement of the precision, the reduction of technical failure, as well as the correction of erroneous diagnosis, authorizing a more adapted therapeutic management.</brief_summary>
