	<brief_summary>This is a phase I trial of the combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and AKT inhibitor AZD5363. There are two parts to this study. Part A: dose escalation, and Part B: dose expansion. Part A will investigate the combination of 300 mg bd of olaparib with intrapatient ascending doses of AZD5363 administered for either 4-days-on, 3-days-off, and 2-days-on, 5-days-off. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached for both arms (or under the advice from the Safety Review Committee (SRC) one of the schedules will be discontinued), the schedule with the optimum safety and PK/PD profile will be taken forward to a dose expansion phase (Part B). Part B will evaluate the optimized dose/schedule identified in Part A of the study in patients with (1) BRCA1/2 mutant cancers (with previous disease progression on PARP inhibitor monotherapy), or (2) advanced sporadic tumours (e.g. TNBC, CRPC, HGSOC and tumours with somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated PI3K-AKT pathway).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Olaparib in Combination With AZD5363 (ComPAKT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A: The starting doses for both intermittent schedules will be 300 mg bd of olaparib and either AZD5363 given at 320 mg bd 4-days-on, 3-days-off, or 480 mg bd 2-days-on, 5-days-off. These starting doses are based on available data from the first-in-human studies [D0810C00002] (AstraZeneca) and [D3610C00001] (AstraZeneca) of both drugs, respectively. A general schema for 3 potential dose levels to be pursued on the 4-days-on, 3-days-off AZD5363 schedule (Schedule A) and 2-days-on, 5-days-off AZD5363 schedule (Schedule B) in Part A of the study are listed below. The starting dose of olaparib will be fixed at 300mg bd in both schedules. These schema only provide general guidance; it will be possible for doses of one or both drugs to be escalated or de-escalated in a "seesaw" fashion contingent on the toxicity and/or PK/PD data reported. This may create dose cohort combinations not listed below. Both PK and PD data will be taken into consideration if available. With the exception of dose level 1, actual dose escalation/de-escalation will be determined following a discussion with the SRC during dose escalation teleconferences. Dose escalation will continue until MTD(s) are reached. Patients will be dosed on a flat scale and not by body weight or body surface area. Both schedules will be carried out in parallel. Table 1: Schema for dose escalation in schedule A (4-days-on, 3-days-off AZD5363) Dose level (DL) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 4d-on, 3d-off - 1 200mg* 240mg 1. 300mg 320mg 2. 300mg 400mg 3. 300mg 480mg *An intermediate dose of 250mg bd of olaparib may be considered depending on drug-related toxicities observed and patient tolerability Table 2: Schema for dose escalation in schedule B (2-days-on, 5-days-off AZD5363) Dose level (DL) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 2d-on, 5d-off - 1 200mg* 400mg 1. 300mg 480mg 2. 300mg 560mg 3. 300mg 640mg - An intermediate dose of 250mg bd of olaparib may be considered depending on drug-related toxicities observed and patient tolerability After careful review of the clinical toxicity data, if the DLT is deemed to be caused by one of the agents, the responsible drug may be dose decreased and if well tolerated, the other agent maybe be increased in subsequent cohorts. If necessary, both drugs can also be dose de-escalated. In Part A of the study, olaparib will be administered continuously with intermittent AZD5363 in 21-day cycles. Intrapatient dose escalation of AZD5363 will be utilised to evaluate different dose levels. The optimal dose schedule selected based on toxicity, PK-PD and/or efficacy data will be taken forward into two expansion cohorts in Part B of the study. Cohort 1 will comprise patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutated tumours, while Cohort 2 will comprise advanced sporadic cancers that may harbour HR defects (e.g. TNBC, CRPC and HGSOC) or those with somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Part A: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant advanced solid tumours refractory to standard therapy or for which no suitable effective standard therapy exists, including, but not limited to patients with: BRCA1/2 mutant cancers, TNBC, CRPC and HGSOC, and those with somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated PI3KAKT pathway. Part B: (1) BRCA1/2 mutation cohort: Patients with advanced germline BRCA1/2 mutant solid tumours; (2) Sporadic cancers cohort: This cohort will include advanced sporadic cancers that are not known to harbour germline BRCA1/2 mutations, but which may harbour homologous recombination (HR) defects, e.g. advanced TNBC, CRPC and HGSOC, and those with somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated PI3KAKT pathway. 2.
