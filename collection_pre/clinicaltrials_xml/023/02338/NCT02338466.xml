	<brief_summary>Proximal Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) occlusions constitute the most severe stroke. Intra-venous thrombolysis with rt-PA within the first 4,5 hours is the only proven effective treatment. Prognosis is closely related to the recanalization rate that reaches only 30 to 50%. A new therapeutic strategy consisting in a sequential intravenous (IV) thrombolysis by rt-PA followed by 50UI/kg of IV tenecteplase (TNK) has been proposed in case of no recanalization after rt-PA. A case series of 13 consecutive patients treated by this association has been published in 2011. A high rate of recanalization without hemorrhagic transformation increase has been reported. However, efficiency and safety of this therapeutic have to be assessed in a randomized multi-centric study. Such a study is of great interest since interventional neuroradiology has not already shown superiority regarding IV rt-PA. Moreover interventional neuroradiologists specialists are only available in major hospital and an IV sequential strategy could provide an interesting alternative. Main study objectives: Main Clinical Objective: Sequential thrombolysis should be associated with a significant better outcome at 3-month, assessed by the modified Rankin score (mRS). Main Radiological Objective: Sequential thrombolysis should be associated with a higher rate of recanalization (TIMI 2b/3) at 24-hour.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superiority of Rt-PA + Tenecteplase in Comparison With Rt-PA Only in Proximal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multi-center, national, randomized, biomedical study comparing two therapeutic strategies in ischemic stroke associated with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Patients will be included in two randomized arms and the new sequential treatment approach (rt-PA + tenecteplase) will be compared with the standard treatment (rt-PA alone).</detailed_description>
