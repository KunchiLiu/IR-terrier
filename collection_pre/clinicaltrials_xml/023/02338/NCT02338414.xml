	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim administered at every other week in ITP patients who attained stable platelet counts ≥ 50 x 109/L for 4 consecutive weeks after weekly doses of romiplostim.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Biweekly Romiplostim in Adult Patients With ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regarding the determination of appropriate dose, it is well known that romiplostim resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet counts, but required dose for raising platelet count is variable between individuals according to each patient's ability to eliminate serum romiplostim. Because of this variability, after administration of initial 1mcg/kg of romiplostim, dose adjustment is recommended based on the platelet response to given dose of romiplostim. However, the optimal dose interval of romiplostim has rarely been studied. In pivotal studies, romiplostim was administered on a weekly schedule, and based on these studies, one dose at every week is being widely used. In one study in which ITP patients received weekly subcutaneous doses of romiplostim at a range from 3 to 15mcg/kg, half life of romiplostim was estimated from 1 to 34 days, suggesting that lengthening the interval between doses more than a week can be potentially possible in some patients.</detailed_description>
