	<detailed_description>This will be a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in up to 80 sites in the United States of America (USA) and Canada to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of SC BMT versus placebo on an as-needed basis under conditions of home use in premenopausal women with HSDD (with or without decreased arousal). The study will consist of 2 phases: (1) a 32-week phase including a randomized, double-blind treatment period preceded by a screening/baseline period (Core Study) and (2) a 52 week open-label treatment phase (Extension Phase). Primary Objective â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of bremelanotide (BMT), administered subcutaneously (SC) on an as needed basis for the treatment of HSDD (with or without decreased arousal) in premenopausal females. Secondary Objectives - To evaluate the efficacy of BMT in premenopausal women in the double-blind Core Study, as assessed by subject responses to questionnaires measuring sexual function, treatment satisfaction, and distress associated with sexual dysfunction. - To evaluate the safety of BMT in premenopausal women in the double-blind Core Study. - To evaluate the safety of long-term therapy with BMT in the open label Extension Phase. - To evaluate the efficacy of long-term therapy with BMT in the open-label Extension Phase.</detailed_description>
