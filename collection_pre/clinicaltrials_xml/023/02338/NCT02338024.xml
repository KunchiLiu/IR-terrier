	<brief_summary>This study proposes to assess whether a modified Antiretroviral Treatment Access Study intervention, proved to be effective in the U.S. and based on the nurse case management approach, can impact the enrollment in HIV care of recently detected HIV-positive patients in specialized health care clinics in three regions in Ukraine, using the existing local infrastructure. The proposed study addresses a significant public health issue of non-/late enrollment of HIV-positive persons in HIV care and treatment.</brief_summary>
