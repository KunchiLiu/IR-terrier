	<brief_title>Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) and Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) in Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatients seeking treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) at Geha anxiety-disorders clinic will be randomized into two groups (ABMT+CBGT; placebo control+CBGT). One group will undergo an Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) aimed at diverting attention away from socially-threatening stimuli. The second group will receive a placebo-control not designed to affect attention. Both groups will also undergo a standard Cognitive-Behavioral Group Treatment (CBGT) comprising 18 weekly sessions of 1.5-hr duration (along the lines of Heimberg, Juster, Hope &amp; Mattia 1995 and Clark &amp; Wells 1995). Symptoms and attention bias measures will be taken at three time points: Pre-treatment, Post-treatment,and at 3-month follow-up. The study includes the following steps: a) initial assessment of participants' psychopathology and symptom levels; b) attention bias measurement; c) 8 sessions of ABMT/placebo control delivered as part of the CBGT sessions; d) two booster ABMT/Placebo treatments will be delivered at sessions 13 and 16 of the CBGT protocol. e) post-treatment assessment will include symptom and attention bias assessments. Finally, f) a three-month follow up assessment. The goal of the study is to to test the effectiveness of ABMT as an add-on to established CBGT protocol for social anxiety disorder.</detailed_description>
