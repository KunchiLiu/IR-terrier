	<brief_summary>Evaluation of unfavourable outcome-related factors in patients affected by renal cell cancer in treatment with everolimus and previously treated with a Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor (i.e. sunitinib, sorafenib,pazopanib, or bevacizumab+interferon)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome-related Factors in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated With Everolimus (ORCHIDEE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Predictive factors to be considered are: histology, Heng risk group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS), site of metastases, glycemia and cholesterolemia. The data collected in this "real life" population could contribute to identify clinical factors that predict favourable outcomes in patients treated with everolimus after failure or a a first-line treatment with a VEGF inhibitor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, aged 18 years or older, with histologically or cytologically confirmed mRCC (clear cell or not clear cell); 2. ECOGPS 012; 3. With target and/or nontarget lesions according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1; 4. Following failure of a previous treatment with VEGFtargeted therapy (e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, or bevacizumab+interferon); 5. For whom a decision has been taken to initiate everolimus treatment or patient currently receiving treatment with everolimus by a period of time ≤30 days; 6. Willing and able to comply with followup and all other protocol requirements and able to commence treatment within 21 days; 7. Written informed consent obtained before any screening procedure and according to local guidelines. Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry: 1. Previous treatment with everolimus or at the date of written informed consent provision receiving everolimus by more than 30 days; 2. Symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Patients may be eligible if the central nervous system metastases have been adequately treated (surgery or radiotherapy), and do not require ongoing corticosteroids for control of symptoms and have had no evidence of progression for at least three months; 3. Other malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years, except the following, if adequately treated: superficial squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma of skin, superficial bladder cancer (T1 and G1 or T1 and G2), stage 1 cervical cancer; 4. Treatment with an investigational agent in the past 4 weeks; 5. Clinically relevant human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus infection; 6. Non adequate liver function as shown by: serum or plasma ALT and AST &gt;3.0x upper limit of normal (ULN) &gt;5 if hepatic metastases are present; Serum or plasma total bilirubin: &gt;1.5xULN (excepted for patients with Gilbert's syndrome); 7. Non adequate renal function as shown by serum creatinine &gt;2.5xULN; 8. Any of the following in the last year: myocardial infarction, severe/ unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack or pulmonary embolism; 9. Ongoing grade ≥2 cardiac dysrhythmias, atrial fibrillation of any grade or prolongation of the corrected QT interval to &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females; 10. Pregnancy (negative pregnancy test required for women of childbearing potential), breast feeding; 11. Inadequate contraception. Women must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or use a reliable form of contraception. Men must be surgically sterile or use a barrier method of contraception; 12. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to everolimus or its excipients.</criteria>
