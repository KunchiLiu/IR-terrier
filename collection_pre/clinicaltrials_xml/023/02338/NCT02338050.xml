	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized, prospective study to evaluate the activity, safety, and feasibility of administration of moxetumomab pasudotox in the pre-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) setting to patients with B-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who are in a morphologic complete remission and have pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) &gt; 0.01% (detected by flow cytometry). The primary objective of this study is to determine if treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox in the MRD positive setting is able to lead to MRD negativity (&lt; 0.01% by flow cytometry) or at least a 1-log10 reduction in MRD prior to allogeneic HCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Moxetumomab Pasudotox (CAT-8015, HA22) in Children With B-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Minimal Residual Disease Prior to Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2 study designed to assess safety, feasibility and clinical activity of pre-HCT moxetumomab pasudotox for patients with ALL in morphologic CR but with MRD. It is hypothesized that subjects in a morphologic complete remission with proven minimal residual disease (MRD) after chemotherapy for ALL planned for allogeneic HCT who receive a course of moxetumomab pasudotox prior to the start of conditioning will show a marked reduction or elimination of detectable MRD after moxetumomab pasudotox treatment without adverse impact on the feasibility or safety of allogeneic HCT. The primary objective of this study is to determine if treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox in the MRD positive setting is able to lead to MRD negativity (&lt; 0.01% by flow cytometry) or at least a 1-log10 reduction in MRD prior to allogeneic HCT. Secondary objectives to be studied include: toxicity profile (including safety and feasibility of administration in the pre-HCT setting and ability to proceed to transplant, incidence of capillary leak syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome and other post-HCT toxicities), comparison of quantitative MRD assessments, progression-free survival, overall survival, pharmacokinetic profiles, immunogenicity to moxetumomab pasudotox, transplant-related mortality, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and relapse.</detailed_description>

Patients &gt; 18 years of age must have the ability to give informed consent according to applicable regulatory and local institutional requirements. Legal guardian permission must be obtained for patients &lt; 18 years of age. Pediatric patients will be included in age appropriate discussion in order to obtain assent 10.

Subjects with known 11q23 MLL rearrangement are excluded. 4. Prior therapy: Prior treatment with CAT3888 (BL22), moxetumomab pasudotox (CAT8015, HA22), any pseudomonasexotoxincontaining compound, or any antiCD22 directed therapy at any time in the past Prior allogeneic or autologous HCT or adoptive cellular therapies, including Tcell chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy Chemotherapy &lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug with the following exception: There is no time restriction in regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy provided there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such Monoclonal antibody therapy &lt; 30 days from study enrollment Other investigational agents currently or within 30 days prior to study enrollment 5. Subjects with an absolute contraindication to corticosteroid administration 6.
