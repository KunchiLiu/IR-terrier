	<brief_title>Validation Of TBI Detection System For Head Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to validate the clinical utility of the BrainScope technology for the acute identification of structural brain injuries in a TBI population presenting to the ED with mild symptoms, following closed head injury.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Brain Injuries</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects who are admitted to the ED and are suspected of a traumatic, closed head injury within 72 hours. The patient will have a GCS 1215 upon arrival to the ED even if GCS was lower prior to arrival to the ED (e.g., at the time of injury). Subjects will be excluded who have forehead, scalp, or skull abnormalities or other conditions that would prevent correct application of the electrode headset on the skin. In addition, subjects with dementia, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder, brain tumors, history of brain surgery, evidence of acute psychosis, substance dependence, history of TIA or stroke within the last year, currently receiving dialysis or in endstage renal disease, active fever defined as greater than 100 degrees F or 37.7 degrees C, current condition is "critical" in the opinion of the investigator, subject is suffering from an open head injury, subject requires advanced airway management (i.e. mechanical ventilation), currently receiving procedural sedation medications. Subjects below the age of 18 years, and prisoners will not be eligible for study.</criteria>
