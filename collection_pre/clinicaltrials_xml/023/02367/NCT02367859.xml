	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies dabrafenib in treating patients with ameloblastoma and a specific mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. Dabrafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dabrafenib in Treating Patients With BRAF Mutated Ameloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe the response rate of ameloblastoma to dabrafenib at 6 weeks. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Feasibility and safety in this patient population. II. Response will be assessed pathologically. III. Two main histologic assays for treatment response will be used: tumor necrosis and phosphorylated-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK), phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Ki-67 levels as measured by immunohistochemistry. OUTLINE: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) every 12 hours for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose disease is judged to be not amenable to resection will continue dabrafenib indefinitely as long as there has not been tumor progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
