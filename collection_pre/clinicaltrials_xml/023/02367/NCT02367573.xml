	<brief_summary>Inguinal hernia can be repaired laparoscopically. In the normal laparoscopy there are only two-dimensional view, which is somewhat challenging when operating in three-dimensional environment. The three-dimensional laparoscopic systems are gradually entering the operating rooms. There are plenty of evidence of the benefits of 3D-system in laboratory conditions. However, no prospective randomized trials have been published in the clinical point of view. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate is there something to gain in changing into 3D laparoscopic system in the transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair.</brief_summary>
