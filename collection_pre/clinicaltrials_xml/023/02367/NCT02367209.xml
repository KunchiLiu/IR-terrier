	<brief_summary>In the recent years a novel method for functional lung imaging called Fourier decomposition MRI (FD MRI) has been introduced that allows for simultaneous assessment of regional lung perfusion and ventilation-related information without exposure to ionizing radiation or administration of intravenous or inhalational contrast agent. In this project, the investigators plan to investigate whether Fourier decomposition (FD) MRI is able to provide similar clinical information on regional lung perfusion as the standard methods SPECT/CT and DCE MRI in patients with COPD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the recent years a novel method for functional lung imaging called Fourier decomposition MRI (FD MRI) has been introduced that allows for simultaneous assessment of regional lung perfusion and ventilation-related information without exposure to ionizing radiation or administration of intravenous or inhalational contrast agent. In this project, the investigators plan to investigate whether Fourier decomposition (FD) MRI is able to provide similar clinical information on regional lung perfusion as the standard methods SPECT/CT and DCE MRI in patients with COPD. As MRI in patients with COPD is particularly challenging due to the rarefication of lung parenchyma, the FD MRI technique will be combined with an ultra-fast Steady-State Free Precession (ufSSFP) acquisition method for improved signal efficiency. The investigators ultimate goal is to provide a mean to predict and monitor the outcome of different therapies, such as medication, valves and surgery in COPD patients without requiring ionizing radiation or administration of contrast agents. In the framework of this study, 30 patients with COPD will be enrolled prospectively. The study participants will be recruited by the clinic for thoracic surgery at the University Hospital Basel among all patients undergoing lung perfusion scintigraphy with SPECT/CT for surgery planning. Each participant will undergo one MRI examination of 30 min containing non-contrast-enhanced (FD MRI) and contrast-enhanced (DCE MRI) imaging studies of regional lung perfusion.</detailed_description>
