	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently complicated by depression and other problems such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Untreated depression can lead to reduced productivity and poor global outcome. There is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of TBI-related depression. The overarching goal of this small study is to determine the effectiveness of low frequency right (LFR) rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain stimulation technique. It involves generating a brief magnetic field in a coil that is placed on the scalp. The magnetic field passes through the skull and induces a weak electrical current in the brain that briefly activates neural circuits at the stimulation site. Adults aged 18 and older, with a history of head injury of mild or moderate severity , who are currently experiencing symptoms of clinical depression may join the study.</brief_summary>
