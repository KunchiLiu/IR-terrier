	<brief_title>Prospective Clinical 10-year Follow-up of the LINK® Endo-Model® SL®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post Market Clinical Follow-ups (PMCF) through observational investigations are an important tool to detect infrequent complications or problems, events specific to defined patient populations and long term performance issues under routine condition. Against this background a prospective multi-center study with the LINK® Endo-Model® SL® will be conducted.</detailed_description>
