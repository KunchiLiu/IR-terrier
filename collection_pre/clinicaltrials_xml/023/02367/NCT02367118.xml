	<brief_title>Prednisone in Chronic Rhinosinusitis Without Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Objective: 1. Compare clinical improvement in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) through application of SNOT 22 questionnaire and visual analogue scale of symptoms, sniff test, acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry and nasal endoscopy using Lund-Kennedy score, after 6 months of follow-up after treatment prednisone or placebo plus standard medical treatment for 21 days. Specific Objectives: 1. Compare decreased in SNOT-22 questionnaire score and visual analog scale of symptoms after treatment with prednisone or placebo. 2. Compare decreased in nasal endoscopy findings, through application of Lund-Kennedy score, after treatment with prednisone or placebo. 3. Compare improvements in smell after treatment with prednisone or placebo. 4. Determine whether there are differences in nasal permeability measured by rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry after treatment with prednisone or placebo. 5. Determine whether there is a difference in the SNOT 22 questionnaire score, visual analogue scale of symptoms, score of smell and Lund-Kennedy score between CRSsNP patients and eosinophilia, and CRSsNP patients with normal eosinophils, receiving prednisone or placebo . 6. Determine if there is a difference in the SNOT 22 questionnaire score, visual analogue scale of symptoms, score of smell and Lund-Kennedy score between CRSsNP patients with elevated total immunoglobulin E and CRSsNP patients with normal total immunoglobulin E, receiving treatment with prednisone or placebo.</detailed_description>
