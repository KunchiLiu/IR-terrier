	<brief_title>Phase I Open-label Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 in Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a phase I, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 with a single oral administration of TAK-272 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment as compared with participants with normal renal and hepatic function.</detailed_description>
