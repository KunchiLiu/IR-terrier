	<brief_summary>Patients with eligible diabetic foot ulcers will be screened, treated, and followed for complete ulcer closure. This is a randomized trial. All patients will receive standard-of-care treatment. Additionally, some patients will receive treatment with topical Selinexor gel and some will receive topical placebo gel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Topical Selinexor (KPT-330) Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Eligible patients with diabetic foot ulcers will be screened, randomized, treated, and followed for complete ulcer closure. After screening, qualified patients will be treated for up to 12 weeks. Patients who achieve complete ulcer closure will be followed for an additional 12 weeks. All patients will receive standard-of-care treatment. After randomization some patients will be treated with topical Selinexor gel twice weekly and some patients will be treated with a topical placebo gel twice weekly. Patients receiving Selinexor will be assigned to a sequential treatment cohort, either a 10 μM (μmol/L), 30 μM, or 70 μM dose.</detailed_description>

The patient has adequate arterial blood supply in the affected limb at screening. Patient has the inability to perceive 10 grams pressure in the periulcer area and other regions of the affected foot and toes using SemmesWeinstein 5.07 monofilament at screening. Patient has a foot ulcer that is clearly of nondiabetic pathophysiology. Patient has more than two (2) DFUs on the target lower extremity. DFU is clinically infected. Patient has active osteomyelitis of the foot or active, uncontrolled, connective tissue disease</criteria>
