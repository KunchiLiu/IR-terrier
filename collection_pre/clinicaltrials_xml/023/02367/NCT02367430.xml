	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a well-established case management model called Critical Time Intervention (CTI) can help individuals with hoarding disorder who are concerned about the risk of eviction. Each individual with hoarding disorder will be assigned to work with a CTI Specialist for 9 months, who will provide referrals for mental health treatment, legal consultations, and registration for entitlements. All participants will be offered a facilitated group intervention called the Buried in Treasures Workshop. The CTI Specialist will also facilitate reconnecting the individual with supportive family/friends and will monitor and support the de-cluttering of the patient's home. A second comparison group will be offered the same group intervention (Buried in Treasures Workshop) without the other parts of the CTI protocol.</brief_summary>
