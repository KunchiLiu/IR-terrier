	<brief_summary>Objectives: Primary: Comparison of proportion of patient achieving continence between the four arms at 6 months. Secondary: - Comparison of time to achieve continence between the four arms. - Comparison of urinary symptoms and quality of life improvement between the four arms. - Assessment of adverse events in Duloxetine arms. Primary outcome/ time frame: Proportion of patient achieving continence at 6 months. Continence is defined as "using no pad"or "only security pad". Secondary outcome: - time to achieve continence - Quality of life tested in relation to incontinence according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and King's Health Questionnaire (KQH). - Urinary symptoms measured with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). No. of subjects entered: 300 patients informed and included, 240 patients will be randomized. Statistical methods - Proportion of patients who achieve continence and time to achieve continence will be compared between the four arms. - Comparison of quality of life outcomes between the four arms - Comparison of clinical variables that can affect the primary/secondary outcome - univariate and multivariate analysis (ITT).</brief_summary>
