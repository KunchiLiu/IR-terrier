	<brief_summary>Islet transplantation is one of the effective and promising options for type 1 diabetes mellitus treatment1-4. The liver is the primary target location for infusion and portal vein catheterization is generally used. Percutaneous transjugular, percutaneous transhepatic, laparoscopically transmesenteric and laparoscopically transumbilical approaches were often utilized to access the portal. Current islet infusion approach via portal vein of liver has various defects. Percutaneous trans-hepatic puncture is risk of possible severe hemorrhage and portal thrombosis. The laparoscopic entry techniques require longer surgical duration and have an increased rate of catheterization failure. Moreover, the catheters were not allowed to indwell for subsequent infusions. In the current study, the investigators aim to performed open surgery, catheterized the umbilical vein and infused islets into the portal vein. The catheter was indwelled for one month after surgery. Therapeutic effects, surgical parameters and complications were observed to evaluate feasibility and safety.</brief_summary>
