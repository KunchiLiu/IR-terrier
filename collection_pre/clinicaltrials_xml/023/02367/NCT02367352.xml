	<brief_title>Alisertib (MLN8237) in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel in East Asian Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib in combination with paclitaxel is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in East Asian patients. The study will consist of 2 parts: a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the alisertib plus paclitaxel combination in East Asian patients with advanced solid tumors; the second part is an expansion cohort at the RP2D of the alisertib plus paclitaxel in East Asian patients with either ovarian cancer or small cell lung cancer. This study will look at safety (lab results and side effects) and pharmacokinetic properties (how the drugs move throughout the body). This open label study will enroll 30 participants. Dose Escalation Phase: Alisertib tablets at a starting dose of 15 mg, orally, twice daily, 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycle in combination with paclitaxel, 60 mg/m^2 intravenous in Cohort 1 escalated to a dose of 25 mg alisertib, orally, twice daily 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycles in Cohort 2. If ≥ 2 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) the dose of alisertib will be decreased to 20 mg. Expansion Cohort: alisertib tablets at the determined RP2D dose orally, twice daily 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycles in combination with paclitaxel, 60 mg/m^2 intravenous. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Alisertib 15 mg to 25 mg tablets - Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 intravenous solution This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants 18 years or older (or minimum age of legal consent consistent with local regulations) at the time written study informed consent is obtained. 2. Participants of East Asian ethnicity (eg, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean). 3. Must have a diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy (escalation part) or relapsed or refractory ovarian cancer (OC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (expansion part). Participants in the expansion cohort must have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of either OC (including recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer) or SCLC, which is measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Participants in the expansion cohort must not have received more than 2 prior taxane containing regimens. 4. No antineoplastic therapy (eg, drugs, biologicals, monoclonal antibodies, etc) or radiotherapy within the 3 weeks before enrollment (14 days for regimens with recovery expected within 7 to 14 days). The participant must have recovered (ie, ≤ Grade 1 toxicity or participant's baseline status, except alopecia) from all treatmentrelated toxicities. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 6. Adequate bone marrow function as defined by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (without need for growth factor support). Platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 (without need for transfusion or growth factor support). Hemoglobin level ≥ 9 g/dL. 7. Adequate liver function as defined by: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if due to liver metastases) Serum albumin equal to or greater than the lower limit of normal 8. Adequate renal function as defined by: • Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/minute (can be calculated using serum creatinine value). 9. No more than 2 previous chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting. 10. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study drug Adhere to any treatmentspecific pregnancy prevention guidelines for paclitaxel Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug Adhere to any treatmentspecific pregnancy prevention guidelines for paclitaxel. 11. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 12. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling, including pharmacokinetics (PK). 13. Ability to swallow tablets. 1. Participants with carcinomatous meningitis. 2. Participants with symptomatic and/or progressive brain metastases or treatment with brain edema. 3. Known hypersensitivity to Cremophor® EL, paclitaxel, alisertib or their components. 4. Prior treatment with an Aurora A specifictargeted or panAuroratargeted agent, including alisertib in any setting. 5. Prior history of ≥ Grade 2 neurotoxicity or any toxicity requiring discontinuation from taxane chemotherapy that is not resolved to ≤ Grade 1. 6. Participants who received prior weekly taxanebased therapy with early disease progression during or within 1 month of completing therapy (refractory disease). 7. Any comorbid condition or unresolved toxicity that would preclude administration of weekly paclitaxel. 8. Systemic treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors must be discontinued at least 14 days before the first dose of alisertib, and the use of these agents is not permitted during the study. 9. Known gastrointestinal (GI) abnormality (including recurrent nausea or vomiting) or GI procedure that could interfere with or modify the oral intake, absorption, or tolerance of alisertib. 10.
