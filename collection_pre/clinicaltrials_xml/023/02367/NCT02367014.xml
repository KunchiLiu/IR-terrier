	<brief_summary>This study will be a Phase 1/2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, multiple ascending dose, placebo-controlled study, enrolling an anticipated 36 subjects with mitochondrial myopathy associated with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of MTP-131 in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of mitochondrial disease believed to impair the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Eligibility requires prior genetic confirmation of mitochondrial disease. Diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy judged by the Investigators to be due to existing mitochondrial disease. Subject must be able to complete a Screening Visit 6MWT. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use birth control as specified in the protocol from the date they sign the ICF until two months after the last dose of study drug. Eligible subjects may be required to stay overnight in the clinical research center for the duration of their study participation lasting up to 7 consecutive days. Any prior or current medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing all study requirements. Hospitalized (admitted as inpatient) within 1 month prior to the Baseline Visit. A history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Uncontrolled Type 1 (T1DM) or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in the opinion of the investigator. A creatinine clearance &lt;45 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft Gault equation. Requires pacemaker, defibrillator, or has undergone cardiac surgery within 2 years of the Screening Visit. Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;100 mmHg diastolic) at the Screening Visit. Subject has participated in another interventional clinical trial within 3 months of the screening visit or is currently enrolled in a noninterventional clinical trial judged by the Investigator to be incompatible with the current trial. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
