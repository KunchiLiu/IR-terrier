	<detailed_description>The present study aims to evaluate a targeted, progressively challenging, online cognitive training program comprised of 49 distinct exercises targeting a variety of cognitive capacities. The cognitive training program will be compared to a plausibly beneficial active control condition in which participants completed online crossword puzzles. The investigators hypothesize that the cognitive training will show greater transfer to a range of underlying cognitive abilities than the active control, as measured by a broad battery of neuropsychological assessments and participant-reported outcomes.</detailed_description>
