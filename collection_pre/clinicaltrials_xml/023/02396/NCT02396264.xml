	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy of reproductive-aged women characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Available guidelines recommend lifestyle intervention although they do not suggest the best dietetic regimen for the treatment of PCOS. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two nutritional protocols, namely Mediterranean Diet and standardized normocaloric Diet in normal weight women with PCOS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mediterranean Diet as Treatment for Normal Weight Women With PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive age women, that is often characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. The central importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been established by several in vivo and in vitro studies. No data are available for the best therapeutical approach for metabolic dysfunction of PCOS. In addition, although insulin resistance is a crucial pathogenetic factor for PCOS and lifestyle change program improves insulin resistance, no available data can also suggest whether non-obese women with PCOS benefit or did not from lifestyle change program including diet without calorie-restriction. Although there are not studies focused on the effectiveness and safety of Mediterranean diet in PCOS, several indirect studies performed in obese and/or insulin resistant subjects, seem to suggest a potential role of this diet in PCOS population and, in particular, on long-term PCOS-related health risk. In this study, the investigators' purpose is to compare two nutritional protocols in order to find the best dietetic approach for improving clinical, metabolic and hormonal outcomes in normal weight women with PCOS.</detailed_description>
