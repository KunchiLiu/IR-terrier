	<brief_summary>The preliminary data demonstrate potent activity of Ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory GvHD. The investigators therefore intend to launch a clinical phase 2 trial. In this multicenter phase 2 trial the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of Ruxolitinib in Steroid-refractory acute GvHD in up to 15 transplantation centers. The investigators will evaluate the response by monitoring the clinical GvHD grade, requirement of alternative GvHD active agents and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Until now, there is no report of GvHD patients treated with JAK1/2 inhibitors and the investigator don't have the evidence for a coexisting trial that investigates the activity of JAK1/2 inhibitors in GvHD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pathophysiological hallmark of GvHD after allo-HCT is an allogeneic donor T cell response against recipient antigens. This process is aggravated by increased processing and presentation of host antigens by donor APCs following conditioning treatment. The allogeneic T cell response leads to inflammation, tissue damage and fibrosis and is mediated by extensive production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2R, IL-6 and TNF. The signal transmission of inflammatory cytokines in effector cells (T- cells, macrophages, NK - cells) requires activation of specialized kinases from the family of the Janus kinases. These kinases, JAK1, 2 and 3 are linked to cytokine receptors, and are activated upon binding of the cytokine to the receptor of the inflammatory effector. The JAK1/2 kinase inhibitor Ruxolitinib (INC424) is approved for myelofibrosis. In advanced myelofibrosis, Ruxolitinib lead to sustained clinical remissions with regard to constitutional symptoms, weight loss and spleen size in the majority of treated patients. Of note, clinical responses correlated with a marked reduction in inflammatory plasma cytokines. Importantly, cytokines down-regulated by Ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis correspond to inflammatory effectors that mediate tissue damage and inflammation in GvHD. These are mainly the cytokines IL- 1, IL -6, TNF and IFN-Î³. Since Ruxolitinib suppresses the JAK1 / 2 cytokine response, the investigator hypothesized that Ruxolitinib might attenuate the cytokine mediated inflammatory tissue damage in GVHD and thus might favourably affect the severity and course of GvHD after allo-HCT. In vitro, the investigator demonstrated in an allogeneic system (major mismatch mixed-lymphocyte reactions) that co-incubation with Ruxolitinib strongly suppressed both the proliferation of allogeneic T cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines. Using a very aggressive major mismatch mouse model of acute GvHD (C57BL/6 on BALBc) Ruxolitinib treatment significantly prolonged survival of animals. In addition, in these animals showed a reduced weight loss, significantly reduced histopathological GvHD severity, suppression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and a reduction of donor T cells in GvHD target organs such as the intestines. Sole suppression of cytokine production or cytokine receptor activity by Ruxolitinib would be very similar to already established drugs for GvHD and no major conceptual advance. However the investigator observed that Ruxolitinib did not only suppress cytokine production but also led to increased frequencies of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. This cell type was previously shown to lead to long-lasting tolerance as compared to the short-term immunosuppression achieved by conventional medication for GvHD.</detailed_description>
