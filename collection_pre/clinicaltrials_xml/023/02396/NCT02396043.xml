	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of treatment for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) according to modified BFM-95 regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified BFM-95 Regimen as First-Line Chemotherapy in Adults With T- Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients received a modified BFM regimen which was derived from the NHL-BFM-95. Th e diff erences were as follows: (1) during the course of high-dose methotrexate therapy (HD-MTX), citrovorum folinate (CF) was used for rescue at 36 h after the administration of HD-MTX;(2) cranial prophylactic radiotherapy was omitted, but all patients received regular intrathecal chemotherapy and four additional HD-MTX treatments during maintenance therapy.(3) Pirarubicin was used instead of daunorubicin (4) Pegaspargase was used instead of L- asparaginase for patients</detailed_description>
