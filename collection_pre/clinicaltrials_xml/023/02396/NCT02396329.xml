	<brief_title>Chlorhexidine Versus Povidone-Iodine Antisepsis for Reduction of Post Cesarean Section Surgical Site Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy &amp;safety of Chlorhexidine-based antisepsis protocol versus povidone- iodine protocol used as preoperative skin antisepsis for patients undergoing cesarean section in reduction of surgical site infection.Chlorhexidine is a chemical antiseptic. It is effective on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, although it is less effective with some Gram-negative bacteria. It has both bactericidal and bacteriostatic mechanisms of action, the mechanism of action being membrane disruption. Iodine is commonly used as an antiseptic agent clinically. Iodine is usually formulated as an iodophor, which consists of iodine combined with a carrier molecule. This formulation increases the solubility of iodine and provides a reservoir for sustained release. The most commonly used iodophor is povidone iodine which is a 10% iodophor solution that contains 1% available iodine. Iodine molecules penetrate microbial cell walls and cause oxidation of cysteine, iodination of amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids. This leads to reduced protein synthesis and bacterial cell wall damage.</detailed_description>
