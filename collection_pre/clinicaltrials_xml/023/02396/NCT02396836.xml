	<brief_summary>The aim is to compare the effectiveness of the 6 step hand rub technique versus 3 step hand rub technique in hand coverage and in reducing bacterial contamination on the hands of healthcare workers in practice. Research questions 1. What is the effectiveness of the 6 step technique in hand coverage compared to the 3 step technique? 1. What are the most frequently missed sites in hand surface coverage using 6 steps compared to 3 steps? 2. What is the reduction in bacterial contamination of the hand with the 6 step compared to the 3 step technique? 2. Does site missed or coverage relate to bacterial load? 3. What is the time taken for 6 step technique versus 3 step technique?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of 6 Versus 3 Steps for Hand Hygiene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 6 step for decontamination of healthcare workers hand is recommended by the World Health Organization but the 3 step technique is easy to perform and has been shown by some studies to be effective. Compliance with the 6 step technique is not optimum. If the 3 step was more as or more effective than the 6 step compliance with it could be compared with that for the 6 step. No randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of these two techniques using alcohol based hand rub has been conducted.</detailed_description>
