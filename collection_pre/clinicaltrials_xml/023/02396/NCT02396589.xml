	<brief_summary>Stroke is one of the most serious, disabling health conditions in the United States. Patients who undergo rehabilitation treatment for stroke have a high rate of disability. Poor outcomes for many persons with stroke may be low because of incomplete treatment. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial and a process evaluation to examine the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of an enhanced rehabilitation transition program, Community Participation Transition after Stroke (COMPASS), designed to bridge inpatient rehabilitation and the home to support the performance of everyday activities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Participation Transition After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose an enhanced rehabilitation transition program: Community Participation Transition after Stroke (COMPASS) is a compensatory intervention consisting of one pre-discharge and five post-discharge home visits by an occupational therapist to supplement usual care. This intervention is focused on resolving barriers to independence in daily activities and participation using environmental support and active practice of daily activities in an individual's real home (versus an idealized clinical setting). This is a new combination of evidence-based compensatory treatments delivered in a novel treatment setting (transition to home). Our long-term goal is the development of an effective intervention for a transition home designed to prevent excess disability for people living with stroke that could have an immediate effect and high public health significance.16 We will recruit 40 patients currently undergoing inpatient rehabilitation (IR) for ischemic stroke from longitudinal studies of stroke at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and randomize them to receive six additional sessions of the enhanced rehabilitation transition program or attention control. Exploratory participation outcomes will be assessed by blinded evaluators at baseline, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after stroke. We will test the central hypothesis that COMPASS will be acceptable, feasible, and superior to attention control on measures of participation and daily activity performance at 6 months after stroke.</detailed_description>
