	<brief_title>3D HD Versus 2D HD in Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair: a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental studies have shown that even experienced surgeons gain from stereoscopy when solving both easy and complex tasks. Inguinal hernia repair is a specialist operation and the large flow makes this type of operation suitable for exploring any advantage of three-dimensional laparoscopy for the experienced surgeon.</detailed_description>
