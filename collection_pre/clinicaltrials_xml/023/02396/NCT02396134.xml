	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well vaccine therapy works in reducing the frequency of cytomegalovirus severe infections (events) in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Vaccines made from a peptide may help the body build an effective immune response and may reduce cytomegalovirus events after donor stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Reducing the Frequency of Cytomegalovirus Events in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if cytomegalovirus (CMV)peptide(Pep)vaccine(Vax) (CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine) reduces the frequency of CMV events defined as reactivation or CMV disease in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 allogeneic CMV positive hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients (HCT-R+). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMVPepVax by assessing the following: non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days post HCT, severe (grade 3-4) acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) (aGVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks from each vaccination. II. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipients of CMVPepVax compared to placebo by assessing time-to viremia (defined as number of days from transplantation to the date of &gt;= 500 CMV genome copies [gc]/mL) , duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (&gt; 100 and =&lt; 360 days post HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by clinically significant viremia of &gt;= 1500 CMV genome copies [gc]/mL), cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days. III. To evaluate the impact of CMVPepVax on transplant related outcomes by assessing the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-relapse mortality, all-cause mortality, infections. IV. To determine if CMVPepVax increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T cell immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated HLA A*0201, CMV seropositive HCT-recipients. V. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells. VI. To explore GVHD biomarkers and compare between the vaccine and placebo groups. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on days 28 and 56 after HCT. ARM II: Patients receive placebo SC on days 28 and 56 after HCT. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up through day 365 after HCT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent Participant must be willing to comply with study and/or followup procedures, including willingness to be followed for one year postHCT Planned HCT for the treatment of the following hematologic malignancies: Lymphoma (Hodgkin and nonHodgkin) Myelodysplastic syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second remission (for acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, the disease status needs to be in hematologic remission by bone marrow and peripheral blood; persistent lymphadenopathy on computed tomography [CT] or CT/positron emission tomography [PET] scan without progression is allowed) Acute myeloid leukemia in first or second remission Chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic or accelerated phase, or in second chronic phase Other hematologic malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders and myelofibrosis; patients with multiple myeloma and those with nonmalignant disease such as aplastic anemia are excluded HLA A*0201 High resolution, 4digit typing is required at HLAA2 to ensure A*0201 status. CMV seropositive (recipient) Planned related or unrelated HCT, with HLA donor allele matching; related donor must be an 8/8 match for HLAA, B, and C at intermediate (or higher) resolution, and DRB1 at high resolution using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)based typing; unrelated donor must be an 8/8 match at HLAA, B, C, and DRB1 at high resolution using DNAbased typing Planned HCT with no exvivo T cell depletion of graft; conditioning and immunosuppressive regimens according to institutional guidelines are permitted Negative serum or urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test (female patient of childbearing potential only) within two weeks of registration Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and active hepatitis B virus (HBV) (surface antigen negative) within 2 months of registration Agreement by females of childbearing potential and sexually active males to use an effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for up to 90 days postHCT; should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately Any prior investigational CMV vaccine Experimental antiCMV chemotherapy in the last 6 months Planned medications from the time of HCT to day 70 postHCT: Live attenuated vaccines Medically indicated subunit (EngerixB for HBV; Gardasil for human papilloma virus [HPV]) or killed vaccines (e.g. influenza, pneumococcal, or allergy treatment with antigen injections) Allergy treatment with antigens injections Alemtuzumab or any equivalent in vivo Tcell depleting agent; this includes antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and posttransplant cyclophosphamide Antiviral medications with known therapeutic effects against CMV such as ganciclovir (GCV)/valine (VAL), foscarnet (FOS), cidofovir, hexadecyloxypropylcidofovir (CMX001) and maribavir; acyclovir has no therapeutic efficacy against CMV and is allowable as standard of care to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV) Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV treatment Other investigational product concurrent enrollment in other clinical trials using an investigational product is prohibited Other medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the investigational product Diagnosis with autoimmune disease Pregnant women and women who are lactating; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures, e.g., social/psychological issues, etc Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics)</criteria>
