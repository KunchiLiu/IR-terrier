	<brief_summary>The investigators are studying the utility of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) during transsphenoidal pituitary surgery by randomizing patients to either an intra-operative MRI after resection, or no intra-operative MRI. The investigators will then count the number of gross total resection in each group of patients and also the complications related to surgery.</brief_summary>
