	<brief_summary>Post-partum haemorrhage is one of the life threatening emergencies. It accounts for nearly one-quarter of all maternal death worldwide. Atonic uterus contributes about 80% among the causes. Uterotonic drugs are administered following the delivery of baby both in vaginal and caesarean delivery for prevention of PPH. However postpartum haemorrhage cannot always be prevented. But, the incidence and especially its magnitude can be reduced by assessing the risk factors and following the guidelines. The intelligent anticipation, skilled supervision, prompt detection and effective institution of therapy can prevent a normal case from undergoing disastrous consequences. This study will be carried out at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) within six months after approval. This is a Randomized Control Trial which will compare efficacy of Carbetocin and Oxytocin for the control of PPH. Structured Questionnaire, Data Sheet, hospital indoor documents i.e. Patient chart, operation notes, surgeons visual estimation of blood loss etc will be used as study tool. Ethical clearance will be obtained from Institutional Review Board of BSMMU. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient or from her legal guardian. Patient confidentiality will be strictly maintained. No name, address or contact details of the patient will be divulged.</brief_summary>
