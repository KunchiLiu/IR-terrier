	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine the optimum dose of thrombolytic and duration of the ultrasound procedure as a treatment for acute submassive pulmonary embolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimum Duration of Acoustic Pulse Thrombolysis Procedure in Acute Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with pulmonary embolism with a RV/LV &gt;0.9 and hemodynamically stable who meet all eligibility criteria and sign informed consent will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups (see below). 48 hours after the start of treatment, a repeat CTA will be obtained and a RV/LV obtained. Thereafter, subjects will be followed for 12 months and an echocardiogram obtained at each clinic visit. Subjects will be monitored for occurrence of repeat PE and other serious adverse events.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age and ≤ 75 years of age 2. CTA evidence of proximal PE (filling defect in at least one main or lobar pulmonary artery) 3. PE symptom duration ≤14 days 4. Submassive PE: RV/LV diameter ≥ 0.9 from CTA and hemodynamically stable 5. Must be treated within 48 hours of diagnosis of PE by CTA 6. Signed Informed consent obtained from subject or Legally Authorized Representative 1. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), head trauma, or other active intracranial or intraspinal disease within one year 2. Recent (within one month) or active bleeding from a major organ 3. Major surgery within seven days of screening for study enrollment 4. Clinician deems the subject highrisk for catastrophic bleeding 5. History of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) 6. Catheterbased pharmacomechanical treatment for PE within 3 days of study enrollment 7. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90 mm Hg and/or use of vasopressors 8.

Life expectancy &lt; one year 11. Use of thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists within 3 days prior to inclusion in the study 12. OutofRange Laboratory Values: Hematocrit &lt; 30%, Platelets &lt; 100 thousand/μL, INR &gt; 3, 13. Creatinine outside the normal range for the treating institution 14. Subject is pregnant (positive pregnancy test; women of childbearing capacity must be tested) or breast feeding 15. Active cancer (metastatic, progressive, or treated within the last 6 months). Exception: subjects with nonmelanoma primary skin cancers are eligible to participate in the study 16. Known allergy, hypersensitivity, or thrombocytopenia from heparin, rtPA, or iodinated contrast except for mildmoderate contrast allergies for which steroid premedication can be used</criteria>
