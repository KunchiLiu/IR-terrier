	<brief_title>Split-dose Versus Single-dose Polyethylene Glycol Regimen for Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The image quality obtained from the wireless capsule endoscopy improves its diagnostic yield. The amount of visualized mucosa is in direct correlation with the diagnostic yield. Nonetheless, frequently, the quality of the image obtained is hampered by the presence of bubbles, debris, bile and enteric fluid. Therefore many efforts have been putted in order to eliminate this factor such as the use of prokinetics, simethicone and bowel purgatives. The latter (namely the polyethylene glycol - PEG - solution) has accumulated evidence and is, therefore, recommended by the last European guidelines. Usually, the cleansing starts and finish in the day before the capsule endoscopy ingestion. We hypothesized that, similarly to what had become evidence to large bowel cleansing, a shorter gap between the polyethylene glycol intake and the exam could provide a better capsule endoscopy image quality and therefore gauging our diagnostic yield.</detailed_description>
