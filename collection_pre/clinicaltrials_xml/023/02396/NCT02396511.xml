	<criteria>1. Willingness and ability to consent for self to participate in study 2. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures 3. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 and elevated serum βhCG 4. Histologically proven choriocarcinoma that has progressed despite all described lines of chemotherapy for this condition 1. Prior treatment with TRC105 2. Serious doselimiting toxicity related to prior bevacizumab 3. Current treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial 4. Uncontrolled chronic hypertension defined as systolic &gt; 140 or diastolic &gt; 90 despite optimal therapy (initiation or adjustment of BP medication prior to study entry is allowed provided that the average of 3 BP readings at a visit prior to enrollment is &lt; 140/90 mm Hg) 5. Symptomatic pericardial or pleural effusions 6. Uncontrolled peritoneal effusions requiring paracentesis more frequently than every 2 weeks 7. Active bleeding or pathologic condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (i.e. hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) 8. Thrombolytic or anticoagulant use (except to maintain i.v. catheters) within 10 days prior to first day of study therapy 9. Cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade ≥ 2 within the last 28 days 10. Known active viral or nonviral hepatitis 11. Open wounds or unhealed fractures within 28 days of starting study treatment 12. History of peptic ulcer disease or erosive gastritis within the past 6 months, unless treated for the condition and complete resolution has been documented by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 28 days of starting study treatment 13. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related illness 14. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for this study</criteria>
