	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare 3D-laparoscopy versus 2D-laparoscopy with the use of HD resolution in cholecystectomy in terms of error rating, performance time and subjective assessment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D HD Versus 2D HD in Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional laparoscopy can be very challenging, especially with the requirement of converting the two-dimensional image of the operating field to a three-dimensional perception. This can potentially lead to a detrimental effect on the learning curve as well for the feasibility of the operation for the more inexperienced surgeon. In our hospital, the high frequency of cholecystectomy serves as a basis for the minimally experienced surgeons to explore whether three-dimensional laparoscopy provides a better ability for solving complex intraoperative tasks than the conventional laparoscopy.</detailed_description>
