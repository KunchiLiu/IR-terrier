	<brief_title>Prostate Artery Embolization as a Treatment for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Men With Prostates Larger Than 90 Grams</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate improvement in symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with prostates larger than 90 grams treated with prostate artery embolization (PAE). Symptoms will be assessed utilizing the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to evaluate change from baseline at 12 months post PAE.</detailed_description>
