	<brief_summary>This is a phase III study designed to provide efficacy and safety data for canakinumab administered for at least 48 weeks as subcutaneous (s.c.) injection every 4 weeks (q4wk) in Japanese patients with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). Interim analysis (IA) data at Week 28 and 48 from this study will support a registration submission of canakinumab in the indication of SJIA in Japan.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Confirmed diagnosis of SJIA as per ILAR definition (Petty, et al. 2004) that must have occurred at least 3 months prior to enrollment with an onset of disease &lt; 16 years of age: Arthritis in one or more joints, with or preceded by fever of at least 2 weeks duration that is documented to be daily/quotidian for at least 3 days and accompanied by one or more of the following: Rash due to SJIA,lymphadenopathy, Hepatomegaly/Splenomegaly, Serositis Active disease at the time of baseline defined as follows: At least 2 joints with active arthritis Documented spiking, intermittent fever (body temperature &gt; 38Â°C) for at least 1 day during the screening epoch and within 1 week before first canakinumab dose CRP &gt; 30 mg/L(3 mg/dL) (normal range &lt; 10 mg/L(1 mg/dL)) Negative TB screen (Chest Xray and TSPOT test) With active or recurrent bacterial, fungal or viral infection at the time of enrollment, including patients with evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infection. Patients with resolved/previous hepatitis B infection (a negative HBs antigen, but a positive antiHBs antibody and/or antiHBc antibody). With underlying metabolic, renal, hepatic, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions which in the opinion of the investigator immunocompromises the patient and /or places the patient at unacceptable risk for participation.
