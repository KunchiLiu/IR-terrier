	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if immune-tolerance with Alum-formulated GAD (Diamyd), in combination with high dose Vitamin D3, may delay or stop the autoimmune process leading to clinical type 1 diabetes in non-diabetic children with ongoing beta-cell autoimmunity as indicated by positive islet autoantibodies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Trial: Immune-tolerance With Alum-GAD (Diamyd) and Vitamin D3 to Children With Multiple Islet Autoantibodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if immune-tolerance with Alum-formulated GAD (Diamyd), combined with high dose Vitamin D3, may delay or stop the autoimmune process leading to clinical type 1 diabetes (diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria) in non-diabetic 4-17.99 year old children with ongoing beta-cell autoimmunity as indicated by positive islet autoantibodies. The secondary objective is to demonstrate that treatment with Diamyd is safe in children at risk for type 1 diabetes. The children will be followed for 5 years in the study. Primary endpoint is proportion of subjects diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in each treatment arm. Secondary endpoints are 1) safety, 2) change in metabolic status from normal to impaired glucose metabolism in the group of children with normal glucose metabolism at baseline screening.</detailed_description>
