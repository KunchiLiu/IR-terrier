	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of MM-121 plus docetaxel or pemetrexed is more effective than docetaxel or pemetrexed alone in regards to OS in patients with heregulin-positive NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of MM-121 in Combination With Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Heregulin Positive NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center, phase 2 study in patients with Heregulin-positive NSCLC that have progressed following no more than three systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic disease, of which one must have been an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. All patients will initially be screened for heregulin status. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive MM-121 in combination with investigator's choice of either docetaxel or pemetrexed versus docetaxel or pemetrexed alone.</detailed_description>
