	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD), the Dose Limitant Toxicities (DLTs) and the safety profile of S-1 combined with fixed doses of Irinotecan (SIRI schedule) and fixed doses of Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin (SIRINOX schedule).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Assessing Several Schedules of Oral S-1 in Combination With a Fixed Dose of Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the therapeutic potential and reduced toxicity advantages of S-1 compared with other fluoropyrimidines, this trial assessing S-1 with Oxaliplatin plus Irinotecan is warranted for future investigations (Phase II-III). The primary objectives are to determine the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD), the Dose Limitant Toxicities (DLTs) and the safety profile of S-1 combined with fixed doses of Irinotecan (SIRI schedule) and fixed doses of Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin (SIRINOX schedule).</detailed_description>
