	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b, open label, multi-center study of CMB305 (sequentially administered LV305 [a dendritic cell-targeting viral vector expressing the NY-ESO-1 gene] and G305 [NY-ESO-1 recombinant protein plus GLA-SE]) in patients with melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that express NY-ESO-1. CMB305 is a novel in vivo approach designed to stimulate the body's immune system to fight the spread and growth of cancer for patients whose tumors express the NY-ESO-1 protein. LV305 will be given in a prime-boost approach with G305 to induce a synergistic immunotherapeutic response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Safety Study of CMB305 (Sequentially Administered LV305 and G305) in Patients With Locally Advanced, Relapsed, or Metastatic Cancer Expressing NY-ESO-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to investigate and examine the safety and immunogenicity of the combinatorial regimen called CMB305, where intradermal LV305 is administered sequentially with intramuscular G305 over three months. During Part 1, a dose escalation design will be utilized in patients with melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or sarcoma. After completion of Part 1, the study will be expanded in Part 2 and will enroll patients with NSCLC, ovarian cancer, synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Locally advanced, relapsed, and/or metastatic cancer with low or minimal tumor burden, which may or may not be measureable (see Appendix A for descriptions) 2. Tumor histology consistent with one of the following: In Part 1, Dose Escalation melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube carcinoma), or sarcoma (any subtype). In Part 2, Patient Expansion NSCLC, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube carcinoma), or the sarcoma subtypes, synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma 3. Tumor specimen positive for NYESO1 expression by IHC and/or RTPCR 4. If ovarian cancer, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) must be ≥ 40 U/mL (unless patient has measureable disease that cannot be followed by CA125); if melanoma, LDH must be ≤ ULN 5. Inadequate response, relapse, and/or unacceptable toxicity with one or more prior systemic, surgical, or radiation cancer therapies, and for whom curative standard therapy is not an option (except patients with NSCLC who must have experienced either an inadequate response, relapse, and/or unacceptable toxicity with two or more prior systemic, surgical, or radiation cancer therapies) 6. ≥ 18 years of age 7. Life expectancy of ≥ 6 months per the investigator 8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 9. ECG without evidence of clinically significant arrhythmia or ischemia 10. If female of childbearing potential (FCBP), willing to undergo pregnancy testing and agrees to use at least one highly effective or two effective contraceptive methods during the dosing period and for three months after last CMB305 injection 11. If male and sexually active with a FCBP, must agree to use highly effective contraception such as latex condom during the dosing period and for three months after last CMB305 injection 1. Investigational therapy within 3 weeks prior to CMB305 dosing 2. Prior administration of other NYESO1targeting immunotherapeutics 3. Significant immunosuppression from: 1. Concurrent, recent (≤ 4 weeks ago) or anticipated treatment with systemic corticosteroids at any dose, or 2. Other immunosuppressive medications such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine (antihistamines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and aspirin permitted) or conditions such as common variable hypogammaglobulinemia or exposures such as large field radiotherapy 4. Cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation, biologics or kinase inhibitors, GCSF or GMCSF within 3 weeks prior to the first scheduled CMB305 dosing 5. Psychiatric, other medical illness or other condition that in the opinion of the PI prevents compliance with study procedures or ability to provide valid informed consent 6. Significant autoimmune disease with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, hypothyroidism or other conditions that have never been clinically active or were transient and have completely resolved and require no ongoing therapy 7. Myocardial infarction within 6 months of study initiation, active cardiac ischemia or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade III or IV heart failure 8. Inadequate organ function including: 1. Marrow: Peripheral blood leukocyte count (WBC) &lt; 3000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1500/mm3, platelets &lt; 75000/mm3, or hemoglobin &lt; 10 gm/dL 2. Hepatic: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2.5 x ULN, total serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN (patients with Gilbert's Disease may be included if their total bilirubin is ≤3.0 mg/dL) 3. Renal: Creatinine &gt; 1.5x ULN 4. Other: INR (prothrombin time ratio) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt;1.5 x ULN 9. History of other cancer within 3 years (except nonmelanoma cutaneous malignancies and cervical carcinoma in situ). 10. Active tuberculosis or recent (&lt; 2 week ago) clinically significant infection or evidence of active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection 11. Uveal melanoma 12. Brain metastases considered unstable as: 1. Without confirmed stability over 60 days in patients previously treated with prior surgery or radiation; OR 2. Associated with symptoms and/or findings; OR 3. Requiring corticosteroids or anticonvulsants in the prior 60 days 13. Pregnant or nursing 14. Known allergy(ies) to any component of CMB305, including egg lecithin</criteria>
