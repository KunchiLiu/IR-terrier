	<brief_title>Open Label Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of AKB-9778 in Subjects With Macular Edema Due to RVO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will participate in the study for up to 168 days. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will self-administer study medication as subcutaneous (SC) injections in the abdomen (preferably) twice per day; the first dose each day should be administered in the morning and the evening dose should be administered within 8 to 16 hours after the morning dose.
