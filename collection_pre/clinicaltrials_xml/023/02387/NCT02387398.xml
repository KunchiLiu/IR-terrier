	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot, multi-centered, randomized, clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of performing early Coronary Angiography (CAG) versus no early CAG in post-cardiac arrest patients without ST segment elevation. Safety will be assessed by evaluating the association of major adverse events (re-arrest, bleeding, pulmonary edema, hypotension, acute renal insufficiency, and pneumonia) with early coronary angiogram. Efficacy will be assessed by a composite endpoint of improved left ventricular regional and global function (both regional wall motion analysis and left ventricular ejection fraction) as measured by echocardiography prior to hospital discharge and favourable neurological function (Cerebral Performance Categories 1 or 2) at discharge.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Coronary Angiography Versus Delayed Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest is a major public health issue. Arizona has been a leader in improving long-term survival by introducing new and innovative resuscitation approaches including "Chest Compression-Only CPR" and "Cardiocerebral Resuscitation". Post-resuscitation care is the next great opportunity for further improvements. Early coronary angiography (CAG) combined with therapeutic hypothermia has become the recommended standard of care for post-cardiac arrest patients manifesting ST segment elevation on their electrocardiogram (ECG). However, the majority of cardiac arrest victims do not have ST segment elevation. There is clinical equipoise as to whether these patients will benefit from early CAG. Subjects who are qualified for the study will be randomized 1:1 to one of two groups. ° Intervention Group-Early coronary angiography (door-to-angiography) within 120 minutes of admission to Emergency Department. or ° Control Group-No early coronary angiography (within the first six hours from admission) All enrolled patients, will be treated with therapeutic hypothermia which is standard of care, beginning simultaneously with both groups or within at least 2 hours of hospital arrival. Subject will be followed for 180 days for safety and long-term survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All successfully resuscitated outofhospital cardiac arrest patients with a suspected cardiac etiology for their nontraumatic arrest 2. Age greater than 18 years 3. The post resuscitation ECG shows no evidence of ST segment elevation 1. Nonresuscitated (no sustained pulse and BP) 2. Presence ST segment elevation or new left bundle branch block present on the postresuscitation ECG 3. Suspected noncardiac etiology for their arrest such as respiratory failure, asphyxia, pulmonary embolus, shock, trauma, drug overdose, or CNS bleed as likely cause of the cardiac arrest 4. Known "Do Not Resuscitate" status 5. Minors (&lt;18 years old) 6. Prisoners 7. Significant bleeding or blunt trauma 8. Known or confirmed pregnancy test by urinalysis 9. Patients who are known to have received any other investigational therapies within the 30 days prior to enrollment or during study duration will be excluded unless these studies have been reviewed and approved by the Study Steering Committee. 10. Known "opt out" choice; wearing Optout band for any EFIC approved study or on an "Optout" list</criteria>
