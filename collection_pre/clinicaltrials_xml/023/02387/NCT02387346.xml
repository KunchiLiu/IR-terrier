	<brief_summary>The role of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop in the generation of tremor, gait impairments and postural instability has been made evident. The current study will use a Magstim Rapid 2 to deliver rTMS with the aim of modulating the activity in the vermal/paravermal region of the cerebellum, and consequently the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. Analysis of the effects of an acute session of stimulation will be made to determine the therapeutic potential of the protocol. Motor symptom improvement will be assessed immediately following stimulation to detect motor symptom improvement up to one hour following stimulation, providing insight into the effectiveness of the protocol to produce benefits which outlast the period of stimulation. Participants will each receive one session of stimulation in the ON state of medication. A pre-assessment will be performed before beginning the session and a post-assessment will be performed immediately following stimulation. There will be two groups, which will both undergo the exact same protocol, however one group will receive real stimulation, and one group will receive sham stimulation.</brief_summary>
