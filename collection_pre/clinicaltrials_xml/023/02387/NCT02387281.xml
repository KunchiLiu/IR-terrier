	<brief_summary>Freezing of gait (FOG) is among the most disabling motor features of Parkinson disease (PD) and is present in other forms of parkinsonism as well. FOG is a brief (usually lasting &lt;30 seconds) episode of absence or a greatly reduced forward movement of the feet despite intention to walk. It typically occurs when patients initiate gait (so-called "start hesitation") and when attempting to turn. It is a leading cause of falls and often results in a wheelchair-dependent state. FOG greatly interferes with activities of daily living, causes social isolation and poor quality of life. FOG is one of the least understood features of PD. It possibly may develop independent of the other motor features of the disease, and be caused by specific pathological changes in the brain. Previous studies on FOG have shown conflicting information and have not lead to clear understanding of the pathophysiology. One key reason for this is that there appears to be multiple subtypes which have rarely been taken into account. The purpose of this study is to show that different types of FOG exist and to see if there is a connection to cognitive differences or gait patterns.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Freezing of Gait: Clinical, Cognitive, and Imaging Features</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an observational study to assess FOG via using multiple methods such as: clinical features, imaging, cognition and dopamine blood levels. The study consists of four parts (plus an optional fifth part) that will be completed over two-three separate days within a 30 day span. The four parts will not necessarily be performed in this order. Part one will be clinical and written questionnaire assessments of PD and FOG followed by 3D motion capture evaluations. Part two are cognitive or neuropsychiatric assessments. Part three is a magnetic resonance image (MRI) to examine the brain structure. Part four is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging scan that measures norepinephrine transporter levels. The optional part 5 is a lumbar puncture that will measure cerebrospinal fluid catecholamines and proteomics.</detailed_description>
