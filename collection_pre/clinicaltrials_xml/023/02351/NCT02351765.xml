	<brief_title>ABC-08: Phase Ib Trial of Acelarin in Combination With Cisplatin in Locally Advanced/ Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Active chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of advanced biliary tract cancers (ABC) include gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines and platinum agents. The United Kingdom (UK) National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) ABC-02 study established cisplatin and gemcitabine as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with ABC and this regimen has been widely adopted in the UK and internationally. However, inherent and acquired tumour resistance limits the efficacy of gemcitabine and it is necessary to explore alternative treatments. The study will explore the combination of acelarin, a drug designed to specifically overcome the key cancer resistance mechanisms associated with gemcitabine, with cisplatin. As this is the first time the combination of acelarin and cisplatin will be given to patients the aim of the study is to investigate the safety of the combination and to establish the recommended phase II dose of acelarin. This is a phase Ib, single-arm, multi-centre, open-label trial. The trial design is a classic 3+3 design where patients are recruited into cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at different dose levels until the dose level for phase II is determined. Patients in each cohort will be monitored closely for safety and drug toxicity. Secondary trial objectives will involve assessing the activity of acelarin in combination with cisplatin in terms of; progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, as well as exploring the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically/cytologically verified, nonresectable or recurrent/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder or ampullary carcinoma. No prior systemic therapy allowed for advanced biliary cancer. Prior low dose chemotherapy used with or without radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting is allowed if completed &gt; 6 months from enrolment. Recent palliative radiation (within 28 days prior to consent) is allowed if candidate has measurable disease outside radiation field. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01. Age ≥ 18 years and life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Adequate renal function with serum urea and serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min. Adequate haematological function: Hb ≥ 10g/dl, white blood count (WBC) ≥ 3.0 x 10*9/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L, platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3. Adequate liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 30 μmol/L and alkaline phosphatase, along with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN. Adequate biliary drainage, with no evidence of ongoing infection. Women of child bearing age MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry AND be using a highly effective contraception method (combined or progestogenonly hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonereleasing system, vasectomised partner*(a) or sexual abstinence**(b)) which must be continued for 6 months after the end of study treatment, unless child bearing potential has been terminated by surgery/radical radiotherapy or infertility due to bilateral tubal occlusion. Male subjects must either have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and their female partner meet the criteria above (not of childbearing potential or practicing adequate contraception [e.g. combined or progestogenonly hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonereleasing system, sexual abstinence**(b)] throughout the study period and for 6 months after the end of study treatment). Patients must not have a history of other malignant diseases (within the previous 5 years and there must be no evidence of recurrence), other than adequately treated nonmelanotic skin cancer or insitu carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Patients must have given written informed consent. Patients must be registered within 4 weeks of the diagnosis of advanced disease; and patients must start treatment within 6 weeks of diagnosis of advanced disease. (a) The vasectomised partner must have received medical assessment confirming surgical success. (b) Sexual abstinence in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. History of allergic reactions attributed to previous gemcitabine or cisplatin treatment. Previous treatment with Acelarin. Incomplete recovery from previous therapy (surgery/adjuvant therapy/radiotherapy) or unresolved biliary tree obstruction. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases which, in the view of the investigator, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial. Evidence of significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding which, in the opinion of the investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial. Any patient with a medical or psychiatric condition that impairs their ability to give informed consent. Any other serious uncontrolled medical conditions. Clinical evidence of metastatic disease to the brain. Any pregnant or lactating woman. Preexisting hearing impairment.</criteria>
