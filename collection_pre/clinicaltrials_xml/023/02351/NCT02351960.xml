	<brief_title>Dexlansoprazole in Asian Participants With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. A dual delayed release formulation of dexlansoprazole, referred to as dexlansoprazole Modified Release (dexlansoprazole MR) is being tested to treat people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study will look at the healing of the esophageal lining of the GERD patients who take dexlansoprazole MR. Participants will be assigned to two study groups based on the endoscopy screening procedures to receive treatments as follows: 1. a non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) group; dexlansoprazole 30 mg QD for 4 weeks. 2. an erosive esophagitis (EE) study group; dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD for 8 weeks, with an interim clinical evaluation at Week 4 and a clinical evaluation and endoscopy at week 8. The study will enroll approximately 300 patients; 200 in the dexlansoprazole 30 mg QD and 100 in the dexlansoprazole 60 mg groups. All participants will be asked to take one capsule in the morning each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record the presence and maximum severity of daytime and nighttime heartburn and regurgitation symptoms during screening and, if assigned to a treatment group, throughout the duration of the study using the supplied paper diary. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea). The overall time to participate in this study is up to 8 weeks. Participants will make up to 3 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
