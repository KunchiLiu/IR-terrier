	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare correlation for right to left shunts (mainly patent foramen ovale) detection for three methods-transesophageal echo as a gold standard, transcranial doppler with contrast agent (microbubbles) and new method- Flow detection system ( Cardiox TM) in young stoke patients ( age under 55 years).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to compare correlation for right to left shunts (mainly patent foramen ovale) detection for three methods-transesophageal echo as a gold standard, transcranial doppler with contrast agent (microbubbles) and new method- Flow detection system ( Cardiox TM) in young stoke patients ( age under 55 years). Flow detection syst√©m is a new method for right to left shunt detection comfortable for patients, not dependent on experienced examinator and only one method with exact valsalve maneuver measurement. Right to left shunt could be important etiology of cardioembolization in young stroke patient population, therefore screening for this condition is recommended in all young patient after ischemic stroke especially with unclear etiology. Flow detection systes seams to be ideal screening method for this patients.</detailed_description>
