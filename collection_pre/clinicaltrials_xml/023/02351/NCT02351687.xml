	<brief_summary>Children who recover from moderate acute malnutrition in Malawi remain at high risk for relapse or death in the year following recovery. This cluster-randomized trial will evaluate a package of affordable, safe, proven interventions specifically targeted to this population of children in an attempt to decrease their risk of relapse or death following recovery from moderate acute malnutrition. These children will be followed for a year following recovery to assess rates of relapse and mortality.</brief_summary>
