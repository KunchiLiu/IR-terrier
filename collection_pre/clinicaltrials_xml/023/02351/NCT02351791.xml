	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study Investigating Human Skin Reaction to Output</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six types of patches are tested: Patch 1: Standard adhesive with own feces Patch 2: Standard adhesive with own feces mixture Patch 3: Standard adhesive with simulated feces Patch 4: Standard adhesive with simulated feces mixture Patch 5: Standard adhesive with buffer (control) Patch 6: Standard adhesive with buffer feces mixture (control) Each subject is randomized to one of two arms testing three patches on the peristomal skin (patch 1, 3 and 5 or patch 2, 4 and 6). Furthermore, within each arm an attempt will be made to randomize each of the three patches on the peristomal skin to one of three locations surrounding the stoma (upper left, upper right, lower).</detailed_description>
