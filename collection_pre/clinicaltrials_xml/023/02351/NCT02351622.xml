	<brief_summary>The investigators are undertaking a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 120 adults with newly diagnosed ITP from 5 medical centers in China. Part of the participants are randomly selected to receive caffeic acid tablets combining dexamethasone and the other part are selected to receive high-dose dexamethasone treatment. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants' platelet count will be monitored weekly. Response will be evaluated after 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. If the participant did not get complete response or response after 3 months, he would quit the trail.</detailed_description>
