	<brief_title>Inhaled Beclomethasone After Community-Acquired Respiratory Viral Infection in Lung Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired respiratory viral (CARV) infections after lung transplantation are associated with an increased risk for the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) after lung transplantation. The exact mechanisms whereby CARV infections increase this risk are unknown. We propose that viral infection results in airway epithelial cell injury and the expression of injury-response genes that provide signals that initiate immunologic and non-immunologic pathways that result in the airway remodeling characteristic of obliterative bronchiolitis, the predominant pathology of CLAD. Systemic and inhaled corticosteroids are frequently used as anti-inflammatory agents to treat the peribronchiolar inflammation seen in viral bronchiolitis. Beneficial effects from corticosteroids have been reported, but this has not been demonstrated in lung transplant recipients. The aim of this single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the short and long term effects of a 6 month course of inhaled beclomethasone on adult lung transplant recipients with CARV infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult (â‰¥ 18 years old) Single, bilateral, or heartlung transplant recipient Confirmed infection with a communityacquired respiratory virus including: adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A or B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PiV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinovirus At least 6 months posttransplant, with completion of 6 month bronchoscopy if indicated Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with study procedures (e.g. testing, treatment) BOS Stage 3 Requirement for mechanical ventilation at study entry Use of inhaled steroids at the time of CARV infection Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would preclude the patient's participation in a clinical trial Lack of available spirometric data to establish a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second and/or forced vital capacity Pregnancy Current participation in another interventional clinical trial</criteria>
