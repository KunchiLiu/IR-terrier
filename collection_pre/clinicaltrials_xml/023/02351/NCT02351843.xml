	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of low amplitude electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to reduce, and possibly eliminate the side effects of ECT by lowering the strength of the ECT stimulus from the conventional 800 mA to 500 mA. Low amplitude ECT could potentially reduce the risks associated with ECT while preserving its unparalleled efficacy. This novel development would remove key obstacles to allow for the wider adoption of ECT as a safe and effective therapy.</brief_summary>
