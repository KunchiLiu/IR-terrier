	<brief_summary>To determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in HIV infected patients, and the consequences on secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone mineral density (BMD). Also, to establish the improvement in vitamin D status, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and BMD, in case of receiving vitamin D supplementation, during a follow up period of at least 1 year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Hypovitaminosis D on Bone Disease in HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study deals with the impact of vitamin D on metabolism and bone health in HIV infected patients. To answer the questions about the importance of this hormone in this population, we designed a cohort study about the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (measured as 25-hydroxy-vitamin D), classifying it in severe deficiency (&lt;10 ng/ml), deficiency (&lt; 20 ng/ml), or insufficiency (&lt; 30 ng/ml), the relationship with secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH &gt; 65 pg/ml), and related BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). These results will be adjusted by baseline factors, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, risk practice for HIV infection, CD4+ count, antiretroviral therapy, and HIV RNA level. In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation according to clinical decision, it will be evaluated the changes in percentage of hypovitaminosis D and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, and the effect on BMD. Bone biomarkers will be collected to determine the impact of changes secondary to vitamin D improvement in the bone evolution.</detailed_description>
