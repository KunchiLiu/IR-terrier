	<brief_title>Genetically Informed Smoking Cessation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal is to determine whether genetic markers can be used to optimize smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to enhance efficacy, medication adherence, and reduce side effects. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability, and smoking cessation reverses the risk of mortality. However, cessation failure is common despite available cessation medications, which are associated with different efficacy, side effects, adherence, use constraints, and costs. This challenge can be addressed by improving current treatments via personalized medicine based on individual genetic markers to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects. We propose a prospective, genotype-based stratified randomization trial to compare two smoking cessation medications (combination NRT [patch and lozenge], varenicline vs. placebo) for 3 months in 720 smokers with known genotypes. This study uses a stratified randomization trial design based on a subject's pertinent genotype for smoking cessation. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine if CHRNA5 genotype moderates the effect of medication (combination NRT, varenicline, vs. placebo) on abstinence. In Aim 2, we will determine if CHRNA5 genotype predicts medication adherence and side effects. In Aim 3, we will incorporate multiple genotypes and other predictors in order to develop a clinical treatment assignment algorithm for cessation success. This work can result in improved physician care of patients who smoke, overall smoking cessation success, and prevention of cancer, heart, and lung disease.</detailed_description>
