	<brief_summary>As low back pain (LBP) imposes a heavy socioeconomic burden, early detection of pathologic intervertebral disc change in young adults holds high clinical relevance as a common structural cause of LBP. The investigators therefore assessed the feasibility of using X-ray disc space height measurements as a predictive evaluation method of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and degeneration in LBP patients in their early 20s.</brief_summary>
