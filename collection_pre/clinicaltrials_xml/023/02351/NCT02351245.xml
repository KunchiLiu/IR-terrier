	<brief_title>Clinical Characteristics of Lip Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemangiomas involving lip are of special concern, since they occur in a prominent location on the face and can distort lip anatomy and lead to disfunction. Infantile hemangiomas in lip had significantly higher incidence than the others. It is often difficult to decide which patient with an lip hemangioma is at higher risk. The investigators are interested in conducting a study on the clinical features of lip hemangiomas. The investigators are collecting medical records and photos of lip hemangiomas, including demographic information, maternal process, birth, location, size and complication. Based on the data, sum up the main points of clinical characteristics and complication.</detailed_description>
