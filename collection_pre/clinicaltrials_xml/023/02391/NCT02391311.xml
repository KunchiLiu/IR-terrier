	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to conduct a small, self-contained project to test the hypothesis that tDCS will augment SOP cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) in older HIV+ adults. The investigators will randomly assign 60 HIV+ older adults (i.e., â‰¥ 50 years old) to 10-hours in either a SOP CRT + sham tDCS condition (n=30) or SOP CRT + active tDCS condition (n=30) and examine neurocognitive functioning at baseline and 6 weeks post-intervention. Hypothesis 1: The SOP CRT + active tDCS condition will show larger proximal (i.e., SOP) gains than the SOP CRT + sham tDCS condition. Hypothesis 2: The active tDCS condition will demonstrate generalization to secondary neurocognitive domains compared to the sham tDCS condition.</brief_summary>
