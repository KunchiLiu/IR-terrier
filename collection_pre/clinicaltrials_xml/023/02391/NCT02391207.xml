	<brief_summary>Major hepatectomies are generally selected for tumors involving the hepatic vein (HV) at the caval confluence (CC). As alternative, HV reconstruction has been proposed. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a HV-sparing policy guided by intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) in a cohort of patients having at least one colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) in contact with a HV at CC. HV section can be avoided in the large majority of cases thanking to CLMs detachment or to HV partial resection or reconstruction: this policy seems feasible, safe, reduces the need of major hepatectomies, and oncologically provides an adequate local control.</brief_summary>
