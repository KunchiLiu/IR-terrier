	<detailed_description>This is a prospective traditional feasibility study evaluating Cartiva® SCI for CMC for the treatment of first carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis.The objectives of this clinical study are to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Cartiva® SCI for CMC in terms of pain relief and improvement of joint function in the treatment of first CMC OA and to evaluate Cartiva® SCI for CMC device performance in order to establish the parameters for a pivotal trial. Follow up visits will occur at the following time points after the surgical procedure: 14 days, 42 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, and range as appropriate. Categorical values will be summarized using the number of observations and percentages as appropriate. Chi‐square or Fisher exact tests will be used for comparisons of categorical data. Paired t‐tests will used for the comparisons of continuous data. For statistical testing, an alpha of 0.05 is used as an acceptance standard and all testing are conducted as two tailed. Also, 95% confidence intervals for mean values or proportion values will be provided as appropriate. Since this is a feasibility study and no formal hypothesis is to be tested, p‐values will be reported without adjustment for multiple comparisons. All analyses will be conducted using SAS version 9.1 or later.</detailed_description>
