	<brief_summary>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and adolescents. Clinical and biochemical evidence suggests that deficiencies of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could be related to ADHD. PUFAs are the major components of brain with important physiologically active functions. Aim: Study the relationship between omega3 blood values and ADHD clinical status. Methods: The investigators will recruit 30 children, who have been diagnosed with ADHD by a child psychiatrist. In addition the investigators will recruit a control group of 30 children without ADHD and related neuropsychiatric syndromes. Blood will be taken from all children. The ADHD children will be asked to consume omega3 capsules for 6 month. After 3 and 6 months, all children will undergo clinical examination and blood tests will be taken for omega3 index analysis. Blind frozen samples of isolated red blood cell (RBC) will be analyzed according to the omega3 index methodology.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major problem in children and adolescents. Clinical and biochemical evidence suggests that deficiencies of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could be related to ADHD. PUFAs are the major components of brain with important physiologically active functions. Aim: To investigate influence effects of omega3 dietary supplementation on ADHD symptoms and the measured blood values. Methods: The study will be authorized by the Ziv Helsinki Committee and the Ministry of Health. Written Informed consent will obtained from parents. The investigators will recruit 30 children, who have been diagnosed with ADHD by a child psychiatrist. In addition the investigators will recruit a control group of 30 children without ADHD and related neuropsychiatric syndromes. Blood will be taken from all children.</detailed_description>
