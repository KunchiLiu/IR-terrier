	<brief_summary>Delayed clamping of the umbilical cord (DCC) has been shown to have some benefits for preterm infants. Initiation of breathing before cord clamping is also thought to be beneficial. Since some preterm infants do not breathe well on their own immediately after birth, assisting ventilation during delayed cord clamping might have additional benefit beyond DCC alone. "VentFirst Pilot" will assess feasibility and safety of assisting ventilation of preterm infants during 90 seconds of DCC which is essential before proceeding to a randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mothers expected to deliver an infant at 24-32 completed weeks' gestation will be approached for consent. When the infant is delivered, members of the neonatology team will be at the mother's side and will provide initial steps of resuscitation (position, suction, stimulate) per guidelines of the Neonatology Resuscitation Program (NRP). At 30 seconds after birth, the infant will receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if breathing well, or positive pressure ventilation (PPV) if not breathing well. At 90 seconds, the umbilical cord will be cut and the remainder of the resuscitation and stabilization will be carried out in the usual location.</detailed_description>
