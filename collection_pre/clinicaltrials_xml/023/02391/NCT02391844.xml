	<detailed_description>The objective of this single center is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oxycodone Extended Release (MNK-795) in postoperative pain following common musculoskeletal surgical procedures. Knee surgery being the most common surgery performed in the US, the investigators chose the model. The investigators also want to look at the flexible-dosing and titration which is the common way pain managed by clinicians. This is an open-label study of MNK 795 to be described in the procedures section. Primary endpoint: â€¢ Change in pain from baseline (before taking the first dose of study medication) measured on NRS Secondary endpoints: - Patient/Investigator Global assessment of treatment satisfaction - Safety evaluation with adverse event monitoring</detailed_description>
