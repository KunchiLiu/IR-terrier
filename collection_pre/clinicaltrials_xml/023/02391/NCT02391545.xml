	<brief_title>A Study of Duvelisib in Combination With Rituximab or Obinutuzumab in Subjects With Previously Untreated CD20+ Follicular Lymphoma (CONTEMPO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-arm, open-label, Phase 1b/2 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI-145 in combination with rituximab and IPI-145 in combination with obinutuzumab in subjects with previously untreated CD20+ FL. The study will be conducted in two parts, a Safety Lead-in (Part 1) followed by a randomized, 2-Stage Design in Part 2. Each treatment arm will be assessed independently for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within Part 1.</detailed_description>
