	<brief_summary>The investigators will evaluate ventricular reversed remodelling after double lung transplantation (LTX) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Reversed remodelling will be compared with control patients without PAH (e.g. Cystic Fibrosis) who will also undergo LTX.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ventricular Reversed Remodeling After LTX in PAH Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, pre-LTX and six-months post-LTX measurements will be compared with each other and between the primary and control group. Pre- and post-LTX measurements include: Past medical history: Including basic diagnosis; interventions, surgery and transplant related complications (re-operations, hospitalizations, infections) and medication history; These data will be collected by studying the medical files including surgical reports. Present medical history: Including NYHA class. Physical examination: Including length and weight. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging: - Ventricular volume, function and mass measurements - Flow measurements of the pulmonary artery and aorta - Disease specific measurements (e.g. septal bowing, RV trabecularisation, etc.) - T1-mapping Transthoracic Echocardiography Resting ECG: Disease specific electrophysiological findings (e.g. QRS-duration, right bundle branch block). Laboratory evaluation: - NT-pro-BNP - eGFR - Remaining serum will be stored.</detailed_description>
