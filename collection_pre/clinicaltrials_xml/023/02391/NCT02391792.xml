	<brief_summary>Microparticules (MPs) result from plasma cell membrane remodeling and shedding after cell stimulation or apoptosis. MPs are know recognized as a pool of bioactive messengers with merging role in pathophysiology of immune and cardiovascular diseases. MPs have been characterized during septic shock and may contribute to dissemination of pro-inflammatory and procoagulant mediators. This a prospective observational study of circulating MPs and blood coagulation in septic shock patients admitted in medical intensive care units (ICUs) of four tertiary hospitals at baseline (D1, D2, D3, D4, D7).</brief_summary>
