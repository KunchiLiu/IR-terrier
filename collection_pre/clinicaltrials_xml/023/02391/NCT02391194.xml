	<brief_title>Trial of AVB-620 in Women With Primary, Non-Recurrent Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the safety and tolerability of AVB-620 administered as an IV infusion to women with primary, non-recurrent breast cancer undergoing surgery. The study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics of AVB-620 in this subject population and determine the dose of AVB-620 needed to generate a fluorescence signal in tumor and lymph node tissue to enable fluorescence recordings and image analysis with an imaging system. The study will also evaluate the effect of timing of AVB-620 administration, relative to surgery, on fluorescence characteristics.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or Stage IIII, primary invasive carcinoma of the breast Primary surgical treatment is planned to be a mastectomy or lumpectomy.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 Adequate renal function Lab values (hematology and chemistry) within institution's normal laboratory limits Willing to remain onsite for approximately 24 hours after administration of AVB620 or, if required, stay overnight after the surgical procedure If the subject received neoadjuvant therapy, residual tumor is present (to be determined by the primary surgeon) If the subject received prior anthracycline therapy, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be within institution's normal limits Subject has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Recurrent ipsilateral breast cancer Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or biologic therapy for current clinically or biopsyproven node positive breast cancer within 4 weeks before the planned surgery. Open surgery in the ipsilateral breast within 1 year of AVB620 administration History of radiation therapy to ipsilateral breast Abnormal cardiac rhythm not controlled with medication, history of stroke, coronary events, and/or heart failure within 1 year of AVB620 administration Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders History of drugrelated anaphylactic reactions or allergic reactions; subjects with an active diagnosis of uncontrolled airway hyperactivity, uncontrolled asthma, or asthma requiring oral corticosteroids will be excluded History of renal disease or current evidence of renal disease Current diagnosis of any other active or clinically significant nonbreast cancer Systemic investigational drug of any kind within 6 weeks of AVB620 administration Pregnant or breast feeding</criteria>
