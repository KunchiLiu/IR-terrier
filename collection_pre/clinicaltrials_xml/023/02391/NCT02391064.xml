	<brief_summary>Cognitive disorders are common in early stage of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and concern mainly information processing speed (IPS) which also influences with other cognitive functions such as attention, working memory and executive functions. The investigators validated a computerized test of IPS, the computerized speed cognitive test (CSCT), which can detect disorders of IPS in MS. A short battery was proposed, the brief cognitive assessment for multiple sclerosis (BICAMS) battery, which combines the Symbol-Digit Modalities-test (SDMT), a test of the IPS, and two measures of episodic memory. On the same principle, the investigators propose to validate a short computerized battery to improve the feasibility (brief computerized cognitive assessment (BCCAMS)) combining the CSCT and a computerized test of visual episodic memory. Purpose: to establish the screening value of a brief computerized cognitive assessment (BCCAMS) combining the computerized speed cognitive test (CSCT) and a new computerized episodic visual memory test (CEVMT) in French-speaking patients with multiple sclerosis as compared to a reference battery (MACFIMS).</brief_summary>
