	<brief_summary>Stable Asthma patients (GINA 1-2) stay 6 days in a row for 4 hours per day in a hypoxic chamber simulating 2800m above sea level. Study participants will be blinded to the treatment given and divided into a hypoxic and a sham group (about 360m above sea level). Effects of this intermittent hypoxia on the asthmatic inflammation of these patients will be measured. The primary endpoint is the change in forced exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) before and after the study. Secondary endpoints include blood parameters, lung function testing and questionnaires.</brief_summary>
