	<detailed_description>Tele-monitoring involves a personal monitoring system used to analyze data to provide relevant health information back to the treating clinician and the user. The monitoring system remotely monitors electrocardiographic (ECG) signals, heart rate, breathing rate, and activity levels. Additional devices will be integrated with the monitoring device to assess blood pressure and weight. Health Coaching involves a team of health care professionals including a registered nurse (RN). The health care team creates a plan specific to the patient and provides guidance on nutrition' medications, and exercise. The data collected by the remote monitoring device will assist the care team in patient management.</detailed_description>
