	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical (range of motion, weight bearing, quality of life) and radiographic outcome (boney consolidation) between open reduction and internal fixation using locking compression plates with revision prosthesis using a non-cemented long femoral stem in a group of patients with a Vancouver type-B2, B3 and C periprosthetic fracture after primary total hip replacement.</brief_summary>
