	<brief_title>Early Gastric Decompression During Advanced Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (EGD_ACLS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects and setting : adult sudden cardiac arrest patients in out of hospital, and transported to emergency department for advanced resuscitation treatment Interventions: first step, establish the advanced airway, after then insertion the naso (or oro)-gastric tube during CPR Data collection: live observation and review the automatically recoding data Missing or failed data should be collected and descriped Study period and sample size: numbers of participants necessary to identify the effect of interventions; 12 months or lesser were anticipated Analysis: All collected data can be analysed by Statistical programs</detailed_description>
