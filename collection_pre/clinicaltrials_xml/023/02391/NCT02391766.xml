	<brief_summary>After diagnosis of a dementing illness, patients and their spouses have many concerns related to the disease and their future. This often leads to poor psychological well-being and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the family. Support for Empowerment has been proven to be an effective method to improve prognosis of asthma, heart failure, osteoarthritis.and diabetes. However empowering interventions have not been studied in dementia. Therefore, the investigators aim was to examine, in an objective-oriented group intervention, the efficacy of empowerment support program (ESP) on the HRQoL of dementia patients and their spousal caregivers as well as on the sense of competence and psychological well-being of caregivers. Methods: During the years 2014 to 15, 180 dementia patients and their spouses will be recruited from memory clinics or day centers and randomized into two arms: 90 patients for group-based ESP sessions including topics selected by the participants and the use of the by us for us guides, 90 patients will serve as controls in usual community care. Sessions may include topics on dementia, active lifestyle and prevention for cognitive decline, spousal relationship, future planning and emotional well-being. The patients and spouses will have their separate group sessions (ten participants per group) once a week for eight weeks.</brief_summary>
