	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation study in participants with advanced solid tumors to determine the pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose of ABBV-075 at different monotherapy dosing schedules. In addition the study will evaluate the safety. tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of ABBV-075 monotherapy or combination therapy in disease specific expansion cohorts.</brief_summary>
