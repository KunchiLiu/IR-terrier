	<brief_title>Assessment of the Symbiotic Fermented Milk in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common digestive disorders in the developed world which. It is associated to numerous symptoms, of which the most characteristic are recurrent pain or discomfort in the abdominal region, changes and difficulties related to bowel movements, and bloating. Although not dangerous, the disease may significantly impair the patients' quality of life. Treatment is symptomatic, but currently not very efficient. The use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS is a promising approach and has been the subject of much research in the last two decades. The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled study is to assess changes in health-related quality of life in patients with constipation-predominant IBS after regular consumption of symbiotic fermented milk (containing probiotics and dietary fibres) and to assess its effects on some symptoms, like abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and chronic constipation.</detailed_description>
