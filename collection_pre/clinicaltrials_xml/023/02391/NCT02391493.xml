	<brief_summary>For bilingual and multilingual patients, brain activation and Electric Stimulation Mapping studies have shown that different languages may be localized, at least partially, in distinct microanatomical systems located within the same gross anatomical areas. The present investigation involves both types of healthy bilinguals with carefully controlled proficiency levels, as well as bilingual patients suffering from low-grade glioma. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data will be collected while the participants perform a picture naming task in blocked conditions for both languages (either English or French) or in switch condition (English and French). A stimulation mapping study will be conducted in the patients during awake surgery with the same tasks.</brief_summary>
