	<brief_summary>Non invasive methods are the only available methods to stage liver fibrosis during pregnancy. The safety of elastometry - ultrasound based - is obvious, as medical supervision of pregnancy is based on ultrasonography, both methods using same wavelengths. Therefore, this method is sometimes used in pregnant women with recent diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis infection, whereas its validity in pregnant women has never been studied. This lack of data justifies our study.</brief_summary>
