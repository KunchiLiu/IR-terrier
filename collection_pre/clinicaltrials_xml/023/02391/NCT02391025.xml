	<brief_summary>This is a single center cross-sectional imaging study investigating the use of gallium-68 citrate PET in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are planning to undergo a metastatic tumor biopsy on protocol CC# 125519. The study population will consist of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are undergoing a metastatic tumor biopsy as part of clinical protocol CC# 125519, with evidence of resistance to androgen signaling inhibition. The study will involve gallium-68 PET scan obtained at single time point, followed by radiographically-guided metastatic tumor biopsy within 14 days of PET scan.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) on LHRH analogue or have had prior orchiectomy. Presence of one or more metastases by standard radiographic scans including crosssectional imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and whole body bone scan that is safely accessible to tumor biopsy in the judgment of treating clinician and/or Interventional Radiology Evidence of disease progression by PCWG2 criteria during or within 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation with potent androgen signaling inhibitor, including abiraterone, enzalutamide, ARN509, or a combination. Patients must be either receiving or within 4 weeks of discontinuation of androgen signaling inhibitor at the time of PET imaging and tumor biopsy. Age 18 years or older at the time of study entry Platelets &gt;75,000/Î¼l and PT or INR and a PTT &lt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN within 14 days prior to biopsy. Intervening systemic therapy between discontinuation of androgen signaling inhibitor and planned date of gallium citrate PET. History of radiation therapy to the target metastatic lesion selected for tumor biopsy Contraindication to biopsy including uncontrolled bleeding diathesis. Active infection within 14 days of study enrollment Contraindications for MRI (for patients undergoing PET/MR study), including presence of pacemaker, aneurysm clip, implanted device, or severe claustrophobia</criteria>
