	<brief_summary>Patients in Clopidogrel therapy alone or in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) presenting with a hip-fracture represent the surgeon with the dilemma of putting the patient at risk of a major blood loss during and after surgery, or putting the patient at risk of a thromboembolic event after surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the risk of a major blood loss in patients that are still under the effect of Clopidogrel or DAPT during or after hip-fracture surgery is relatively low. The investigators have conducted a retrospective observational study on hip-fracture patients to test this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
