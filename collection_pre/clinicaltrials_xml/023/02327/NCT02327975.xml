	<brief_summary>Physical inactivity is a health problem that affects people worldwide and has been identified as the fourth largest risk factor for overall mortality (contributing to 6% of deaths globally). Many researchers have tried to increase physical activity (PA) levels through traditional methods without much success. Thus, many researchers are turning to mobile technology as an emerging method for changing health behaviours.The study consists of a physical activity intervention through a mobile application in elderly. The study is a 3x2 model, in which the sample is distributed in three study groups (over 53 years) and were evaluated at 10 weeks from baseline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prescription of Physical Exercise Through Mobile Application in Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives of the study: - Evaluate effectiveness of a physical exercise program for 10 weeks to improve fitness, cardiovascular, anthropometric and body composition parameters in people over 53 years. - Examine effects of exercise intervention delivered through a mobile application (WhatsApp) on fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric and body composition in people over 53 years. Hypotheses of the study: - An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in people over 53 years. - An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective to increase physical fitness in people over 53 years. - An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective in reducing BMI, percent body fat; and in increasing the percentage of muscle mass in people over 53 years. - 10-weeks face-to-face intervention of physical exercise obtains greater improvements in fitness parameters than an intervention delivered via mobile application in people over 53 years. - 10-weeks face-to-face intervention of physical exercise obtains greater improvements in anthropometric and body composition than an intervention delivered via mobile application in people over 53 years.</detailed_description>
