	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs/potential recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of the combination treatments of MLN2480 + MLN0128, MLN2480 + alisertib, MLN2480 + paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1B Study of MLN2480 in Combination With MLN0128 or Alisertib, or Paclitaxel, or Cetuximab, or Irinotecan in Adult Patients With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called MLN2480. MLN2480 is being tested to evaluate side effects and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for future studies when administered in combination with three other medications. This study will assess the safety of MLN2480 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants with solid nonhematologic malignancies who have failed standard therapies. The study will be conducted in two phases, the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion Phase. Approximately 49 participatns will be enrolled in the Escalation phase. Participants in this phase will be assigned to one of the five treatment groups: - MLN2480 + MLN0128 - MLN2480 + Alisertib - MLN2480 + Paclitaxel - MLN2480 + Cetuximab - MLN2480 + Irinotecan Once the MTD for each combination treatment arm has been established in the Escalation Phase, one or more of the combination treatments will be selected for the Expansion Phase. Approximately 76 participants will be enrolled in the Expansion Phase. This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 14 months. Participants will make approximately 43 visits to the clinic including an end of study visit 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All Treatment Arms: 1. Informed consent. 2. Male or female participants 18 years or older. 3. Participants who, in the opinion of the treating physician, have failed standard therapies and for whom a phase 1 trial is an appropriate option. 4. Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor. For Expansion phase: Tumors must be measurable and of the protocol specified genetic mutational status, where applicable. 5. Recovered (ie, ≤ Grade 1 toxicity) from adverse effects (except alopecia) of prior therapy. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01. 7. Expected survival time of at least 3 months in the opinion of the investigator. 8. Block of banked tumor tissue and/or ≥ 10 unstained slides. Participants who satisfy all other eligibility criteria but do not have banked tissue/slides may be asked to consent to baseline biopsy. 9. Suitable vein access for the studyrequired blood sampling. 10. Thyroid function tests consistent with stable thyroid function. Note: Participants on a stable dose of thyroid replacement therapy for a suggested minimum of 12 weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1 are eligible. 11.

Female participants who are post menopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception through 120 days (4 months) after the last dose of study drug for participants in Arms 1, 2, and 5, and through 6 months for participants in Arms 3 and 4, or agree to practice true abstinence. 13. Male patients who, even if surgically sterilized, agree to practice effective barrier contraception through 120 days (4 months) after the last dose of study drug for participants in Arms 1, 2, and 5, and through 6 months for participants in Arms 3, and 4, or agree to practice true abstinence. 14. Additional inclusion criteria for Arm 3 Expansion Only (MLN2480 + paclitaxel): a. Participants with KRAS exon 2 or BRAF nonV600 mutationpositive non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received a minimum of 1 but not more than 2 prior cytotoxicapproved regimens. 15. Additional inclusion criteria for Arms 4 and 5 Expansion Only (MLN2480 + cetuximab; MLN2480 + irinotecan): 1. Participants with CRC who have received a minimum of 1 but not more than 2 prior cytotoxicapproved regimens. All treatment arms: 1. Female participants who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding. 2. History of any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with safe protocol completion. 3. History of uncontrolled brain metastasis unless: previously treated with surgery, wholebrain radiation, or stereotactic radiosurgery; stable disease for ≥ 60 days without steroid use (or stable steroid dose established for ≥ 28 days before the first dose of MLN2480). 4. Ongoing seizure disorder or a requirement for antieplieptics. 5. Recent prior therapies, including: chemotherapy and hormonal therapy ≤ 4 weeks or 4 half lives, whichever occurs first, before administration of study drug; immunotherapy/monoclonal antibody use ≤ 4 weeks before administration of MLN2480; or radiation therapy ≤ 3 weeks before administration of study drug. 6. Chronic therapeutic corticosteroid use with the exception of replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency or corticosteroid inhalers. 7. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; Prior allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplantation, or active condition of chronic immune suppression is not allowed. 8. Concomitant use, or administration ≤ 14 days before first dose of study drug(s), of clinically significant enzyme inducers. 9. Treatment with gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) within 14 days before the first dose of MLN2480. 14. History of or current illicit drug use, drug abuse, or alcohol abuse. 10. Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of study drug. 11. Inability to comply with study requirements. 12. Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the investigator or Millennium, make the patient unsuitable for enrollment. 13. Expansion phase only: Prior treatment with RAF, MEK, or other inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. 14. Additional exclusion criteria for Arm 2 Only (MLN2480 + alisertib): a.
