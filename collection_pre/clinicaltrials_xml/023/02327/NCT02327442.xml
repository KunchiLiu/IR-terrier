	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, biodistribution, dosimetric properties of the positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical agent 68Ga-NOTA-NFB. To preliminarily evaluate its application in glioma diagnosis. To assess the application of 68Ga-NOTA-NFB PET/CT in the evaluation of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer before and after the therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-NOTA-NFB: Radiation Dosimetry in Healthy Volunteers and Applications in Glioma Patients or Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>6 healthy volunteers with whole-body PET/CT scans 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after tracer injection (mean dose, 4.93 Â± 0.10 mCi) will be performed. During the imaging period, 1 mL blood samples will be obtained specifically at 1, 3, 5, 10, 30,60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after the injection, for time-activity curve calculations. The estimated radiation doses will be calculated by using OLINDA/EXM software. 8-10 patients with glioma will be enrolled for the clinical study of diagnosing glioma, they will be performed with both 68Ga-NOTA-NFB PET/CT and18F-FDG PET/CT scans before surgery. The preoperative images are compared and correlated with the pathologically report. Next, the expression of CXCR4 will be determined by immunohistochemical staining of the resected brain tumor tissues. 30 patients with breast cancer will be underwent 68Ga-NOTA-NFB PET/CT and18F-FDG PET/CT scans before and after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SUV of lesions before and after therapy will be contrasted.</detailed_description>
