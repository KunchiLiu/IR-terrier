	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream when it is given as a single oral dose and as an intravenous infusion (given directly into a vein via a small needle). The study will also provide information on how well the study drug is tolerated when given as a tablet in combination with giving it intravenously, and information on any changes in heart function. The study will last about 10 days. Screening is required within 28 days before study drug is given.</brief_summary>
