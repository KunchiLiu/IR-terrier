	<brief_title>Comparison of Different Botulinum Toxin A Injection Patterns in the Treatment of Blepharospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The authors performed a prospective double-blinded randomised clinical trial of 60 patients with an established diagnosis of benign essential blepharospasm from February 2013 to December 2015. Patients received a full injection pattern of 5 sites on one eye and a medial lower eyelid waived injection pattern of 4 sites on the other eye randomly. They were surveyed on ocular surface disease index (OSDI), Jankovic rating scale (JRS), blepharospasm disability index (BSDI) prior to injection and 1week, 1month and 3 months after injection. At these time points, closure of the eyelid, tear break up time (BUT), Schirmer test ï¼©, and lower lid tear meniscus height (TMH) were also measured.</detailed_description>
