	<brief_summary>Bed rest has been a commonly prescribed intervention for high risk pregnancies, despite the lack of data to support its benefits, and increasing evidence pointing to potential harms. In this study, the effects of bed rest compared to moderate activity will be on maternal mood and muscle strength will be evaluated in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Bed Rest Versus Moderate Activity in Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically, bed rest has been considered a beneficial treatment option for patients with high risk pregnancies. The definition of bed rest varies between providers, and can mean anything from being completely bed-bound for months at a time (sometimes called strict bed rest) to walking around within the home a few times a day (sometimes called modified bed rest). Recent studies have highlighted potential harmful effects from bed rest. However, scientific studies need to be carried out to compare the effects of bed rest and moderate activity on the health of mothers and babies. PPROM is defined as rupture of membranes prior to 37 weeks gestation prior to the onset of labor, and affects approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the Unites States. Women with PPROM are routinely managed in the inpatient setting from the time of diagnosis until delivery. Therefore, PPROM patients are a closely supervised and easily accessible cohort of women. In this study, participating patients with PPROM will be randomized into two groups: bedrest or moderate activity. Maternal mood and muscle strength will be assessed at enrollment and after delivery to determine whether there are significant differences in these outcomes in the two groups.</detailed_description>
