	<brief_summary>The purpose of this small randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the impact of a brief (16 hour) 3rd trimester mindfulness-based childbirth education program, "Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth," with a standard care/"treatment as usual" (TAU) active control condition of standard hospital- and community-based childbirth education. The MIL group is expected to demonstrate a reduction in fear of labor (less pain catastrophizing and greater childbirth self-efficacy), less perceived pain in labor, less use of pain medication in labor, greater birth satisfaction, and better prenatal and postpartum psychological adjustment compared to the TAU group.</brief_summary>
