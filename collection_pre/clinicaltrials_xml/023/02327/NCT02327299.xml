	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent nutrient deficiency which is a public health problem, especially in developing countries. There are several strategies to correct iron deficiency in populations: besides supplementation with tablets, one of the most sustainable and effective strategies on medium term has been iron fortification, the addition of iron to regularly consumed foods. In fortification, the chemical nature of the compound to be added plays an important role: depending on the compound sensory qualities of the fortified foods can vary as well as the iron absorption. Iron pyrophosphate (FePP) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are two commonly used iron fortification compounds in foods such as rice, breakfast cereals, pasta, flour and others. We want to test the effect of addition a food stabilizer on the absorption of ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) when added to bouillon, as was recently suggested by in vitro experiments in the laboratory.</brief_summary>
