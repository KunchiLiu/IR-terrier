	<mesh_term>Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Hyperkinesis</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Vortioxetine</mesh_term>
	<criteria>The patient is aged ≥18 years and ≤55 years. The patient is willing and able to attend study appointments within the specified time windows. The patient is an outpatient. The patient is diagnosed with a primary diagnosis of ADHD according to the DSM5™ classification. The patient has an AISRS total score ≥24. The patient has a CGIS rating ≥4 (moderately ill or worse). The patient has previously been treated with vortioxetine. The patient has any current psychiatric disorder (DSMIVTR™ criteria), other than ADHD, as assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The patient has a known firstdegree relative with bipolar disorder. The patient suffers from intellectual disability as evaluated by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) II vocabulary and matrix. The patient suffers from organic mental disorders, or mental disorders due to a general medical condition (DSM5™ criteria). The patient has reported current use of, or has tested positive for, drugs of abuse (opiates,methadone, cocaine, amphetamines [including ecstasy], barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids). If a patient tests positive for opiates due to incidental use of codeine containing medication, as assessed in a clinical interview, the drug screen may be repeated up to three weeks later but the retest result must be available from the central laboratory latest at Visit 2 and has to be negative for this patient to be eligible for enrolment. If a patient tests positive for amphetamines due to his/her ADHD current treatment, as confirmed by a clinical interview, the patient is eligible for enrolment provided this treatment is discontinued two weeks prior to the Baseline Visit. The patient has a history of two prior failed (&lt;50% improvement in symptoms) adequate trials of ADHD treatment. The patient has any other disorder for which the treatment takes priority over treatment of ADHD or is likely to interfere with study treatment or impair treatment compliance. The patient has a history of moderate or severe head trauma or other neurological disorders or systemic medical diseases that are, in the investigator's opinion, likely to affect central nervous system functioning. The patient has attempted suicide within the last 6 months or is at significant risk of suicide (either in the opinion of the Investigator or defined as a "yes" to suicidal ideation questions 4 or 5 or answering "yes" to suicidal behaviour on the ColumbiaSuicide Rating Scale (CSSRS) within the last 12 months). Other protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria do apply</criteria>
