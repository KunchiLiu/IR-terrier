	<brief_summary>Dental caries (tooth decay) is a disease with significant public health implications afflicting low-income children, with marked rural disparities in disease prevalence and treatment. More than 70% of 11th grade children in Crook, Deschutes and Jefferson counties have experienced tooth decay. Effective approaches to prevent decay include brushing with fluoridated toothpaste and professional dental care. Medicaid enrolled children are legally entitled to dental care under Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT), yet &lt;50% had any care in 2010. Free distribution of toothpaste and toothbrushes combined with parental education can increase toothbrushing frequency and reducing tooth decay. However, many parents are confused about when to start, how much and often toothpaste should be used, and how to overcome behavioral difficulties in brushing toddlers' teeth or getting older children to brush their own. The investigators' objective is to implement and evaluate a community-wide toothpaste distribution campaign enhanced by telephone support for OHP children and adolescents and their families in Central Oregon</brief_summary>
