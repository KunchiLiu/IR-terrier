	<brief_summary>Generally, osteoarthris (OA) is considered as primarily cartilage disease. However, as we and others have previously reported, a portion of OA might be caused primarily by bone alterations. In this study, we prospectively and retrospectively show that the bone altertations may affect OA primarily in all of the joints. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a joint disease when immune system attacks synovium. Joint destruction occurrs continuously if suitable treatment is not performed. The etiology of RA is still largely unknown. As with OA, RA can be primarily damaged in bone, instead of cartilage. Here we prospectively and retrospectively show that the bone altertations may affect RA primarily in all of the joints.</brief_summary>
