	<brief_summary>Treatment of IBS is very problematic. Despite the wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, there is no universally accepted approach. In recent years, the low FODMAP diet has been developed, a dietary approach that aims to relieve the symptoms of IBS. FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Di-saccharides, Mono-saccharides and Polyols) are a group of dietary sugars that may be poorly absorbed in the small intestine and fermented by bacteria to produce gas. Ingestion of FODMAPs may also result in alterations in fluid content in the colon and trigger functional gut symptoms in some individuals. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the FODMAP diet in Israel in improving symptoms of IBS compared to the standard dietary advice.</brief_summary>
