	<brief_summary>The age-related increase in falls is strongly associated with a decline in muscle strength by the mechanism of sarcopenia. There has been great interest in developing approaches to counteract the effects of sarcopenia, and thereby reduce the age-related decline in muscle mass with vitamin D that have muscular effect. However, a limited number of studies demonstrate a vitamin D analog (alfacalcidol) increase in lower body muscle strength in adults with vitamin D deficiency. A double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in order to determine the effect of alfacalcidol on the upper-body muscle strength in Indonesian elderly women in age group of 60 or more who had low handgrip strength.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Alfacalcidol on Muscle Strength in Elderly Indonesian Women : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 122 elderly women were enrolled to this study. It was determined subjects with handgrip strength less than 22 kg and measured using handheld dynamometer. There were 95 subjects fulfilled the eligible criteria. These subjects were randomized into two groups, one group of 47 subjects received alfacalcidol 0.5 mcg/day and the other group received placebo. Each subject was given calcium 500 mg/day. After 12 weeks of intervention, 88 subjects had the second muscle strength measurement (7 dropped out).</detailed_description>
