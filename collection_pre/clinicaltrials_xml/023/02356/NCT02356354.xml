	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to understand why the regeneration of the cutaneous sensory nerve fibers is poor in post-burn scar. The presence or the lack of several molecular factors known to regulate neuronal cell development will be evaluate and compared within biopsies from healthy skin and post-burn scar.</brief_summary>
