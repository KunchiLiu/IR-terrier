	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the overall clinical comfort performance of enfilcon A and senofilcon A lenses over 15-minutes of lens wear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Comfort Evaluation of Two Marketed Spherical Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of the clinical comfort performance of two contact lenses to determine performance advantages or disadvantages of enfilcon A compared to senofilcon A. The key variable of interest is initial comfort differences.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Based on his/her knowledge, must be in good general health. 2. Be 18 to 38 years old. 3. Be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and complete all specified evaluation. 4. Read, indicate understanding of, and sign Written Informed Consent. 5. Be existing or successfully adapted users of soft contact lenses, but not currently wearing either of the study lenses (Avaira or Oasys) being evaluated in this trial. 6. Require a visual correction in both eyes. 7. Require a prescription between +8.00D and 12.00D and have less than or equal to 0.75D of astigmatism in both eyes. 8. Achieve visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye with a spherical contact lens prescription. 9. Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purposes of this study a normal eye is defined as one having: No amblyopia. No evidence of lid abnormality or infection (e.g. entropion, ectropion, chalazia, recurrent styes). lamp findings Grade 2 or above: corneal edema, tarsal abnormalities, and conjunctival injection). No other active ocular disease (e.g. glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, cornea [infiltrates], conjunctiva, lids, and intraocular infection or inflammation of an allergic, bacterial, or viral etiology). No aphakia. 1. 0.75D or greater of refractive astigmatism in either eye. 2. Presbyopic or current monovision contact lens wear. 3. Cannot be currently wearing either lenses (Avaira or Oasys). 4. Presence of clinically significant (grade 24) anterior segment abnormalities; inflammation such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated structures. 5. Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medication which might interfere with contact lens wear. 6. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as: Pathological dry eye or associated findings Pterygium, pinguecula or corneal scars within the visual axis Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from the limbus Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) worse than Grade 1 Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present) Seborrheic eczema, seborrheic conjunctivitis History of corneal ulcer or fungal infections Poor personal hygiene A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity) 7. Contact Lens best corrected Snellen visual acuities (VA) worse than 20/30. 8. Aphakia, Keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea.</criteria>
