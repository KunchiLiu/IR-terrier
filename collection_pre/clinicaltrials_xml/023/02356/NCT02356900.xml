	<brief_summary>This study seeks to examine the effectiveness of training while in a hyperoxic-hyperbaric environment for exercise performance at altitude. Subjects will complete a short, high-intensity interval training (HIT) program inside the hyperbaric chamber.Before and after this training phase, all subjects will be tested for maximum aerobic capacity at a simulated high altitude of 15,000ft in a hypobaric chamber, as well as for molecular markers of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in a skeletal muscle biopsy. A group of individuals of similar characteristics completing this training program in a normoxic-normobaric environment will serve as a control.</brief_summary>
