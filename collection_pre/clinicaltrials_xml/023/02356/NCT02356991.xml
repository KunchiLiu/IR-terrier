	<brief_summary>Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and Flt3. Phase I study has shown that the toxicity is manageable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of Famitinib in patients with Advanced Non-squamous and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
