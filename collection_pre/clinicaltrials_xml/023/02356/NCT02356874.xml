	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this multicenter randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate if exercise can modify the disease course and prevent comorbidity in patient with spondyloarthritis (SpA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Exercise on Disease Activity and Cardiovascular Risk for Patients With Axial SpondyloArthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>International guidelines recommend exercise as a cornerstone in the management of SpA. Due to the typical features of SpA with reduced spinal mobility, the main focus for exercise has been flexibility exercise. Exercise trials for this patient group have mainly aimed at improving spinal mobility and there is limited evidence of the potential effects of exercise on disease pathogenesis and CVD risk factors.</detailed_description>
