	<brief_summary>The goal of this protocol is to expand access for patients who lack a fully HLA (Human leukocyte antigen) matched sibling donor and who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). These patients have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease for which HSCT is indicated. These patients are not eligible for other Children's Hospital of Philadelphia IRB approved protocols that utilize CliniMACs technology for T depletion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access Protocol Using CD3+/CD19+ Depleted PBSC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only 25-30% of patients who may benefit from HSCT have a matched related donor. There is a higher rate of complications using cells from an unrelated or partially matched related donor. T cells within the donor cells may cause a complication called graft vs. host disease (GVHD). The goal of this study is to use the CliniMACs device to remove the T cells that cause GVHD, called T cell depletion.</detailed_description>
