	<brief_summary>Rationale for the study: To try and define PEF in cirrhotic patients with CSPH, and maybe to try to find a correlation between HVPG result and PEF result in a way that the result of the PEF test will be able to predict if a patient has CSPH (yes of no). By this, to try and develop a portable office-based device that can produce immediate results in a non-invasive manner in cirrhotic patients and help in evaluating prognosis in these patients in a noninvasive manner. Aim: The aim of this study is to try and characterize the peripheral endothelial function (PEF) in patient with cirrhosis and CSPH. This will be evaluated by measuring the PEF in every patient before evaluating his HVPG level in a hemodynamic study.</brief_summary>
