	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and the function of the collagen Matrix 10808 in humans and to compare it versus the standard therapy, the transplantation of the autologous connective tissue graft. The Collagen Matrix was developed for soft tissue augmentation. It is a three dimensional porous Matrix and consists mainly of Collagen I and III. Study patients must have a single tooth gap with insufficient soft tissue volume after implant placement. Therefore a soft tissue augmentation will be necessary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Investigate Collagen Matrix 10808 for Soft Tissue Volume Augmentation Around Single Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of soft tissue volume augmentation procedures using the autogenous soft tissue graft or the Collagen Matrix 10808 to gain mucosal thickness. Second the safety of the two procedures will be investigated.</detailed_description>
