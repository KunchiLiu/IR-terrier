	<brief_title>rESP Medication With a Single Intravenous Administration and Dose Escalation to Explore the Tolerability ,Safety and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a single center and open test, and the dose of successive incremental method was taken. The study included 4 groups that is 0.5 ug/kg, 1.0ug/kg, 2.0ug/kg and 3.0ug/kg,the pharmacokinetic data (the screening period, before administration, after administration of 15, 30, 60 minutes, fourth, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours, seventh, 10, 14, 21, 28 days, 10 cases in each group) were collected. In order to determine the tolerance and safety after a single intravenous injection of different doses of rESP in healthy subjects, the investigators had this trial. On the other hand, this study is to preliminarily explore the pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.</detailed_description>
