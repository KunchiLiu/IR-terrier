	<brief_title>The Effects of Thoracic Spine Mobilizations in Individuals With Neck Pain.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of two commonly used, safe, thoracic spine treatments: grade 1-4 as performed by Cleland et. al. and grade 1-4 mobilization to the thoracic spine as selected by the Physical Therapist for cervical spine pain. The immediate effects of thoracic spine mobilization have been shown to facilitate greater range of motion increases in the cervical spine and greater pain decreases within a treatment session and on follow-up visits. There is no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective outcome of these treatments. Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and concluded that future research should be completed which includes manual therapy for the thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007) If the PT identifies an appropriate patient they will ask if they are interested in being a research subject. The Physical Theapist recruiting subjects all have completed their Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree and have advanced training in manual Physical Therapy. The techniques employed are considered standard practice and are defined as entry level skills by the Comission of Accredicdation of Physical Therapy Programs. These techniques are typically taught in DPT degree programs.</detailed_description>
