	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Gene Therapy Drug (Neovasculgen) to Treat Secondary Raynaud's Phenomenon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open, comparing clinical trial assessing the therapeutic efficacy of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in treating scleroderma-associated Raynaud's syndrome. Each patient of clinical group will undergo several intramuscular injections with a treatment dose of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in hand where digital ulcers locate. In the control group patients will receive only standard of care without gene therapy drug. Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy. After this initial assessment, the patients of clinical group will undergo intramuscular injections of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in a hand altered with digital ulcers. Patient will report the severity of their Raynaud's symptoms weekly over the six month study period. At three month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy. At six months post-injection, the patient will again complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy.</detailed_description>
