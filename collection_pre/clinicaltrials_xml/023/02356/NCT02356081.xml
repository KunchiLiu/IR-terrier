	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy may cause distressing symptoms which can impact on patients' quality of life. Chemotherapy is frequently given on an outpatient basis therefore patients are often required to manage the symptoms they experience at home without direct supervision from healthcare professionals. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a mobile phone based, remote monitoring, symptom management system (ASyMS) on the delivery of care to people with nonmetastatic breast, colorectal or haematological cancer during chemotherapy and for one year following treatment. The study aims to compare a number of outcomes of patients using the ASyMS intervention with outcomes of patients who receive normal care at their hospital. Throughout chemotherapy treatment, once a day and any other time they feel unwell, patients allocated to the mobile phone group will enter information on the phone regarding any symptoms they are experiencing, take their temperature and enter this on the phone. The information is sent via secure connection to a computer, which assesses the information and sends an alert to their health care professional in the hospital, who will call the patient at home if the patient has reported problematic symptoms. Patients in the normal care group will receive care as normal at their hospital. Both groups of patients will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires before they start treatment, after each chemotherapy cycle and at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after treatment completion (a subset of patients will also be asked to complete midcycle symptom assessments). The study will also evaluate the cost benefit of ASyMS, assess changes in clinical practice as a result of ASyMS and develop a predictive risk model (statistical model) for use in future care of patients receiving chemotherapy for these cancers. This multicentre study is taking place across a number of European countries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Diagnosed with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or haematological malignancies (i.e. HD or NHL). Scheduled to receive firstline cytotoxic chemotherapy. Scheduled to receive 2, 3 or 4weekly chemotherapy protocols (i.e. chemotherapy administered at repeated cycles of 14, 21 or 28 days, respectively). Planned to receive a minimum of 3 chemotherapy cycle. Deemed physically/psychologically fit to participate in the study by a member of the multidisciplinary team. Able to understand and communicate in the respective language. Diagnosed with a distant metastasis, i.e. stage IV disease as defined by the TNM/UICC (for breast and colorectal cancers) and the Ann Arbor Staging System (for NHL/HD). Patients with metastatic disease will be excluded because of differences in symptom profiles experienced by people who have localised compared to advanced disease [42]. Scheduled to receive concurrent radiotherapy during chemotherapy treatment. Scheduled to receive weekly chemotherapy protocols. Also, patients who shift from a 2, 3 or 4weekly protocol to a weekly protocol during chemotherapy will be excluded from further participation in the study. Diagnosed with the same (i.e. where relapse has occurred) or another type of cancer in the past. Having received chemotherapy treatment in the past for the same or another type of cancer. Unable to provide written informed consent.</criteria>
