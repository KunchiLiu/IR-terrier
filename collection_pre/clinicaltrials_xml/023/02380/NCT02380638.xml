	<brief_summary>The main aims of the present project include 1) to study the longitudinal effects of whole-body vibratory exercise on bone metabolism in adolescents with and without DS and 2) to evaluate whether a low frequency vibratory training program consisting of 3 sessions per week for 9 months (each vibratory session last approximately 10 minutes and includes 5-6 bouts of 1 min with 1 min rest between bouts) can improve bone development in these populations. Finally, and additional aim of the project is 3) to determine how long these effects may last after the end of the intervention.</brief_summary>
