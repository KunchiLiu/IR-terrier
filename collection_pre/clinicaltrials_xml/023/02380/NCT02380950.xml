	<brief_summary>Objectives: Alcohol metabolism is changed in gastric bypass patients, leading to faster resorption and higher alcohol peak concentrations in blood. Because of stronger alcohol effects after gastric bypass we suggest that also general cognitive function is stronger impaired. Materials and Methods: We included 28 females (12 gastric bypass patients, 8 obese and 8 normal weight subjects) in the study. Each participant had to drink 250 ml white wine. Directly before, 10-30 min after and 45-65 min after wine consumption cognitive functions were tested by test battery for attentional performance (TAP) from Zimmermann and Fimm. During the whole examination breath-alcohol-contents (BACs) were measured every 5 minutes with breathalyser "Dräger Alcotest 7510".</brief_summary>
