	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be used as a non-invasive means of confirming pathologic diagnosis in early-stage (Stage I) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients scheduled to undergo surgical intervention will have blood samples obtained to test for CTCs. Presence of CTCs will be compared to final pathologic diagnosis based on surgical specimens to assess the sensitivity of using CTCs alone to make a definitive diagnosis.</brief_summary>
