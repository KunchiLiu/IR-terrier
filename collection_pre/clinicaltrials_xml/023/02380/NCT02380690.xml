	<brief_summary>To maximize implementation potential of pain self-management in the VA, alternative delivery methods are needed to provide Veterans with education and support needed to self-manage their pain, without requiring additional resources from healthcare teams. A novel and promising approach is a peer coaching model, in which Veterans with chronic pain who are successfully managing their pain offer information, support, and mentorship to other Veterans with pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Peer Coach-Led Intervention to Improve Pain Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' goal is to test the effectiveness of a peer coaching model among Veterans. The investigators are examining feasibility for implementation alongside effectiveness, to shorten the timeline to implementation. Aim 1 (primary aim): To compare 6-month (primary endpoint) and 9-month (sustained effects) effects of peer-supported chronic pain self-management versus controls on overall pain (intensity and function). Hypothesis 1: Veterans in the peer support arm will experience reduced overall pain compared to controls. Aim 2 (secondary aim): To compare 6- and 9-month effects of peer-supported chronic pain self-management versus controls on self-efficacy, social support, pain coping, patient activation, health-related quality of life, and health service utilization. Hypothesis 2: Veterans in the peer support arm will experience greater self-efficacy, social support, pain coping, patient activation, and health-related quality of life, and lower health service utilization, compared to controls. Aim 3 (pre-implementation aim): To explore facilitators and barriers to implementation of peer support for chronic pain, intervention costs, and fidelity to the model.</detailed_description>
