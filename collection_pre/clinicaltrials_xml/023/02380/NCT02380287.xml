	<brief_summary>This is an open label, phase 1, "3+3" dose escalating study of tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous injection of the novel monoclonal antibody against human IL-17 - BCD-085. The study will enroll 37 healthy male volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-in-human Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Various Doses of BCD-085 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IL-17 is a new potential therapeutic target which plays important role in pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, possibly - SLE and MS. BCD-085 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody against human IL17 developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which is now on the first step of clinical evaluation. BCD-085-1 study is the first-in-human clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of BCD-085 when used as a single step-by-step escalating subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine diapason of safety doses of BCD-085 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2 studies.</detailed_description>
