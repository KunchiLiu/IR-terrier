	<brief_summary>Photoplethismography will be measured and compared in newborns suffering from patent ductus arteriosus and normal controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plethismographic Perfusion Index in Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newborn babies admitted to the NICU and well baby will be connected to a specially designed photoplethismograph (PPG). Right hand (pre ductal), and and one of the legs (postductal) values will be compared, based on the formula Delta amplitude of PPG / baseline absorption (perfusion index (PI)). Normal values will be defined in healthy term and preterm babies, and clinical conditions in which the PI is expected to change (Patent Ductus Artheriosus, Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn)will be compared with these normal values.</detailed_description>
