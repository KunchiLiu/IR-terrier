	<brief_title>Contraceptive Counseling in the Postpartum Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants will be identified in the post-partum period and will be randomized to one of two groups. The control group will receive the standard of care contraceptive counseling which includes any prenatal counseling they received as well as information from the nurse practitioner that rounds on them in the post-partum period. The intervention group will also receive the standard of care contraceptive counseling but will also watch a 10 minute video created by the CHOICE project which counsels on different contraceptive options. Both groups will fill out a pre-intervention questionnaire as well as a post-intervention questionnaire 24hrs later. The primary outcome will be which type of contraception each woman chooses. The secondary outcomes will include determining if the women come to their post-partum visits as well as if they get the method of contraception they chose on the post-partum floor.</detailed_description>
