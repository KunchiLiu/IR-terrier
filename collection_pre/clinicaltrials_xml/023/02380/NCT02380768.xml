	<brief_title>A Comparison of the Ambu AuraGain Versus LMA Supreme in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare whether there is a clinically relevant difference in airway leak pressures between the Ambu AuraGain (sizes 1.5 and 2) and the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Supreme. Parameters of clinical relevance such as insertion success rates, fiberoptic view of the glottic opening, ease and speed of gastric tube placement, airway stability, and peri-operative complications will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
