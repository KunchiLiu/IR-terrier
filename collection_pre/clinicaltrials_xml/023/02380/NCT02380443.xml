	<brief_summary>This is a single center, open label dose frequency escalation study of InSituVax personalized anti-tumor vaccine protocol combining the cryoablation of a selected metastatic lesion with intra-lesional immunotherapy with AlloStim®. The in-situ (in the body) cancer vaccine step combines killing a single metastatic tumor lesion by use of cryoablation in order to cause the release of tumor-specific markers to the immune system and then injecting bioengineered allogeneic immune cells (AlloStim®) into the lesion as an adjuvant in order to modulate the immune response and educate the immune system to kill other tumor cells where ever they reside in the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increased Frequency of AlloStim® Immunotherapy Dosing in Combination With Cryoablation in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies. The study will assess six different dosing schedules. A standard 3 plus 3 study design will be used. The starting frequency for each dosing schedule will be escalated in subsequent groups of patients. The study will evaluate safety of increased frequency of AlloStim® dosing and anti-tumor effect of the new proposed dose and frequency schedule.</detailed_description>

Clinical evidence or radiological evidence of brain metastasis or leptomeningeal involvement 4. Symptomatic asthma or COPD 5. Pulmonary lymphangitis or symptomatic pleural effusion (grade ≥ 2) that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment or oxygen saturation &lt;92% on room air 6. Bevacizumab (Avastin®) treatment within 6 weeks of scheduled cryoablation procedure 7. Regorafenib prior to the Study Period 8. Taking anticoagulant medication for concomitant medical condition (unless can be safely discontinued for invasive cryoablation, biopsy and intratumoral injection procedures) 9. Prior allogeneic bone marrow/stem cell or solid organ transplant 10. Chronic use (&gt; 2 weeks) of greater than physiologic doses of a corticosteroid agent (dose equivalent to &gt; 5 mg/day of prednisone) within 30 days of the first day of study drug treatment Topical corticosteroids are permitted 11. Prior diagnosis of an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, uveitis). Well controlled Type I diabetes allowed 12. Prior experimental therapy 13. History of blood transfusion reactions 14. Known allergy to bovine products 15. Progressive viral or bacterial infection All infections must be resolved and the subject must remain afebrile for seven days without antibiotics prior to being placed on study 16. Cardiac disease of symptomatic nature 17. History of HIV positivity or AIDS 18. Concurrent medication known to interfere with platelet function or coagulation (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, clopidogrel, or warfarin) unless such medications can be discontinued for an appropriate time period based on the drug halflife and known activity (e.g., aspirin for 7 days) prior to cryoablation and biopsy procedures 19. History of severe hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibody drugs or any contraindication to any of the study drugs 20. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude study participation. 21.
