	<brief_summary>Uncontrolled diabetes is associated with increased risk for micro-vascular complication. Hypoglycemia is one of the major barriers in achieving good glucose control. Hypoglycemia is associated with a range of unpleasant symptoms including palpitations, tremor, hunger, sweating, confusion, difficulties in thinking as well as other idiosyncratic symptoms. Fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) refers to phobic avoidance reactions associated with hypoglycemia FOH may increase behavioral attempts to avoid hypoglycemia including decreased consumption of insulin and/or increased consumption of carbohydrates, resulting in poor glycemic control and an increased risk of diabetic complication. In this study, the investigators present a novel system, which simultaneously employs BioFeedback and Virtual Reality in order to cope with fear of hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>
