	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent pathology leading to major morbidity and mortality in young people. Cerebral flood flow maintenance is a major goal directed therapy to improve the prognosis of the patient. Due to cerebral-myocardial interaction, a myocardial dysfunction might occur at the early phase of the traumatic brain injury. This myocardial dysfunction could be partly responsible for a decrease in cerebral blood flow. In such case, improving myocardial dysfunction may help to increase cerebral blood flow and improve patient prognosis. In clinical practice the easiest and non invasive way to explore myocardial dysfunction is with transthoracic echocardiography. The objective of this trial is to investigate myocardial dysfunction at the early phase of traumatic brain injury, compared with a controlled group without TBI.</brief_summary>
