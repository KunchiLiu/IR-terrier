	<brief_summary>Hypogonadism is a clinical condition that can be associated with obesity in man. Controversy exists regarding if its a condition that needs to be treated. The standard Testosterone Therapy is associated with increase in cardiovascular risks, according to some studies, and leads to infertility. The use of Clomiphene Citrate in this sub population of obese man as an alternative treatment option is not well studied. The aim of this protocol is to evaluate the cardiovascular risks, metabolic and hormonal parameters in a double blinded randomized placebo trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clomiphene Citrate for the Treatment of Obesity Related Male Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypogonadism (low testosterone level) in obese man is a clinical condition and its treatment is controversial. Most of this controversy remains in the association between cardiovascular risk elevation and Testosterone replacement therapy in some studies. This protocol is a double blinded randomized placebo trial and 2 groups will be followed. The primary end-point of this research is to correlate the serum testosterone with the flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMDAB), circulating levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, E-selectin and progenitor endothelial cells. The secondary end-points are the evaluation of metabolic parameters (weight, abdominal circumference, glycaemia, total cholesterol, fractions and triglycerides, HOMA index and bioimpedanciometry parameters) and hormonal parameters (total testosterone levels, SHBG, LH, FSH and Estradiol).</detailed_description>
