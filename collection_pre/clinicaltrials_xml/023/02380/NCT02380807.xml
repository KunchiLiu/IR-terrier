	<brief_title>Effects of Dry Needling on Spinal Mobility and Trigger Points in Patients With Fibromyalgia Syndrome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry Needling is a skilled intervention that uses a thin filiform needle to penetrate the skin and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points, muscular, and connective tissues for the management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments. Dry needling (DN) is a technique used to treat dysfunctions in skeletal muscle, fascia, and connective tissue, and, diminish persistent peripheral nociceptive input, and reduce or restore impairments of body structure and function leading to improved activity and participation.</detailed_description>
