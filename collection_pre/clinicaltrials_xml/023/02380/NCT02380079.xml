	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and clinical effects of SCD-101 when given to adults with sickle cell disease. SCD-101 inhibits sickling of red blood cells containing Hb S (sickle hemoglobin) under low oxygen conditions, the underlying cause of sickle cell disease. SCD-101 may inhibit red blood cell sickling in patients with sickle cell disease and reduce symptoms and slow disease progression. This study will evaluate the safety and antisickling activity of SCD-101 in up to 24 adults with sickle cell disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study of SCD-101 in Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, non-randomized, non-placebo-controlled, single site, dose- escalation study of SCD-101 in participants with homozygous sickle cell disease (S/S) or S/beta 0 thalassemia. All participants will be monitored for safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, 1855 years of age 2. Homozygous sickle cell disease or S/beta 0 thalassemia 3. Hemoglobin F ≤10% 4. Hemoglobin ≥ 6.0 g/dL and ≤ 9.0 g/dL 5. Female participants of child bearing potential and male participants whose partner is a female of child bearing potential must be willing to use approved contraception during the trial and for 3 months following the end of treatment. Only barrier methods or complete abstinence are acceptable for this study. Participants using hormonal contraception (including morningafterpill) and IUD are excluded unless willing/able to change to an acceptable form of contraception. 6. Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an informed consent document 1. Red blood cell transfusion within 3 months of enrollment 2. Hydroxyurea treatment within 6 months of enrollment 3. Painful or other acute sickle cell event that required a hospitalization within 4weeks of enrollment 4. AST and/or ALT &gt;3x upper limit of normal and/or creatinine &gt;2x upper limit of normal or any other significant renal or hepatic impairment 5. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 60 mL/min (Cockcroft Gault formula) at screening. 6. QTc interval of &gt;470 msec at screening and patients with congenital long QT syndrome 7. No other significant sickle cell or nonsickle cell illness that would confound the results of the trial 8. Any condition that, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at risk because of participation in the trial, or may influence the result of the trial or the participant's ability to participate in the trial 9. Participant pregnant or nursing an infant or planning pregnancy during the course of the trial 10. Other investigational drug use within 3 months of enrollment</criteria>
