	<brief_summary>The study was designed as a randomized 2-way cross-over study to assess the bioavailability of carotenoids and flavonoids from sweet oranges and orange juice. Volunteers followed a wash-out period for 2 weeks prior to eating either 400 g of fresh oranges or 719 g of orange juice. The amount of test food was adjusted to deliver an equal amount of β-cryptoxanthin (740 µg). After a consecutive wash-out period of 2 weeks, the procedure was repeated and the volunteers ingested the complementary test food. Blood samples were collected at 8 time points up to 9.5 h after test meal consumption. Additionally, 24 h-urine was collected to evaluate flavonoid recovery.</brief_summary>
