	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of OBE001 Versus Placebo in the Delay of Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be a multi-centre, randomised, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in pregnant women with threatened preterm labour between 34^0/7 and 35^6/7 weeks of gestation. The study will be in 2 parts as follows: - from screening until the day of delivery (including a treatment period up to seven days) - a maternal and neonatal follow-up period from the day of delivery until 28 days post expected term date (or until 28 days post-delivery should this be later). In addition, there will be an observational, safety follow-up of the infants for 2 years to evaluate developmental outcome.</detailed_description>
