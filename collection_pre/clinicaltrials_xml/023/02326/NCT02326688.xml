	<brief_summary>Reproducibility assessment of a quantitative measure of the amount of trunk compensation by kinematic analysis in a grasping task in stroke patients.This "maladaptive trunk compensation" is suspected to be underlined by "arm non-use" in some patients, since this abnormal movement impairs the ability of patients to correctly flex their shoulder and extend their elbow during grasping.</brief_summary>
