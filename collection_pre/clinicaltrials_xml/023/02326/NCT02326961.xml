	<brief_title>Celution Prepared Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ACT - OA Knee Clinical Trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-center device trial intended to assess safety and feasibility of intraarticular administration of Celution processed Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells (ADRCs). The study will include 90 patients in up to 15 sites in the United States. Subjects that have chronic knee pain due to idiopathic osteoarthritis of the knee (confirmed clinically and radiologically) will be evaluated for eligibility in this study. Following informed consent and screening evaluations, eligible subjects will undergo pre-operative testing. Subjects will then undergo fat harvest through small volume liposuction under local anesthesia. Lipoaspirate will be processed in the Celution System to isolate and concentrate ADRCs for immediate intraarticular administration. A dose escalation approach has been designed wherein the study is divided into two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parts as follows: Part A: Low Dose (20,000,000 cells): 30 patients OR Placebo: 15 patients Part B: High Dose (40,000,000 cells): 30 patients OR Placebo: 15 patients Subjects randomized to placebo will undergo fat harvest and intraarticular injection of a placebo that has been visually matched to the active test substance. All subjects will undergo imaging studies, clinical evaluations, and laboratory testing prior to and after the procedure; patients will be followed for 48 weeks after intraarticular injections are performed.</detailed_description>

Any major injury to the target knee within the 12 months prior to the screening visit 2. Need for cane or other assistance device for walking 3. Any surgery to the target knee within the 6 months prior to the screening visit, or surgery to the contralateral knee or other weightbearing joint if it will interfere with knee assessments 4. Prior articular transplant procedures 5. Prior ligament reconstruction to the target knee within 12 months prior to the screening visit 6. Inflammatory arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus arthropathy, or psoriatic arthritis 7. Gout or calcium pyrophosphate (pseudogout) diseases that have flared within the previous 6 months prior to the screening visit 8.

Fibromyalgia, pes anserine bursitis, lumbar radiculopathy, and/or neurogenic or vascular claudication 10. Primary knee pain due to diagnosed isolated patellafemoral arthritis or chondromalacia in the target knee 11. Significant target knee joint infection or skin disorder/infection within the previous 6 months prior to the screening visit 12. Symptomatic OA of the hips, spine, or ankle, if it would interfere with the evaluation of the target knee 13. Any condition requiring immunosuppressive medication or use of systemic steroids 14. Intraarticular injection of steroids in previous 3 months or hyaluronic acid in previous 6 months in one or both knees prior to the screening visit 15. Patients that have received PRP, other plateletbased product, or investigational treatment in another cell/biologic study for the targeted treatment injury in the 12 months prior to the injection procedure 16.
