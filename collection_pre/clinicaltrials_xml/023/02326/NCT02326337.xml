	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and economical benefits of Cyclical Topical Wound Oxygen (TWO2) Therapy in the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers. All subjects will wear a standardized off-loading device and use advanced moist wound therapy (AMWT) dressings. Half the subjects will use the TWO2 device, while the other half will use a sham device.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subjects will use the TWO2/Sham device for 90 minutes a day at their home or nursing care facility 5 times a week for the treatment phase of up to 12 weeks. Monitoring of the wound will take place with weekly clinic visits for safety and compliance assessment and documentation. Wounds that close at or before 12 weeks will continue to use TWO2/sham device, off-loading and AMWT and have an additional to visits two weeks apart confirm wound closure. All subjects whether healed or not will enter a follow up period of an additional 12 and 38 weeks. The maximum duration for participation in the trial is 54 weeks. During the follow-up phase, subjects will receive standard care according to the clinician's recommendation and will be asked not to participate in another wound care trial in this period.</detailed_description>
