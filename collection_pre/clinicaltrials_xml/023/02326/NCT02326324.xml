	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in a large cohort of unselected patients who are undergoing CMR scanning for clinical indications (i.e. suspected/confirmed cardiovascular disease). CMR indices will be related to the presence and severity of cardiovascular disease and other markers of cardiovascular and health status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo CMR scanning in the usual clinical manner. As part of the study, patients will undergo approximately 5 minutes of extra CMR scanning. Cardiovascular anatomical, structural and functional data will be recorded, including data pertaining to myocardial characteristics (e.g. extracellular volume, oedema, fibrosis, infarction, function, perfusion), pericardial disease; valvular disease; vascular structure and function. Blood sampling will be performed on the same day as CMR scanning for assessment of serum/plasma markers of cardiovascular disease and health status, and DNA analysis. Health questionnaires will be completed on the day of CMR scanning. Follow-up information regarding health status, demographics and concurrent medical conditions and treatments will be obtained over a 10 year period following CMR scanning.</detailed_description>
