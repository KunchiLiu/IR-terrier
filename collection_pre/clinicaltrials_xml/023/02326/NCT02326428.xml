	<brief_summary>Ischemic stroke, i.e. irreversible damage of a part of the patient's brain, is caused by the formation of blood clot in the major vessel which gives blood supply to a certain part of the brain. At early time, within the first 4,5 hours, the conventional treatment is to try to dissolve this blood clot with a medication ("thrombolytic drug") which is administered to the blood through the needle in the vein. If the clot still remains there, additional treatment is possible - going directly to the clot via artery and taking it out with a special device. Though this treatment is already used in many stroke centres, its benefit is not clearly proven. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the benefit and safety of this additional treatment for the big stroke in patients fulfilling criteria for and receiving conventional treatment within 4.5 hours of onset, as compared to conventional treatment only.</brief_summary>
