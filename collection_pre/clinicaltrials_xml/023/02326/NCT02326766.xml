	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on nonobese, nondiabetic and prehypertensive subjects. Over a 12 week test period, the red ginseng group (n=31) consumed 10 capsules (total 5g) daily containing red ginseng, while the placebo group (n=31) consumed the same product without red ginseng. Fasting plasma metabolomes were profiled using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry.</detailed_description>
