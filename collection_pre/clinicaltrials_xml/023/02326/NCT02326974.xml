	<brief_summary>This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for breast cancer that has tested positive for a protein called HER2. The names of the study interventions involved in this study are: - Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1) - Pertuzumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T-DM1+Pertuzumab in Pre-OP Early-Stage HER2+ BRCA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved T-DM1 for pre-operative use in breast cancer but it has been approved for other uses in breast cancer. The FDA has approved pertuzumab as a pre-operative treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have HER2positive Stage II or III histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast. A minimum tumor size of 2 cm determined by physical exam or imaging is required. HER2 positive, confirmed by central testing (Clarient labs): IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive based on one of the three following criteria: Singleprobe average HER2 copy number≥6.0 signals/cell OR Dualprobe HER2/CEP17 &lt;2.0 with an average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals/cell OR Dualprobe HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 ER/PR determination is required. Bilateral breast cancers are allowed if both cancers are HER2positive. Patients with multifocal or multicentric disease are eligible as long as one area meets eligibility criteria. Breast imaging should include the ipsilateral axilla. For subjects with a clinically negative axilla, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed either before or after preoperative therapy at the discretion of the subject's physicians. For subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or SLN procedure will be performed to determine the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes. Men and women (with any menopausal status) ≥ 18 years of age ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Required laboratory values: ANC ≥1500/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN (institutional) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 X ULN (institutional) For patients with Gilbert syndrome, the direct bilirubin should be within the institutional normal range. AST and ALT ≤ 1.5x ULN (institutional) Alkaline phosphatase ≤1.5x ULN (institutional) Documentation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serologies is required: this includes hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) in addition to HCV antibody testing. Only for patients who test positive for hep B/C virus: PTT/INR &lt; ULN (institutional) Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 55% Premenopausal women must have a negative serum pregnancy test, including women who have had a tubal ligation and for women less than 12 months after the onset of menopause. Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use one highly effective form of nonhormonal contraception or two effective forms of nonhormonal contraception by the patient and/or partner and continue its use for the duration of the study treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of study treatment. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, should be avoided during the study treatment period with TDM1. Excessive alcohol intake should be avoided (occasional use is permitted). Patients with a history of ipsilateral DCIS are eligible. Patients undergoing breast conservation therapy (i.e. lumpectomy) must not have any contraindications to radiation therapy. Willing and able to sign informed consent. Willing to provide tissue for research purposes. Pregnant or nursing women due to the teratogenic potential of the study drugs. Active, unresolved infection. Receipt of intravenous antibiotics for infection within 7 days prior to enrollment. Patients with active liver disease, for example, due to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, autoimmune hepatic disorder, or sclerosing cholangitis. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;180 mm Hg and/or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg) or clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease: cerebrovascular accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to first study medication, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF) of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or higher, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. Significant symptoms (Grade ≥2) peripheral neuropathy. Other concurrent serious diseases that may interfere with planned treatment, including severe pulmonary conditions/illness, uncontrolled infections, uncontrolled diabetes. Any prior treatment for the current breast cancer, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation or experimental therapy.</criteria>
