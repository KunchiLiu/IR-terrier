	<brief_title>Low-dose Aspirin Therapy for Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that low-dose aspirin can improve survival in stage II-III esophageal cancer patients, and to evaluate whether this effect is influenced by PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF mutation and COX-2 expression. Eligible participants will be randomized to either aspirin treatment arm (100 mg aspirin OD for 3 years), or non-aspirin user arm in 1:1 ratio. After randomization, participants will receive 3 monthly assessments during treatment and follow-up.</detailed_description>
