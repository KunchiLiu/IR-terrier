	<criteria>Age between 18 and 50 years old Traumatic spinal cord injury at the neck, thoracic or lumbar level Classification ASIA A and B with no significant further improvement with physical therapy/rehabilitation A score of less than 200 in the 324point ASIA scale Injury duration 1 month to 5 years An advanced, severe, or unstable disease of any type that may interfere with primary and secondary variable evaluations, including any medical condition that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to such an extent that it may bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the patient to a significant degree or put the patient at special risk (e.g., severe liver or kidney disease, malignancies/cancer) Immune system disorder or dysfunction Any major/serious infections up to 2 months prior to inclusion A disability that may prevent the patient from completing all study requirements (e.g., blindness, deafness, severe language difficulty) A current diagnosis of active, uncontrolled peptic ulceration within the last three months A current diagnosis of acute, severe, or unstable asthmatic conditions [e.g., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] Participated in any other investigational trial within 4 weeks of initial screening and within 7 weeks of study entry History of regular alcohol intake or drug abuse in the previous 3 months and not able to sustain from alcohol intake during the trial Cardiovascular A current diagnosis of severe or unstable cardiovascular disease A current diagnosis of sicksinus syndrome or conduction deficits (e.g., sinoatrial block, second or third degree atrioventricular block) A current diagnosis of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation (&gt;100 bpm) A current diagnosis of moderate to severe heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA), Class III or more] A myocardial infarction (MI) known to have occurred within the last 3 months A current diagnosis of severe or unstable angina Vital signs (supine) outside the following ranges Systolic blood pressure below 90 or above 160 mmHg Diastolic blood pressure below 55 or above 95 mmHg Radial pulse below 50 or above 100 bpm CNS related A recent history of up to one year or currently diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke transient ischemic attacks, aneurysms) A current diagnosis of any primary neurodegenerative disorder [e.g., Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease etc.] A current diagnosis of an active, uncontrolled seizure disorder Psychiatric A current DSMIV diagnosis of major depression Any other DSMIV Axis 1 diagnosis that may interfere with the response of the patient to study medication, including other primary degenerative dementia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder Laboratory abnormalities Clinically significant abnormalities in routine laboratory examinations (hematology, electrolytes, biochemistry, liver and kidney function tests, urinanalysis) Concomitant therapy Previous stem cell treatment Ingested any of the following substances An investigational drug during the past 6 months A drug or treatment known to cause effect on the central nervous system [CNS] during the past four weeks A drug or treatment known to cause major organ system toxicity during the past four weeks Anticholinergic drugs at baseline Medication for Parkinson's disease at baseline (e.g., selegiline, levodopa, amantadine, dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors)</criteria>
