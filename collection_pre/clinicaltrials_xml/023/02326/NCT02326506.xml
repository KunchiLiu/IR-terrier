	<brief_summary>Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ELS) is used to support patients with acute cardiac failure. In that context, sufficient drainable venous volume is crucial for reliable and adequate support. To date, no reliable measurement method exists to monitor drainable volume adequately. Furthermore, it is still unresolved how to diagnose adequate cardiac recovery. Previous (pre)clinical studies showed that the calculation of the dynamic filling index may provide a valuable parameter to monitor the drainable volume in patients supported by VAELS. In addition, a case report showed that measurement of the dynamic filling index could successfully be used to estimate cardiac recovery in a single patient supported by VA-ELS in the ICU. This study will assess the dynamic filling index as a representation for drainable volume and cardiac recovery using standard recorded perfusion data in patients supported by VA-ELS</brief_summary>
