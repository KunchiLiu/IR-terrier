	<brief_title>Multi-Center Study Safety of Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of ADSC implantation using an IV delivery system. The study will provide therapies to up to 100 qualified patients who match the inclusion/exclusion criteria, agree to the follow up program and who have provided a signed consent for each procedure. The treatment is a combination of (a) general detoxification, (b) lymphatic massage/drainage, (c) therapeutic massage, reflexology and acupuncture and (d) cellular infusion therapy in which cells will be deployed via IV injection over two treatments of 60 minutes each during the five (5) day treatment period. Follow-up data based upon MSIS-29, a modified SF-36 and standard complication questionnaire will be collected at 3, 6 and then annually post treatment by the patients' local physician and reported back to the sponsor where it will be logged into a HIPPA-compliant outcomes database. Additional safety data, based upon a standard complication questionnaire will be collected via survey of patient at intervals of 3 and 6 months and then annually for a minimum of five (5) years.</detailed_description>
