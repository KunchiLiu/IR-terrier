	<brief_summary>Risk factors for difficult intubation are well described in anesthesiology. But intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a challenging issue, associated with severe life-threatening complications. Non-anesthesiologist trainees performing ICU intubation may not fully appreciate the potential difficulty and complications. Therefore in this retrospective analysis the MACOCHA score will be used to determine difficult intubation in the ICU and predict intubation failure.</brief_summary>
