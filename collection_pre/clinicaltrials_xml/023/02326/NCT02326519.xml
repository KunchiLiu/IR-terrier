	<brief_title>Electrical Signal Collection From a 20 Pole Catheter During Routine Cardiac Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to collect atrio-ventricular electrograms using a sequence of tip-ring spacings in patients undergoing routine cardiac procedures (EP study, pacemaker/ICD/CRT implant). To collect these signals, a 20 pole catheter (Medtronic StableMapr intracardiac steerable electrode catheter) will be acutely placed in the RV apex during a routine cardiac procedure. Routine data collection will be conducted during normal sinus rhythm and AV synchronous pacing for approximately 20 minutes. The data collected will then be processed and the P, R and T wave amplitudes will be measured.</detailed_description>
