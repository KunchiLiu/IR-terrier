	<brief_summary>Spontaneous intracerebral bleeding also known as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) constitute 10-15 % of all apoplexies. The Prognosis is considerably worse than it is for the larger population of patients suffering from cerebral thrombosis. Development of brain edema seemingly contributes to the disadvantageous prognosis. However, the mechanisms behind is only understood fragmentarily. By using multimodal neuro monitoring, the investigators seek to investigate electrophysiological and metabolic processes, which seem to accompany the formation of edema and clinical deterioration in patients suffering from sICH.</brief_summary>
