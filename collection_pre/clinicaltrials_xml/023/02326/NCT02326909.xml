	<detailed_description>Minimal invasive endoscopic treatment for Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UUT-UC) has been accepted as a treatment option instead of radical nephroureterectomy for patients with low grade, low stage disease. For this reason, information on tumour stage and grade is important for a clinical decision. Until now,diagnostic ureterorenoscopy combined with histology/cytology is the gold standard. Unfortunately, histology/cytology is often inconclusive. Optical Coherence Tomography is a new high resolution imaging technique that has potential to provide the urologist real time per-operative information of grade and stage of the disease. In this study the investigators aim to establish in vivo sensitivity and specificity of OCT in the diagnosis of Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma. Secondary objectives are inter-observer variability of 1300 nm OCT in the diagnosis of UUT-UC and optical properties of cancerous and healthy ureter and collecting system tissue in vivo in humans.</detailed_description>
