	<brief_title>Effects of Foot Strengthening on the Prevalence of Injuries in Long Distance Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a web software as a follow up tool, subjects can be scanned for injuries and have them confirmed by a physician, determining the injuries prevalence in one year. Through force platform and infrared cameras, the kinematics and kinetics during gait will allow assessment of joint moments, power during propulsion, ankle and knee range of motion. The hypothesis is that a strengthening program for foot and ankle muscles can alter the prevalence of lower limbs injuries on long distance runners, lowering the harmful forces that these segments receive. The participants will be randomly assigned into control group (placebo intervention) or into intervention group, that will receive an 8 weeks strengthening intervention, twice a week with the supervision of a physiotherapist and three times a week being remotely supervised by a software at home, for 30 minutes each session. This will aim for increasing foot and ankle range of movement and muscle strength. Every exercise has its own progression depending on the subjects execution, increasing in intensity and difficulty.</detailed_description>
