	<brief_summary>Recent studies have shown an increased incidence of renal replacement therapy after the use of Hydroxyethylstarchs (HES) in patients admitted in the intensive care unit. However, studies showing detrimental effects of HES have been conducted in mostly non-surgical subjects. There are very few studies analyzing the effects of HES on renal function after cardiac surgery, a population already at risk of renal dysfunction.</brief_summary>
