	<brief_summary>The aim of this recruitment plan (ADAPT-SCR) is to collect image and other data on both digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and full-field digital mammography (FFDM) from asymptomatic women undergoing screening mammography. These data will be included in a subsequent and prospectively planned pooled analysis described in a separate protocol (ADAPT-BIE) examining superiority of DBT to FFDM for breast cancer diagnosis and other clinical performance measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy and Performance of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Compared to Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADAPT program consists of 2 recruitment plans (ADAPT-SCR and ADAPT-BX) followed by an off-line read of the images and data collected (ADAPT-BIE). This study involves the comparison of two devices that can identify abnormalities in routine breast screening and diagnostic mammography. Mammography is usually done with full-field digital mammography (FFDM), which takes flat, two-dimensional X-ray images of the breast. Doctors use the two-dimensional images to look for cancers and other abnormal tissue. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the accuracy of full-field digital mammography devices and a new mammography device called digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT is similar to full-field digital mammography, but can also move around the breast to get X-ray images from different angles, which provides a three-dimensional view that doctors can use to look for cancers and abnormal tissue. Subjects will undergo routine imaging with FFDM and will also have a DBT performed. They will continue with their standard of care treatment as would occur outside of the study. Based on the results of the FFDM and DBT, the subject's status will be followed-up with routing imaging at approximately 1 year (10-16 months). If the doctor recommends biopsy based on the FFDM or DBT, information about the biopsy and cancer determination results will be collected. Being in this study does not require subjects to have a biopsy that was not recommended by the doctor for normal medical care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women aged 30 years or older (â‰¥30 years old); Asymptomatic women scheduled for screening mammography or have completed a screening mammogram within the past 30 days; Mammography completed on a GE FFDM system (with CC and MLO views) at the site or another clinical facility; Are able and willing to comply with study procedures; Have signed and dated the informed consent form; Are either surgically sterile or postmenopausal or, if of childbearing potential, the possibility of pregnancy is remote based on a documented negative patient history and, optionally, a negative urine pregnancy test (if subject requests one). Have been previously included in this study; Have a history of breast cancer and are in active treatment. However, subjects with a prior lumpectomy (&gt; 5 years prior) who receive only routine screening mammography views can be included; Have breasts too large to be adequately positioned on 24 x 31 centimeter (cm) FFDM digital receptor without anatomical cut off during either FFDM or DBT examination; Have participated in (within the prior 30 days) another trial of an investigational product expected to interfere with study procedures or outcomes; Have breast implant(s); Have reconstructed breast(s).</criteria>
