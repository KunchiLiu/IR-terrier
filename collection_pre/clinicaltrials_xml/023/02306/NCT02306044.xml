	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether platelet indices from automated haematology equipment, whole blood impedance aggregometry and a standardized bleeding questionnaire predict bleeding in admitted patients with thrombocytopenia of various causes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bleeding Prediction in Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrombocytopenia is a risk factor for bleeding, but studies concerning markers for stratification of bleeding risk among thrombocytopenic patients are lacking. This prospective observational cohort study investigates risk factor for bleeding in admitted patients with thrombocytopenia of various causes.</detailed_description>
