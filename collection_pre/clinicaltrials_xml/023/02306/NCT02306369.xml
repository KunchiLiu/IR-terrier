	<brief_title>Internet-delivered CBT for Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is prevalent and associated with low quality of life in adolescents. Medical or dietary treatments lack evident efficiency, while psychosocial interventions, i.e. cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)has shown promising effects in face-to-face treatments. Therapists trained to deliver CBT for IBS are scarce, leading to a situation where very few adolescents with IBS receive the only evidence-based intervention. Exposure-based internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) for adults with IBS has shown strong stable effects and cost-efficency. Our aim is to develop a treatment that enhances the availability to evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with IBS. Such a treatment could swiftly be implemented in regular health care for this large population. The main purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of exposure-based ICBT to treatment as usual (wait-list) for adolescents with IBS.</detailed_description>
