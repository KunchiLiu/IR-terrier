	<brief_title>STRIBILD in Non-Nucleoside Resistant Patients (SINNR STUDY)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SINNR study is a pilot, observational, open label study. It will evaluate the virologic efficacy (viral load &lt;50 copies/mL), safety, and immunologic response of STRIBILD administered for 48 weeks to HIV-infected current or recent illicit drug users. Approximately 30 HIV-infected current or recent illicit drug users (â‰¥19y.o.,&lt;70y.o.) from Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre and Regina General Hospital, University of Saskatchewan will be taking an oral 1 STRIBILD tablet once a day for 48 weeks. Additionally, adherence to STRIBILD over 48 weeks and quality of life will be measured in this population.</detailed_description>
