They will receive 12 weeks of therapist-supported ICBT and will be assessed by clinician ratings and child- and parent-reports at baseline, post-treatment and 3 month follow-up. The primary outcome measures the Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scale (CGI-S). Secondary outcome measures include clinician rated global functioning, and child and parent-rated anxiety and functioning.</brief_summary>
