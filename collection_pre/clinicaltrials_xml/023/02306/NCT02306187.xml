	<brief_summary>In the patients with osteoporosis, bisphosphonates (BPs) are a golden standard treatment. However, the bone turnover markers or the bone mineral density (BMD) are not improved in some osteoporotic patients even though they have taken BPs and alfacalcidol more than several years. In those case, the investigators better off prescribing BPs and Eldecalcitol, instead of BPs and Alfacalcitol.</brief_summary>
