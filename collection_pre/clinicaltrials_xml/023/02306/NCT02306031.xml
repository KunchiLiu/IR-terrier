	<brief_summary>Eyes of 108 diabetic patients have underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation surgery have enrolled. Fifty four eyes have received the conventional postoperative care with steroid drop, whereas the other group (54 eyes) have given a preoperative diclofenac drop four times daily in addition to steroid drop and continued six weeks after surgery. All patients have evaluated by Optical coherence tomography (OCT) preoperatively and days 1, 30, and 90.The outcome measures including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT findings were compared in and between both groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diabetic patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy that were candidate for phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation Eyes with clinically significant macular edema based on the ETDRS(Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) study and/or central macular thickness &gt;260Âµ were not included. Neither did we include the eyes with other accompanying diseases affecting the macula or eyes with history of previous retinal laser photocoagulation or intraocular surgery. Eyes with severe cataract that preclude performing an acceptable quality optical coherence tomography (OCT) were not enrolled either.</criteria>
