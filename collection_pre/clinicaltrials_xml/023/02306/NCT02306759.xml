	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the safety &amp; efficacy of low dose ketamine and morphine versus morphine alone for acute generalized pain in the Emergency Department (ED). The investigators are also interested to investigate whether low-dose ketamine is a safe and effective alternative option to opioids for the acute treatment of pain in the Emergency Department. The agents that are available in the department includes acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) and opioids. In most cases, acetaminophen and NSAIDS are not adequate to manage acute pain crisis. There is also heightening concerns for increased opioid use or abuse by patients. Since the HCAPHS survey includes various questions which inquires about patient perception of pain management in the department, the investigators are interested in investigating the safety and efficacy of low-dose ketamine to as an alternative method to opioids for the acute management of pain. There has been limited, mostly observational pilot studies, published in the literature. Limited data in the literature have reported the incidence of nausea and vomiting ranged from 3-13%. All published literature administered low-dose ketamine as an intravenous push. To the best of our knowledge our study would be the first study to administer low-dose ketamine as a short bolus infusion to mitigate the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The investigators believe our study would provide important scientific data to fill the theoretical gap that low-dose ketamine at 0.3mg/kg/dose may be a safe and effective agent for acute pain management in an ED that is located in the center of a densely populated urban area.</brief_summary>
