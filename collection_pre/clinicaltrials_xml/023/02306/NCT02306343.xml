	<brief_summary>The study is an open-label, randomized, two-period, one-way crossover study using the Meal Tolerance Test (MTT) protocol or the daily life setting protocol. The study consists of two parts. Subject may participate in both parts or just in one part. The first part tests the effect of local heating on the post prandial glucose levels following a bolus at in-patient settings.Type I and type II diabetic patients on basal bolus insulin therapy admitted after overnight fast for a meal tolerance test. Subjects injected 0.2 units/kg and consumed standardized liquid meal. Blood samples for glucose and insulin measurements was taken from a venous line. The study was conducted twice with (test) and without (control) the use of the InsuPad device. The second part evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device use at daily life settings. Type I and type II diabetic patients enrolled to the study. They will be required to perform at least 3 self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Study length is up to 25 months. Up to one month run in period, up to 12 months with the device (test) and up to 12 months without the device (control).The subjects will be asked to record events of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and any adverse events related to diabetes or the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effect of the InsuPad device was studied using the Meal Tolerance Test protocol or the daily life setting protocol. In the Meal Tolerance Test protocol subjects consumed a standardized liquid meal taken immediately after injection of insulin bolus (0.2 units/kg body weight). Each subject went through the same Meal Tolerance Test protocol twice, once with the InsuPad device (test conditions) and again without the InsuPad device (control conditions) in randomized order. The study started after an overnight fast and stabilization period in which the subject glucose level was stabilized between 100-150 mg/dl, using I.V glucose solution/oral glucose or intravenous insulin administration if needed. The patient remained stable (change of glucose level &lt;20mg/dl) without any intervention or infusion 30 min prior to the study. Blood glucose measurements were taken from a peripheral venous at pre-specified time points. Total follow up time was 5 hours post meal. Safety limits of the study were 75 mg/dl as the low limit and 300 mg/dl as the high limit. If the subject's blood glucose level was below 75 mg/dl glucose solution was given orally to increase his blood glucose level. If subjects blood glucose was above 300 mg/dl iv insulin was given to reduce blood glucose level. In the daily life setting protocol subjects meeting the inclusion exclusion criteria enrolled to the study. Study length was up to 25 months. Up to one month run in period, up to 12 months with the device (test) and up to 12 months without the device (control). Subjects were asked to perform at least 3 blood glucose measurements a day. Subjects were asked to fill logbooks with measured blood glucose levels and insulin doses given during the whole study. Subjects were asked to report any adverse event during the study. The subjects received a tutorial about the device usage and the study procedures. The order of the test and control phases was randomly selected.</detailed_description>
