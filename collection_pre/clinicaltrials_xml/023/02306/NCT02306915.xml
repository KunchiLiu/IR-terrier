	<brief_summary>Cohorts of Japanese participants will be enrolled and treated prior to cohorts of Caucasian participants for the sake of matching. Every effort will be made to match Caucasian and Japanese participants on a cohort basis at enrollment. Reasonable effort will be made to maintain balance between male and female participants within the cohorts. There will be no replacement of participants following randomization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PK, PD, Safety and Tolerability of Lipegfilgrastim in Healthy Japanese and Caucasian Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible participants will be admitted to the investigational center and after confirming their eligibility will be randomized to receive a single dose of 30, 60, or 100 μg/kg lipegfilgrastim. There will be 11 visits to the investigational center during the study, including a screening visit, 1 inpatient period (through Day 4 post-dose) and 9 ambulatory visits. Blood samples for PK, PD and immunogenicity analysis will be collected pre-dose and at specified time points post-dose. A mandatory blood sample for pharmacogenetics (PGx) will be collected from all participants. During the study the following safety assessments will be performed: vital signs measurements,physical examinations, record of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, urinalysis, safety ECG recordings, local tolerability (injection site reactions), overall tolerability, pregnancy testing, spleen sonography, and concomitant medications</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) ≥18.0 and ≤25 kg/m2. Body weight must be ≥ 50 kg and ≤ 90 kg. Is in good general health as determined by medical history, physical examination, 12lead electrocardiography (ECG), vital signs and clinical laboratory tests. Subjects are able to read, write and understand English or Japanese; they must be able to understand the requirements of the study and be willing to comply with all trial requirements. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test at checkin. All subjects must be either surgically sterile (for females that means documented complete hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomyor bitubal ligations; partial hysterectomy is not sufficient), abstinent throughout the study or, if of reproductive capacity and not abstinent, exercising any 2 different forms of highly effective contraception methods with his/her partner during the entire study period. o Additional inclusion criteria for Japanese subjects: Subject must be a nonnaturalized Japanese citizen and hold a Japanese passport. Subject must have/had 2 Japanese parents and 4 Japanese grandparents who are all nonnaturalized Japanese citizens, as confirmed by interview. Subject has been living outside of Japan for 10 years or fewer as confirmed by interview. o Additional inclusion criterion for Caucasian subjects: The subject is Caucasian, and confirms by interview that his/her parents and grandparents are Caucasian and none are of Black/African descent, MiddleEastern descent or Asian descent. other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information History of hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, lenograstim, Escherichia coli derived proteins, or to any excipients (glacial acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, sorbitol, polysorbate 20). Prior exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim or other granulocyte colony stimulating factors (GCSFs) in clinical development less than 6 months before randomization. Findings of splenomegaly on sonography, defined by splenic length in excess of 12.3 cm (Andrews, 2000; Benter et al, 2011) and clinical judgment. Existence or recent history of persistent pulmonary infiltrates or recent pneumonia, or current symptoms of upper respiratory infection. In the case of pneumonia, subject may be screened 12 weeks following cessation of antibiotic treatment. other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
