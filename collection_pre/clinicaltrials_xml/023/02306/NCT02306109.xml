	<detailed_description>The study is a multicentric, randomized, controlled trial to compare effects of standard versus intensive motor rehabilitation treatment for people with ALS. Eligible patients are going to be randomly assigned to the Standard or Intensive treatment (controlling for ALSFRSR rates at enrollment, age and site of onset). Randomization ratio is 1:1. Standard treatment: 2 sessions/week of motor rehabilitation treatment (45 minutes each one) for 10 weeks for a total of 20 sessions. The program consists of exercises for aerobic endurance, reinforcement at low load and stretching. At the end of the 20 sessions patient and caregiver are going to continue activity with supervision through regular follow up. Intensive treatment is characterized by an increased volume of the above mentioned exercises: 5 sessions/week (45 minutes each one) for 10 weeks for a total of 50 sessions. At the end of the 50 sessions patient and caregiver are going to continue activity with supervision through regular follow up. Collection and analysis of data Recruitment: during the first 18 months of the study. Outcome measures: evaluated at T0-T3-T6-T9-T12-T15-T18-T21-T24. Rating scales will be administered by a neurologist in singe blind method with respect to the treatment. Data collection will be done through an ad hoc Case Report Form and entered into a database on a dedicated website.</detailed_description>
