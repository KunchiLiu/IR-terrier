	<brief_title>Endometrial Local Injury to Improve the Outcome of Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is important to evaluate the efficacy of endometrial local injury in assisted reproductive technology(ART),especially on the patients of recurrent implantation failure. Although most trials proved the effectiveness of the intervention of local injury, the subjects of these trials are rarely the patients of repeated implantation failure(RIF). Moreover, the mechanism of endometrial injury is not clear.Our trial may provide further basis for this purpose by comparing to the quality of endometrium in two-dimensional ultrasound.If the technique demonstrates efficacy, it would help the patients with RIF caused by poor conditions of endometrium to deal with the problem of infertility.</detailed_description>
