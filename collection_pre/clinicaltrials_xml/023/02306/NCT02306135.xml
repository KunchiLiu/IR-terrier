	<brief_summary>mTOR kinase is part of the mTORC1 complex that promotes cap-dependent protein translation, and part of the mTORC2 complex that activates AKT. Everolimus (Afinitor) is an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR that suppresses mTORC1 activity. Everolimus is FDA-approved for the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer (in combination with exemestane), renal cell carcinoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), and neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET), and is currently being tested in ongoing clinical studies in other indications. While everolimus-based therapies elicit anti-cancer effects, most cancers ultimately progress and exhibit everolimus resistance. This study will evaluate genetic mechanisms of resistance to everolimus.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Treatment with everolimus (as a singleagent or in combination) for any malignancy for ≥3 months. 2. A Patients who are scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated tumor biopsy (as standard of care, or as part of another study) within 5 years following cancer progression on everolimus are eligible. B Patients who already had such a biopsy procedure performed are eligible. Tumors biopsied shortly after progression on everolimus are strongly preferred. 3. Excess tumor tissue from biopsy must be available for molecular analysis. This will include tumor tissue sufficient to make ≥5 fivemicron sections; more tumor tissue is preferred. 4. Patients currently seen at DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center must be capable and willing to provide informed written consent for study participation. Patients who are no longer seen at DHMC will not be consented for use of archived tissues and data. 5. For patients currently seen at DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center, patients must be willing to provide an extra 1020 mL of blood during a routine, clinically indicated blood draw procedure.</criteria>
