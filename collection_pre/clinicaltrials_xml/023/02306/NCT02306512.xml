	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if immunofluorescence (IF) can effectively identify features of malignant melanoma in situ, on sun-damaged skin, in the setting of Mohs Micrographic Surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mohs and Immunofluorescence for Malignant Melanoma In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to 1. Determine the feasibility of using melanocytic markers such as Melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) with fluorescence to clear surgical margins when compared to conventional MART-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the setting of MMS for LM (lentigo maligna type melanoma in situ). 2. Compare the use of a cocktail of immunofluorescent markers such as, but not limited to, Sex-determining Region Y (SRY)-box 10 (SOX10), human melanoma black 45 (HMB-45), and Kiel-67 (Ki-67) to sections only stained with fluorescent MART-1 alone. 3. Explore the value of using other combinations of immunofluorescent markers such as S-100 with Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF), Nestin with Ki-67, and HMB-45 with Lamin.</detailed_description>
