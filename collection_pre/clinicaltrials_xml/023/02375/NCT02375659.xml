	<brief_summary>Across the U.S. Skin of Color (SOC) clinics have been established with the goal of providing medical care and supporting research related to patients with skin of color. There have been no formal studies evaluating why patients seek medical care at SOC clinics or treatment outcomes. Reasons may include past experiences with other providers, the perception that providers working in these clinics have a special interest or knowledge in caring for patients with skin of color and thus may provide better care, the expectation of cultural sensitivity, the hope that their provider may have a similar ethnic background, and/or ease of communication with their provider. Through focus group discussions we aim to identify the factors influencing a patient's choice to seek medical care at a SOC clinic and to gain insight into the presence and impact of racial concordance between provider and patient. The current study will focus on self-identified African American patients with interest in conducting similar sessions with patients of other ethnicities and races in the future.</brief_summary>
