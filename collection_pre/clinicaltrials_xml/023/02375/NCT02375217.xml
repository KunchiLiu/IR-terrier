	<brief_summary>Prospective Randomized non inferiority Trial involving adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia.56 Patients will be enrolled in 2 groups : full dose sugammadex vs half dose sugammadex for reversal of NMB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Low Dose Sugammadex Combined With Neostigmine and Glycopyrrolate Versus Full Dose Sugammadex for Reversal of Rocuronium-induced Neuromuscular Blockade: a Cost Saving Strategy"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' aim is to prove that half dose sugammadex in combination with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg is non-inferior to the recommended dose of sugammadex for the reversal of deep ( absence of Trian of Four response :TOF) or moderate ( TOF 1 or 2 twiches) muscle paralysis in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia.</detailed_description>
