	<brief_summary>Acquired lymphedema is a disease that causes chronic swelling of the limb(s). It is frequently under-recognized or misdiagnosed. This study is designed to lead to the development of an accurate, noninvasive, blood test to allow testing for lymphedema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers for the Detection of Lymphatic Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The validation of a sensitive and specific biomarker assay for human acquired lymphatic vascular insufficiency would represent a highly significant development for the patient community. Accurate bioassay for the presence of lymphatic vascular insufficiency should help to pave the road for future human clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies designed to treat human lymphatic diseases. Molecular profiling will be performed in human tissues (skin) obtained by biopsy. The insights gained from these initial analyses will determine the targets for assay in human body fluids (blood).</detailed_description>
