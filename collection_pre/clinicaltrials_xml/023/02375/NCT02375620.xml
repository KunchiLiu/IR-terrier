	<brief_summary>The study was evaluated as the optimal dose for the treatment of SGA short stature children by Pegylated Somatropin, initially evaluated its efficiency and safety for the treatment of SGA short stature children and provided scientific, reliable basis for phase III clinical trials for dose selection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Pegylated Somatropin (PEG Somatropin) to Treat SGA Children With Short Stature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter, randomized phase II study, half of participants will receive the high dose, while the other half will receive the low dose.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The patients are diagnosed as being clinically full term small for gestational age infant. Girl are 36 years old, boys are 37 years old. Be in preadolescence (Tanner stage 1). The child did not achieve catchup growth when he/she entered the group (the definition of catchup growth is that the height is higher the third percentile with the same age and gender) (Appendix 2 and 3). The height of child is shorter than 2SDS of the median of normal children with the same age and gender when he/she entered the group (the mean height and height standard deviation of normal children with the same age and gender of normal children regard the height data in the physical development investigation data of children aged 018 in 9 cities of China (2005) as standard [13], Appendix 4 and 5). Within a year before entering the group, after any growth hormone stimulation test, the peak concentration of growth hormone in serum&gt;10 µg/L. Bone age≤ the actual age+1. The function of glucose regulation is normal: fasting blood glucose &lt; 5.6mmol/L. Birth gestational age ≥ 37 weeks. The subjects and their guardians sign the informed consent (if the subjects is lack of ability for signing the informed consent, his legal guardian can write the subjects name instead). People with abnormal liver or kidney function (ALT&gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal value, Cr&gt; the upper limit of normal value). Patients are positive for hepatitis B core antigen (HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). People with known highly allergic constitution or allergy to the drug or the excipient of the study. People with diabetes, severe cardiopulmonary, hematological system and malignant tumors diseases or general infection, immune deficiency and patients with mental disease. Other abnormal growth and development, such as Turner syndrome, Laron syndrome, growth hormone receptor deficiency. Potential tumor patients (family history). Patients who used growth hormone for treatment. Subjects took part in other clinical trial study within 3 months. Patients used other hormonal for treatment within 3 months (such as sex hormone, glucocorticoid and etc., treat for more than a month) and received the drug treatment which may interfere with the secretion of GH or GH function (oxandrolone, growth hormone releasing hormone and etc.); Other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator preclude enrollment into the study.</criteria>
