	<brief_summary>Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in children is a potentially devastating disease. The mortality rate may reach 80-90% in the absence of liver transplantation. Liver injury is considered to be mainly immune mediated with augmentation of cytolytic pathways of infected hepatocytes. For that, it is suggested that corticosteroids modulate the activity of the disease by suppressing the immune system.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in children is a potentially devastating disease. The mortality rate may reach 80-90% in the absence of liver transplantation. FHF is the clinical manifestation of liver cell death of a critical degree with insufficient hepatocellular regeneration and characterized by coagulopathy with or without hepatic encephalopathy. Liver injury is considered to be mainly immune mediated with augmentation of cytolytic pathways of infected hepatocytes. For that, it was suggested that corticosteroids modulate the activity of the disease by suppressing the immune system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient is diagnosed to have FHF, if he fulfilled all the following criteria: 1. Evidence of liver dysfunction within 8 weeks of onset of symptoms (neonates may have only deranged liver functions without overt symptoms). 2. Uncorrectable coagulopathy (68 hours after administration of one dose of parenteral vitamin K) with International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, or INR&gt; 2.0 in patients without encephalopathy. 3. No evidence of chronic liver disease. 1. Presence of absolute contraindications to steroid therapy (as presence of an active gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, acute pancreatitis, active tuberculosis, uncontrolled diabetes and psychosis). 2. Presence of absolute contraindications to growth hormone therapy (as active malignancy, benign intracranial hypertension, proliferative or preproliferative diabetic retinopathy)</criteria>
