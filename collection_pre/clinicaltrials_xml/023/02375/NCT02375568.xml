	<brief_summary>According to many recent research, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated from synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat pad have higher ex vivo proliferation capacity, multipotency and ability to undergo chondrogenesis. Based on this concept, the investigators plan to get two removed tissues (synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat pad) from patients who have an operation of total knee replacement. The investigators are going to isolate and expand MSC from these two tissues respectively, and then compare the chondrogenesis ability for clinical application. In the other hand, the investigators plan to build techniques and procedures which comply with "Good Tissue Practices (GTP)"</brief_summary>
