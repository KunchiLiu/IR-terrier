	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age 2. Documented pCAD expressing tumor cells with the exception of HNSCC and ESCC. An archived tumor sample collected within 36 months prior to baseline if available, or a new tumor biopsy sample must be available for molecular prescreening. 3. Consent for a tumor biopsy at screening 4. Progressive disease and no effective therapy exists 5. Measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 criteria 6. ECOG Performance status of ≤ 2 Exclusion criteria: 1. CNS metastatic involvement 2. Clinically significant cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or neurological conditions. 3. A history of serious allergic reactions, which in the opinion of the investigator pose an increased risk of serious infusion reactions. 4. Monocular vision or has media opacities or any other condition that precludes monitoring of the retina or the fundus, or has a history of ophthalmology exam with retina or cornea abnormalities 5. Previously treated with antipCAD biologic therapies. 6. Received anticancer therapies within the following time frames prior to the first dose of study treatment: Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy: ≤4 weeks Biologic therapy (eg, antibodies), other than ADCs: ≤4 weeks Noncytotoxic small molecule therapeutics: ≤5 T1/2 or ≤2 weeks (whichever is longer) Other investigational agents: ≤4 weeks Radiation therapy (palliative setting is allowed.): ≤4 weeks Major surgery: ≤2 weeks 7. Patient has out of range laboratory values defined as: Hematological values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9 g/dL Platelets &lt;100 x 109/L Hepatic and renal function Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). For patients with Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin &gt;2.5 x ULN. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 x ULN for patients without tumor involvement of the liver or &gt;5 x ULN for patients with tumor involvement of the liver. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN and/or measured creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min</criteria>
