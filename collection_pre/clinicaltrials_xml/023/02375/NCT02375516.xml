	<brief_summary>The planned research aims to delay the onset of drug use and reduce harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. The culturally-tailored prevention program will be delivered to youths by computer. Over 5 years, the program will be developed and tested in a randomized clinical trial. The intervention program will include 10 initial sessions, followed by annual booster sessions. Outcome measurements will involve baseline, post-intervention, and three annual follow-up data collections. The study's primary hypothesis is that rates of 30-day alcohol and drug use will be lower among participants assigned to receive the intervention. If proven to be efficacious, the program will be revised and disseminated nationally.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Drug Abuse Among Hispanic Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>America's largest ethnic minority group, Hispanics are also a youthful population: one-third of Hispanic Americans are less than 18 years old. Unfortunately, young Hispanic Americans are an at-risk population more likely than their majority culture peers to drop out of school, become involved in the criminal justice system, fall prey to violence, and face lifelong economic problems. Hispanic youths are also at risk for early drug use and subsequent harmful use and abuse. As early as eighth grade and relative to their Black and White peers, Hispanic adolescents report higher rates of most harmful substances. Drug use continues to pose problems for Hispanic youths throughout adolescence and into adulthood.</detailed_description>
