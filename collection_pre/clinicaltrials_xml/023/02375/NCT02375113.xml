	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study examining the effect of dietary supplements that contain soy products. The purpose of this study to find out if soy supplementation can help to reduce the storage of a certain kind of fat on the body, visceral fat. Visceral fat is fat found deep in the abdomen; it has the potential to increase the risk of certain health problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soy as an Innovative Dietary Component in Abdominal Obesity Management Amongst Peri- and Early Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is a leading risk factor for many chronic diseases in the USA. Abdominal fat, specifically visceral fat is metabolically active and can be detrimental to health. Abdominal obesity is especially high in postmenopausal women (prevalence rates 50- 70%) in whom estrogen deficiency may lead to accumulation of excess visceral fat. Although estrogen replacement therapy is effective in preventing visceral fat accumulation, its adverse effects warrant a search for a safer phytochemical that exerts estrogenic properties. Soy, containing isoflavones (estrogen-like compounds), is a promising dietary component in reducing abdominal obesity in menopausal women. The favorable effects of isoflavones were already demonstrated in animal studies.The effects of soy compounds as a dietary component in preventing and reducing abdominal obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities will be examined among menopausal Women. We will use quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging (qMRS/I) to determine dose and effects of soy supplementation for preventing and treating abdominal adiposity. The results from this study will shed light on the application of soy as a novel dietary approach in preventing and managing abdominal obesity among peri- and early menopausal women.</detailed_description>
