	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to evaluate the implementation of an efficacious medication adherence program in a group at high risk for CVD. The program involves patients receiving/responding to e-reminders to take CVD medications via patient-selected technology [mobile/web-based applications, short message service (SMS; text messaging), interactive voice response (IVR), or e-mail] supported by a tailored, monthly, self-management program administered by either research staff or a case manager staff member from the Duke Outpatient Clinic via the telephone. This is a hybrid type II implementation science study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating CVD Medication Adherence Program in Low SES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to evaluate the implementation of a medication adherence program among patients who attend Duke Outpatient Clinic (DOC). It is anticipated that, among the providers' patient panels, at least 100 and up to 300 with CVD risk and poor CVD medication adherence (&lt;0.08 medication possession ratio) will consent to the program. Using procedures from the investigators previous studies, the investigators will identify potential patients from the EHR, and will identify a pool of potential patients using electronic health records, with the goal of administering the program to at least 100 patients. Patients will be mailed letters, signed by their own provider or medical director of DOC, requesting their participation in the programs. The RA will contact patients via telephone to explain the study, screen for eligibility, and determine what mode of administration individuals prefer to receive the program (SMS, IVR, or email). The primary outcome will be that the effectiveness/impact of the proposed adherence program will be a 10% improvement in MPR and CVD outcomes (anticipate reducing SBP by 5 mmHg, Hgb a1c by 0.5%, LDL-C by 20 mg/dl).</detailed_description>
