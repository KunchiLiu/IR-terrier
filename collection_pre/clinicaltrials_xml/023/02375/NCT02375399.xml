	<brief_summary>Echocardiography parameters for cardiac dyssynchrony had no predictive value in current multicentric prospective studies concerning cardiac resynchronization therapy. Comprehensive echocardiography and new parameters as 2D and 3D strain, as well as 3D echo have been analyzed, but their definite value has not been proven yet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Echocardiographic Parameters for Prediction of Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with severe heart failure, delays in the conduction system can result in asynchronous contraction impairing cardiac function. By implantation of pacemaker systems with three leads located in atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus, tracing back this deranged contraction closer to the physiological excitation propagation is aimed (cardial resynchronization therapy [CRT]). Despite patient selection according to the guidelines nearly one-third of the patients do not profit, neither clinically nor echocardiographically, from an implanted CRT-device. In addition, recent studies have shown that no reliable prediction may be achieved with the known echocardiographic parameters of dyssynchrony, regarding the response to such therapy. The aim of this study is therefore to assess new echocardiographic parameters, which may allow to better predict CRT response.</detailed_description>
