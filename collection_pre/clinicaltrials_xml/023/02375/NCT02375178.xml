	<brief_summary>This is a three arm randomized trial. The aim is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide oral antiseptics on the microorganisms of the oral cavity. A total of 30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled and randomly allocated to control group (CG, n=10), which will be instructed to rinse the mouth with 10ml of a sterile saline solution for one minute, to chlorhexidine group (ClG, n=10), which will be instructed to rinse the mouth with 10ml of an 0.12% chlorhexidine solution, for one minute, or to polyhexamethylene biguanide group (PG, n=10), which will be instructed to rinse the mouth with 10ml of an 0.07% polyhexamethylene biguanide solution, for one minute. Samples of saliva will be collected before the mouth wash and after 30, 60 and 180 minutes. Samples will be plated on manitol agar, mitis salivarius agar, EMB agar and Sabouraud agar. Samples will be processed by a blinded microbiologist.</brief_summary>
