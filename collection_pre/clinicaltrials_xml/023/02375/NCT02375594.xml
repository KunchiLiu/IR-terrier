	<brief_summary>Exercise park equipments for the elderly are designed taking into account the physical and cognitive capabilities and needs of elderly individuals. These equipments are usually built in public spaces, and may be part of public health initiatives to promote active lifestyles in the elderly. Previous research has provided clear evidence on the short-term efficacy of exercise programs in improving physical function and level of physical activity in community-dwelling elderly. The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to assess whether an exercise intervention conducted in an exercise park equipment is able to achieve sustained improvements in physical function and level of physical activity, that are maintained for at least 3 months after the end of the intervention. The target population are community-dwelling elderly that are insufficiently active.</brief_summary>
