	<brief_title>Randomized Study on Postmenopausal Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer: WBI Versus APBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treated with Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation (WBI) received SIB irradiation of the whole breast and surgical bed at two different dose levels. Dose prescription was 40.5 Gy to PTVWB and 48.0 Gy to PTVboost in 15 fractions over 3 weeks, with simultaneous integrated boost delivering 2.7 and 3.2Gy/fraction for each PTV respectively. Daily image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) were generated before each treatment session in each patient to verify the set-up. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) using external intensity -modulated radiotherapy (VMAT RA) was delivered at a dose of 30 Gy in five 6-Gy/day fractions over 10 days (every other day) with IGRT at each treatment.</detailed_description>
