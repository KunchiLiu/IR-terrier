	<brief_summary>Radioiodine (I-131) therapy for thyroid disease is known to decrease salivary function in adult patients. The impact of pediatric I-131 exposure on salivary function is unknown. The investigators goals are to answer this question by measuring salivary gland function before and after I-131 administration in children who receive radioiodine therapy at our hospital for thyroid disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radioiodine (I-131) therapy for thyroid disease is known to decrease salivary function in adult patients. The impact of pediatric I-131 exposure on salivary function is unknown. The investigators goals are to answer this question by measuring salivary gland function before and after I-131 administration in children who receive radioiodine therapy at our hospital for thyroid disease. We will use a Modified Shirmer Test to measure saliva production and a questionnaire to evaluation symptoms of xerostomia.</detailed_description>
