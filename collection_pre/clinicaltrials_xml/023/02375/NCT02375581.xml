	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Icotinib With Concurrent Radiotherapy in Elderly Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older patients with esophageal cancer have been correlated with poor prognosis because of having little chance to receive aggressive local therapy, including surgery or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. EGFR is overexposed in most of the cases. In this phase II trial, the efficacy and toxicity of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (Icotinib) with concurrent radiotherapy will be investigated in this setting.</detailed_description>
