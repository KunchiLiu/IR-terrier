	<brief_summary>This is study testing the feasibility of collecting neurophysiological measures of outcome related to body-based interventions for low back pain. The investigators will collect fMRI and psychophysical data about pain sensitivity before and after the interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned to either spinal manipulation or therapeutic touch groups. Participants will attend two practice sessions prior to the first data collection. There will be two follow-up assessments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Assessment of Neurophysiological Measurement in Veterans With LBP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be enrolled from VA pain clinical at the North Florida/South George VA Medical Center. The investigators will collect functional magnetic resonance imaging data of resting state and pain-related events (i.i. during thermal pain sensitivity testing, as well as psychophysical data to determine pain sensitivity. Pain sensitivity will be measured using thermal and mechanical stimuli. These data will be collected before and after the interventions, in addition to two follow-up sessions after intervention. In addition, clinical measures of pain intensity in the low back, as well as trunk range of motion and strength will also be collected.</detailed_description>
