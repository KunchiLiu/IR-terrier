	<brief_summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severely disabling psychiatric disorder with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of 2-3% (Islam et al., 2015).Despite the efficacy of pharmacological and behavioural treatment methods for most OCD patients, roughly one third do not demonstrate significant symptom improvement, even after aggressive treatment (Foa et al, 2007). The effectiveness of neurosurgical treatment methods (including ablative surgery) for those with severely disabling treatment resistant OCD is substantiated by clinical research (Greenberg, Rauch &amp; Haber, 2010). The brain target of this procedure is usually the area between the anterior and middle third of the anterior limb of the internal capsule.</brief_summary>
