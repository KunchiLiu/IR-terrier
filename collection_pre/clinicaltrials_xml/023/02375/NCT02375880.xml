	<brief_summary>DKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (Mab) with neutralizing activity against Dkk-1 and is being developed as an anti-neoplastic agent. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of DKN-01 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with carcinoma primary to the intra- or exta-hepatic biliary system or gallbladder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of DKN-01 and Gemcitabine/Cisplatin in Patients With Carcinoma to Primary to the Intra- or Extra-Hepatic Biliary System or Gallbladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part A, escalating doses of DKN-01 will be administered to different cohorts of patients to evaluate safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to establish the maximum tolerated dose of DKN-01 when administered in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Part B is an expansion cohort in which patients are treated at the MTD of DKN-01 (or highest dose tested if the MTD is not defined) to further characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy within the defined patient population.</detailed_description>
