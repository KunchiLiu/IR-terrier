	<brief_summary>Patients with type 2 diabetes are increasingly complex. Lack of time to address all patient and provider priorities during primary care visits represents a barrier to effective primary care. The investigators propose to design, implement, and evaluate in a randomized clinical trial a web-based tool linked to the electronic health record (EHR) that will enable complex patients to easily define care priorities for their upcoming visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Visit Prioritization for Complex Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes are increasingly living with multiple concurrent conditions and complicated medical regimens. For these patients, diabetes management decisions and treatment goals must be addressed within the larger context of other competing health concerns. In parallel, clinical advances have led to a substantial increase in the number of tasks that primary care providers must perform during each visit. These twin trends present a formidable challenge to effective diabetes primary care. We hypothesize that among complex patients not meeting diabetes management goals, a web-based health IT tool to help patients explicitly prioritize all health issues (both related and unrelated to diabetes) and then submit these priorities directly into the electronic health record (EHR) for a scheduled visit with their primary care provider will result in more effective diabetes management over time. To test this hypothesis, we propose to design, implement, and evaluate in a randomized clinical trial a web-based tool linked to the EHR that will enable complex patients to easily define care priorities for their upcoming visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary care physicians (PCPs) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with potentially eligible patients (type 2 diabetes and HbA1c &gt; 8.0%) wil be recruited and consented to participate in this study. PCPs will review lists of potentially eligible patients of theirs (defined below). Patients approved by PCP's allocated to the intervention arm will be sent a secure message on the PCPs behalf asking them to review the PreVisit Prioritization Questionnaire to identify top priorities for discussion at the next scheduled visit. Patient Current adult member (&gt; 21 years old) Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with most recent HbA1c &gt; 8.0% English as primary language Registered on kp.org. Patient Excluded by PCP, and/or: terminal illness, in hospice care or reside in a longterm care facility, severe mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia or personality disorder), currently or recently pregnant, and/or significant dementia</criteria>
