	<brief_summary>This study compares efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block and ilioinguinal nerve block for postoperative pain in patients undergoing inguinal herniorraphy with spinal anesthesia. One-third of the patients will receive standard postoperative pain regimen(control group), one-third will receive a transversus abdominis plane block (with ultrasound guidance) and the last group will receive an ilioinguinal nerve block(with ultrasound guidance) in addition to standard postoperative pain regimen. This study is a Randomized prospective open-label controlled study.</brief_summary>
