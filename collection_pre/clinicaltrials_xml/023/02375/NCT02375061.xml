	<brief_title>A Positive Psychology Intervention for Fibromyalgia Patients Using ICTÂ´s</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of positive psychological factors in pain adjustment. Specially, optimism has been linked to lower pain sensitivity, better physical functioning, less psychological distress and pain catastrophizing. Until recently, the beneficial effects of optimism on pain have been studied mostly in correlational studies or in experimental interventions in laboratory settings. To address the gap between research and clinical practice, the aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the Best Possible Self intervention (BPS) using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with fibromyalgia patients. BPS is a guided imagery exercise that requires participants to envision themselves in the future, achieving desired goals in different areas of their lives. This exercise has shown efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control condition, in general population (Meevissen, Peters &amp; Alberts, 2011; Sheldon &amp;Lyubomirsky, 2012; Peters, Flink, Boersma &amp; Linton, 2010). Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate the findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in a chronic pain population. The exercise will be applied through a Positive Technology system and the effects will be analyzed during four months. The design employed in this study is similar to the used in other studies (Meevissen et al, 2011; Renner, Schwarz, Peters &amp; Huibers, 2014; Sheldon &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2006).</detailed_description>
