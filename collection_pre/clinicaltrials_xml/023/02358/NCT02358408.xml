	<brief_summary>The study consists of 2 parts: The objective of part 1 of this study is the performance of a short evaluation of system accuracy for 25 subjects in order to familiarize the study personnel with the study BGMS to be used during the planned evaluation of system accuracy (see IDT-1416-BL (Part 2)), ensure that the Karajishi meters are fully functioning, assure and document the accuracy of the comparison method, evaluate and validate the processes and procedures of the study methodology. The objective of part 2 of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy following ISO 15197:2013 (E), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test procedures for blood glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose by patients are stipulated. This study will be performed for Karajishi Contour and Karajishi Contour TS (manufacturer: Bayer Healthcare Diabetes Care) with 3 reagent system lots for each BGMS.</brief_summary>
