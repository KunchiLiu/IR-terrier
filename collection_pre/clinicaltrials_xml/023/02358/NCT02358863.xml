	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether molecular profile-directed therapy (otherwise known as personalized treatment) can improve the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy combinations for patients with esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. A series of tests will be performed on a sample of tumor; based on the results of these tests, a patient will be assigned to a chemotherapy treatment.</brief_summary>
