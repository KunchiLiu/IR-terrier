	<brief_summary>This is a study comparing grazoprevir (MK-5172) plus elbasvir (MK-8742) treatment with sofosbuvir (SOF) plus Pegylated Interferon plus Ribavirin (RBV) [PR] treatment in treatment-naïve and prior PR treatment failure participants with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype (GT)1, GT4, or GT6 infection. The primary objectives are to compare efficacy (assessed by the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 12 weeks after ending study treatment [SVR12]) and safety between the grazoprevir plus elbasvir treatment arm and the SOF plus PR treatment arm. The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving SVR12 in the grazoprevir plus elbasvir treatment arm is non-inferior to that in the SOF plus PR treatment arm.</brief_summary>
