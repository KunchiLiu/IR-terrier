	<brief_summary>Trial is to evaluate the safety and performance of the NovaCross™micro-catheter in respect to providing additional guidewire support that is expected to allow easier crossing of femoropopliteal and infra-popliteal Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesion. The procedure will be conducted on a patient diagnosed with a CTO in a peripheral vessel that requires revascularization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective, Non-randomized Study to Evaluate the Safety and Performance of the NovaCross™ Microcatheter in Femoropopliteal Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, single center, prospective, first in man pilot study in which the investigational device, NitiLoop micro-catheter, will be tested in up to 15 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease scheduled to undergo CTO in an anterograde approach.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Adult aged 2580 2. Patient understands and has signed the study informed consent form. 3. Patient has symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) requiring endovascular revascularization of a CTO, evidenced by angiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography. 4. Patient has an occluded femoropopliteal or infra popliteal artery 5. Target femoropopliteal or infrapopliteal vessel is ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤5 mm in diameter. 6. Patient has RutherfordBecker Classification of 25. 1. Patient unable to give informed consent. 2. Current participation in another study with any investigational drug or device. 3. Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to contrast materials that cannot be adequately pretreated. 4. Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to antiplatelet medications. 5. Patient is pregnant or lactating. 6. Patient has a coexisting disease or medical condition contraindicating percutaneous intervention. 7. Target lesion is in a bypass graft. 8. Target lesion is in a stent (i.e., instent restenosis). 9. Patient has had a procedure on the target limb within 7 days. 10. Patient had undergone attempted treatment of the CTO within the prior 3 months (to prevent a guidewire from entering dissection planes created by prior recanalization attempts. 11. Vasculitis and Buerger disease (thrombendarteritis obliterans) 12. Evidence of embolism 13. Peripheral vessel aneurysm</criteria>
