	<brief_title>Microendoscopic Discectomy Vs Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy Vs Open Discectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common diseases in the department of orthopedics, which produced medical and economic burdens to families and society. In spite, the majority of the patients with disc herniation can be relieved or even cured via conservative treatment; there are still a considerable number of invalid patients who eventually still need to be undergoing a surgical operation treatment. Three main methods for intervertebral disc surgery are adopted in our routine work. One procedure is Open Discectomy (OD), which has been always a gold standard for treatment of LDH. And the other two procedures are Microendoscopic Discectomy (MED) and Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy (TELD) respectively. MED and TELD have been developed as alternatives to OD. OD can compress the nerve root or spinal cord through removal of the protrusion. However, it destroys the rear structure of spine, causing segmental instability and long-term distress. Compared with OD, MED and TELD procedures are smaller incisions or less dissection (or both), lower blood loss, less postoperative pain, shorter hospitalisation and earlier return to work. However, the steep learning curves of MID inhibit the development of surgery specialists; for example, optimal surgical management requires many years of experience. These deficiencies need more educational effort at a higher priority than accorded so far. There are inconsistent outcomes about the efficacy and safety in the previous studies; all of the recent researches do not yield conclusive results.</detailed_description>
