	<brief_summary>The 5 year survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer is less than 5 %. Since the introduction of gemcitabine, further advances in therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting have been extremely slow. Numerous phase III studies have evaluated different gemcitabine-based regimens as first-line therapy, but in most cases, any observed benefits have been small and restricted to patients with a good performance status (PS). Recently two new chemotherapy combination schedules, FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel demonstrated a significant survival improvement compared to gemcitabine alone. Nab-paclitaxel is especially interesting because it is able to break-down the tumor matrix and increases the concentration of cytotoxic drugs in the tumor. Our study will explore the modification of the desmoplastic reaction seen in pancreatic cancer using two approaches, targeting tumor stroma by nab-paclitaxel and the hedgehog inhibitor LDE225 and targeting the tumor cells with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of LDE225 With Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growing body of evidence suggests that the stroma is not only a mechanical barrier that may prevent efficient delivery of various anticancer therapies to the tumor, but also constitutes a dynamic compartment of pancreatic tumors that is critically involved in tumor formation, progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting both tumor stroma and cancer cells could be a lucrative strategy to increase the efficacy of our therapeutic approach. In the present study we want to explore the safety and activity of the chemotherapy combination: Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + LDE225. LDE225 is a hedgehog inhibitor with promising antitumor activity in several cancer models, including pancreatic cancer. One of the main activities is also the degradation of the tumor matrix. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated with fixed doses of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, the same doses used in the recently presented phase III study (von Hoff American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013). In the phase I part of the study LDE225 will be added according to standard dose escalation strategy for phase I studies, and at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) patients will be treated in the phase II part of the study.</detailed_description>

Patients who are planning on embarking on new physical activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in significant increases in plasma CK (Creatine Kinase) levels while on study treatment. 6. Patients who require the use of coumarin derivates cannot be enrolled as LDE225 is a competitive inhibitors of CYP2C9 based on invitro data. 7. Patients with chronic use of corticosteroids 8. Patients who are not willing to avoid consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice grapefruit hybrids, pomelos and exotic citrus fruits during the entire study and preferably 7 days before the first dose of study medications, due to potential CYP3A4 interaction with the study medications. 9. Patients who are not willing to stop taking herbal medications at least 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. 10. Patient is currently being treated with drugs known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5, which cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication 7 days prior to starting study treatment and for the duration of the study.. 11. Current medical history of the following: History of or presence of clinically significant uncontrolled ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmia Clinically significant resting bradycardia (&lt; 45 beats per minute) or any primary of secondary heart block History of unstable angina pectoris Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g. congestive heart failure NYHA Class IIIIV (New York Heart Association), atherosclerosis, labile hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension 12.

Patients who in the investigators' opinion may be unwilling, unable or unlikely to comply with requirements of the study protocol 15. Patient is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment with corticosteroids ((≥ the antiinflammatory potency of 4mg dexamethasone) or another immunosuppressive agent. 16.

Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of LDE225 (e.g., ulcerative colitis, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) 19. Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study. 20.
