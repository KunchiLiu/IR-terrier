	<brief_summary>This study is primarily exploratory and is designed to both identify factors that may have affected participant adherence to study product in VOICE, and describe how sexual behaviors, such as anal sex, may have had an effect on product efficacy. As such there is no specific hypothesis that is being tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study of Potential Sources of Efficacy Dilution in the VOICE Trial (MTN-003)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MTN-003D will use qualitative in-depth interviews and/or focus group discussions with VOICE participants to explore study product adherence and/or anal sex behaviors in greater depth than was measured quantitatively during trial participation. The study approach is designed to encourage honesty and to minimize socially desirable responses, which may have affected participants' ability/willingness to accurately report during the trial. An in-depth and candid understanding of the various behavioral factors that contribute to the dilution of efficacy may assist in the interpretation of VOICE trial results and inform future studies. In light of VOICE's divergent results, MTN-003D will explore the potential factors that may have contributed to efficacy dilution in the trial. MTN-003D, was initially designed after the early closure of the oral and vaginal tenofovir arms, and sought to explore those factors contributing to the dilution of efficacy using qualitative methods (Stage 1). Given the subsequent release of VOICE results in February of 2013 and the availability of drug PK data, Stage 2 of MTN-003D has been designed to explore factors influencing adherence in greater depth, including HIV risk perception and motivation to join the trial.</detailed_description>
