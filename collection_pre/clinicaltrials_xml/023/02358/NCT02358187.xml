	<brief_summary>The study will assess the immunogenicity, safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of the GAA/TT-peptide vaccine and poly-ICLC in HLA-A2+ children with unresectable low-grade gliomas that have received at least two chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Radiation therapy counts as one biologic regimen, but patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Vaccine Trial for Low Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated with subcutaneous injections of GAA/TT-vaccines starting on Week 0 and every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 8 cycles or until Off-treatment criteria are met (Section 4.6). I.m. poly-ICLC will be administered (30ug/kg i.m.) immediately following the vaccine. Poly-ICLC should be administered i.m. within 3 cm of the peptide-injection site. To allow for flexibility with scheduling, the peptide vaccine and Poly-ICLC dose may be given within one week of the date that the vaccine and poly-ICLC administration are due. Patients will be evaluated for any possible adverse event, regimen limiting toxicity (RLT) as well as clinical/radiological responses by clinical visits and MRI scanning. Follow-up MRIs will be performed (Weeks 6, 15 and 24).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Tumor Type Unresectable lowgrade gliomas that have received at least two chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Radiation therapy counts as a biologic regimen. Patients may not have received radiation therapy to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. Patients may have tumor spread within the CNS. HLAA2 positive based on flow cytometry. Patients must be clinically stable and off or on lowdose (no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day Dexamethasone) corticosteroid for at least one week prior to study registration. Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt; 22 years of age at the time of HLAA2 screening. Patients must have a performance status of ≥ 70; (Karnofsky if &gt; 16 years and Lansky if ≤ 16 years of age. Documented negative serum betaHCG for female patients who are postmenarchal. Because the effect of the peptidebased vaccine and polyICLC on the fetus has not sufficiently been investigated, pregnant females will not be included in the study. Patients must be free of systemic infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of registration. Patients must be off IV antibiotics for at least 7 days prior to registration. Patients with adequate organ function as measured by: Bone marrow: ANC &gt; 1,000/µ; Platelets &gt; 100,000/µ (transfusion independent); absolute lymphocyte count of ≥ 500/µ; Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dl (may be transfused). Hepatic: bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional normal for age; SGPT (ALT) &lt; 3x institutional normal. Renal: Serum creatinine based on age or Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/ml/min/1.73 m² Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to grade 1 or better. Patients must be at least 3 weeks from the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least 1 week from the last dose of nonmyelosuppressive biologic therapy. No overt cardiac, gastrointestinal, pulmonary or psychiatric disease. Patients living outside of North America are not eligible. Patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment. Concurrent treatment or medications (must be off for at least 1 week) including: Interferon (e.g. IntronA®) Allergy desensitization injections Growth factors (e.g. Procrit®, Aranesp®, Neulasta®) Interleukins (e.g. Proleukin®) Any investigational therapeutic medication Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement. Use of immunosuppressives within four weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used in the perioperative period must be tapered to no more than 0.1 mg/kg/day, max 4 mg/day dexamethasone for at least one week before study registration. Topical corticosteroids are acceptable. Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy, HIVpositive patients are excluded from the study. Patients who have received prior immunotherapy.</criteria>
