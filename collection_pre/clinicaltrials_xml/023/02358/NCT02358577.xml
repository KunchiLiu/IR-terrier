	<brief_title>Early In-bed Cycling in Critically Ill Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single centre, Pilot RCT that will evaluate in-bed cycling in addition to usual care physiotherapy, compared to usual care physiotherapy, on functional recovery in critically ill children. We will conduct a qualitative substudy to evaluate caregiver impressions of the intervention, and to understand barriers and facilitators to implementing early mobilization in critically ill children.</detailed_description>
