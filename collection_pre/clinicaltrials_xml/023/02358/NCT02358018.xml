	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use a new type of scan, called 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scan, instead of OctreoScan, the standard scan, to diagnose, monitor and manage your tumor. 68Ga-DOTATOC is an improved imaging agent being routinely used in many centers outside the USA, with better tumor detection than with OctreoScan.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosed or suspected NET requiring 111Inpentetreotide imaging for clinical indications. High risk of NET because of familial predisposition with clinical findings requiring radiolabeled somatostatin imaging. Other somatostatin positive tumor for which 111Inpentetreotide has been used successfully (for example adult meningioma). Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of 68GaDOTATOC in pregnancy are not known; exceptions may be performed if expected risk outweighs the benefit. Pregnancy testing will follow MITS procedure for diagnostic reagents. Patients self report pregnancy status. If pregnant the test will not be performed unless in the clinical opinion of the attending physician the gain of the test is likely to outweigh the risk (this will be rare). If unsure whether pregnant or not then a urine or serum pregnancy will be performed. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of 68GaDOTATOC in the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued for at least one day if the mother receives 68GaDOTATOC. Patients that have contraindications for 111Inpentetreotide. Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to oral contrast will preclude administration of such contrast (will preclude receiving oral contrast only). Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of the PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT, PET/CT and MRI that will result. Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.</criteria>
