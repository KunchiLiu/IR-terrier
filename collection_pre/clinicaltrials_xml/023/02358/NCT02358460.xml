	<brief_title>Pressure-limited Ventilation Versus Volume-targeted Ventilation in Term Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: There is increasing evidence that volume-targeted ventilation (VTV) holds benefits for preterm infants in comparison to pressure-limited ventilation. It is not known whether the same is true in the case of infants born at term. This study aims to compare pressure-limited to VTV in term-born infants. Hypothesis: Volume-targeted will be associated with significantly earlier extubation compared to pressure-limited ventilation Primary outcome: Time to extubation. Methods: Ventilated infants 34 weeks or more gestational age at birth were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either pressure-limited or VTV. Adjustments to ventilator settings were made according to the trial protocol. Infants were deemed to have met failure criteria if they required HFOV or peak pressures of more than 30 cm of water. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat.</detailed_description>
