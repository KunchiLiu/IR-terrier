	<brief_title>The Effect of Theory Menu-Based Intervention on Vitamin D Adherence in People With Osteoporosis-Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis is a common disease around the world. The morbidity and mortality attributed to osteoporosis is due to fracture. The evidence shows that vitamin D is effective in preventing osteoporotic fracture, however, adherence to vitamin D is low among people with osteoporosis (20%-60%). The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) has been found useful to describe, explain, and predict changes in health behaviours in a variety of setting. Based on HAPA, mini-videos will be developed aiming to increase vitamin D adherence in people with osteoporosis. Mini-videos will address self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, risk perception and action and coping plan. This pilot study aims to evaluate the recruitment and participants' feedback about the mini-videos.</detailed_description>
