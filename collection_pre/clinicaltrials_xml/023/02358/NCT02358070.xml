	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - to investigate the risk factors of HCC among Americans with focus on lifestyle factors and energy balance. - to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes that are associated with HCC risk through a genome-wide search. - to assess if genetic susceptibility differs by hepatitis virus infection or lifestyle factors, and to explore if there are interplays or effect modifications between genetic factors and viral infection or lifestyle factors.</brief_summary>
