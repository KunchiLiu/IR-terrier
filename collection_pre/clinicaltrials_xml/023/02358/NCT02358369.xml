	<brief_summary>The Bimatoprost Ocular Insert is intended to provide sustained delivery of bimatoprost to the ocular surface to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different doses of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert, compared to an active control arm with timolol ophthalmic solution (0.5%).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Written informed consent At least 18 years of age Diagnosis in both eyes of either primary openangle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension Best correcteddistance visual acuity score equivalent to 20/80 or better Stable visual field Central corneal thickness between 490 620 micrometers Inclusion Criteria at the Randomization Visit: IOP for each eye is ≥ 23 mmHg at T=0hr, ≥ 20 mmHg at T=2hr and T=8hr. Intereye IOP difference of ≤ 5.0 mmHg at T=0hr, T=2hr and T=8hr. IOP for each eye is ≤ 30 mmHg at T=0hr, T=2hr and T=8hr.
