	<brief_summary>Recently, It is known that the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) with extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is greater than that of BTX-A with electrical stimulation in the management of post-stroke spasticity of the upper limb. However, it was not determined which dose of ESWT is optimal as a adjuvant therapy after BTX-A injection on the upper limb in patients with stroke. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal dose of ESWT after botulinum toxin type A injection for post-stroke spasticity</brief_summary>
