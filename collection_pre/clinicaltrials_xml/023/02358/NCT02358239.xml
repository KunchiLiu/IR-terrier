	<brief_summary>Dizziness and vertigo account for roughly 4% of chief symptoms in the emergency department (ED). Pharmacological therapy is often solicited for these symptoms, such as vestibular suppressants, anti-emetics and benzodiazepines. However, every medication is accompanied with unavoidable side-effects. To the best of the investigators knowledge, no papers surveyed assess the feasibility of applying acupuncture as an emergent intervention means to the treatment of dizziness and vertigo. The investigators study targeted on filling in this gap by performing a clinical control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine - acupuncture - in treating patients with dizziness and vertigo in ED.</brief_summary>
