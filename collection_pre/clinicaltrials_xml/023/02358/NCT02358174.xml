	<brief_summary>An association between hemorrhoidal disease and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been described previously. MMPs regulate extracellular structural proteins and tissue remodeling. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is involved in the regulation of MMP activity. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between the levels of MMPs and NGAL and different stages hemorrhoids. The study provides potentially important insights to the understanding of the natural history of Hemorrhoids and MMPs and NGAL regulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction. An association between hemorrhoidal disease and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been described previously. MMPs regulate extracellular structural proteins and tissue remodeling. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is involved in the regulation of MMP activity. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between the levels of MMPs and NGAL and different stages hemorrhoids. Methods. In a multicenter, open-label, prospective study, patients with hemorrhoids were recruited and represented the Group I (patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids - Grade I to IV sec. Goligher), a further group of healthy volunteer subjects were also recruited as the control group (Group II). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis will evaluate the levels of immunoreactive MMPs and NGAL in all patients with hemorrhoids.</detailed_description>
