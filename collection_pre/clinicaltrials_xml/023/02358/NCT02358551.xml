	<brief_summary>The intrathoracic subclavian venous technique for pacemaker implantation may be associated with serious complications. Axillary vein puncture tends to reduce lead implantation complications such as pneumothorax and lead crush, but clinical adoption is not widely acknowledged, especially in China, although this approach has been proposed for 20 years. The major concern is the learning curve for axillary vein puncture and its success rate. The investigators try to prove that the success rate of axillary vein puncture is non-inferior to subclavian vein puncture, hence to promote the clinical application of axillary vein puncture to reduce pacemaker implantation complications.</brief_summary>
