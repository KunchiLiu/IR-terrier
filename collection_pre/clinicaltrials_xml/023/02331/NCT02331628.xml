	<brief_summary>Effect of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Chronic Neurogenic Heterotopic Ossification in Traumatic Brain Injured (TBI) patients Chronic Neurogenic Heterotopic Ossification (NHO) - Heterotopic ossification is a well known late complication of traumatic brain injury. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy - ESWT- is used in various medical situations and is being tested for feasibility of use in TBI patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ESWT as a Treatment for Chronic NHO in TBI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Title Effect of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Chronic Neurogenic Heterotopic Ossification in Traumatic Brain Injured (TBI) patients. The investigators primary objective is to determine whether Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) is effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with traumatic brain injury who have heterotopic ossification around the hip or knee. The investigators hypothesize that four applications of ESWT to the affected hip or knee joint in the patient group will demonstrate a positive physiological effect and this will lead to a reduction in pain and improved function.</detailed_description>
