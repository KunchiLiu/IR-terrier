	<brief_summary>The performance of multiple minor hepatectomies (MMH) instead of major hepatectomies (MH) in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is object of debate. We build a study, using the propensity score matched analysis, to compare the short- and long-term outcome of the tow groups of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Minor Hepatectomies Versus Major or Extended Hepatectomies for Colorectal Liver Metastases.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to investigate the outcome of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) undergoing multiple minor hepatectomies (MMH) instead of major hepatectomies (MH). Indeed, the performance of MMH versus MH in patients with CLM is object of debate. For this purpose, the databases at two independent institutions were retrospectively reviewed. To control for confounding variable distributions, a propensity score-matched analysis 1:1 was performed, and the nearest neighbor-matching method with caliper distance of 0.01 was used. Among 554 patients, 110 patients undergoing MMH and 110 undergoing MH were matched. They were similar in baseline characteristics, comorbidities, features of the primary tumors, and CLM. Primary outcomes were short- and long-term outcome.</detailed_description>
