	<detailed_description>Fatigue Severity Scale We used to be KRUPP's fatigue severity scale. The survey has nine questions as following: (1) my motivation is lower, when I am fatigued (2) exercise brings on my fatigue (3) I am easily fatigued (4) fatigue interferes with my physical functioning (5) fatigue causes frequent problems for me (6) my fatigue prevents sustained physical functioning (7) fatigue interferes with carrying out certain duties and responsibilities (8) fatigue is among my 3 most disabling symptoms (9) fatigue interferes with my work, family, or social life. All subjects scored each question on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = neither disagree nor agree to 7 = strongly agree). All fatigue severity scale calculated and collected by one research nurse (C.W.K) in the Department of Internal Medicine.</detailed_description>
