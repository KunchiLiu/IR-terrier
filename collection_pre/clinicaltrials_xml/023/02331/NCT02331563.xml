	<brief_summary>A total of 60 adult patients American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I,II, III were randomized to Group B (n = 30) receiving TAP block with 0.25% bupivacaine and Group D (n = 30) with 0.5 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine added to 0.25 % bupicavaine followed by general anaesthesia. Total local anaesthetic volume was standardised with 20 ml each sides of the abdomen. Hemodynamic responses to surgical incision and intraoperative fentanyl consumption were noted. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were assessed on the emergence, at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 24 h. Time to first rescue analgesic (when VAS â‰¥4 cm or on demand), duration of postoperative analgesia, incidence of postoperative nausea-vomiting were also noted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Effect of Dexmedetomidine in Ultrasound (USG) Guided Transvers Abdominis Plane Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been shown to provide postoperative pain relief following various abdominal and inguinal surgeries. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to assess the effect of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks on opioid requirements and median hospitai stay, postoperative nause and vomitting in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
