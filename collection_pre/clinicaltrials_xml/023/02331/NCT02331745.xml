	<brief_title>RCT Study on Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor(G-CSF) Treatment of Hepatic Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can be used to mobilize stem cells to the periphery and the liver tissue in patients with advanced liver disease, and could promote hepatic regeneration. Moreover, G-CSF was reported to protect patients from sepsis by restoring the function of both neutrophils and monocytes. Therefore, G-CSF therapy may be beneficial for liver regeneration in patients with ACLF induced by different causes. standard therapy for the treatment of ACLF includes reduced glutathione, glycyrrhizin, ademetionine,polyene phosphatidylcholine, alprostadil, and human serum albumin) on the day of admission. HBV associated ACLF patients receive entecavir at the same time</detailed_description>
