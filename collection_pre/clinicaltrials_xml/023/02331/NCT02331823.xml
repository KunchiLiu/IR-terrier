	<brief_title>Research on New Regimens for Retreatment Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>China is the country with the second highest Tuberculosis (TB) burden in the world. Most of the retreatment TB patients may develop multi-drug resistant. The resistant rate of any of the anti-TB drug is 35.9%, and the multi-drug resistant rate is 15.4%. Retreatment TB becomes one of the factors which inhibit the decrease of morbidity and mortality of TB. It is also a tuff work in TB control. At present the standardized regimen for retreatment TB is 2SHREZ/6HRE or 3HREZ/6HRE. The drugs in the regimen are all first-line anti-TB drugs which are unsuitable for the high drug resistance prevalence, because the cure rate of this regimen is low and the adverse reaction is severe. Our study is a national multi-center, prospective trail to investigate the efficacy of a new super-short regimen for retreatment TB patients. The new regimen consists of 5 drugs lasting 5 months. The cure rate and success rate of the new regimen is compared with standardized regimen usually 8-9 months in order to obtain the optimized regimen.</detailed_description>
