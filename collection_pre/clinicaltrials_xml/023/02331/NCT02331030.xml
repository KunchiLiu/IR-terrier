	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of Pecs II block to ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block in patients undergoing arteriovenous graft creation surgery. Participants will be randomised into two equal groups, one receiving supraclavicular and pecs II blocks, the other receiving supraclavicular block and sham block (Grade 1).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial Comparing Supraclavicular Block vs Supraclavicular and Pecs II Block in Arteriovenous Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regional anaesthesia (RA) for arteriovenous grafting surgery has advantages of avoiding risks of general anaesthesia (GA) in this group of patients with significant co-morbidities, and beneficial vasodilatation, which may prevent early fistula thrombosis. Hence, RA is preferable to GA for this surgery. Brachial plexus blocks (BPB) are the most commonly employed RA technique to anaesthetise the upper limb for this surgery. According to the results of a recent 2-year retrospective audit in our centre, ultrasound-guided supraclavicular BPB are the most popular RA technique for this surgery. Anatomically, the T1 and T2 dermatomes are often missed by the supraclavicular BPB. This means that the upper medial arm and axilla (sites involved in brachiobasilic and brachioaxillary arteriovenous grafting) may not be adequately anaesthetised, mandating intraoperative local anaesthetic supplementation by the surgeon. This may affect patients' and surgeons' acceptance of, and satisfaction with the RA technique. The ultrasound-guided Pecs II block, described by Blanco et al, seems to address this problem, as the intercostal T1-6, intercostobrachialis, long thoracic nerves and nerve to serratus anterior are targeted by this block.</detailed_description>
