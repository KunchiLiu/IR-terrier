	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Effects of Rivaroxaban Versus Dabigatran</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study showed that administration of rivaroxaban reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. However, it is unknown whether the anti-inflammatory markers are decreased in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving novel oral anticoagulants.</detailed_description>
