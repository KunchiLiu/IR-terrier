	<brief_title>Tiotropium Respimat Versus HandiHaler on SaO2 and Sleep in COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have poor sleep quality as a result of various alterations in oxygenation parameters and sleep macro- and micro-architecture. We aimed to compare the tiotropium Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler and the HandiHaler in terms of their effects on sleeping oxygen saturation (SaO2) and sleep quality in patients with COPD. In a randomized, parallel-group trial involving 200 patients with mild to moderate COPD (resting arterial oxygen tension &gt;60 mmHg while awake), we compared the effects of 6 months' treatment with the two devices on sleeping SaO2 and sleep quality.</detailed_description>
