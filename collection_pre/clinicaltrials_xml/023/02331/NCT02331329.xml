	<brief_summary>Cardiac output (CO) is an important parameter in the diagnosis and therapy of cardiac diseases. The current standard methods for the determination of CO, however, are either invasive (e.g. right heart catheterization) or technically expendable and expensive (magnetic resonance tomography, MRT). Therefore, the aim of the study at hand was to evaluate NICOM (bioreactance) as a new method for determinion of CO and to compare this new technique to MRT.</brief_summary>
