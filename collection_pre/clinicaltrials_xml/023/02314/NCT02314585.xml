	<brief_title>Fall Risk Reduction in Multiple Sclerosis (FIRMS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purposes of this project are four-fold: 1) to determine if a 6-month home-based targeted exercise program results in immediate and sustained reduction in falls risk and incidence ; 2) to identify the factors that contribute to a reduction in fall risk and incidence; 3) to determine if a decrease in physiological fall risk and/or fall incidence results in increased quality of life and participation in older adults with MS; and 4) to determine the association between cognition, environment and comorbidities on future falls and intervention efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria involve having an established definite diagnosis of MS Ability to walk 25 feet with or without aid Relapse free in the last 30 days Being â‰¥ 50 years of age Having fallen at least once in the past year Physician approval to engage in light physical activity Willingness and ability to attend the training sessions and testing sessions. We will exclude all individuals with risk factors contraindicative for undertaking strenuous exercise. During the initial phone contact with the project coordinator, participants will verbally respond to a health history questionnaire. Those individuals who are asymptomatic and meet no more than one risk factor threshold including family history of coronary heart disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle will be considered at low risk and included for participation.</criteria>
