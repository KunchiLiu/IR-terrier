	<brief_summary>This randomized trial studies transdermal or oral telapristone acetate in treating patients undergoing surgery to remove the breast (mastectomy). Telapristone acetate may help prevent breast cancer from forming in premenopausal women. Giving telapristone acetate transdermally may be safer and have fewer side effects than oral administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transdermal or Oral Telapristone Acetate in Treating Patients Undergoing Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate that mean levels of telapristone (telapristone acetate) in breast tissue following gel application will result in levels that are not more than 50% lower than those following oral administration. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess whether plasma concentrations of telapristone are significantly lower with transdermal than oral therapy. II. To compare within-breast variation of breast tissue concentration in transdermal and oral groups. III. To measure changes in cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67 [Ki67] labeling index) and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate [dUTP] nick end labeling [TUNEL]) in breast cancer samples obtained at diagnostic core needle biopsy (of cancer) or research core needle biopsy (of unaffected breast) with tissue samples obtained at mastectomy. Measure protein expression of related targets in the following order of priority: progesterone receptor isoforms (progesterone receptor [PR]A and PRB), and estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and TUNEL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) at baseline and after treatment. IV. Explore changes in gene expression in breast tissue related to telapristone therapy. V. Assess change in serum progesterone associated with telapristone therapy. VI. Assess the safety and tolerability of oral and transdermal administration. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (TRANSDERMAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE): Patients receive telapristone acetate transdermally and placebo orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks. ARM II (ORAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE): Patients receive placebo transdermally and telapristone acetate PO QD for 4 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 60.</detailed_description>
