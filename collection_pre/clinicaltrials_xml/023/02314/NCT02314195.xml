	<brief_summary>Previous studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of receptive individual music therapy as an adjunct to standard care, in a variety of psychiatric ailments including mood and anxiety disorders. However, the role of music in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder have not been investigated to date. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the efficacy of music therapy as an adjunct to standard treatment, on obsessions in patients with treatment-na√Øve OCD. Moreover, given the fact that a significant proportion of patients with OCD have other comorbid mood or anxiety disorders, the question of whether therapeutic benefits of music could be expanded to also affect concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms was explored.</brief_summary>
