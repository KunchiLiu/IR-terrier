	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of topical tranexamic acid to reduce perioperative blood loss, reduction in postoperative drain output and allogenic transfusion requirements. The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind (subject, surgeons, investigators, research coordinators) placebo-controlled study. Patients following high energy trauma who have sustained thoracic or lumbar spine fractures, dislocations or ligamentous injury with resultant instability requiring posterior spinal fusion will be enrolled for this study. Furthermore, patients undergoing elective complex deformity surgery will also be enrolled. Both populations of patients will be randomized into two groups. Group I will receive standard of care operative fixation with topical tranexamic acid intervention (test); Group II will receive standard of care operative fixation with normal saline (placebo) intervention. This study will have a 2-year follow-up and will consist of three periods: screening/enrollment phase up to 21 days from the day of injury to the day of randomization and operative intervention, an inpatient data collection period for 4 days postoperative, and then a follow-up period for 2-years postoperative (visits occurring at 2 week, 16 week, 1 year, and 2 year) time points.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid to Reduce Blood Loss in Spine Trauma Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reducing perioperative blood loss is critically important in the treatment of multiply injured combat casualties, and major blood loss during complex spine trauma surgery is a significant concern. Similar to previous studies in dental, cardiac, and total knee arthroplasty procedures, the use of topical tranexamic acid during complex combat related spine trauma surgery can be a cost-effective and simple route of administration to reduce blood loss, with no significant systemic effects. Patients would be expected to benefit immediately by decreasing blood loss and the need for blood transfusion postoperatively, thereby exposing them to less risk of transfusion reactions or disease transmission. This may also potentially decrease the rate of surgical site infection because patients have been found to have a significantly increased risk for surgical site infection after blood transfusion due to changes in the immune system, and by also decreasing the amount of blood that collects under the surgical wound, which serves as excellent medium for bacterial growth. The goal of the investigators study is to determine if the use of topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in the setting of complex spine trauma surgery reduces blood loss, and subsequently reduces the rate of allogenic blood transfusion and surgical site infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Thoracic or lumbar spinal column injury with or without neurologic deficit requiring surgical fixation 2. Surgical fixation to be performed within 21 days of injury 3. Adult patients undergoing long segment (&gt;5 fusion levels) posterior spinal fusions 1. Age &lt;18 or &gt;75 years old 2. Severe soft tissue disruption around planned surgical site preventing adequate primary wound closure 3. Physiologic instability or ongoing sepsis/infection 4. Use of intravenous tranexamic acid during the prestudy period 5. Ballistic spinal column injury 6. Allergy to tranexamic acid 7. Disturbances of color vision or color blindness 8. Preoperative hemoglobin value of &lt;7 g/dL, or &lt;10 g/dL if patient has comorbidities or symptoms which will require preoperative allogeneic blood transfusion 9. Refusal to consent for blood products 10. Participation in another clinical trial 11. Previous thoracic or lumbar spine surgery 12. Moderate or severe traumatic brain injuries that do not allow participation in individual patient outcomes surveys 13. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, anecdotal experience indicates that cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by TXA 14. Concomitant use of Factor IX Complex concentrates or Antiinhibitor Coagulant concentrates, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased 15. Preoperative use of anticoagulant therapy (heparin, lowmolecular weight heparin, warfarin) within three days before surgery, or nonsteroid inflammatory medication (aspirin, ibuprofen, naprosyn) use within seven days before surgery 16. Fibrinolytic disorders requiring intraoperative antifibrinolytic treatment 17. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 18. Coagulopathy (as identified by a preoperative platelet count of &lt;150,000/mm3, an international normalized ratio of &gt;1.4, or a prolonged partial thromboplastin time &gt;1.4 times normal) 19. History of arterial or venous thromboembolic disease (such as a cerebrovascular accident, deepvein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolus), as these patients may be at increased risk for venous or arterial thrombosis 20. Upper urinary tract or ureteral injury (ureteral obstruction due to clot formation in patients with upper urinary tract bleeding has been reported) 21. Pregnancy or breastfeeding (Category B) 22. Substantial renal dysfunction (as assessed by a serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 or calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 50) or hepatic failure 23. Major comorbidities: alcohol or drug abuse, illnesses that affect bone or calcium metabolism, connective tissue disorders, coronary artery disease, severe ischemic heart disease [New York Heart Association Class III or IV], previous myocardial infarction, severe pulmonary disease [forced expiratory volume &lt;50% of normal], diabetes mellitus (Type I or Type II), immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, severe penetrating or hemorrhagic traumatic brain injury, a history of skeletal malignancies, prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton. 24. History of seizure or convulsive disorders, or currently concomitant use of other medications that are known to reduce seizure threshold 25. History of dural tear or open subdural space</criteria>
