	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal is to facilitate the delivery of empirically supported treatments (ESTs) for mental disorders and to improve client mental health outcomes. Toward this end, this Phase II SBIR proposal seeks to complete the development and testing of PracticeGround, a comprehensive software system designed to integrate with electronic health records, and that contains multiple methods of training clinicians in ESTs and delivering ESTs to clients, continuous progress monitoring of client outcomes, and clinical support tools to guide clinicians and clients through delivery of the necessary EST. The investigators will conduct an 18-week randomized controlled trial (N=80) comparing PracticeGround (n=40) to care-as-usual (n=40) in depressed outpatient clients. PracticeGround clinicians will have full access to the software. Study clinicians and clients will be assessed once every six weeks (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 weeks). To ensure generalizability of findings, the investigators will not control for natural therapy variations (e.g.,session frequency, medication use, etc.). Primary outcomes include: depression, psychological distress, treatment satisfaction (clients and clinicians), and treatment drop out. Secondary clinician outcomes include: extent of PracticeGround use with clients across clinicians' caseload.</brief_summary>
