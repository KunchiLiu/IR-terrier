	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label Phase II study of the SINE™ compound Selinexor given orally to patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL and CTCL. Approximately 60 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and CTCL who meet the eligibility criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive Selinexor until either disease progression or intolerance has occurred.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label Phase II study of the SINE™ compound selinexor given orally to patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL and CTCL. Approximately 60 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and CTCL who meet the eligibility criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive Selinexor until either disease progression or intolerance has occurred. Enrolled patients will be given Selinexor at an oral fixed 60 mg dose (equivalent to ~35 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-4 of each 4-week cycle. There is no maximum treatment duration. Patients will receive supportive therapy to mitigate Selinexor side effects, as well as best supportive care (BSC).</detailed_description>
