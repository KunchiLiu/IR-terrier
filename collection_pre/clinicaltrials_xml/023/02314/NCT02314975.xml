	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficiency of conventional fixed appliance orthodontic treatment with that supplemented by the daily application of cyclic forces to the dentition via a removable (AcceleDent) vibrational appliance. The primary outcome measure is rapidity of tooth alignment; whilst secondary outcome measures include pain and discomfort during treatment, rapidity of orthodontic space closure, changes in arch dimensions and root length.</brief_summary>
