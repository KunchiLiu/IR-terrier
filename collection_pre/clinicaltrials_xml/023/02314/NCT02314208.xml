	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to study the efficacy of three candidate molecules (Xenbilox, Tahor and Resveratrol) in order to decrease the production of oxysterols by reducing the synthesis of cholesterol and/or regulate the production of bile acids and/or enabling neuroprotective action within the motor neuron.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Metabolic Intervention in Patients With Spastic Paraplegia SPG5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is: - decrease the accumulation of metabolites which can have a negative impact on neurological and systemic function of patients with SPG5. The secondary objectives of the study are: - confirm the clinical and biological tolerance of the different candidate molecules under study - improve the serum bile acid profile of patients with SPG5</detailed_description>
