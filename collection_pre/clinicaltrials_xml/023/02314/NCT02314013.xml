	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial for the Uncomplicated Diverticulitis in Right Colon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients in the study were randomly allocated to one of the following two treatment groups; no-antibiotics group or antibiotics group. Patients of no-antibiotics group were admitted to the ward and administered intravenous fluid and bowel rest at least up to 5 days until clinical symptom and sign were stabilized. And then the patient discharge until oral intake was tolerated. In antibiotics group, the treatment was initiated with an intravenous combination of a third generation cephalosporin or quinolone and metronidazole until oral intake was tolerated. Oral antibiotics such as cefpodoxime together with metronidazole were initiated subsequently on the ward. The total duration of antibiotic treatment was an expected average 10days. Patients in both group were re-visited outpatient clinic after an expected average 7 days for check-up of serology test (including complete blood count and C-reactive protein), and after an expected average 6 weeks for CT. If the patients did not re-visit outpatient clinic, we checked the call.</detailed_description>
