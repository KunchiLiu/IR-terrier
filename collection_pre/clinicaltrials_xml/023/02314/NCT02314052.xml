	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational anticancer drug DCR-MYC. DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC. MYC oncogene activation is important to the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. In this study the Sponsor proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/2, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study of DCR-MYC in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this second study in humans, DCR-MYC will be administered by 2 hour intravenous (IV) infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are either sorafenib-refractory, sorafenib-intolerant despite dose reduction and best supportive care, or for whom neither sorafenib nor other suitable therapy is available. During the Phase 1b portion of the study, the highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the preliminary antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated. During the Phase 2 portion of the study, up to 30 patients will be treated at the MTD identified in Phase 1b in order to further evaluate safety and tolerability, as well as assess the antitumor activity, of DCR-MYC.</detailed_description>
