	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with anal canal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Anal Canal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) with nivolumab in patients with previously treated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of nivolumab in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal. II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal treated with nivolumab. III. To evaluate the grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal when treated with nivolumab. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate ORR, PFS, and OS based on expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), peritumoral cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peritumoral CD4+ TILs, and regulatory T cells as analyzed from tumor biopsies in previously treated patients with metastatic SCCA of the anal canal when treated with nivolumab. II. To evaluate radiographic responses according to relative changes in proportions of anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) specific CD8+ and CD4+ TILs and regulatory T cells in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal following treatment with nivolumab, analyzed from serial peripheral blood samples. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes once every two weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days and then every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 50 mL/min (if using the CockcroftGault formula) Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab; women must not be breastfeeding; women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal; menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Brain metastases are allowed if they have been adequately treated with radiotherapy or surgery and have been stable for at least three months prior to registration; eligible subjects should be neurologically asymptomatic; there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for a minimum of 4 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration;
