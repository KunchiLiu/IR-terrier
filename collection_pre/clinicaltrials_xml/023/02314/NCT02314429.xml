	<brief_summary>In this first-in-human volunteer phase I clinical trial, a vaginal ring that slowly releases lactic acid (racemic mixture) into the vaginal environment, will be inserted in healthy volunteering women and left in place for 7 days. The primary objective of this phase I study is to assess the safety and the tolerability of this new intravaginal delivery system. The eventual goal of this and related studies is to develop a vaginal ring that reduces recurrences in women suffering from bacterial vaginosis, which is the commonest form of vaginal infection.</brief_summary>
