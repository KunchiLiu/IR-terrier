	<brief_summary>Single center, open-label randomized-control trial Population: de novo 48 kidney transplant recipients (age 18-75 years) from ECD/AKI donors Compare: everolimus with low dose CNI and prednisolone versus standard immunosuppressive regimen Objective: To evaluate efficacy of everolimus with low dose CNI in de novo kidney transplant recipients of ECD/AKI donors Primary endpoint: Mean eGFR (CKD-EPI) at 12 months post-transplantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients of ECD or AKI Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary Endpoints: - To assess renal function by means of eGFR (Cockcrault and Gault formula), at -Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation - To assess incidence of the individual composite endpoints including BPAR, graft loss and death at Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation - To assess the incidence and duration of renal replacement therapy - To assess the incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy (IF/TA) at Month 12 - To assess renal function by means of serum creatinine at Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation - To compare the overall safety and tolerability (incidence of AEs and SAEs, infections, discontinuations due to AEs, lab abnormalities, wound and surgical complications) at Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation Definition of ECD - Brain-dead donor &gt; 60 years old or - Donor age &gt; 50 years old with two of the following criteria; - History of HT - Terminal SCr. ≥ 1.5 mg/dL - Death from cerebrovascular accident Definition of AKI donor - Brain-dead donor with an increase of SCr. ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from baseline</detailed_description>
