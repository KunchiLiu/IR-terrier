	<brief_summary>A prospective, open, multicenter, randomized III trial with two arms: - Arm A: Primary tumor resection , followed by chemotherapy - Arm B: Chemotherapy alone. Compare overall 2-year survival rates in patients treated for resectable rectal adenocarcinoma with unresectable metastasis, treated either with the primary tumor resection with chemotherapy +/- target therapy, or with chemotherapy (+/- target therapy) alone.</brief_summary>
