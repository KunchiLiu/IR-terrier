	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is seen in approximately 6% of Americans. It is a serious medical condition with significant medical and psychological consequences, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The treatment of choice for OSA is Positive Airway Pressure therapy (PAP). PAP supplies positive pressure to the upper airway creating a "pneumatic splint" to keep the airway open during sleep. Adherence to PAP is notoriously low, with as few as 50% reaching minimal guidelines for adherence. One comprehensive review of adherence research found that adherence to PAP was less than that for any other medical disorder. The problem of adherence is significant not only because of the medical consequences that can ensue, but also because third party payers have begun to refuse to pay for PAP therapy when adherence is less than optimal, even in the face of clinical improvement. This is a critical time to address this problem. This research study is designed to identify methods that may help people respond to PAP, the most common therapy for OSA. Identifying these methods may be an important way to better care for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. With this research, the investigators hope to find ways to help people have a better response to treatment and a better quality of life.</brief_summary>
