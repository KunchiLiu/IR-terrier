Have a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 12% Ocular Conditions: 1. Any ocular condition in the study eye that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent improvement in visual acuity or successful completion of any study examination 2. Ocular hypertension or glaucoma, dry eye, and any other ocular pathology in the study eye requiring treatment with topical ophthalmic drops Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
