	<brief_summary>Arthritis is one of the most prevailing causes of disability with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) the most common form. The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic KOA by the age of 85 years is 44.7%, where females are at a greater risk (1.8 times) than male counter parts. KOA is the leading cause of limitations in activities of daily living such as walking and climbing stairs particularly in the elderly. This is primarily due to pain and instability of the joint resulting in buckling of knees caused by muscle weakness, joint stiffness and damage. Patients with KOA have larger variations in muscle strength and are unable to maintain a target force combined with impaired ability to perceive joint movement and positioning suggests impaired neuromuscular control (NC) may influence KOA. NC refers to the nervous system's control over muscle activation contributing to task performance. This study aims to establish the role of loss of NC in biomechanical determinants and health outcomes of KOA.</brief_summary>
