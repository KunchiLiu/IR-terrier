	<brief_title>Group- Versus Individual-Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy: a Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a common co-morbidity in patients with a chronic somatic disease which has a negative impact on patients' physical and mental health. In recent years, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has gained interest and popularity as a treatment not only for preventing recurrence of depression, but also to treat current symptoms. Usually, the training is delivered in group format, thus little is known about the feasibility and effectiveness of MBCT as an individual training. This pilot study aims to compare the effectiveness and feasibility of group and individual MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with a chronic somatic disease.</detailed_description>
