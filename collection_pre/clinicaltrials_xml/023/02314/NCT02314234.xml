	<brief_title>Improvement of Facial Nerve Monitoring in Parotid Surgery by Sugammadex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of facial nerve has been applied in identifying and preserving facial nerve during parotid surgery. In this setting, even a single dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxant may lead to delayed and weakened electromyography (EMG) signal in facial nerve monitoring during parotid surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block by sugammadex during IONM of facial nerve during parotid surgery</detailed_description>
