	<brief_title>G7 Acetabular System vs. Exceed ABT Acetabular System in THA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a multi-center randomized controlled study. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive a combination of G7 Acetabular system with CoC articulation and Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem or Exceed ABT Acetabular system with CoC articulation and Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem. Patient demographics, preoperative clinical outcomes, operative information, postoperative clinical outcome, radiographic assessment, incidence of squeaking, incidence of dislocation, implant survivorship and adverse events will be collected prospectively.</detailed_description>
