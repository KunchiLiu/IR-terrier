	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if it would be helpful to use advanced MRI imaging techniques to take additional views of the tumor target for radiation treatment planning or treatment follow-up MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced MRI Sequences for Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The results of this research project will be used to establish a standard MRI protocol specific to each tumor or disease site. An MRI protocol is a list of MR image types that are acquired for each disease site. These images are used to generate the patient's treatment plan.</detailed_description>
