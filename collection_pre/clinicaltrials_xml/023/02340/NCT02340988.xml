Positive breath test for alcohol and/or positive urine test for drugs of abuse at Screening. 3. Has a history or presence of alcohol/drug abuse within 2 years. Alcohol abuse is defined as regularly consuming &gt;3 units/day (21 units per week for men), &gt;2 units/day (14 drinks/week) for women. 1 unit of alcohol is defined as a can of 4% beer (330 mL), approximately 190 mL of 67% beer (malt liquor), a glass of 40% spirits (30 mL), or a glass of wine (100 mL). 4. Blood or plasma donation within past 2 months. 5. History of hypersensitivity to glycopeptide antibiotics (that have a similar chemical structure to oritavancin) or to any of the excipients of oritavancin. 6. History of hypersensitivity to warfarin or other 4hydroxycoumarins, or to any of the excipients of warfarin. 7. Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other investigational drugs or devices within 90 days prior to enrollment and/or unwilling to allow at least two months before participation in another drug trial following the current trial. 8. Treatment with any prescription or OTC (over the counter) drugs or herbal nutritional supplements within 2 weeks of Screening, with the exception of acetaminophen/paracetamol for minor headache. Subjects will not be allowed to receive medications for the duration of the study (except the above mentioned acetaminophen/paracetamol). Birth control or other hormone replacement is also permitted as long as it has been taken at a stable dose for at least three months before the Screening Visit and remains stable for the duration of the study. 9. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who have a positive pregnancy test result at screening. 10. Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth. control during the entire study period (i.e. condom with spermicide) 11. Known protein C or protein S deficiency. 12. Inflammatory Bowel Disease or conditions which may decrease the absorption of warfarin. 13. History of bleeding tendencies (e.g history of menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding). 14. History of heparininduced thrombocytopenia. 15. Surgery within the last 30 days.</criteria>
