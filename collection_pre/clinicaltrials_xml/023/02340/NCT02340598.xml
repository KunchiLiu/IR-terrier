	<brief_summary>Randomized trial of supplying a cold vest as compared with controls (no cold vest) on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids, insulin, blood pressure and body weight and also on basal metabolic rate. Recruitment of 100 participants and 70 are randomized to being given a vest which they can use to increase basal metabolic rate during 1-2 hours (as long as the pre-cooled vest stays cool) by activating brown adipose tissue and/or shivering. The remaining 30 subjects will constitute a control group. Lab tests and anthropometrics are checked at baseline, after 2 months and after 1 year.</brief_summary>
