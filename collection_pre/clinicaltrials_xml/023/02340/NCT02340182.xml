	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in the systemic priming of immune effector cells. Twelve healthy male volunteers, 18-35 years of age, will be treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole) for seven days, in order to deplete the gut microbiota. Blood and faeces will be sampled before, 24 hours and 6 weeks after the 7-day period of antibiotics. Main study endpoints include laboratory parameters for inflammatory responses, functional assays (ex vivo stimulation assay) and gut microbiota composition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of the Microbiota in the Systemic Immune Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Sepsis ranks among the top ten leading causes of death worldwide. Most nonsurvivors die in a state of immunosuppression. The gut microbiota exerts numerous beneficial functions in the host response against infections. Gut flora components express microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by neutrophils and macrophages. MAMPs from the intestinal microbiota constitutively translocate to the circulation and prime bone marrow derived neutrophils via PRRs. Antibiotic treatment, which is standard of care for all patients with sepsis, depletes the gut microbiota and leads to a diminished release of MAMPs and other bacteria derived products. This causes diminished priming of systemic immunity, which may attribute to sepsis associated immunosuppression and an increased susceptibility to invading bacteria. Objective: To investigate the role of the gut microbiota in the systemic priming of immune effector cells Study design: Within-subject-controlled intervention study in human volunteers Study population: Twelve healthy male subjects, 18-35 years of age Intervention: All subjects will be treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole) for seven days, in order to deplete the gut microbiota. Blood and faeces will be sampled before, 24 hours and 6 weeks after the 7-day period of antibiotics. Main study parameters/endpoints: Laboratory parameters for inflammatory responses, functional assays (ex vivo stimulation assay) and gut microbiota composition.</detailed_description>
