	<brief_title>The Impact of the Glycaemic Index (GI) on Daily Blood Glucose Profiles and Food Intake in Young Chinese Adult Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The GI is a method of classifying foods based on the food's ability to raise the blood glucose level. Low GI foods are recommended as they have a lower impact on blood glucose concentrations and also reduce total food intake. There is very little information on how eating high and low GI foods affect daily blood glucose concentrations in Asians. Therefore, the objective of this study is to observe the effect of eating high and low GI breakfasts and snacks on 24 hour blood glucose concentrations and food consumption in Asian males. Healthy, normal-weight, Chinese males will be recruited. There will be two sessions (consisting of four days for each session) where they will consume either a high or low GI breakfast or snack, and a standardized ad libitum lunch buffet. Their glycaemic response will be measured using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) throughout the period. The proposed research for the first time demonstrates how the consumption of high and low GI breakfasts and snacks affect subsequent energy intake and 24 hour blood glucose profiles in Asians. These findings will have significant public health benefits for optimum weight and dietary control.</detailed_description>
