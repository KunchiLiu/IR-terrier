	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects 2. 18 years and older 3. Histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma 4. Subjects must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to standard regimens 5. Prior lines of therapy: 1. For Phase 1b and: Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum or fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease. 2. For Arms A, B, and C of Phase 2: Must have received and have progressed, or arerefractory to one systemic platinum or fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinumor fluoropyrimidinebased therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen withrelapse within 6 months of therapy. 3. For Arm D of Phase 2: Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory totwo systemic regimens (one standard platinum or fluoropyrimidinebasedchemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen) for metastatic or recurrent disease. 4. Subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemicplatinum or fluoropyrimidinebased therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvantregimen with relapse within 6 months will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting. 1.
