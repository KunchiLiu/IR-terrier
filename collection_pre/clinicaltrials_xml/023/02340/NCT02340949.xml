	<brief_summary>This trial compares induction treatment with FOLFOX with or without aflibercept in a high risk population selected by MRI, prior to receiving standard chemoradiation (capecitabine combined with 50.4 Gy in 28 days) and surgery, in order to evaluate the efficacy in terms of pCR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction FOLFOX With or Without Aflibercept Followed by Chemoradiation in High Risk Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized trial comparing induction treatment with FOLFOX with or without aflibercept in a high risk population selected by MRI, prior to receiving standard chemoradiation (capecitabine combined with 50.4 Gy in 28 days) and surgery. Once it is confirmed that the subjects fulfill the eligibility criteria (MRI-defined high risk RC), and have signed the informed consent, a central review will be requested to confirm clinical stage, and then they will be randomized to receive mFOLFOX6 + Aflibercept or mFOLFOX6 (without Aflibercept). Random assignment of treatment will be stratified by T3 versus T4 stage. All the patients enrolled in the study will receive one cycle of study medication (mFOLFOX6 with or without aflibercept) every 14 days for six cycles, unless unacceptable toxicity or progression is detected. After this treatment, patients will receive standard chemo-radiotherapy (CT/RT) (capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily combined with a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 days) followed by surgery, provided they have not progressed. Patients with progression disease during the treatment phase will be withdrawn from the study and will receive their treatment according to the investigator's judgment. If a patient withdraws consent and refuses to receive further treatment, the patient must be followed up for 3 years from randomization or until progression, to evaluate disease-free survival. If a patient withdraws consent and refuses to continue in the study, the follow-up evaluations must be discontinued.</detailed_description>
