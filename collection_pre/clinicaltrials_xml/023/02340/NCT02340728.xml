	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects good and/or bad of combining radiofrequency ablation with placement of a second stent, versus a second stent alone. The investigators will also look at the safety of the combination treatment, and see which treatment is better. In either case, the second stent will be placed inside the existing stent as is done in standard practice when treating a blocked stent for the first time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with any tumor obstructing the distal bile duct and causing an indwelling biliary SEMS Patients with jaundice or clinical cholangitis, with new elevation of alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and imaging findings supportive of stent occlusion (loss of stent patency, debris within stent, loss of or excessive pneumobilia) Age â‰¥ 18 years Have altered gastroduodenal or hepatobiliary anatomy such that ERCP is felt to be unacceptably technically difficult or unsafe Have additional sites of biliary strictures (intrahepatic/hilar) such that ERCP stenting is felt to be unlikely to provide adequate clinical benefit Have cardiac pacemakers Have Child B/C cirrhosis Are pregnant Are unsuitable for endoscopy (either because of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress or unsafe hematological parameters such as refractory anemia &lt;7g/dL, thrombocytopenia &lt;50K/mcL, or coagulopathy with INR &gt;2.0) Have biliary strictures not technically amenable to endoscopic therapy</criteria>
