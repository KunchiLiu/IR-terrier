	<criteria>1. Adult 18 or over 2. Meets definition of acute sinusitis by Infectious Disease Society of America (2012) 3. Clinician and participant chose to start antibiotic treatment 1. Previously enrolled in the study 2. Allergic or intolerant to amoxicillin, penicillin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate 3. Specific medication concerns: lactating (since safety of clavulanate unknown); taking allopurinol (increased risk of rash); concurrent mononucleosis (increased risk of rash with amoxicillin); chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30; significant hepatic impairment; history of antibioticassociated colitis 4. Cognitive impairment so that unable to give informed consent or give reliable assessment of improvement 5. Need to use highdose amoxicillin/clavulanate: treatment with amoxicllin or penicillin within the past month (risk of penicillinresistant pneumococci), very ill patient (though not ill enough to send to hospital); immunocompromise 6. Need to hospitalize the patient</criteria>
