	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomised, prospective safety study in patients with rhinitis or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, with controlled asthma, and clinically relevant sensitisation to dust mites from the Pyroglyphidae and Glycyphagidae families.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of the Depigmented Modified Allergen Extract of Two Mites in Subjects With Allergic Rhinitis or Rhinoconjunctivitis, With Controlled Allergic Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the administration of two allergen extracts of dust mite mixtures at 200 DPP/ml (DP/MG/14-1 Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus / Blomia tropicalis and DP/MG/14-2 Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus / Lepidoglyphus destructor) using a rush build-up phase in patients with allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis, with controlled asthma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject has provided appropriately signed and dated written informed consent. 2. Men and women aged 18 years and 70 years of age at Visit 1. 3. Has an FEV1 value 80% of predicted normal value at Visit 1. 4. Individuals suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis moderatesevere for at least the preceding year, with controlled asthma, caused by double sensitization against Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DPT) and Lepidoglyphus destructor or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Blomia tropicalis. 5. Patients sensitized to coallergens such as tree pollen, grasses or weeds, fungi or animal epithelials cannot participate in the study if they are symptomatic. 6. If a female is of nonchildbearing potential, the subject must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile. 7. If a female is of childbearing potential, the subject must be nonlactating and nonpregnant and must correctly use an effective method of contraception during the study. 1. Any contraindication for treatment with allergen specific immunotherapy. 2. Subjects with a previous history of anaphylaxis. 3. Patients with hospital admission due to asthma exacerbations within 1 year prior to V1. 4. Has uncontrolled asthma, according to Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines (GINA 2010). 5. Acute or chronic infectious conjunctivitis. 6. Has acute or chronic inflammatory or infectious airways disease. 7. Has chronic structural diseases of the affected organ (e.g. eye, nose, lung). 8. History or presence of confirmed or potential diseases of the immune system including autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies of actual clinical relevance. 9. Has any disease that prohibits the use of adrenaline (e.g., hyperthyroidism). 10. Has a severe uncontrolled disease that could increase the risk to the subjects while participating in the study, including but not limited to, the following: cardiovascular insufficiency, any severe or unstable lung diseases, endocrine diseases, clinically significant renal or hepatic diseases or haematological disord</criteria>
