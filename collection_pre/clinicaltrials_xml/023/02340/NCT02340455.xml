	<brief_summary>Hyperalgesia is known to be caused by the excitatory amino acid through NMDA receptor. GABA, an inhibitory amino acid, alters the opioid receptor sensitivity against pain resulting hyperalgesia. If the GABA level can be maintained at certain level, the progression into hyperalgesia can be averted. GABA related drugs are known to decrease the postoperative opioid consumption, lower the degree of pain, and prevent hyperalgesia. We hypothesize the effective postoperative pain management and the prevention of hyperalgesia from pregabalin, GABA analogue, and the possible sex difference in such effects of pregabalin.</brief_summary>
