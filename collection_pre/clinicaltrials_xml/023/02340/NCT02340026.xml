	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal treatment duration of a novel early mobility training program (dynamic supported mobility, DSM) between 6 to 24 weeks of treatment; and to evaluate the clinical futility of this intervention compared to current rehabilitation practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a single-blind, randomized exploratory clinical trial with repeated assessments during a 24-week treatment phase and at three follow-up points over 12 months after treatment to track the developmental trajectory of participants' motor function. Gross motor ability will be compared to published percentile scores of motor function development in cerebral palsy (CP) to determine if the trajectory of predicted motor development is altered, and to outcomes of intensity-matched conventional treatment to determine if continued Phase III investigation is warranted.</detailed_description>
