	<brief_summary>The investigators are asking subjects to take part in the Patient NAVIgation to Reduce Readmissions among Black Men with Heart Failure (NAVI-HF) research study. This research study will test how well trained laypeople working as patient navigators will help patients recently hospitalized for heart failure avoid future hospitalizations. NAVI-HF is a new program sponsored by funding from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities. People who enter into the study will work with a patient navigator to undergo the full program or work with a trained layperson to receive general education on heart disease treatment and prevention. The purpose of the study is to determine whether a patient navigation program will be effective in reducing the number of hospitalizations in the future for program participants. This study will enroll 416 participants from UAB.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Therefore, in the Patient NAVIgation to Reduce Readmissions among Black Men with Heart Failure (NAVI-HF) study, the investigators propose to recruit 416 AA men with HF receiving inpatient care at UAB Hospital and randomize them either to HF self-care education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan (Education + PN arm) or to HF self-care education alone (Educational Control arm). The investigators will compare participant outcomes such as all-cause and HF readmission rates, HF self-care adherence as well as cost effectiveness across the two intervention arms. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To assess the 30-day all-cause readmission rates among male African American HF patients receiving HF self-care education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan versus HF self-care education alone 2. To assess the HF self-efficacy and heart failure self-care adherence among male African American HF patients receiving HF self-care education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan versus HF self-care education alone 3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HF self-care education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care plan versus HF self-care education alone</detailed_description>
