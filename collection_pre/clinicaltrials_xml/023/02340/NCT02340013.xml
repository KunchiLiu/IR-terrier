	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study examining the feasibility of implementing a large randomized control trial looking at the effect of endometrial shedding with medroxyprogesterone acetate compared to no pre-treatment in women taking clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction for infertility due to oligo-ovulation or anovulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endometrial Shedding Prior to Ovulation Induction Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of implementing a randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of giving medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to induce a withdrawal bleed compared to a control group of women not receiving MPA on pregnancy rates prior to ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate in oligo-ovulatory and anovulatory women. The primary outcome measure is the effective implementation of the study including a measure of time to recruit 50 patients, physician, nursing and patient compliance rate with the study protocol, and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcome measures include the pregnancy rate per ovulation (where pregnancy is defined as a positive fetal heart rate on ultrasound 2 weeks after a positive pregnancy test), the ovulation rate per cycle started, conception rate per cycle started (where conception is defined as a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level), conception rate per ovulation, time to complete 3 stimulation cycles and endometrial thickness at time of luteinizing hormone surge.</detailed_description>
