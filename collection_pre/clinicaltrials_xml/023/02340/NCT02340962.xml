	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TG-2349 in Combination With Peg-interferon and Ribavirin in Subjects With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1b Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of two different doses of TG-2349 combined with Peg-interferon (IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) in HCV-GT1b treatment naïve East Asian subjects. The treatment duration of TG-2349+IFN+RBV is 12 weeks, with or without an additional 12-week treatment of IFN+RBV, depending on HCV RNA level at On-Treatment Week 4. Approximately 24 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of the following 2 treatment groups: - Group I (n=12): 200 mg TG-2349 (2 capsules) + IFN + RBV - Group II (n=12): 400 mg TG-2349 (4 capsules) + IFN + RBV Randomization will be stratified by IL28B genotype "CC" or "non-CC". Subjects with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ (lower limit of quantification), TD (target detected) or TND (target not detected) at Week 4 will receive 12 weeks of TG-2349+IFN+RBV treatment. Subjects with HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ but &lt; 100 IU/mL at Week 4 will receive 12 weeks of TG-2349+IFN+RBV treatment followed by an additional 12 weeks of IFN+RBV treatment. However, subjects with HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL at Week 4 will discontinue the study treatment and complete the Early-Termination (ET) visit. The study will be terminated if 3 or more of the first 12 subjects enrolled across both Groups I and II, or ≥ 25% of subjects thereafter, fail to respond to treatment (i.e., confirmed on-treatment virologic failure or post-treatment relapse). Patients, except those who have achieved SVR12, will be offered the standard of care with Peg-interferon and Ribavirin for duration of 24, 48, or 72 weeks based on Taiwan's regulatory guideline and principal investigator's judgment.</detailed_description>

If no definitive diagnosis of cirrhosis by the above criteria, a liver biopsy is required; liver biopsy results will supersede noninvasive testing results and be considered definitive. 10. Screening ECG without clinically significant abnormalities. 11. Subjects must have the following laboratory parameters at Screening: 1. ALT ≤ 10 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) 2. AST ≤ 10 × ULN 3.

Creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 60 mL /min, as calculated by the CockcroftGault equation 9. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN 10. Hemoglobin ≥ 11 g/dL for female subjects; ≥ 12 g/dL for male subjects 11. Albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL 12. INR (International Normalized Ratio for Prothrombin Time) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is stable on an anticoagulant regimen affecting INR 13.
