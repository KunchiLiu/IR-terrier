	<brief_summary>This study will enroll people with SCI who are receiving physical therapy/exercise training. The goal is to understand if standing on a platform and receiving WBV prior to training results in decreased spasticity and improved walking ability compared to training alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Response Effects of Whole Body Vibration on Spasticity and Walking in SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 of this study has been successfully completed. The results of Phase 1 indicate that the combination of high-frequency (50Hz) and long duration 6 minutes (delivered in eight 45-sec bouts) of WBV was associated with the largest change in spasticity (as measured by the pendulum test). It also seems feasible that WBV would serve as a priming stimulus to increase responsiveness to training. The goal for Phase 2 is to understand if adding WBV to physical therapy/exercise training results in decreased spasticity and improved walking ability compared to the training alone. Two different doses of WBV, a short dose and a long dose will be tested.</detailed_description>
