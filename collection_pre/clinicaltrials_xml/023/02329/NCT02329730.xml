	<brief_summary>Choose healthy subjects and patients with TB, distribute them into different dose groups according to the recombinant EC allergen dose from low to high average. Conducting clinical trials of TB-PPD or placebo as controlled arms intradermal injection. Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin test，after the test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. Evaluate the safety of the recombinant EC allergy , and provide the appropriate dose range for phase IIb clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIa Clinical Study of Recombinant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Allergen ESAT6-CFP10</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First, 56 healthy subjects are distributed into different dose groups according to the recombinant EC allergen dose from low to high.Conducting clinical trials of TB-PPD as controlled arms intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin test，after the test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. The vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature), skin reaction at injection site (flush and induration) , local reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events; The vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram （before the skin test,after skin test 144h ）are the main test items,Evaluate the safety of the recombinant EC allergy in the expansion of the healthy people , and provide the appropriate dose range for phase IIb clinical trials. Second，56 patients of TB are distributed different dose groups according to the recombinant EC allergen dose from low to high. Conducting clinical trials of TB-PPD as controlled arms intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin test，after the test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. The vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature),skin reaction at injection site (flush and induration) , local reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events; The vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram （before the skin test,after skin test 144h ）are the main test items,Evaluate the safety of the recombinant EC allergy in patients of TB,and provide the appropriate dose range for phase IIb clinical trials. Third，32 patients of TB are distributed into different dose groups according to the recombinant EC allergen dose from low to high. Conducting clinical trials of placebo as controlled arms intradermal injection.Do specific interferon gamma detection before the skin test，after the test 72h±2h and 144h±2h. The vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature), skin reaction at injection site (flush and induration), local reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events; The vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram （before the skin test,after skin test 144h ）are the main test items,Evaluate the safety of the recombinant EC allergy in patients of TB on safety.</detailed_description>
