	<brief_title>Development of a Cellular Biomarker for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to identify objective, quantitative biological and molecular markers that correlate with healing outcomes for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) using debrided tissue of patients with wounds. This project aims to result in the identification of such markers, and the development of a feasible quantitative method of distinguishing between tissue that has the capacity to heal and tissue that does not, thus identifying a non-healing phenotype. The ability to differentiate between healing and non-healing tissue at the onset of wound care will allow for the use of targeted therapies and earlier initiation of aggressive treatments where indicated.</detailed_description>
