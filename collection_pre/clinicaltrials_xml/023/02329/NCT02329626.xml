	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to make a first evaluation of the relationship between metabolic abnormalities objectified by Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro- D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (PET CT 18 FDH) performed at rest at the onset of symptoms in patients with a first episode of motor conversion disorder and the persistence of a motor disability at 6 months measured by the modified Rankin score (mRS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: A. To assess whether metabolic abnormalities objectified by PET CT 18 FDH performed at rest at the onset of symptoms may be predictive of persistent disability at 6 months as measured by the EDSS, the NIHSS and WHO status. B. To assess whether metabolic abnormalities objectified by PET CT 18 FDH performed at rest at 3 months after diagnosis may be predictive of persistent motor disability at 6 months (EDSS, NIHSS, mRS, WHO) C. To search for and characterize any abnormalities of metabolism objectified in the initial PET CT 18 FDH predictive of persistent motor disability at 3 months. D. To determine if there are persistent metabolic abnormalities 3 months post-diagnosis independently of the clinical course (marker trait). E. Define the brain areas whose metabolism is often altered in patients with motor conversion disorders. F. Establish a collection of biological samples from patients for future research studies of prognostic biomarkers of a motor conversion disorder.</detailed_description>
