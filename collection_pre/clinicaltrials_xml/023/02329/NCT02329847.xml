	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), follicular cell lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Once the dose is optimized, the combination will be assessed for Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy, further safety in participants with CLL/SLL, FL or DLBCL and in participants with Richter syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Preliminary Efficacy of the Combination of Ibrutinib With Nivolumab in Participants With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study, which consists of Part A (Dose Optimization Cohorts) and Part B (Expansion Cohorts). Part A consists of two dose optimization cohorts (cohort A1 and cohort A2) will determine the RP2D for the combination based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic assessments in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Part B consists 3 participant populations to further evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab: Cohort B1 (participants with CLL/SLL with del 17p or del 11q), Cohort B2 (participants with FL), Cohort B3 (participants with DLBCL) and Cohort B4 (participants with Richter syndrome). Part A and B will consist of Screening Period (28 days before enrollment), Treatment Period and Follow up Period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). Participants will receive nivolumab intravenously (Day 1 of every cycle) and ibrutinib orally once daily on a 14-day cycle. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) and International Working Group (IWG) for lymphoma guidelines. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study. Further exploration of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and biomarker information will be assessed throughout the trial.</detailed_description>
