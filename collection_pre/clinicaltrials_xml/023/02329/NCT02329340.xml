	<brief_summary>Injuries are the leading cause of death and disability in children in America. Most injuries can be prevented when parents implement effective child safety practices. This project will create a behaviorally based program to teach parents what to do to prevent injuries to their school aged child, in an effort to reduce the number of injuries, hospitalizations, medical costs, and missed work days.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project will produce a comprehensive, interactive multimedia (IMM) program to teach childhood injury prevention skills to parents of children 6 through 11 years of age. This is one of a four-part series of funded programs to address injury prevention issues for three age groups of children (birth through 24 months, 2-5 years of age and 6-11 years of age). The program will be created in three formats: Internet/intranet, CD-ROM, and linear video (DVD) suitable for use in homes, worksites, medical settings, service agencies, and health information Web sites. On-screen narrators will guide the user through program material comprised of short video presentations, modeling vignettes demonstrating desired behaviors, supportive testimonials, and suggestions for modifications to home and recreational environments.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The basic lower age limit for parents or guardians of children aged 611 for this study was 18. Parents or legal guardians could potentially be as old as 65 or older. Only Englishspeaking participants were accepted because the program was developed only for English speakers. All Englishspeaking parents or guardians living in the U.S., with children aged 611 years old, who wished to participate were included. Parents under 18 were excluded from this online study because parental consent cannot be obtained online.</criteria>
