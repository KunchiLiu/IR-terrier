	<brief_summary>ERCP is the primary choice for removal of common bile duct stone (CBDS) currently. However, 4-24% patients underwent recurrence after successful clearance of CBDS. Stone re-formation due to chronic inflammation of biliary duct is generally considered an important cause of CBDS recurrence, which is associated with duodenal-biliary reflux (DBR) after sphincterotomy. Although it was believed that DBR was the important cause of CBDS recurrence, the direct evidence was still lacking. Here we conducted a case control study to investigate the DBR rate in patients with recurrent CBDS after ERCP.</brief_summary>
