	<brief_summary>Relatives of patients in situation of withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining therapies often show post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (60%)[1]. This number is even greater when family members are active in this decision (81%) or when communication is not optimal between medical team and family members. There are several ways to assist families of patients in intensive care units [2], amongst them the use of a written document to explain the environment, therapies and possible outcomes. Here the investigators want to test the impact of a written document in the context of end-of-life conference in intensive care units. Specifically, this research addresses wether such written support could decrease 3-months post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression exhibited by the closest family member or the patient representative.</brief_summary>
