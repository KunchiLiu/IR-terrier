	<brief_summary>Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory disease with the etiology of bacterial plaque and is associated with a number of putative bacterial species. The periodontal destruction is substantially mediated by the host, driven by the bacterial challenge. The presence of pathogenic bacteria with the absence of so-called "beneficial bacteria" and the susceptibility of the host are the main aetiological factors of periodontal diseases.</brief_summary>
