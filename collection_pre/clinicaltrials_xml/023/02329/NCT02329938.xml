	<brief_summary>Unlike Lichtenstein tension free repair for inguinal hernia, Desarda's repair was introduced as a pure tissue repair with no need for mesh. In other words; the complications which may arise from the use of a foreign body (mesh) will be avoided. The idea was to evaluate the efficacy of this new repair and compare it to the standard Lichtenstein repair.</brief_summary>
