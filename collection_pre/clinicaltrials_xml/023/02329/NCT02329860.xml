	<brief_summary>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial. This clinical study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with advanced liver cancer who have progressed on Systemic Therapy (Chemotherapy and/or Targeted Therapy). Approximately 360 patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to Apatinib or placebo (1/3 chance to receive placebo). Primary endpoint of the study is overall survival.</brief_summary>
