	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a respiratory rehabilitation exercise training package on dyspnea, cough, exercise tolerance, and sputum expectoration of hospitalized elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Using purposive sampling, 61 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 30) or the control group (n = 31). The experimental group participants received the respiratory rehabilitation exercise training twice a day and 10-30 minutes per session for four days. The control group participants received usual care and health education. Data were collected at baseline and at the end of the four-day intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The respiratory rehabilitation exercise training package included: (a) Disease awareness: The doctor explained the disease to patients and their families through the chest X-ray, (b) Sputum clearance treatments: Easily understood postural drainage cards were provided to the patients and families to assist with proper sputum clearance procedures, (c) Pursed lip breathing training: Devices were provided to the patients to ensure that the breathing exercises were completed properly, (d) Upper-limb exercise with breathing pranayama: Towels were provided to the patients to assist with upper-limb exercises properly, (e) Walking training with breathing pranayama: Legs were elevated while inhaling, and returned to the position while exhaling, and (f) Assign a pulmonary rehabilitation program coordinator: Coordinators were assigned to assist the patients in nutrition management and health education.</detailed_description>
