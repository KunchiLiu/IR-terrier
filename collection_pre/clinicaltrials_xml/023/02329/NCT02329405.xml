	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effects of pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation on hepatic fat content in healthy volunteers. Rifampicin (an antibiotic and also an efficient PXR activator) and placebo will be given for a week to volunteers. Hepatic fat content is measured with magnetic resonance imaging and blood samples are collected at the end of each study arm. The investigators' hypothesis is that rifampicin causes accumulation of fat to the liver.</brief_summary>
