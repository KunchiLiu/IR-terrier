	<brief_summary>This study is investigating whether combining noninvasive brain stimulation with behavior therapy can help to improve outcomes for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Exposure and response prevention (ERP) -- a specific type of behavior therapy -- is a first line treatment for OCD. This study will test whether a form of noninvasive brain stimulation called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can help ERP work better.</brief_summary>

Psychiatric medications will be limited to the following: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI; including clomipramine), combination antidepressants (including bupropion and SNRIs), buspirone, benzodiazepines, and/or stimulants (standing doses) Naive to tDCS Active substance use disorder Lifetime diagnosis of psychotic or bipolar mood disorder Previous minimally adequate trial of ERP (e.g., at least 16 sessions including both therapist and selfdirected exposure and response prevention) Therapy outside the study protocol which has evidence for efficacy with OCD during the study intervention period Active suicidal or homicidal ideation Organic brain disease or injury Any health problems that would interfere with study participation, including contraindications to tDCS (e.g., skin condition, mental implant in skull) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. All women participants of childbearing age are required to have a negative pregnancy test prior to treatment, and must use medically acceptable birth control during study participation. Medically acceptable birth control includes: established oral, injected, implanted, or vaginal ring hormonal contraception, an intrauterine device (IUD), two barrier contraception methods (condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), or having a vasectomized partner Use of anticonvulsant medications (including depakote, gabapentin, tegretol, dilantin, lamictal) and/or glutamateacting agents (including nacetylcysteine, riluzole, amantadine, memantine).</criteria>
