	<brief_summary>China, efforts are underway to respond to an unprecedented epidemiologic transition, with soaring rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart disease and stroke. Yet there may be limitations in translating observations and findings derived from Anglo-based population studies. As such, there is a critical need for population-based studies that provide insight into the risk factors, incidence, and outcomes of CVD in China. The Qingdao Port Health Study is a population-based prospective cohort study of employees of the Qingdao Port Group, China, designed to investigate the burden of CVD and risk factors (e.g., sociodemographic, biological, environmental and clinical factors) associated with disease onset and outcomes.</brief_summary>
