	<criteria>Inclusion: 1. Acute major bleeding episode requiring urgent reversal of anticoagulation; defined by at least one of the following: Acute bleeding that is potentially lifethreatening, OR Acute bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin level by ≥2 g/dL, OR Acute bleeding associated with a hemoglobin level of ≤8 g/dL if no baseline hemoglobin is available, OR Acute bleeding in a critical area or organ such as intraspinal, pericardial, or intracranial. 2. If bleeding is intracranial or intraspinal, the patient must have undergone a head CT or MRI scan demonstrating the bleeding. 3. Patient received or is believed to have received one of the following within 18 hours prior to andexanet administration: apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or enoxaparin. 4. For patients with intracranial bleeding, there must be a reasonable expectation that andexanet treatment will commence within 2 hours of the baseline imaging evaluation. Exclusion: 1. The patient is scheduled to undergo surgery in less than 12 hours, with the exception of minimally invasive surgery/procedures. 2. A patient with an intracerebral hemorrhage has any of the following: Glasgow coma score &lt; 7, OR Intracerebral hematoma &gt; 60 cc as assessed by CT or MRI 3. Patients with visible, musculoskeletal or intraarticular bleeding as their qualifying bleed. 4. Expected survival of less than 1 month 5. Recent history (within 2 weeks) of a diagnosed thrombotic event (TE) as follows: venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina pectoris hospitalization or severe peripheral vascular disease within 2 weeks prior to screening. 6. Severe sepsis or septic shock at the time of Screening. 7. Pregnant or a lactating female. 8. Patient has received any of the following drugs or blood products within 7 days of Screening: Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) Dabigatran Prothrombin Complex Concentrate products (PCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (rfVIIa) Whole blood, plasma fractions 9. Treated with an investigational drug &lt;30 days prior to Screening 10. Planned administration of PCC, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or rfVIIa from Screening until within 12 hours after the end of the andexanet infusion.</criteria>
