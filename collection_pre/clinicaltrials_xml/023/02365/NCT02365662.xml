	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 2. Has a solid tumor likely to exhibit elevated levels of EGFR (e.g. head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer ,colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme). Has an archived, diagnostic tumor tissue available for analysis. Has adequate hematologic, renal, cardiac and hepatic function. Expanded Safety Cohort participants must have confirmed metastatic lung cancer and progressed after receiving prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy. Previously received an EGFRdirected monoclonal antibody within the past 4 weeks. Has unresolved, clinically significant toxicities from prior anticancer therapy defined as &gt; Grade 1 on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. History of major immunologic reaction to any IgG containing agent. Any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator places the participant at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.</criteria>
