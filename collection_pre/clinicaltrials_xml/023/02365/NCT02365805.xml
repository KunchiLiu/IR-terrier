	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used for early-stage operable breast cancer. Response of breast cancer to NAC is correlated with survival: patients who obtain greatest survival advantage are those who attain complete response of their primary tumor. BReast Cancer 1 (BRCA1) plays a crucial role in DNA repair and associations between BRCA1 mRNA expression and sensitivity to platinum and/or resistance to taxanes has been previously documented. We propose a two-arm, randomized, multi-centre, open-label phase II study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of NAC customized by BRCA 1 levels versus standard FEC chemotherapy, being pathological complete response the primary endpoint.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used for early-stage operable breast cancer. Response of breast cancer to NAC is correlated with survival: patients who obtain greatest survival advantage are those who attain complete response of their primary tumor.BReast Cancer 1 (BRCA1) plays a crucial role in DNA repair. Associations between BRCA1 mRNA expression and sensitivity to platinum and/or resistance to taxanes are previously documented. Improving complete response rates with NAC we can improve outcomes in breast cancer. If we establish biomarkers which predict better response we may optimized treatment by individualized breast cancer care. Therefore, we propose a two-arm, randomized, multi-centre, open-label phase II study. The study will compare the efficacy and tolerability of NAC customized by BRCA 1 levels versus standard chemotherapy, being pathological complete response the primary endpoint. Women with primary Her-2 negative breast cancer who have not undergone previous treatment for invasive breast cancer will be randomized to receive the following: Treatment Arm 1 (standard therapy): 5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide day 1 every 3 weeks per three cycles; Treatment Arm 2: Patients with low levels of BRCA1 mRNA will receive Epirubicin and Cisplatin day 1 every 3 weeks and 5-Fluorouracil for three cycles; And patients with high levels of BRCA1 will receive docetaxel day 1 every three weeks per three cycles. Definitive surgery will be performed within 4 weeks after the last cycle.</detailed_description>
