	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore safety and efficacy of TMC207 administered as part of a multi-drug regimen for 24 to 48-week treatment in Japanese participants with pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of TMC207 and its primary metabolite M2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study of TMC207 in Japanese Participants With Pulmonary Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (everyone know the study intervention), single-arm, multicenter trial to explore safety, efficacy and PK of TMC207 in Japanese participants with pulmonary MDR-TB. The participants will receive TMC207 for 24 weeks in combination with individualized BR drugs selected by the Investigator on Day -1. Participants will primarily be assessed for sputum culture conversion at Week 24. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
