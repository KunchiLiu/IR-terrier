	<brief_summary>The control of perioperative pain is necessary to avoid worst surgical suites after shoulder arthroplasty. Interscalene block (ISB) with or without catheter is the gold standard in postoperative analgesia after shoulder prosthesis but neurological or respiratory adverse events can occured . The intra-articular local (IAL) anesthetic infiltration with catheter is a simple procedure. Its efficacy was proved in knee and hip arthroplasty but not in shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was the IAL is as effective as ISB in early postoperative analgesia after shoulder arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
