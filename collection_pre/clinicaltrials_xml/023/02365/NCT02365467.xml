	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Feasibility study is to characterize the safety of the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System, including an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the device acutely and at the 30 day visit in the identified subject population. This study will also evaluate the current instructions for use and may direct changes to the delivery and deployment steps. The purpose of the expansion to the Feasibility Study is to characterize the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and effectiveness of the device acutely and at the 30 day visit, in subjects enrolled with chronic, Type B dissections.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is at least 18 years of age. Subject understands and has signed an Informed Consent approved by the Sponsor and by the IRB for this study. Subject must be considered a candidate for revascularization of the LSA. Subject must be able to tolerate a surgical revascularization of the LSA. Subject has a DTA which will require coverage of the LSA and is: a fusiform aneurysm with diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm OR is &gt; 2 times the diameter of the nonaneurysmal thoracic aorta; AND/OR a saccular aneurysm or penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (ulcer defined as ≥ 10 mm in depth and 20 mm in diameter) OR a chronic type B dissection defined as &gt; 30 days from symptom onset and is complicated with an aortic diameter ≥ 5.5 cm or has progressive aortic enlargement (&gt; 5 mm/year). Subject has a healthy, nondiseased aortic proximal seal zone of at least 10 mm from the LCC to the LSA and at least 5 mm landing zone distal to the LSA and proximal to the start of the aneurysm/ulcer or 5 mm landing zone distal to the LSA to the proximal entry tear for dissection. Subject has a nondiseased aortic diameter between 25 mm and 42 mm (fusiform/saccular aneurysms or penetrating ulcers) or 28 mm to 44 mm (chronic type B dissections); Subject has a LSA with a diameter between 8 mm and 13 mm. Subject has sufficient landing zone within the LSA to accommodate the BSG without occlusion of any significant vessels Subject has patent brachial arteries, iliac or femoral arteries, or can tolerate a conduit that will allow endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with the delivery system of the appropriate sized device chosen for treatment. •Subject has a condition requiring prospective revascularization of the LSA, including: oDominant left vertebral artery requiring revascularization oPrior coronary artery bypass graft utilizing the left mammary artery requiring revascularization oIncomplete circle of Willis or other neurological vasculature requiring revascularization Subject has an aneurysmal, tortuous, or atherosclerotic LSA. Subject has an acute dissection of the descending thoracic aorta. Subject has an intramural hematoma of the descending thoracic aorta. Subject has an aortic atheroma classified as grade IV or grade V. Subject has prohibitive calcification, occlusive disease, or tortuosity of intended fixation sites. Subject has had previous endovascular repair of the ascending and/or descending thoracic aorta. Treatment with the Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft system would require intentional coverage of the left common carotid artery with the stent graft fabric. Subject has significant and/or circumferential aortic mural thrombus at either the proximal or distal attachment sites that would compromise fixation and seal of the device. Subject is a pregnant female. Subject has a known allergy or intolerance to the device components. Subject is in acute renal failure or has renal insufficiency with a serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL or is on dialysis. Subject has a body habitus which prevents adequate visualization of the aorta. Subject has coronary artery disease with unstable angina and has not received treatment. Subject has a connective tissue disease (e.g. Marfan's syndrome, medial degeneration). Subject has active systemic infection and/or a mycotic aneurysm. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device clinical trial that would interfere with the observations of this study. Subject has other medical, social, or psychological problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with treatment and followup procedures. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 1 year. Subject requires treatment of an infrarenal aneurysm at the time of the implantation. Subject has had previous surgical or endovascular treatment of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, or refuses blood transfusion. Subject has had a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) within the prior 3 months. Subject has had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the prior 3 months. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants or contrast media, which is not amenable to pretreatment.</criteria>
