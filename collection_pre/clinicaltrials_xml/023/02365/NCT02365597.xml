	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of JNJ-42756493 in Participants With Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label study (participants will know the identity of study drugs administered) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-42756493 in participants with urothelial cancer. The study comprises a 30-days Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase comprised of 28-day treatment cycles that will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, and a post-treatment Follow-up Phase that will extend from the End-of-Treatment Visit until the participant has died, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. The end of study is defined as approximately 12 months after last participant is enrolled. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Must have histologic demonstration of metastatic or surgically unresectable urothelial cancer. Minor components of variant histology such as glandular or squamous differentiation, or evolution to more aggressive phenotypes such as sarcomatoid or micropapillary change are acceptable Must have measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) at baseline Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0, 1, or 2 Must have adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as described in protocol Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [bhCG]) at Screening for women of child bearing potential who are sexually active Must have shown disease progression according to RECIST, version 1.1, following prior chemotherapy for metastatic or surgically unresectable urothelial cancer. Subjects who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and showed disease recurrence or progression according to RECIST, version 1.1, within 12 months of the last dose are considered to have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. These subjects will be referred to as chemorefractory subjects. (Subjects who have shown disease progression according to RECIST, version 1.1 following prior treatment with antiProgrammed deathligand 1 (anti PDL1/PD1) antibodies are also eligible) Received chemotherapy, targeted therapies, definitive radiotherapy, or treatment with an investigational anticancer agent within 2 weeks (in the case of nitrosoureas and mitomycin C, within 6 weeks; in the case of immunotherapy, within 4 weeks) before the first administration of study drug. Localized palliative radiation therapy (but should not include radiation to target lesions) and ongoing bisphosphonates and denosumab, are permitted Has persistent phosphate level greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) during screening (within 14 days of treatment and prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) and despite medical management Has a history of or current uncontrolled cardiovascular disease Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant within 3 months after the last dose of study drug and males who plan to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 5 months after the last dose of study drug Has not recovered from reversible toxicity of prior anticancer therapy (except toxicities which are not clinically significant such as alopecia, skin discoloration, or Grade 1 neuropathy)</criteria>
