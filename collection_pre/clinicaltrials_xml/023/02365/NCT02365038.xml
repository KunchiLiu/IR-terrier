	<brief_title>ART-2 Pilot - Driving Pressure Limited Ventilation for Patients With ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury. Driving pressure is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP. Evidence from observational studies suggests that elevated driving pressure is the main independent determinant of ventilator-induced lung injury, however clinical trials are needed to establish whether targeting low driving pressures can improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, ART2pilot is a multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of a driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy compared to the ARDS Clinical Network strategy (conventional strategy) in patients with ARDS. Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical ventilation with diagnosis of ARDS of less than 72 hours duration. We will exclude patients with less than 18 years old; contraindication to hypercapnia such as intracranial hypertension or recent acute coronary syndrome; patients in which a high probability of death within 24 hours is anticipated and patients under exclusive palliative care. Eligible patients will be randomized to the driving pressure limited ventilation strategy or ARDSNet strategy. The primary outcome is driving pressure between days 1 and 3.</detailed_description>
