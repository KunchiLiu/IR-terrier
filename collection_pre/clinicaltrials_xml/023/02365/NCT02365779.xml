	<brief_summary>High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most threatening type of gynaecological cancer with an important mortality due to late diagnosis. However the prognosis is excellent in the early stages of the disease. Recently it has been described a new serous carcinogenic sequence from the fallopian tube with tubal precancerous lesions. Therefore the identification of these early preinvasive lesions would be of great interest in the population with hereditary predisposition for ovarian cancer (concept of oncofertility) and in the general population (to determine whether bilateral salpingectomy has to be performed during a hysterectomy for benign disease). The optical biopsy has been developed and validated in the detection of early precancerous lesions (such as Barrett's oesophagus or in situ cancer of the bladder). The first objective of this study is to prospectively assess the efficacy of optical biopsy (Cellvizio®) in the study of fallopian tubes during laparoscopy with correlation between the histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis and the endomicroscopy image interpretation. The second objective is to describe the optical biopsy pictures in order to state a classification.</brief_summary>
