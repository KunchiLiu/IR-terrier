	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the blood supply at the base of the tongue and within the tonsil region. We hypothesize that high-resolution Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) will improve the diagnosis of oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC). The goal is to provide the better assessment of tumor and thus providing better preoperative expectations to patients with OPC or tumor extent prior to radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
