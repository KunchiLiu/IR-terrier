	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to image human prostate tissue using a new transrectal photoacoustic imaging probe and correlate this with ultrasound and MRI imaging performed once the specimen has been surgically removed. We hope to see what we can visualize with our device as this has never been done before. Eventually, we hope to use a similar device to image the prostate in men being seen by their doctor for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
