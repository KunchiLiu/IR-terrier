	<brief_summary>This is a pre-surgical study involving subjects with muscle invasive bladder cancer, or urothelial cancer, who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy. It is is a two-part trial with a one-arm phase Ib portion followed by a two-arm phase II portion. The study treatment is stratified into two cohorts based on cisplatin eligibility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in Combination With Gemcitabine Therapy in Cis-eligible/Ineligible UC Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Phase Ib Dose-Finding Cohort I Cisplatin-Eligible: Phase Ib is a 3+3 design for the cisplatin-eligible group only. Cisplatin-eligible subjects receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days repeated for 4 cycles; cisplatin 70mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles. (Subjects with Ccr of 50-59 mL/min must follow split dosing of cisplatin over two days). Pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks for 5 doses, with a starting dose of 200 mg. NOTE: the last dose of pembrolizumab falls on what would be D8 of a 5th 'chemo' cycle, however gemcitabine/cisplatin is NOT GIVEN. Phase II Arm A: Cohort I Cisplatin-Eligible: Cisplatin-eligible subjects receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days repeated for 4 cycles; cisplatin 70mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles. (Subjects with Ccr of 50-59 mL/min must follow split dosing of cisplatin over two days). Pembrolizumab at recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is given every 3 weeks for 5 doses starting with C1D8. NOTE: the last dose of pembrolizumab falls on what would be day 8 of a 5th 'chemo' cycle, however gemcitabine/cisplatin is NOT GIVEN. Cohort I treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin will continue for a maximum of 4 cycles (cycle = 21days). Phase II Arm B: Cohort II: Cisplatin-ineligible subjects receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1, D8 and D15 every 28 days, repeated for 3 cycles. Pembrolizumab at RP2D is given every 3 weeks for 5 doses starting with C1D8. NOTE: due to the timing of gemcitabine cycles every 4 weeks, and every three week dosing of pembrolizumab, there are two doses of pembrolizumab given during cycle 2: D1 and D22. Additionally, the last dose of pembrolizumab falls on what would be D8 of a 4th 'chemo' cycle; however gemcitabine is NOT GIVEN. Cohort II treatment with gemcitabine will continue for a maximum of 3 cycles (cycle = 28 days) Subjects will then have surgery to remove their primary tumor within 2-7 weeks after their last dose of neoadjuvant therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOC) performance status: 0-1 for cisplatin-eligible subjects; 0-2 for cisplatin-ineligible subjects. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined by the following laboratory values at study entry. All screening labs should be performed within 28 days of C1D1. Hematopoetic: - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL - Absolute lymphocyte count ≥350 mcL - Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL - Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L Renal: - Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min Hepatic: - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.25 X ULN OR ≤ 2.5 x ULN for subjects with Gilbert's disease - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 2 X ULN Coagulation: - International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy and as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial. Over 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. Have histologically confirmed muscle invasive disease of the urinary bladder, renal pelvis, or ureters. Histology must be urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) or urothelial carcinoma with mixed histology/features. Clinical stage cT24aN0M0. Please see exclusion criteria for acceptable N0 determination/lymph node size. Have a surgical evaluation that documents the plan for multimodality therapy with a consolidative radical cystectomy or nephroureterectomy. NOTE on surgical intent: Criteria for acceptable surgical risk are not defined and per treating urologist. Minimum guidance on surgical intent includes subjects who do not have significant cardiovascular disease such as NHYA class III or IV heart failure, unstable arrhythmias or angina, active CAD, and/or EF&lt;25%. Specific diagnostic testing to determine surgical intent is not required and per treating urologist or oncologist discretion. Have an archived tumor block available to submit unstained slides for PDL1 expression, basal and luminal subtype analysis; MANDATORY. If slides are not available, a biopsy is strongly encouraged to obtain tissue for submission Subjects on full dose anticoagulants must be on a stable regimen of warfarin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for at least two weeks. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to study registration. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test is required. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control, be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual intercourse for the course of the study and through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. NOTE: Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.
