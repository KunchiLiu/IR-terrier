	<brief_summary>This is a observation clinical trial. We are collecting the patients with glucocorticoid. They were divided into the experiment group (with femur head necrosis) and control group (without femur head necrosis).Then, we will analyse the patients' genome with genome-wide association study (GWAS). Our purpose is to find susceptibility loci for glucocorticoid-induced femur head necrosis in the Chinese population.</brief_summary>
