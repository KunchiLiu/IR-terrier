	<criteria>Patient has chronic Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN), defined as pain present for more than 6 months and less than 10 years after onset of herpes zoster skin rash affecting a single dermatome. Patients with more than 1 involved dermatome may also be included, provided the affected dermatomes are contiguous. Patient is â‰¥18 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 34 kg/m2, inclusive, at the screening visit.

Patient has PHN affecting the face (trigeminal nerve distribution). Patient has a history, in the judgment of the investigator, of inadequate response to more than 3 adequate courses of treatment with other medications used to treat neuropathic pain (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, topical lidocaine, and/or topical capsaicin). Patient is taking oral analgesics (either opioid or nonopioid) or is receiving topical therapy such as the 5% topical lidocaine patch for the treatment of pain and is unwilling or unable to complete a washout period during which the patient will discontinue analgesic therapy or topical pain therapy.
