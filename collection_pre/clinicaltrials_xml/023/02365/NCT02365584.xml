	<criteria>Subjects must demonstrate willingness to participate in the study and to be compliant with any protocol procedure. Provision of written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. Diagnosis of an inoperable malignant bowel obstruction, confirmed by appropriate imaging report. In case of peritoneal carcinomatosis, diagnostic confirmation by CT or MRI scan. Confirmed as inoperable after medical advice.

Has prior treatment with somatostatin or any analogue within the previous 60 days. Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or related compounds.
