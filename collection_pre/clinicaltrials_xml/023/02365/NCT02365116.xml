	<brief_summary>Every year in the United States about 1 million people make a suicide attempt and more than 38,000 die by suicide. The risk of suicide is highest among individuals with mental illness who have been hospitalized due to suicidal thoughts or behaviors, yet there are few interventions known to reduce suicide risk in this population. This study will develop and pilot test a peer mentorship intervention by which trained peer professionals will use their own personal experience with recovery from mental illness to instill hope and belongingness in high-risk patients and provide additional support to prevent future suicidal thoughts or behaviors. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) develop a peer mentorship intervention to reduce suicide risk among patients psychiatrically hospitalized with suicidal ideation or following a suicide attempt; (2) Conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of the peer mentorship intervention in preparation for a larger efficacy trial; and (3) an exploratory aim will be to measure potential mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness in terms of belongingness, burdensomeness, and hopelessness according to the interpersonal theory of suicide.</brief_summary>
