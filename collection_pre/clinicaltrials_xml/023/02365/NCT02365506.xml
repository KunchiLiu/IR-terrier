	<criteria>Individuals with an established diagnosis of LQT2 (by genotype testing) Mean (of triplicate) QTc interval ≥ 480 msec for at least four out of seven time points, determined by standard 12lead ECG, at screening Known mutations associated with LQT1 or LQT3 Known or suspected history of seizures or epilepsy History of heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV and/or known left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 45% Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 36 kg/m^2 at screening Severe renal impairment at screening (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m^2, using the 4 Variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation), as determined by the study center Abnormal liver function tests at screening, defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN An aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) implantation, syncopal episode, or appropriate ICD therapy within 3 months prior to screening Any other condition or circumstance that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude compliance with the study protocol</criteria>
