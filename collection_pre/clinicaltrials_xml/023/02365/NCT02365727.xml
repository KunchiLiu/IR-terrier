	<brief_summary>Patients will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to receive Exparel and a nerve block, standard of care for this procedure, or Exparel alone for pain management after surgery. They will also be asked to complete questionnaires before surgery, during their stay at the hospital after surgery, then at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery to assess pain and/or function levels, as well as the amount of pain medicine patients have used after surgery. Patients' leg strength will be measured immediately after surgery and again at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.</brief_summary>
