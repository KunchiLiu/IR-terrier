	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is observing the relation between serum Vitamin D levels and morphokinesis of time lapse monitored Day 5 embryo in between 18 and 38 years age women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) because of unexplained or tubal factor infertility. Individuals will be divided into 2 groups according to serum vitamin D levels as normal or low , and the influence of those levels in morphokinetic parameters of embryos will be identified.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to date there are few studies questioning the serum Vitamin D deficiency as a negative factor for pregnancy rates in women undergoing COH cycles and also are displaying different and inconclusive results. This dedicated negative affects may be mediated through endometrial and/or ovarial factors. In experimental animal models Vitamin D receptors have been found in endometrium and ovaries and deficient levels might have been a cause of impaired folliculogenesis. In one of human study Vitamin D has been suggested as a positive regulator of anti- Mullerian hormone (AMH) production. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the affects of Vitamin D on folliculogenesis, oogenesis and embryo quality in COH cycles by using time lapse monitoring.</detailed_description>
