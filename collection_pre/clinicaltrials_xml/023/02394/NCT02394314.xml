	<detailed_description>This is a first-time-in-humans (FTIH), randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of MEDI0382 administered as single-ascending SC doses to healthy subjects (age 18-45). Eight subjects per cohort will be enrolled in a total of 8 cohorts. The decision whether or not to dose escalate will be based upon data review by the Dose Escalation Committee (DEC). Within each cohort, the subjects will be randomized to MEDI0382 or placebo (3:1). Following screening, the study duration for each subject will be approximately 29 days, consisting of an inpatient evaluation period, and an outpatient follow-up period.</detailed_description>
