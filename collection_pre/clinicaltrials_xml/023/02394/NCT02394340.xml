	<criteria>Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis, as defined by a PGA score of 2 or 3 on both feet, AND moderate to severe tinea cruris, as defined by a PGA score of 2 or 3 Subjects with a mycological diagnosis of tinea pedis AND tinea cruris confirmed by the detection of fungal hyphae on a microscopic KOH wet mount Subjects must be in good general health and free of any disease that might interfere with study evaluations Subjects with the ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled visits and successfully complete the study Female subjects who are pregnant and/or nursing or planning a pregnancy during the course of the trial Subjects who are immunocompromised Subjects who have a recent history of or currently known drug or alcohol abuse Subjects with a history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to imidazole compounds, proton pump inhibitors or the inactive components of Luliconazole Cream 1% or omeprazole Subjects with a lifethreatening condition within the last 6 months Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Subjects who are unable to communicate or cooperate with the investigator Subjects using medications for treatment of tinea pedis and/or tinea cruris (see investigator for length of time prior to study start) Subjects receiving concomitant drugs that are known to inhibit and/or induce CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4; or that interact with omeprazole Because of the potential for drug interaction with luliconazole, administration with medications that are known to be substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 should be carefully monitored</criteria>
