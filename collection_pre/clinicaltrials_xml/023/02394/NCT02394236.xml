	<brief_summary>Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of continuos exercise training (CET) and interval exercise trainining (IET) on oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) in patients with coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise and Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope in Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) is a submaximal index that incorporates cardiovascular, peripheral and pulmonary factors that determine ventilatory response to exercise. There is scarce information about the effects of the mode and intensity of exercise training on OUES in patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
