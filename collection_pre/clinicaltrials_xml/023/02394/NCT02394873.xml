	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-DFU for the treatment of deep second-degree burn wound patients. ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells release growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in treating a burn.</brief_summary>
