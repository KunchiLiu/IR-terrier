	<brief_title>Post Approval Study to Evaluate the Trulign™ Toric Posterior Chamber IOL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this post approval safety study is to evaluate the incidence of IOL vaulting (ie, position change) of the Trulign™ Toric IOL following cataract surgery at up to three years post implantation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who are able and willing to comply with the followup schedule Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of agerelated cataract that is considered amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification/extracapsular cataract extraction Subjects must require a lens power from 4 to 33 D Subjects must have a Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) equal to or worse than 20/40, with or without a glare source Subjects with any anterior segment pathology in the study eye likely to increase the risk of complications from phacoemulsification cataract surgery Subjects with associated ocular conditions which could affect the stability of the IOL Subjects with clinically significant irregular corneal astigmatism in the study eye</criteria>
