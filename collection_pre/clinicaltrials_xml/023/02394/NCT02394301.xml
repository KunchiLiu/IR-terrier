	<detailed_description>In this prospective, observational study, change in psoriasis plaque appearance, per the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) tool, will be evaluated after using a topical psoriasis cream containing at least 3 of the following: corticosteroid, methotrexate, vitamin D3 or synthetic analog, retinoid acid, or urea, or a topical shampoo or spray containing a corticosteroid and vitamin D3 or synthetic analog. The change in quality of life will be assessed during all visits using the Skindex-16 assessment tool. In patients receiving a methotrexate-containing formulation, a sub-study will be available as an option, where laboratory values (methotrexate levels, complete blood count, liver function tests, etc.) will be obtained to confirm that methotrexate absorption is negligible.</detailed_description>
