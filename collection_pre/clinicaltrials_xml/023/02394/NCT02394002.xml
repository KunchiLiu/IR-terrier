	<brief_summary>The relation between burst and suppression periods in transcranial and direct cortical recorded EEG with cortical amplitudes median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials is studied. 60 patients are included in this study: 15 patients undergoing brain tumor surgery, 15 spine surgery (University Hospital Düsseldorf) and 30 patients during general surgical procedures (Helios Klinikum Wuppertal).</brief_summary>
