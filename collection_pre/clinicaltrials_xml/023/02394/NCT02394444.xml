	<brief_title>Impact of an Intervention Program on Parenting Stress After Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to prematurity induced infant-mother separation at birth, sometimes for several weeks, and owing to the concerns it generates, preterm birth exposes the parent-child attachment link to disturbances, especially the mother-child attachment after discharge. Several psychological factors affect infant (distress, dysmaturity ) and parents (psychological pain). These can cause lasting parent-child interactions disruption and jeopardize the attachment process. These early link distortions may hinder the infant's behavioral-emotional and cognitive development. Prematurity psychological consequences may negatively influence biomedical risks. Understanding these premature infants' future development modalities and support involves taking into account intricate organic and psychological factors - which may be combined as well. Post-hospital psychological intervention with the family, focusing on parental mental health and triadic parent-infant relationship, proves an essential element in these children care, whose birth conditions were painful.</detailed_description>
