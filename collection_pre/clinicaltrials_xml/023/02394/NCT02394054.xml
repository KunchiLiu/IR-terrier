	<brief_summary>It has long been established that interpersonal relationships can have a profound impact on health and well-being. Yet, the investigators are still learning about the complex biological processes that contribute to positive social interactions and the ability to develop and maintain social relationships. Recent research has begun to focus on vasopressin, a neuropeptide that is naturally produced in the hypothalamus, because administration of this neuropeptide has been associated with empathy, cooperation, memory of social stimuli (e.g., faces), and brain activity in neural regions associated with social and emotional processes. To date, several aspects of vasopressin's effects on social behavior have been unexplored. As such, the overarching goal of this project is to examine the effects of intranasal vasopressin on several tasks involving learning and social processes. In addition, the investigators will explore associated neural activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results from the study will inform our understanding of the neurobiology of socioemotional processes. The investigators hypothesize that compared to placebo, vasopressin will improve deception detection, increase empathy and altruism, enhance responses to photo stimuli of primary caregivers, and improve learning when the subject has a prosocial goal of teaching another person. These effects will manifest in behavioral and neural activity. It is also hypothesized that main effects will not be found for vasopressin, but rather, analyses of relevant moderators will elucidate these findings.</brief_summary>
