	<brief_summary>Vascular inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of atherosclerosis. Renal insufficiency is close correlation with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising tool for identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to demonstrate the correlation between eGFR and vascular inflammation detected by 18F FDG-PET.</brief_summary>
