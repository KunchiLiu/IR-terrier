	<brief_summary>The immune system is influenced by the commensal microbes that live in the gut and on the skin. This study aims to characterize the microbiota of subjects with autoimmune disease in order to determine whether certain microbial species may cause or worsen immune-mediated diseases</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Human Microbiome in Immune-Mediated Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a combination of a defined pilot microbiome study as well as exploratory mechanistic research with candidate commensals identified based on known structures accessible in public databases. In the observational prospective two-center study, subjects will be followed for 8 weeks. The study will consist of a total of 3 study visits (0, 4 and 8 weeks). Screening and baseline visits (week 0) will take place at the same time. A study window period of +/- 7 days will be allowed for follow-up study visits. The mechanistic in vitro research with subjects' blood cells and candidate commensals will typically require between 2-4 visits for sampling, but will not be limited by the frequency of visits.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>18 years of age and older Diagnosis of an immunemediated disease by a healthcare provider, including but not limited to: systemic lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus Exclusion criteria for pilot study (subjects enrolled in the exploratory mechanistic study arm will not be required to meet exclusion criteria and may be enrolled if the investigators believe that the subject can help address the scientific aim)..

No use of topical antimicrobial products (as outlined in appendix F) within 48 hours prior to collection of swab Subject must not have bathed within 8hours of swab collection. For oral swab collection (see also appendix D): No use of antiseptic mouth washes (as outlined in appendix F) within 48 hours of swab collection Subjects must not have brushed teeth or flossed within 8hours of swab collection Major gastrointestinal surgery less than 5 years prior to enrollment (with the exception of appendectomy) Any Gastrointestinal bleeding history Inflammatory Bowel Disease diagnosed by biopsy Bulimia or anorexia nervosa Probiotics (greater than estimated 109 cfu or organisms per day) within 90 days prior to enrollment (with the exception of fermented beverages, milks or yogurts).
