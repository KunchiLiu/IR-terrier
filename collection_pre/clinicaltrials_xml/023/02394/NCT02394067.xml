	<brief_summary>This prospective study will use magnetic resonance imaging of patients with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), to determine if the common radiological finding of transverse venous sinus stenosis can be reversed with standard of care medical treatment of IIH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Venography Pre- and Post-Treatment in Patients With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with suspected Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) will be recruited and undergo an ophthalmologic investigation, and a lumbar puncture, both of which are necessary for diagnosis of IIH. MRI is done as a standard of care to rule out other etiologies of raised intracranial pressure. Our patients will require four MRI/MRVs. The first MRI/MRV is standard of care scan. The second MRI/MRV will be on the day of the lumber puncture, immediately following the procedure. The third MRI/MRV will take place when significant reduction of clinical papilledema has taken place (about 3-6 months), and a forth MRI will take place one year after the initial presentation or with symptom resolution, whichever comes first. Radiological findings will be compared at all stages to determine if transverse venous sinus stenosis can be reversed with standard of care medical treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients with a diagnosis of IIH, where other intracranial pathology has been ruled out, can participate. (1)Patients who have a contraindication or are unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging. (2)Patients who are found to have intracranial pathology to explain elevated intracranial pressure. (3)Patients with allergies to gadoliniumcontaining agents.(4)Patients with elevated creatinine above normal laboratory values.</criteria>
