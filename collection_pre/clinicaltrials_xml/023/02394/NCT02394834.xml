	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study of Treatment Sensitivity and Prognostic Factors in a Efficacy and Safety Study of mFOLFOX6 + Bevacizumab Versus. mFOLFOX6 + Panitumumab Therapy in Patients With Chemotherapy-naïve Unresectable Advanced or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Panitumumab. This exploratory study will investigate biomarkers which may be predictors of efficacy and safety of treatment with mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab versus. mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab therapy in patients with chemotherapy-naïve unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.. Tumor tissue samples obtained from the participants who enrolled in the safety/efficacy study of Panitumumab + mFOLFOX versus bevacizumab + + mFOLFOX (PARADIGM Study) and provided consent for this additional study will be used. Mutations, amplification and rearrangement of predefined tumor-associated genes will be investigated using DNA collected from tumor samples used for assessing RAS mutations and plasma free DNA collected before administration of cycle 1 and at the discontinuation of the protocol treatment in the main study.</detailed_description>
