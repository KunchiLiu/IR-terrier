	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is the development of an EEG-cap (min. 21 electrodes) with user-friendly active dry electrodes that meets the expectations of the users regarding comfort and esthetics, without losing sight of the functional and technical demands for recording high quality EEG signals. The purpose is to use the EEG-cap to investigate clinical neurological disorders (e.g. epilepsy). The EEG-cap could also be used at home so that hospital admission in the EMU can be avoided for some patients and an increasing number of patients can be examined. In this stage of the project video-EEG recording with the prototype will be compared to the conventional way (cup-electrodes and collodion) of recording in the EMU. Minimum 1 - maximum 10 patients with prominent IEDs will be included. After the conventional recording is completed, the patient will undergo a recording of maximum 5 hours with the prototype. There will be an visual and clinical evaluation of the EEG-signals (blinded) and a technical evaluation of the EEG-signals. User experience and experience of the EEG-technologists will also be collected.</brief_summary>
