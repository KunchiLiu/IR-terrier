	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies if kilo-voltage cone beam computed tomography (KV-CBCT) and ultrasound imaging works in guiding radiation therapy in patients with prostate, liver, or pancreatic cancer. Computer systems, such as KV-CBCT and ultrasound imaging, allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor may help in planning radiation therapy and may result in more tumor cells being killed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KV-CBCT and Ultrasound Imaging in Guiding Radiation Therapy in Patients With Prostate, Liver, or Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the feasibility of combining on-board cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with ultrasound imaging to overcome the shortcomings of CBCT or ultrasound imaging alone for imaging guided radiotherapy delivery. OUTLINE: Patients undergo ultrasound imaging prior to and during radiation therapy. Patients also undergo kilo-voltage cone beam computed tomography prior to radiation therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have either 1) an established diagnosis of pancreatic cancer by biopsy or 2) cancer involving the liver by biopsy or radiographic criteria, or 3) prostate cancer by biopsy, with the intent of undergoing definitive dose radiation therapy to targets within the pancreas, liver, or prostate. Patients with prostatectomy receiving postoperative radiotherapy are also eligible. Karnofsky performance status (PS) â‰¥ 70 Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informational form Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements</criteria>
