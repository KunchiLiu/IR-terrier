	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of overweight/obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and an inflammatory state, which together increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). It is also characterized by a decreased insulin sensitivity, namely, lower ability of insulin to metabolize glucose, key in the physiopathogeny of disease process. In the search for a pharmacological agent that can attend more components of the metabolic syndrome and above all improve insulin sensitivity to effectively prevent the development of CVD and DM2, ursolic acid is a promising compound. Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic carboxylic acid present in medicinal herbs, parts of some fruits like apple peel, and plants such as rosemary. There is scientific evidence of important benefits of ursolic acid level in vitro and in vivo on insulin, metabolism of lipids and glucose, as well as on the body weight and metabolic parameters. However, the results are not clear and the mechanisms are not fully elucidados. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ursolic acid on the insulin sensitivity and metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ursolic Acid Administration on Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 24 patients of both sexes aged between 30 and 60 years, with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome according to the modified IDF criteria, without treatment. They will be assigned randomly two groups of 12 patients, each to receive 150 mg of ursolic acid or placebo before breakfast for 12 weeks. Insulin sensitivity will be calculated by Matsuda Index with dates from glucose and insulin levels from Oral Glucose Tolerance Test; Waist circumference will be measured; tryglicerides and High density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and blood pressure will be evaluated before and after intervention in both groups. Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion, average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2, will be used for differences inter-group Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Test for the within-groups differences. Will be considered statistical significance p ≤0.05. This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee (CEI/075/2014) and written informed consent will be obtained from all volunteers.</detailed_description>
