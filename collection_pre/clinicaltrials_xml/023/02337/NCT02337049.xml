	<brief_summary>In order to assess surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in subtypes of preeclampsia, we will conduct a 10-year follow-up study comparing 40 women with a history of early onset preeclampsia; 40 women with a history of late onset preeclampsia and 40 women with a history of normotensive pregnancies. Eligible participants delivered at the Department of Obstetrics at Randers Regional Hospital 1998-2008. Early-onset preeclampsia is defined as preeclampsia that develops before 34 weeks of gestation, whereas late-onset preeclampsia develops at or after 34 weeks of gestation.</brief_summary>
