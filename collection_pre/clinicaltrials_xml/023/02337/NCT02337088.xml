	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in neonatal outcomes with delayed umbilical cord clamping at 30 versus 60 seconds. Our primary outcome will be intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (bleeding in the brain) in these infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delayed Cord Clamping in Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immediately following delivery, up to 40% of the total blood volume available to the infant is in the placenta. Over a period of 30 seconds to 3 minutes, a significant portion of this blood is transferred to the infant through the umbilical cord. Delayed cord clamping following delivery facilitates this transfer of blood. Preterm infants are very susceptible to the effects of anemia and hypovolemia. A recent meta-analysis showed that a brief delay in umbilical cord clamping (30-60 seconds) decreases the risk of anemia, blood transfusion, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the need for blood pressure support after delivery. The same meta-analysis showed no impact on Apgar scores or hypothermia due to a brief delay in resuscitation efforts to allow delayed cord clamping. Preterm infants are at significant risk for IVH and as high as 20% of very low birth weight infants will have it. IVH is an important cause of brain injury in these infants. In our study, we would like to determine the optimal timing of delayed cord clamping in order to prevent IVH in these infants.</detailed_description>
