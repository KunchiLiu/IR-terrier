	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to exploratorily examine efficacy and safety in the patients with chemotherapy-naïve unresectable, advanced/recurrent colorectal carcinoma of KRAS wild-type who have been treated with 6 cycles (2 weeks/cycle) of first-line mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy and then assigned to two groups i.e., a group receiving 5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy and a group receiving mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of mFOLFOX6 + Panitumumab Combination Therapy and 5-FU/LV + Panitumumab Combination Therapy in Patients With Chemotherapy-naïve Unresectable Advanced Recurrent Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label study will exploratorily examine efficacy and safety of 5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy or mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy in the patients with chemotherapy-naïve unresectable, advanced/recurrent colorectal carcinoma of KRAS wild-type who have been treated with 6 cycles [2 weeks/cycle (site visit)] of first-line mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy The study will enroll approximately 100 patients. All patients will receive 6 cycles of Protocol Treatment [1]: mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy [oxaliplatin (OXA): 85 mg/m2/day 1; levofolinate calcium (l-LV): 200 mg/m2/day 1; bolus 5-FU: 400 mg/m2/day 1; infusional 5-FU: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3; panitumumab: 6 mg/kg] once every two weeks. Then they will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the treatment groups. - Group A (50 Patients): mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy, once every two weeks [oxaliplatin (OXA): 85 mg/m2/day 1; levofolinate calcium (l-LV): 200 mg/m2/day 1; bolus 5-FU: 400 mg/m2/day 1; infusional 5-FU: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3; panitumumab: 6 mg/kg] - Group B (50 patients): 5-FU/LV + panitumumab combination therapy, once every two weeks [levofolinate calcium (l-LV): 200 mg/m2/day 1; bolus 5-FU: 400 mg/m2/day 1; infusional 5-FU: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3; panitumumab: 6 mg/kg] This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 12 months.</detailed_description>
