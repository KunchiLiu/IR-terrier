	<brief_title>Once-daily Simultaneous Modulated Accelerated Thoracic Radiotherapy in Limited Small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II randomized study is to determine whether once-daily (qd)simultaneous modulated accelerated thoracic radiotherapy resulted in better survival than twice-daily(bid) RT for patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). All patients received four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP), each of 3 days' duration and separated by 21 days. Thoracic RT was initiated at the first or second chemotherapy. Qd RT includes the delivery of 65 Gy in 26 fractions delivered on weekdays for a total of 33 days. Bid RT includes the delivery of 45 Gy in 30 fractions delivered on weekdays for a total of 19 days. After the chest RT and the fourth cycle of EP, prophylactic cranial irradiation is administered to all patients with a complete remission. 204 patients are needed to be enrolled for an 80% power to detect an improvement in 3-year progression-free survival rate from the expected 25% to 40%.</detailed_description>
