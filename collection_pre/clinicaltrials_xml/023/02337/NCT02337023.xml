	<brief_summary>The investigators perform neuropsychological tests and brain scintigraphy in 30 healthy subjects. These results will be compared with data obtained out of episode in patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS). The investigators want to determine if brain functional imaging and cognitive abnormalities persist during asymptomatic period in a large series of patients with KLS, and to find predictors of these abnormalities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Scintigraphy in Normal Versus Kleine-Levin Syndrome Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3 steps in the protocol : - Brain ECD-SPECT (marking brain perfusion in relation to brain active/hypoactive area) superimposed on a template T1-weighted brain MRI. - Extensive cognitive tests of executive functions, verbal memory and fluency , visuospatial ability and memory, reasoning abilities: spontaneous memory complaint, Stroop Color Word Test, Trail Making Test A and B, Direct and Reverse Digit Span Test, Letter and Semantic Fluency Test, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Mini-Mental test, Progressive matrice of Raven (PM-38) - KLS-inventory and face to face interview of patients and parents by neurologist for patients. Modified KLS-inventory for healthy subjects. Main outcome : Number of patients with persisting hypoperfused brain area (compared to controls), location of these area, number of patients with at least -1SD in one cognitive domain Correlation between KLS severity (disease course, number of episode, mean duration of episodes, time incapacitated, number of symptoms) and brain perfusion and cognitive abnormalities</detailed_description>
