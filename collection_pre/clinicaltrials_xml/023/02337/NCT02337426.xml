	<brief_summary>This phase 1 trial studies the side effects and best dose of dimethyl fumarate when given together with temozolomide and radiation therapy(RT) in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Dimethyl fumarate may help radiation therapy work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving dimethyl fumarate with temozolomide and radiation therapy may work better in treating glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) when combined with standard concurrent temozolomide and RT in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of DMF when combined with standard concurrent temozolomide and RT in subjects with newly diagnosed GBM. II. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the efficacy of DMF when combined with standard concurrent temozolomide and RT in subjects with newly diagnosed GBM. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dimethyl fumarate. CONCOMITANT THERAPY: Between 21 days (3 weeks) and 42 days (6 weeks) following the last surgical procedure, patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 42-49 days and dimethyl fumarate PO twice daily (BID) or thrice daily (TID) continuously. Patients also undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week over 6 weeks for a total of 30 fractions. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients continue to receive dimethyl fumarate PO BID or TID continuously. Four weeks after completing concomitant temozolomide and radiation therapy, patients also receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
