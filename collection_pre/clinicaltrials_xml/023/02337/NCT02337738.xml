	<brief_title>A Phase 2/3 Study of TVP-1012 at 0.5 mg or 1 mg in Levodopa Treated Parkinson's Disease Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVP-1012 as an add-on to levodopa in Japanese participants with Parkinson's disease with wearing-off phenomenon. The study period will consist of a 28-week trial period. The participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria and do not meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled, and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 0.5 mg of TVP-1012, the 1 mg of TVP-1012, or the placebo group.
