	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well vismodegib works in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to previous steroid treatment. Chronic graft-versus-host disease can cause a build-up of scar tissue under the skin and lead to symptoms such as sclerodermatous skin changes, dry mouth, dry eye, narrowing of the esophagus, or vaginal graft-versus-host disease. Vismodegib may work against the build-up of scar tissue and be a better treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vismodegib in Treating Patients With Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the clinical effects of GDC-0449 (vismodegib), in steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety of GDC-0449 in patients with steroid-refractory GVHD. II. To determine the change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria (CC) global score of chronic GVHD at 6 and 12 months from baseline. III. To determine one-year non relapse mortality (NRM) and one-year relapse rate. IV. To determine one-year failure free survival (FFS) and one-year overall survival (OS). V. To determine baseline clinical characteristics that may be associated with decreased FFS. OUTLINE: Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) daily for 6-12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.</detailed_description>

should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 7 days prior to the first dose of GDC0449 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the 24hour period prior to the administration of GDC0449; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing GDC0449, the investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of GDC0449 cause serious or lifethreatening birth defects; patients must continue highly effective contraception during therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of GDC0449 Women of childbearing potential are defined as follows: Patients with regular menses Patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding Women who have had a tubal ligation Women are considered not to be of childbearing potential for the following reasons: The patient has undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy The patient is postmenopausal defined by amenorrhea for at least 12 months in a woman &gt; 45 years old Male patients should use condoms with spermicide, even after a vasectomy, during sexual intercourse with female partners while being treated with GDC0449 and for 3 months after the last dose to avoid exposing an embryo or fetus to GDC0449 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible provided that they meet the following criteria in addition to the other protocol criteria: Cancer as the only acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)defining condition Cluster of differentiation (CD)4 cell count &gt;= 250 Treatment sensitive HIV and prospects for long term survival on the basis of HIV disease alone Willing to take antiHIV therapy that will have minimal potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with GDC0449 Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to GDC0449 Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)/5, cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9), CYP2C8, or CYP2C19 are ineligible; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new overthecounter medicine or herbal product Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow capsules Patients with clinically important history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant women are excluded from this study;
