	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with hepatic glucagon resistance and hyperglucagonemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Involvement of Steatosis-induced Glucagon Resistance in Hyperglucagonaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperglucagonemia is a common condition in obesity, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. It increases the hepatic glucose production, thus contributing to type 2-diabetic hyperglycemia. In the current study we wish to examine whether non-alcoholic fatty disease (NAFLD) results in hepatic glucagon resistance. This could result in hyperglucagonemia through a feedback mechanism acting on the level of pancreatic alpha cells. Cirrhosis and type 1 diabetes, respectively, has previously been shown to be associated with hepatic glucagon resistance but it has not been examined in relation to NAFLD in humans so far.</detailed_description>
