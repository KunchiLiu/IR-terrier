	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial of Inactivated West Nile Virus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will be a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind (within dosing group), dose escalation phase 1 trial, evaluating dosages of 1 mcg and 4 mcg of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine given intramuscularly on Day 1 and Day 29 in up to 50 healthy adults &gt; /=18 and &lt; 50 years of age at a single site. The study will consist of two dosing groups of HydroVax-001 vaccine to be enrolled sequentially. Each dose group will consist of 20 individuals who receive HydroVax-001 and 5 who receive placebo. Controls will receive sterile 0.9 percent NaCl placebo intramuscularly at days 1 and 29. The study duration is approximately 25 months (12 month enrollment, 13 month follow up) and subject participation duration of approximately 14 months. The primary objective is to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of the HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine administered intramuscularly in a two-dose series on Days 1 and 29 at a dose of 1 mcg or a dose of 4 mcg. The secondary objective is to assess WNV-specific plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) responses after a first dose and after a second dose of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine given at doses of 1 mcg and 4 mcg. This study aims to recruit up to 50 men and women between the ages of 18 and 50. The study duration is approximately 25 months at a single site and subject participation duration is approximately 14 months.</detailed_description>

Women of childbearing potential must have used an acceptable method of contraception* in the 30 days prior to enrollment and must agree to continue such use until day 30 after the last vaccination. *Includes, but is not limited to, abstinence from sex with men,barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing®, successful Essure® placement (permanent, nonsurgical, nonhormonal sterilization) with documented confirmation test at least 3 months after the procedure, and licensed hormonal methods such as implants, injectables, or oral contraceptives 1. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition* or need for chronic medications** that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with immunity or affect safety *Includes, but is not limited to, disorders of the liver, kidney, lung, heart, or nervous system, or other metabolic or autoimmune/inflammatory conditions ** Receipt of systemic, prescription medications for the treatment of chronic medical conditions or variations of normal physiologic functions are permissible if, in the opinion of the investigator, they are used for conditions that are not clinically significant and would not impact the safety of the subject or the safety and immunogenicity outcomes of the protocol. Use of systemic, overthecounter medications and PRN systemic, prescription medication are allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of immunogenicity/reactogenicity. Topical (except corticosteroid) medications, nasal (including corticosteroid) medications, vitamins, and supplements are permissible 2.
