	<brief_summary>Despite effective femoral artery endarteriectomy, patients with occlusive arteritis may need complementary stenting of revascularization procedures within the 2 years after the primary surgery because of a poor blood supply in their lower limb extremity. The Near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) is a non-invasive monitoring of the brain or tissue oxygenation and provide information on the quality of the local oxygen supply. The aim of our observational study is to correlate the intraoperative NIRS variations at the calf and the soles and the one-year evolution of the arteritis.</brief_summary>
