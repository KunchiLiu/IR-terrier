	<brief_summary>One of the main symptoms of endometriosis is pain, but his pathogenesis is not fully understood. The detection of mast cells in the endometriosis lesions supports the hypothesis that mast cell degranulation may contribute to development of pain and hyperalgesia. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a class of endogenous compounds that regulate inflammation and pain, controlling mast-cell activation. The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of palmitoylethanolamide-polydatin combination on pain relief in symptomatic patients with endometriosis.</brief_summary>
