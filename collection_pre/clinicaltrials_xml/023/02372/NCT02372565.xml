	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a social media and text-message-delivered, Social Cognitive Theory-based, culturally relevant intervention designed to promote physical activity among African American women. An 8-week, 2-arm randomized trial will be implemented. Arm 1 will receive a culturally-relevant, technology-based physical activity intervention delivered via Facebook and text messages. Arm 2 (Comparison Group) will receive a standard print-based physical activity promotion materials consisting of high quality physical activity promotion brochures produced by the American Heart Association.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to apply and investigate the feasibility of a social media and text-message-delivered, Social Cognitive Theory-based, culturally relevant intervention designed to promote physical activity among African American women. In an 8-week, 2-arm randomized trial, 30 African American women will be assigned to receive either: a) culturally-relevant, technology-based physical activity intervention delivered via Facebook and text messages, or b) a standard print-based physical activity promotion intervention consisting of high quality physical activity promotion brochures produced by the American Heart Association delivered via USPS mail. Aim 1: Test the feasibility of a culturally relevant, social media and text-message delivered physical promotion pilot intervention among adult African American women. The investigators hypothesize that the culturally relevant Facebook and text message delivered intervention will be feasible as measured by the acceptability, implementation, and practicality of the intervention program. Aim 2: Examine the impact of the culturally-relevant, Facebook and text message delivered intervention to increase physical activity and enhance associated Social Cognitive Theory constructs explicitly targeted by the intervention activities. Physical activity will be objectively measured by accelerometers and Social Cognitive Theory constructs of self-efficacy, social support, self-regulation, and outcome expectations will be assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. The investigators hypothesize that participants receiving the culturally-adapted, Social Cognitive Theory-based Facebook and text-message intervention will demonstrate higher physical activity levels and greater enhancements in Social Cognitive Theory constructs when compared to the standard print-based intervention group at the post-intervention assessment. Aim 3: Examine the preliminary effect of a culturally relevant, social media-delivered physical activity promotion intervention on anthropometric, blood pressure, and blood lipid outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that increased physical activity at the post-intervention follow-up will be associated with improvements in these variables.</detailed_description>
