	<brief_title>7% Lidocaine/7% Tetracaine Cream Versus 2,5% Lidocaine / 2,5% Prilocaine Cream</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we will compare the efficacy of 7% lidocaine / 7% tetracaine cream and 2,5% lidocaine / 2,5% prilocaine cream in reducing self-reported pain during a single laser procedure in the treatment of acne keloidalis nuchae and tattoo removal. Patients will be asked to fill in questionnaires to: - assess the severity of pain experienced (VAS score) during laser treatment, - evaluate whether the pain relief is adequate and, - evaluate the amount of money patients would be willing to pay for the cream that provided the 'best' pain relief. One week after the visit the patient will have a telephone consultation. The patients will be asked if they experienced any symptoms, which will be recorded as adverse events.</detailed_description>
