	<brief_title>Evaluation of the AMICUS RBCx System in Sickle Cell Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of Red Blood Cell Exchange is to remove a patient's red blood cells (RBCs) and replace the blood volume removed with either healthy donor RBCs and/or colloid/crystalloid solutions. Depending on the RF used, the procedure can be considered an RBC Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange procedure. The RBC Depletion/Exchange procedure is a modification of the RBC Exchange procedure. The AMICUS RBCx protocol provides the ability to use various RFs including healthy donor RBCs or a combination of fluids, such as saline followed by RBCs. In RBC Exchange and the exchange portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures, RBC units are used as the RF, while colloid and/or crystalloid solutions are used as the RF in the depletion portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures. A new operating protocol on the AMICUS Separator that enables the device to perform Red Blood Cell Exchange (RBCx) procedures in accordance with the replacement fluid(s) (RF) prescribed by a physician for patients with sickle cell disease</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects â‰¥18 years old. Subjects with documented diagnosis of a type of sickle cell disorder who require RBC Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange treatment. Medically stable subjects who have been previously treated for sickle cell disease with RBC Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange. Subjects, or subject's legal representative, who have provided signed informed consent, and assent when applicable, prior to participation. Adequate availability of sickle trait negative, leukoreduced, Blood type (ABO) blood group, Rhesus factor D (Rh (D)) compatible, unexpired replacement RBC products. Subjects with sufficient vascular access to accommodate the RBCx procedure as determined by the medical staff responsible for obtaining intravenous access. Subjects who are able and agree to report adverse events (AEs) during the required reporting period. Procedures that occur during acute hospitalization. Procedures prescribed within one week of discharge of a hospitalization. Subjects with altered mental status that would prohibit the giving and understanding of informed consent, and assent when applicable, who do not have a legally authorized representative. Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, or other factors that in the opinion of the investigator could affect the ability of the subject to comply with the requirements of the protocol. Subjects who have experienced a serious adverse event associated with an RBCx procedure in the past. In the opinion of the investigator, subjects who have a life expectancy fewer than 30 days. Subjects who refuse blood products. Subjects who are pregnant. Subjects who fail to comply with site requirements for cessation of medication that interfere or increase procedure risk.</criteria>
