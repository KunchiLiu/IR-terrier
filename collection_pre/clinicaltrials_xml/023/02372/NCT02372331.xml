	<brief_summary>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is not the program that aim to reduce postoperative hospital stay, but the multimodal strategies that aim to attenuate the loss of, and improve the restoration of,functional capacity after surgery on evidence-based medicine. The benefits of ERAS is proved in many surgical procedures, such as upper gastrointestinal surgery and colorectal surgery. However, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD, Whipple's operation) is still one of most complex abdominal surgery, and there is no evidence that ERAS is beneficial on PD. This study investigate the clinical effectiveness of ERAS on PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of ERAS on Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct totally 276 patients who underwent PD with borderline or malignant periampullary tumor. The patients divided into two groups. One group take conventional, experienced-based perioperative management, the other group take perioperative management based on ERAS protocol. Applied ERAS protocol is based on "Guidelines for Perioperative Care for Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Ehanced Recovery After Surgery Society Recommendations. The outcomes are analyzed for short-term surgical outcomes including operative factors, nutritional status, morbidity, mortality, length of stay, readmission, etc.</detailed_description>
