	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Bilirubinometry in Neonates With Bilicare System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia or newborn jaundice impacts over 85% of all newborns [1]. Regardless of the mechanism, excessive hyperbilirubinemia has been traditionally treated with phototherapy to minimize any probable risk of developing bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. However, earlier and more recent data suggest that pre-discharge bilirubin screening for risk of significant hyperbilirubinemia, whether due to a rapid bilirubin production or an earlier age of onset, has impacted the guidelines for clinical use of phototherapy [1, 2]. In this study, we plan to test the performance of a novel transcutaneous device (BiliCareTM) first for screening for bilirubin levels at postnatal age of 6 to 48 hrs; and possibly also, to substitute the use of this measurement for total plasma/serum bilirubin (TB). This device applies a novel light transmission technology that has the potential to measure bilirubin as a point-of-care test in the subcutaneous tissue, and then uses an internal algorithm to calculate bilirubin levels in the skin. In this proposalstudy, we will to assess the clinical performance of the BiliCare by correlating measurements made by this device to near-concurrent measure of total plasma/serum bilirubin at normative ranges (mean, median, range and inter-quartile ranges ) for all term and late-preterm newborns (including those who are at-risk for jaundice and / or being administered with phototherapy) born to families of diverse race and ethnic backgrounds.</detailed_description>
