	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Effect of Food on Pharmacokinetics of Total EPA and Total DHA of AZD0585 in Healthy Male Japanese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, randomized, cross-over design with three single-dose treatment periods and a washout of at least 10 days in between each treatment visit. The study period consists of 5 visits to the study centre: Visit 1 (enrolment), Visit 2 (first single-dose treatment), Visit 3 (second single-dose treatment), Visit 4 (third single-dose treatment) and Visit 5 (follow-up). Target subject population is healthy male Japanese subjects aged 20-45 years. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 4 g AZD0585 will be administered on 3 separate occasions (fasting, before meal, and after meal) in a randomized crossover fashion with different food restrictions.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy Japanese male, 20 to 45 years of age (inclusive). Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 25 (kg/m2). Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory profiles, medical histories, ECGs, physical findings). Hemoglobin level must be ≥ the lower limit of study centre reference range. 12Lead ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) should be &gt; 340 msec and &lt; 450 msec. No habitual use of drug(s) and tobacco/nicotinecontaining products for a minimum of 3 months prior to first dosing. Subjects must be willing and able to give written informed consent by signing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved Informed Consent Form prior to admission to this study and follow the restrictions and procedures outlined for the study. Past history of psychological or physical disorder which may affect the objectives of this study, in the opinion of the PI. An individual who has abnormal laboratory values (ie, suggesting hepatic, renal, cardiovascular or endocrine disorders or diabetes mellitus), or an inappropriate current or past medical history for participation based on the decision of the PI. A history or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, haematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic or psychiatric disease. Had used fish oil, other EPA and/or DHAcontaining supplements within 2 months prior to first admission day. Have serum (or plasma) EPA and/or DHA concentrations exceeding the upper limit of reference range for the "fatty acids profile, fourfraction" test, determined at Visit 1.</criteria>
