	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effectiveness of candidate dengue vaccine formulations, it is prudent to develop an appropriate challenge model. To this end, this first-in-human study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the Dengue 1 Live Virus Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) product and assess the ability of this virus strain to elicit an uncomplicated dengue-like illness.</brief_summary>

Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) 8.

These potential subjects may be eligible for enrollment a minimum of 4 weeks later 15. Any laboratory abnormalities in the tests specified in Table 19 and Table 20 of the protocol.
