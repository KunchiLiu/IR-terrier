	<brief_title>"It is a Real" The First Baby Of Autologous Stem Cell Therapy in Premature Ovarian Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stem cells (sc) are the foundation cells for every organ, tissue and cell in the body. They are self sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the remarkable potential to develop in many different cell types in the body. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility, and elevated serum gonadotropins. This work aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous Mesenchymal sc (MSC) transplantation in women suffering from POF. Out of 112 high risk patients for POF, 10 cases were diagnosed as POF. The ten POF patients were scheduled for MSC transplantation at Al- Azhar University Hospitals. MSC preparation from the bone marrow of the iliac crest was laparoscopically injected in the ovaries. Endometrial fractional biopsy is histopathologically (HP) and Immunohistochemically (IH) stained and evaluated according to Edessy stem cells score (ESS) (1).</detailed_description>
