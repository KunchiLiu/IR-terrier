	<brief_title>Pretreatments of the Skin Prior to PDT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study investigates the potential of a range of different physical pretreatments to enhance methyl aminolevulinate (MAL)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the skin prior to photodynamic therapy (PDT). The pretreatments include: microneedling, sandpaper, curettage, ablative fractional laser and non-ablative fractional laser. 17 treatment areas are mapped on the upper back of the participants. Each participant receives each intervention in a random sequence. Primary outcome measure: PpIX accumulation after 3 hours incubation with MAL. Secondary outcome measures: pain during treatment and skin reactions.</detailed_description>
