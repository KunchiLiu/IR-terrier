	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of using oral verapamil in subjects with recent onset T1D in order to downregulate TXNIP and enhance the patients' endogenous beta cell mass and insulin production. The objectives are therefore to assess parameters of beta cell survival (including new biomarkers), insulin production and glucose control and the feasibility of this approach and thereby provide the basis for future, larger/expanded, longer-term verapamil studies and the off-label use of this approved drug for T1D.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Verapamil for Beta Cell Survival Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass is a key factor in T1D, but therapies to halt this process are not available. The investigators have discovered thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), as a promising target in this regard and have now found that the commonly used anti-hypertensive drug and calcium channel-blocker, verapamil, effectively lowers beta-cell TXNIP expression in rodent beta-cells and human islets, promotes beta-cell survival and rescues mice from T1D. This makes verapamil a potentially attractive drug for T1D, but prospective clinical data are lacking. The investigators primary objective is therefore to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of verapamil in adults with recent-onset T1D and to demonstrate that subjects on oral verapamil daily for 12 months will have improved insulin production (as an indirect measure of beta-cell mass). The investigators preliminary specific aims include: #1 Assessment of remaining endogenous beta-cell mass/insulin production as measured by the change from baseline in mixed meal-stimulated C peptide, and by exogenous insulin requirements in verapamil and placebo treated subjects at Week 12 and Month 12. #2 Assessment of glycemic control as measured by mean amplitude glycemic excursions and hypoglycemic event rate (CGMS and subject-reported) and HbA1c at Week 12 and Month 12. #3 Evaluation of non-invasive markers for therapeutic follow-up and beta-cell mass, i.e. TXNIP expression in peripheral blood monocytes at baseline, Week 12 and Month 12, and collection of serum for future assessment of potential beta-cell markers (proinsulin/C-peptide ratio, demethylated insulin DNA, and microRNAs). Results will have major translational implications with potential immediate impact on clinical care, encourage large clinical follow-up trials, evaluate markers of beta cell health and ultimately help develop a novel therapy that enhances the patient's own beta-cell mass and function.</detailed_description>
