	<brief_summary>This project will pilot and test a new online communication tool, Loop, developed within a research framework with participatory and user-centred design. This pilot trial focuses on advanced cancer as an example of complex care. Cancer care involves many healthcare providers, spanning hospital to home. There is no organized way for them to communicate. Loop is a practical tool for ongoing collaboration in the patient's actual team of care that engages patients. The study will answer the questions: does Loop improve communication efficiency, engage patients and family physicians, and show early benefits in quality and health care costs?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Patients with Stage IV cancer, or Patients with stage III cancer and poor prognosis as determined by a physician (&gt;3 months but &lt;2 years) 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score ≤2 3. Each patient must have at least two healthcare providers, including an attending oncologist or palliative care physician 4. Patient and, if applicable, family caregiver must be ≥18 years of age 5. Literacy and language capacity and competency to provide informed consent 6. Patient or caregiver must have access to a computer and the internet 1. Patients without the capacity to participate in use of the online tool, and do not have a caregiver who can engage in use of the tool on their behalf 2. Participants without the capacity to participate in evaluation of outcome measures, including, but not limited to, online and paperbased multiplechoice questions, checklists, and visual analogue scales, and do not have a family caregiver who can complete outcome measures 3. A potential candidate for or currently receiving hormone therapy for breast or prostate cancer 4. Patients with a prognosis of &lt;3 months as determined by attending physician 5. Patients with impaired mental status as previously assessed by a physician or judged by research staff using the Bedside Confusion Scale 6. It has been determined that the patient is participating in another study precluding them from taking part in this study, as determined by an agreedupon algorithm, tracked and managed by study coordinators</criteria>
