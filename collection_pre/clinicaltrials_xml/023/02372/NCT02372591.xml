	<brief_summary>Pain is very common in persons with a history of addiction, but few studies have examined the best treatment of pain in this population. This is a study to determine the pain relief provided by intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) or buprenorphine given to persons maintained on stable doses of methadone or buprenorphine who have chronic musculoskeletal pain. Experimental sessions will require overnight stays on a residential research unit. In these sessions, persons will be exposed to standard experimental pain techniques at baseline and then rate the relief (if any) provided by the study medication when exposed to the same techniques. Persons will be asked to participate in 3 sessions, each separated by at least 7 days.</brief_summary>
