	<brief_title>Safety and Cost-Effectiveness of Early Maternal Newborn Infant Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the safety of a policy of early maternal newborn infant discharge compared to a policy of routine discharge 2 to 3 days after delivery. The primary outcome is newborn admissions to the Level II or Level III neonatal care unit or hospital within three days of delivery. Secondary outcomes included admissions and readmissions at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months following delivery, maternal satisfaction with length of stay and overall birthing experience, lactation continuation rates, maternal anxiety, depression, confidence and family functioning. We applied the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for early newborn discharge, but planned the analysis by intention to treat.</detailed_description>
