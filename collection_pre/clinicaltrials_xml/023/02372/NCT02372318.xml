	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure neural reactivity to alcohol-related and emotional cues in alcohol dependent subjects following a single dose of the opioid receptor modulator nalmefene. The study will be done in a cross over design with nalmefene versus placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-dose of Nalmefene to Modulate Neural Alcohol Cue Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will undergo a battery of minimal risk procedures during each study visit; filling out questionnaires, performing agreed behavioral tasks, scanning procedures including two functional MRI (fMRI) scans as well as structural MRI. The fMRI will be obtained in non-abstinent participants with breath alcohol concentrations not larger than &gt; 0.3 ‰ and withdrawal severity not more than 4 on the clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale. Alcohol consumption will be assessed with the Form90 interview. Severity of alcohol dependence will be examined with the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS). Drinking situations will be assessed with the Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS). Trait aspects of craving for alcohol will be measured with the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). To examine state and trait anxiety the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) will be used. Depressive symptoms will be measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Depression Scales (STDS). Nicotine consumption will be assessed with the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence. The following scales will be administered before and after each fMRI scanning: The Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ), the Alcohol Urge Questionaire (AUQ) and visual analogue scales for craving assessment. Participants will undergo two fMRI scanning sessions at intervals of one week: one 2 h after administration of nalmefene and one 2 h after administration of placebo, carried out in a randomized order. MRI examinations include - a cue-reactivity task; - an emotional faces task; - resting-state fMRI; - structural MRI; - including preparation, instructions and breaks</detailed_description>
