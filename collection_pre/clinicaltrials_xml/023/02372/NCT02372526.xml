	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the type of macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid or protein) that most potently stimulates the endogen secretion of different gut hormones (primary outcome = Glucagon-Like peptide-1) in gastric bypass operated patients. The study also includes a comparison of the secretion of gut hormones after oral intake of lipid with or without a pancreatic lipase inhibitor.</brief_summary>
