	<brief_title>Comparison of Delta-Shaped and Billroth II After TLDG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: 78 consecutive patients who underwent TLDG in First Hospital of Jilin University between October 2012 and December 2014 were enrolled in this study . All patients were divided randomly into two groups:Delta-shaped anastomosis group (DS group) and Billroth II anastomosis group (B-II group), and the patients in DS group underwent Delta-shaped anastomosis after TLDG, and the patients in B-II group underwent Billroth-II anastomosis after TLDG.Outcome measures,resected margin,operative time,anastomosis time,number of stapler cartridges used,length of the incision,the time of first flatus and liquid diet,hospital stay and postoperative morbidity are compared between the two groups.</detailed_description>
