	<brief_title>Sonohysterography , 3D Ultrasonography and Hysteroscopy in Assessment of Uterine Factor in Cases of Female Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will be examined by 2D transvaginal ultrasound using a 6.5 MHz probe (Sonoace 5000, Medison Co. Ltd, korea). Examination is performed after emptying of the bladder in dorsal lithotomy position. Three dimensional ultrasound will be performed using Medison, Voulson 530 D-MT ultrasound machine (Medison Co. Ltd, Korea). The uterus is visualized in the longitudinal plane, the ultrasound probe is kept steady and the patient is asked to lie still on the examination bed. Sonohysterography will be done after introduction of the catheter into the cervix, a twenty milliliter syringe which is prefilled with the distending media (saline) is then fitted to the catheter. The speculum is removed and endovaginal probe is introduced in the posterior vaginal fornix. The uterus is then visualized in the longitudinal plane to demonstrate the endometrial cavity and the catheter. Once this is possible, sterile saline is slowly injected through the catheter into the uterine cavity; up to ten milliliter of saline is usually enough for the procedure. Hysteroscopy will be done under general anesthesia. The hysteroscopy is rigid continuous flow diagnostic hysteroscopy . It has a 30ยบ panoramic optic which is 4 mm in diameter and the diagnostic continuous flow outer sheath is 6.5 mm in diameter.</detailed_description>
