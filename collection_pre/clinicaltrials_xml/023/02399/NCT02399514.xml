	<brief_summary>Improvement of sleep quality in emphysema patients is desirable. Yet, there are no data of patients treated with RePneu coils. This monocenter prospective study investigates the effect on sleep quality of RePneu coils for reduction of dynamic hyperinflation in advanced disease stages of pulmonary emphysema. Patient's sleep will be studied in three Polysomnography measurement nights, one prior to Coil Treatment, one six months after, and one twelve month after. Primary objective is to investigate differences in sleep quality 6 and 12 months after Coil Treatment. Further endpoints are changes in daily activity and sleep (actigraphy), 6MWT, lung function parameters, and questionnaires (SGRQ, mMRC dyspnoe scale).</brief_summary>
