	<brief_summary>Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated TSH in the setting of normal thyroid hormone levels, is a common diagnosis in the elderly. The purpose of this study is to examine the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in men and women aged 70 years and older with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism. To evaluate the mechanism behind this condition, participants will undergo thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulation testing at 3 visits: baseline and while taking two different thyroid hormone preparations, levothyroxine and liothyronine. The investigators will also assess physiologic responses to these two different thyroid hormone medications to help us understand how the thyroid works in advanced age.</brief_summary>
