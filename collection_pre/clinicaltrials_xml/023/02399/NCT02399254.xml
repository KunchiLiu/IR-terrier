	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation clearly increases exercise capacity, but its effect on physical activity in the home and community settings is less clear. It may take a longer time for this increase in physical activity to occur. It has been stated in an editorial that it takes 3 months to train the muscles but 6 months to train the brain. The Investigators will first evaluate the change in physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation using state-of-the-science motion detectors, then Investigators will follow the trajectory of physical activity over the next several months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Trajectory of Physical Activity Following Pulmonary Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will follow physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation longitudinally over 48 weeks. Investigators will use a state-of-the-art accelerometer, to analyze minutes walking per day as the primary outcome, rather than vector magnitude units (VMU) or estimated steps per day. Investigators will explore potential factors influencing this important outcome, including baseline activity levels, demographic variables, changes in exercise capacity, psychological variables, and self-efficacy scores. Finally, Investigators will evaluate the rate of change (trajectory) in physical activity over approximately six months after pulmonary rehabilitation. There are limited data suggesting it takes time for the translation of increased exercise capacity into increased physical activity to occur.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Adults (â‰¥ 40 years) with a primary clinical diagnosis of COPD 2. A postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 from spirometry performed within the preceding 12 months (no specific FEV1 percentpredicted requirement, although we anticipate the FEV1 will average around 45% of predicted, based on previous studies of pulmonary rehabilitation) 3. The patient was referred to pulmonary rehabilitation 4. The patient is clinicallystable: no exacerbation in preceding 4 weeks 5. Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea rating of at least 2 out of 5. 1. Disease severity or comorbidity that would make the patient be atrisk for participation this study 2. A significant movement disorder, such as hemiplegia, etc. 3. Inability to read and comprehend the questionnaires, which will be in English 4. A history of poor wound healing or chronic skin conditions that might predispose to local problems from wearing the DynaPort. (The DynaPort can be worn outside a thin garment, such as a tee shirt, and is relatively thin, without protruding parts. However, since the device may be worn overnight, and there is a remote risk of pressure problems, this exclusion criterion was added).</criteria>
