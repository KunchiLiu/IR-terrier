	<brief_summary>Leboride is a dental support device that was developed for reducing pain during active labor. It is made of an inert material, placed in the woman's mouth and does not disturb breathing, talking, or any other activity expected during labor. It is a single-use device, each user receives a new one. This study hypothesis is that the Leboride use can reduce pain during breastfeeding, by that improve women's breastfeeding experience, and increase breastfeeding rates.</brief_summary>
