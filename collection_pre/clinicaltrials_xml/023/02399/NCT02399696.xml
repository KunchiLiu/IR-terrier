	<brief_summary>Primary care patients typically do not receive adequate PTSD treatment because of their reluctance to engage in empirically-supported treatments offered in specialty care settings. Effective treatments for PTSD are also typically not provided in primary care. Brief skill-based treatments offered in primary care may alleviate symptoms and prepare patients to engage in additional treatment. VA primary care patients with PTSD (N=62) were recruited for a randomized clinical trial comparing a Primary Care-Brief Mindfulness Program (PC-bMP) to primary care-treatment as usual (PC-TAU). PC-bMP is a 4-week group program adapted from the 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) curriculum. Veterans in the PC-bMP condition demonstrated significantly greater decreases in PTSD and depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to post-treatment compared to PC-TAU. These gains were maintained at 8 and 12 week follow-up. PC-bMP participants experienced clinically significant decreases in PTSD, averaging a 15-point drop on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Exploratory analyses revealed that the describing, non-judging, and acting with awareness facets of mindfulness may account for decreases in PTSD. Our data support preliminary efficacy of a brief mindfulness-based intervention for Veterans with PTSD in primary care. Further research is needed to investigate how PC-bMP may facilitate engagement into full length empirically-supported treatment for PTSD.</brief_summary>
