	<brief_summary>Continuous haemoglobin determination could improve the outcomes of several patients in risk of bleeding during surgery. An in vivo calibration has been introduced to the device after our team found its need. The uncalilbrated validation of the Masimo Radical 7 continuous haemoglobin monitor has been made in various papers, although it has been compared to point of care devices, thus introducing an error as such point of care devices although validated for haemoglobin determination, are not as accurate as the gold standard. The validation of the gold standard calibrated device has not been described yet. When compared to the accepted gold standard (cyanmethemoglobin method, Coulter), accuracy and precision of the continuous haemoglobin monitor could be good enough to be used interchangeably with the gold standard.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Continuous Noninvasive Haemoglobin Monitoring by the Radical 7 Pulse CO-Oximetry Monitor After in Vivo Adjustment.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous haemoglobin determination could improve the outcomes of several patients in risk of bleeding during surgery. The in vivo calibration has not been adjusted to the gold standard haemoglobin determination in the literature yet. Two blood samples will be withdrawn at the same time from an arterial line, one for the central laboratory and the other one for the POC device. At the same exact time the SpHb measurement will be recorded. At least eight samples are expected per patient. A maximum of 20 samples will be withdrawn per patient. To compare bias, precision and limits of agreement among SpHb, LabHb and COoxHb the Bland Altman method will be used with multiple observations per subject when the true value varies. An error grid analysis will be made to know how it could affect to clinical decision making.</detailed_description>
