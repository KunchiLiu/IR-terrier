	<brief_title>Effect of California Tri-pull Taping Method on Shoulder Subluxation, Pain, Active Range of Motion and Upper Limb Functional Recovery After Stroke - A Pre Test Post Test Design</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention was given by the lead researcher who was trained for the taping techniques. Prior to give taping method participants who have hair around the shoulder was instructed to remove hair. Two types of tape was used, a self-adhesive 1.5ʺ cotton undercover tape (VPK, Chennai) and a 1ʺ rigid strapping tape (VPK, Chennai). To approximate the humeral head into the glenoid cavity participants were instructed to place their affected arm on a wooden table. Three piece of tape was used, firstly the investigators applied cotton undercover pre tape and then the investigators applied the rigid post tape on it. First piece (middle) of tape was applied from 1.5 inches below the deltoid tuberosity up to 2 inches above the glenoid cavity. Second piece (posterior) was applied from 1.5 inches below the deltoid tuberosity upto the 1.5 inches above the mid spine of scapula. Third piece (anterior) was applied from the 1.5 inches below the deltoid tuberosity upto the 1.5 inches above the clavicle. (Figure-1). The tape was removed and new tape applied every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and remained on the patient for 6 consecutive weeks. All the participants were received standardized conventional neuro rehabilitation programme. The conventional neuro rehabilitation treatment includes, active, and passive range of motion exercise, bilateral activation of pectoralis major, activation of lattisimus dorsi, activation of the retractors, weight bearing exercise of upper extremity, activation of supraspinatus, reaching activities, grasping, holding and release, and ADL activities. Every participant was received conventional neuro rehabilitation for 45 minutes and 5 days a week.</detailed_description>
