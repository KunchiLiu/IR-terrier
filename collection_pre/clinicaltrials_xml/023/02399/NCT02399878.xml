	<brief_summary>Respiratory complications represent the second most frequent type of postoperative complications with an incidence estimated to range from 2.0% to 7.9% It has been shown that intra-operative protective ventilation is associated with a reduced risk of respiratory complications. The effects of intra-operative inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) remain to be investigated. In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the association between intra-operative FiO2 and respiratory complication as well as surgical site infection and ICU admission in patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic surgery. The investigators primary hypothesis is that high intra-operative FiO2 increases the risk of postoperative respiratory complications independent of predefined risk factors.</brief_summary>
