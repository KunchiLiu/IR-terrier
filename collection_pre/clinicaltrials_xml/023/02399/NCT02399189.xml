	<brief_title>MT-R Followed by Autologous Stem Cells Transplantation in Newly-diagnosed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It's a single center, single arm, prospective clinical trial. Patients younger than 65 years old with primary central nervous system lymphoma will received four cycles of chemotherapy with rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate and temozolomide as induction therapy, and then received consolidation therapy with autologous stem cell transplant for which the conditioning regimen is Carmustine plus thiotepa.</detailed_description>
