	<criteria>1. Male or female at least 18 years of age at time of screening 2. Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prior to study enrollment 3. Screening laboratory results from the central clinical laboratory indicating HCV genotype 1 infection only 4. Absence of cirrhosis and advanced bridging fibrosis 1. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive immunoassay 2. Clinically significant abnormalities or comorbidities, other than HCV infection, that make the subject an unsuitable candidate for this study or treatment with Ribavirin (RBV) in the opinion of the investigator 3. Any current or past clinical evidence of cirrhosis such as ascites or esophageal varices, or prior biopsy showing cirrhosis or advanced bridging fibrosis, e.g., a Metavir score &gt; 2 or an Ishak score &gt; 3 4. Use of medications contraindicated for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir, sofosbuvir, or ribavirin (RBV; for those that receive RBV), within 2 weeks or 10 halflives whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration 5. Current enrolment in another clinical study, previous enrolment in this study, or previous use of any investigational or commercially available antiHCV agents</criteria>
