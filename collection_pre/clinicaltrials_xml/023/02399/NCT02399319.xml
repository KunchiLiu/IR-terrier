	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare subcutaneous internal fixation and open plating of the symphysis in patients with a disruption of the symphysis requiring stabilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of INFIX and Plating for Pelvic Ring Injuries With Symphysis Disruptions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine whether either one of the two procedures has significant advantages over the other. The null hypothesis of this study is that there is no difference between plating and subcutaneous internal fixation of symphysis disruptions with respect to primary and secondary outcomes. The study is a randomized trial with patients who sustained a symphysis disruption who will randomize to either closed reduction and subcutaneous internal fixation, or open reduction and plating of the symphysis. There will also be two observational arms of the study, patients who do not agree to randomization and will receive internal fixation according to the treating surgeon's discretion and patients with a symphysis disruption that do not require any form of anterior pelvic internal fixation based on the treating surgeon's opinion. Clinical assessments will occur at the time of hospital admission and at all post-operative follow-up intervals (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6months, 12 months, and 24 months).</detailed_description>
