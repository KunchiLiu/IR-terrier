	<brief_summary>This is an open label safety and feasibility trial using Acthar® in addition to center-specific standard therapy including plasma exchange, for treatment of post transplant recurrent FSGS and post transplant recurrent idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Subjects will receive Acthar® 40 units subcutaneously twice weekly for two weeks then 80 units subcutaneously twice weekly for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Proteinuria &gt; 1 g/d by urine protein/creatinine ratio (UP/C) or 24 hour urine collection (at what timepoint?) If treated with an angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), must be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment Newly diagnosed recurrent focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or current/previous treatment of recurrent FSGS with no evidence of at least a partial response as defined by one or more of the following: 1. Recurrent FSGS confirmed by renal transplant biopsy (FSGS on light microscopy and/or foot process effacement on electron microscopy), with FSGS as the primary disease confirmed by native renal biopsy prior to transplant 2. FSGS confirmed by renal transplant biopsy (FSGS on light microscopy and/or foot process effacement on electron microscopy), within 18 months post transplant 3. Patients at any time period post transplant with an established diagnosis of recurrent FSGS in the first 18 months post transplant who did not respond to conventional therapy as defined by persistent proteinuria of &gt; 3 g/d by UP/C or 24 hour urine collection Lactation, pregnancy or refusal of birth control in women of childbearing potential Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or parvovirus B19 Malignancy (with the exception of treated and cured basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma) Evidence of diabetic nephropathy, transplant glomerulopathy or other pathologies that could be associated with secondary FSGS on renal transplant biopsy Nonrenal organ transplant (with the exception of pancreas transplant) Contraindication to receiving Acthar®</criteria>
