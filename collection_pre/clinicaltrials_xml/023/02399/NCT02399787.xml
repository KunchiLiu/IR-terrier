	<brief_summary>The aim of the post doc project is investigate which genes regulate implantation in order to analyze specific proteins and microRNA in the spent culture media with the long-term goal of developing a non-invasive method of embryo assessment and selection. This will be achieved by conducting a targeted NGS analysis, based on list obtained from a non-published pilot study. When further validated by q-PCR, the expression of specific microRNAs known to influence the final list of genes will be analyzed in the spent culture media and the protein products of the genes recovered from the media will be quantified. The level of specific microRNAs and proteins will be related to aneuploidy and implantation potential. If the level of specific microRNA and/or proteins correlates with pregnancy, the study will form the basis for developing a clinical applicable precise method of improved embryo selection and thus improved IVF treatment.</brief_summary>
