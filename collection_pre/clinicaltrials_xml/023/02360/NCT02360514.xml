	<brief_title>Study to Evalutate Long-term Immunity of Hantavax in High Risk Population of HFRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, non-comparable, open-label clinical trial.This trial was conducted written informed consent form by voluntary agreement, negative result of hantaanvirus antubidy by neutralizaing antibody test, test drug was administrated 0, 1, 13 months according to drug label. For antibody test, Sampling was conducted pre-dose(T0), 1 month after vaccination(T1), 1 year after vaccination(before booster vaccination, T2) and 1 month after vaccination(T3). Also, 1 month after vaccination (T3) after completion of booster vaccination for antibody retension duration observed for subjects with antibody to conduct a three-year follow-up survey was conducted, and the antibody test every year.In conclusion, sampling was conducted 12 months(T4), 24 months(T5), 36months(T6) after the booster vaccionation. However, follow-up survey was terminated when the antibody titer was determined as a negative by neutralizing antibody test and fluorescent antibody technique.</detailed_description>
