	<detailed_description>This study will assess a broad range of potential outcomes related to administration of a double-blinded, but FDA-approved study medication. Participants will be required to spend the night on a clinical research unit, located on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus, for 4 consecutive nights (Monday - Friday). Participants will undergo daily sessions Tuesday - Friday. Tuesday sessions will consist of taking a study medication in the morning and afternoon, and completing a pain testing session after each study drug administration. Wednesday through Friday sessions will consist of taking a study drug in the morning and providing self-report ratings of drug effects and vital sign measurements (such as blood pressure, pulse) several times for a 6-hour period. The investigators will also collect saliva samples to assess physiological functioning, and will ask you to complete a computerized task to assess levels of functioning.</detailed_description>
