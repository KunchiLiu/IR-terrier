	<brief_summary>At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, we have developed a novel curriculum for a 6-week psycho-educationally-based, cognitive behavioral program to help patients with subjective cognitive complaints after cancer treatment, titled Emerging from the Haze™ (Haze). Each series meets once a week for 2 hours for 6 weeks. The leading neuropsychologist covers material such as guided relaxation, behavioral strategies for automatic/negative thoughts, compensatory strategies for attention and memory, executive functioning, pacing, and balance. Each Haze series will be electronically delivered in a live format to our satellite site, The University of Kansas.</brief_summary>
