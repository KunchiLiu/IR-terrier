Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after study vaccination, with the exception of any licensed influenza vaccine which may be administered â‰¥ 15 days before or after study vaccination.

History of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis antigencontaining vaccine or to any component of Boostrix. History of encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following a previous vaccination with pertussiscontaining vaccine. History of any neurological disorders or seizures History of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following a previous vaccination against diphtheria and/ or tetanus. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to study vaccination, or planned administration during the study period. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of immunoglobulins and/ or any blood products within the 3 months prior to study vaccination, or planned administration during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of or current autoimmune disease. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality.
