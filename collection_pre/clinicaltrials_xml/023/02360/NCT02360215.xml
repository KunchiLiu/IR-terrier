	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compares memantine hydrochloride and whole-brain radiotherapy with or without hippocampal avoidance in reducing neurocognitive decline in patients with cancer that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to the brain. Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the most common treatment for brain metastasis. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with brain metastases experience cognitive (such as learning and memory) deterioration after WBRT. Memantine hydrochloride may enhance cognitive function by binding to and inhibiting channels of receptors located in the central nervous system. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Using radiation techniques, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy to avoid the hippocampal region during WBRT, may reduce the radiation dose to the hippocampus and help limit the radiation-induced cognitive decline. It is not yet known whether giving memantine hydrochloride and WBRT with or without hippocampal avoidance works better in reducing neurocognitive decline in patients with brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memantine Hydrochloride and Whole-Brain Radiotherapy With or Without Hippocampal Avoidance in Reducing Neurocognitive Decline in Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the addition of whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance (HA-WBRT) increases time to neurocognitive failure at months 2, 4, 6, and 12 as measured by neurocognitive decline on a battery of tests: the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) for Total Recall, Delayed Recall, and Delayed Recognition, Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA), and the Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the addition of HA-WBRT preserves neurocognitive function at months 2, 4, 6, and 12 as separately measured by each test, the HVLT-R for Total Recall, Delayed Recall, and Delayed Recognition; COWA; and TMT Parts A and B. II. Evaluate the potential benefit of HA-WBRT in symptom burden, as measured by the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT). III. Assessment of quality adjusted survival and cost analysis using the five-level version of the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L). IV. Compare cumulative incidence of progression and overall survival after WBRT versus HA-WBRT. V. Compare adverse events between the treatment arms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0 criteria. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Collect serum, plasma, and imaging studies for future translational research analyses. II. Evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and hippocampal volumetry at baseline and 6 months as potential predictors of neurocognitive decline and differential benefit from HA-WBRT as compared to WBRT. III. Association of symptom burden and anxiety/depression with neurocognitive function. IV. Evaluate the potential correlation between the prognostic scoring systems Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) and neurocognitive function at baseline and overtime. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks. Patients undergo WBRT daily over approximately 2 weeks (10 fractions). ARM II: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride as in Arm I. Patients undergo HA-WBRT using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) daily over approximately 2 weeks (10 fractions). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PRIOR TO STEP 1 REGISTRATION: Brain metastases outside a 5mm margin around either hippocampus must be visible on contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed =&lt; 21 days prior to Step 1 registration; an allowed exception, regarding ability to image brain metastases, would be that patients who had undergone radiosurgery or surgical resection and are planning adjuvant WBRT do not have to have visible disease but do need a presurgery MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrating brain metastases; however, the brain metastases could not have been within 5 mm of either hippocampus Patients must have a gadolinium contrastenhanced threedimensional spoiled gradient (SPGR), magnetizationprepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), or turbo field echo (TFE) axial MRI scan with standard axial and coronal gadolinium contrastenhanced T1weighted sequence and axial T2/FLAIR sequence acquisitions; to yield acceptable image quality, the gadolinium contrastenhanced threedimensional SPGR, MPRAGE, or TFE axial MRI scan should use the smallest possible axial slice thickness not exceeding 1.5 mm; the associated coronal and sagittal contrastenhanced T1 sequences can be up to 2.5 mm in slice thickness; this MRI must be obtained =&lt; 21 days prior to step 1 registration; the vendor specific MRI protocols are available for download from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Patients must provide studyspecific informed consent prior to registration PRIOR TO STEP 2 REGISTRATION: The following baseline neurocognitive assessments must be completed prior to Step 2 registration: HVLTR, TMT, and COWA; the neurocognitive assessment will be uploaded into the NRG RAVE System for evaluation by Dr. Wefel; once the upload is complete, a notification will be sent to proceed to Step 2; NOTE: completed baseline neurocognitive assessments can be uploaded at the time of Step 1 registration Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy within 5 years prior to Step 2 registration History and physical examination within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70 within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration Serum creatinine =&lt;
