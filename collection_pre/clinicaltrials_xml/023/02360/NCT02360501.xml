	<brief_summary>The standard treatment strategy for locally advanced (stage IVA) and metastatic (stage IVB) nasopharyngeal carcinoma has not been defined yet. Generally induction chemotherapy is given to those patients in order to shrink the tumor volume and facilitate the following radiation therapy. Thus, in this study, the investigators use the combination of Docetaxel+Cisplatin+Xeloda (DCX) to treat locally advanced and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard treatment strategy for locally advanced (stage IVA) and metastatic (stage IVB) nasopharyngeal carcinoma has not been defined yet. Generally induction chemotherapy is given to those patients in order to shrink the tumor volume and facilitate the following radiation therapy.However, the standard chemotherapy regimen has not been defined yet.Combination of cisplatin and fluracil is the commonly used regimen with tolerable toxicity. Recent studies have found that docetaxel has good efficacy on nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, and capecitabine can be safely used instead of fluracil. Thus, in this study, we use the combination of Docetaxel+Cisplatin+Xeloda (DCX) to treat locally advanced and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles.</detailed_description>
