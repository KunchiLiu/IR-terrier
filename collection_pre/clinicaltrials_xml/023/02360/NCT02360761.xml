	<brief_summary>The role of sublobar resection(Wedge resection or anatomic segmentectomy) for small(≤ 2cm) early stage non-small cell lung cancer has been studied by Lung Cancer Study Group and is being studied by several ongoing trials. However, elderly patients(aged ≥70 years) in these trials is under-represented, as in most of the ongoing clinical trials. This study focuses on the elderly population of early stage lung cancer, and aims to investigate the outcome of lobectomy versus sublobar resection for peripheral stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in elderly patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment of Elderly Patients With cT1N0M0 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Comparison Between Sublobar Resection and Lobectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial is to the best of our knowledge the first one designed to compare sublobar resection and lobectomy for elderly patients, in order to address these open questions:In patients aged 70 years or older and with clinical stage T1N0M0 NSCLC, (1) whether sublobar resection can achieve similar disease-free survival compared to lobectomy, (2) whether sublobar resection can reduce the postoperative mortality and morbidity,(3) whether sublobar resection can reserve better pulmonary function and quality of life for elderly patients of NSCLC?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 70 years or older Preoperative criteria (contrastenhanced Computed tomography scan) Suspected nonsmall cell lung cancer Clinical stage ⅠA, i.e. T1N0M0 (tumor diameter ≤3 cm, surrounded by visceral pleura, shortaxis of lymph node &lt;1 cm or cold lymph nodes on PET scan) The maximum diameter of consolidation of the maximum tumor diameter (consolidation/tumor ratio, C/T ratio) is no less than 0.5 in subsolid lesions Eligible for sublobar resection with sufficient margin Intraoperative criteria Histologically confirmed invasive NSCLC, i.e. NSCLC other than preinvasive adenocarcinomas defined by The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (adenocarcinoma in situ, and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma) Pathological exclusion of suspected lymph nodes involvement Feasible to perform sublobar resection in terms of surgical margin requirement General criteria Must sign informed consent by the patient or his/her entrusted party Must complete 4year mortality index and comprehensive geriatric assessment(CGA) if necessary The physiological reservation can tolerate lobectomy Unable to comply with the study procedure Past thoracic surgery history, except for diagnostic thoracoscopy Malignant tumor history within the past 5 years, except for the following conditions: cured skin basal cell carcinoma, superficial bladder carcinoma, and uterine cervix cancer in situ Any active systemic diseases including uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, newly onset of angina pectoris within recent 3 months, congestive heart failure (class II or plus of New York Heart Association, NYHA), myocardial infarction within recent 6 months, severe disease in the need of medication such as arrhythmia, liver, renal or metabolic diseases Uncontrollable infections Coexisting small cell lung cancer Psychiatric diseases diagnosed Other circumstances which is deemed inappropriate for enrollment by the researchers</criteria>
