	<brief_title>Stay Strong: A Physical Activity Program for Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq (OEF/OIF) are at high risk for becoming overweight and obese. However, existing VA programs are not designed for younger Veterans who are comfortable with technology-mediated interventions, may not yet have developed obesity-related illnesses, and contain a relatively high percentage of women compared to previous Veteran cohorts. Technology-mediated lifestyle interventions that include continuous, objective home monitoring of physical activity, automated internet mediated feedback, and e-coaching increase physical activity and improve weight loss in non-Veteran populations. When delivered on a large scale, such interventions represent low cost but effective alternatives to face-to-face lifestyle change interventions that can be implemented widely in the VA health care system. Thus, this project will test the feasibility and effectiveness of the prevention focused, internet-mediated healthy lifestyle physical activity program, Stay Strong, tailored to the needs, preferences and demographics of OEF/OIF Veterans. Specifically, Stay Strong relies on use of a wearable device, the Fitbit Charge HR, and incorporates coaching support, tailored messages, and personalized physical activity goals. Stay Strong will be compared to the use of the Fitbit Charge HR with standard online support.</detailed_description>
