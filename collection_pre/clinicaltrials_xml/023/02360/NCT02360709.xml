	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the CRE8 Sirolimus-Eluting Stent for the Treatment of De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm observational registry trial planned to enroll 800 subjects. All 800 subjects enrolled will receive CRE8 stents. Clinical follow-up will be performed at 1 month, 6 months,12 months and annually up to 5 years after the procedure.</detailed_description>
