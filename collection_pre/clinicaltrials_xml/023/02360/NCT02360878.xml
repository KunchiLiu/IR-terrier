	<brief_title>The Endocrine Impact of the Duodenal-jejunal Bypass Sleeve on Type 2 Diabetes - Potential Role of the Incretin Hormones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve (DJBS) is being developed for the treatment of obesity, and initial clinical outcomes suggest that this minimally invasive endoscopic technique potentially has beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes also. However, the mechanisms behind the antidiabetic effects of the procedure remain unknown. We want to elucidate how the DJBS might change postprandial secretion of gut and pancreatic hormones.</detailed_description>
