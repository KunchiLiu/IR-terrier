	<brief_summary>Bleeding after ascending aorta surgery is a common, unresolved and consequences-heavy event as per present day. Tisseel (Baxter inc) sprayed on the already hemostased mediastinum jut before closing seems a promising technique to radically diminish bleeding. This study aims to verify this efficacy (expected goal -50% blood volume in chest drains) and possibly the consensual blood transfusion lessening.</brief_summary>
