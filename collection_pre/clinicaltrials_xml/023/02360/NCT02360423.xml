	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the CRE8 Stent for the Treatment of De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of a randomized controlled cohort and a long stent observational cohort. The randomized controlled trial is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferior, randomized controlled trial. The control device (RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent) used in this trial was provided by Medtronic. RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent has been already approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2009 and become commercially available in Chinese market. 400 patients enrolled in this trial will be randomly assigned to CRE8 group (n=200) and RESOLUTE group (n=200) in a 1:1 ratio. The long stent observational trial plans to enroll 30 consecutive patients. Patients in the observational cohort will receive the long CRE8 stent with length 38mm.All 430 patients will be required to receive clinical follow-up at 1 month, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and annually up to 5 years after the procedure, and angiographic follow-up at 9 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint is in-stent LLL at 9 months after the procedure, and the secondary endpoints are device success rate, device-oriented cardiovascular composite endpoint, patient-oriented cardiovascular composite endpoint and stent thrombosis.</detailed_description>
