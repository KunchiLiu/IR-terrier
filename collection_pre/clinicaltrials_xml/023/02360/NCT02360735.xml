	<detailed_description>Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) is a specialized massage technique utilized to decrease various forms of edema. Edema can limit function, range of motion (ROM) and increase pain after surgery. Studies have shown that decreasing edema can increase knee strength and functional performance on various standardized measures. MLD has been shown to be effective in patients with hind foot operations and increases ROM post total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. The aim of this study is to determine whether MLD on a sample of patients with TKR will decrease edema, increase ROM and decrease pain as compared to TKR patients who do not receive MLD.</detailed_description>
