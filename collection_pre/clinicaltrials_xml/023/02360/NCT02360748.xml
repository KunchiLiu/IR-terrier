	<brief_summary>The study proposes that addition of high protein plant based diet will improve serum albumin as well serum phosphate for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Peritoneal Dialysis. Patient will be provided additional food items to help improve their nutritional status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Plant Based High Protein Diet to Improve Nutritional Outcomes in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to improve the albumin and nutritional status of patient with ESRD on Peritoneal dialysis. Serum albumin is a marker to show how well the patient's overall nutrition is. When albumin level drops it signifies poor outcome in dialysis patients both in terms of complications as well as mortality. Our goal on dialysis is to improve serum albumin level as close to normal as possible. This study intends to also improve phosphorus level by adding high protein sources which are plant based. In this study we intend to add certain plant based food items which are high in protein content. Studies have shown that these particular food items considerably increase serum albumin level but at the same time they are safe as they do not increase the phosphorous levels in kidney patients. Patients will be provided the additional food items and all their nutritional parameters will be monitored at baseline and during the study period of one month</detailed_description>
