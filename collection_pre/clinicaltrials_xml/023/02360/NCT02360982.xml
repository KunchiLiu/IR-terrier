	<brief_title>The Comparison of Incidence and Risk Factors of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients After Lower Extremity Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred twenty elderly patients aged ≥65 years scheduled for total hip or knee arthroplasty and femur fracture surgery were enrolled into the study. Patients were allocated into two groups to receive regional anesthesia (group R, n=50) or general anesthesia (group G, n=70). Hemodynamic and blood parameters, potential risk factors of delirium including age, sex, duration of surgery, the type of anesthesia, coexisting disease, smoking and amount of drug used delirium tests (CAM and DRS-R-98), hospital stay and costs were recorded for all patients.</detailed_description>
