	<brief_summary>A prospective, multicenter, randomised controlled phase II study in which patients with therapy resistant (arterio-) venous leg/foot ulcers are treated with Tiscover® (test group) or with AS210 (control group) to determine the safety and relative efficacy of both products.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Skin Substitute for Chronic Leg/Foot Ulcers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, randomised clinical trial in out patient in which patients with chronic (arterio-) venous leg/foot ulcers are treated with an autologous cultured human living skin substitute (Tiscover®: test group) or with Acellular donor dermis (AS210: control group). During a pre-inclusion evaluation period of 4 weeks (non healing) chronicity of ulcer is ensured (ulcer size change of &lt; 30%). To determine ulcer type ABI, Doppler and CEAP is performed. The test group will receive 2 applications of Tiscover®. Week 0: wound activating pre-treatment, application of at least one quarter of the wound surface. Week 1: removal of patches, application of patches on total wound surface. The control group (16 patients) will follow the same application protocol.</detailed_description>
