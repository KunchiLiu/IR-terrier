	<brief_summary>Aim: To identify psychological and socioeconomic predictors of cardiac-rehabilitation (CR) attendance and uncover mechanisms of CR non-attendance. Design: Quantitative, observational, prospective study. Hypothesis a: Educational-level, comorbidity, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, cohabitation and distance from residence are predictors of CR attendance. Hypothesis b: The expected social gradient in CR attendance is explained partly by differential exposure of comorbidity, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, cohabitation and distance to the rehabilitation clinic.</brief_summary>
