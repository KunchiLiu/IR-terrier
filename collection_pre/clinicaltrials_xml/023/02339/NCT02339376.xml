	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to open up the promising treatment of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which has been shown to be effective against seizures in patients with surface neocortical foci, to a much larger population of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and other forms of epilepsy with deep foci, who are not currently considered good rTMS candidates. The investigators hypothesize that rTMS can modulate the hyperexcitable state in patients with deep seizure foci by targeting its usage to accessible cortical partner regions. In this study the investigators aim 1) to map the functional connectivity of the epileptogenic mesial temporal lobe in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; and 2) to perform a randomized controlled assessment of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols applied to specific neocortical targets in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The methods used in this study will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</brief_summary>
