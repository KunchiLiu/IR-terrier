	<brief_summary>The main goals of this study are to provide a cognitive, neurological, brain morphological, and serological profile of sepsis survivors in order to make long-term prognosis of recovery and estimate the need for rehabilitation measures in order to help patients reintegrate into normal daily life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Cognitive and Cerebral Changes in Sepsis Survivors and Their Predictors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison of cognitive function in severe septic/septic shock ICU patients with non-septic postoperative ICU patients and actively recruited healthy controls at several time points up to 12 months after leaving the ICU (with a potential follow up at 24 months post ICU). Secondary aims: - Profiling specific cognitive deficits in sepsis survivors over time. - Identifying possible subclasses of long-term cognitive impairment according to facets of disease, therapy and ICU experience. - Investigating long-term brain morphological changes, with hippocampus as region of interest (ROI). - Determining values of Serum- and CSF-Biomarkers - Evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic value of non-routine biomarkers for systemic- and neuroinflammation in the acute phase and in the long-term - Investigate associations between brain morphological changes, cognitive changes, neurological status, psychiatric burden, disability level, employment status and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). - Investigating brain-activity changes in resting state electro-encephalogram (EEG)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Severe sepsis/septic shock subjects will only be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria: Written informed consent of the patient or documentation of presumed will via a relative or legal representative. Documentation of verification by a doctor independent of the study that the patient's study participation is unobjectionable. Written informed consent of patient will be obtained at the earliest time possible. Aged 2580 years Male or female Admitted to the intensive care units of the AnesthesiologicalOperative Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital Bonn, which includes a surgical ICU, an anesthesiological ICU, and a cardiosurgical ICU Duration of ICU stay must be a minimum of 24 hours. In case of transfer to intermediate care or the observation ward before the 24 hour ICU period is complete, study parameters must be allowed to be assessed. Fulfill the criteria of severe sepsis and/or septic shock according to the modified criteria of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference (ACCP/SCCM), used in the German epidemiologic study of sepsis (Engel et al, 2007) Postoperative ICU Patients will only be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria: Written informed consent of the subject. Aged 2580 years Male or female Admitted to the intensive care units of the AnesthesiologicalOperative Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital Bonn, which includes a surgical ICU, an anesthesiological ICU, and a cardiosurgical ICU Duration of ICU stay must be a minimum of 24 hours. In case of transfer to intermediate care or the observation ward before the 24 hour ICU period is complete, study parameters must be allowed to be assessed. MMSE Score of 25 or above Healthy Controls will only be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria: Written informed consent of the subject Aged 2580 years Male or female EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects presenting with any of the following exclusion criteria may not be included in the study: Simultaneous participation in any clinical treatment study involving administration of an investigational medicinal product within 30 days prior to study beginning Physical or psychiatric condition which at the investigator's discretion may put the subject at risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere with the subject's participation in this study Prior to the start of this study existence of preexisting severe diseases and/or conduction of surgery necessarily imply life expectancy less than 12 months Known or suspected persistent abuse of medication, drugs or alcohol now or in the past Known cerebral lesions, cerebral infarction or malignoms Dementia or history of other central nervous system diseases Cranialcerebral injury Known HIVInfection Known liver cirrhosis with a documented ChildPugh Score of C prior to this study Liver transplants Prior to start of this study nursing care level of 2 or 3 Prior to start of this study residing in a nursing home Additional Exclusion Criteria For NonSeptic Postoperative ICU Patients: Fulfillment of modified criteria of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference (ACCP/SCCM), used in the German epidemiologic study of sepsis In the case that a postoperative ICU patient fulfills the criteria for sepsis during ICU stay, he/she will be moved to the sepsis group. Additional Exclusion Criteria For Healthy: Executing thirdparty cognitive and functional assessments of another patientsubject also included in this investigation History of ICU stay in the last 12 months</criteria>
