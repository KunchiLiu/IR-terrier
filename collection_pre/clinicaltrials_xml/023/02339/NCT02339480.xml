	<brief_summary>This project is to penetrate and consummate the research mechanism of massage therapy on simple obesity. Latest researches indicate that the energy regulation network system of hypothalamus and metabolic disorders on adipocyte may be the pathological bases which result in obesity. The research group have firstly conducted effect studies of massage therapy on model of simple obesity rats and observed some neurobiological mechanism (whole effect mechanism), meanwhile, the team have discussed influences on the development of preadipocyte and function of endocrine with dynamic mechanical stimulation in vitro (local effect mechanism). This research aims at centering on the hypothesis that massage therapy can act on energy regulation network system of hypothalamus specifically, thus regulating the energy metabolic disorders. Then applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore whether patients with simple obesity exist abnormality on energy regulation network system of hypothalamus, ascertain mechanisms how massage therapy treat energy metabolism disorders of simple obesity, deepen mechanism study on how massage therapy prevent and treat obesity and enrich the clinical application's scientific connotation that massage therapy treat simple obesity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project will divide in two groups,healthy volunteers and obesity group.Healthy volunteers do not accept any treatment while obesity group need accept massage therapy three times a week,18 times in total.And two groups will be checked by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Healthy volunteers for once and obesity group for twice(before treatment, obesity group's image of fMRI will compare with Healthy volunteers' and the image which is taken after treatment)</detailed_description>
