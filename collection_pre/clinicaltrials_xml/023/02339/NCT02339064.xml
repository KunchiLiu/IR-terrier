	<brief_title>Infusion of Apomorphine: Long-term Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3, multi center, open-label study will assess the long-term safety of continuous infusion apomorphine in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are unable to achieve adequate control despite optimized noninvasive therapy. Further, this study will assess the clinical effectiveness of continuous infusion apomorphine in reducing "off" time in advanced Parkinson's disease patients and to assess the clinical effectiveness of continuous infusion apomorphine in improving "on" time without troublesome dyskinesias.</detailed_description>
