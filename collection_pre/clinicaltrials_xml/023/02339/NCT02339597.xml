	<brief_summary>Primary hypothesis: The objective compliance ( # of hours per night of APAP therapy) is higher in patients who get the APAP treatment initiation at home due to the fact that they get better support by telemetric control and the possibility of prompt interventions. Secondary hypothesis: Based on the higher support at the home APAP initiation the following parameters will be better in comparison to the standard supply in laboratory: Objective measures: - mask leakage - pressure - Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) Subjective measures: - quality of life - sleepiness</brief_summary>
