	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer that has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent) and/or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Objective tumor response to nivolumab in patients with previously treated recurrent and/or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Tumor response to nivolumab based on immune-related response criteria (IRC). II. Duration of response. III. Progression-free survival and overall survival. IV. Safety and tolerability. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the effect of nivolumab on tumor burden by analyzing the clearance of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during the first 4-6 weeks of treatment. II. To investigate the association between treatment outcome and immunological markers: a) Intratumoral expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L1) in archived NPC tissues (mandatory); b) Serum absolute lymphocyte count at baseline and post-treatment (mandatory); and c) Plasma cytokine levels at baseline and serially during the first 8 weeks of treatment; d) Expression of PD-1 in cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) at baseline (optional). III. To investigate functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences as an early predictor of response to nivolumab (optional only at Chinese University of Hong Kong [CUHK]). OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.</detailed_description>

NOTE: patients with local recurrence at the bony skullbase as the only site of index disease are excluded; patients with locoregional recurrence without distant metastases must have undergone radical radiotherapy previously Measurable disease according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for the evaluation of measurable disease Received one or more lines of chemotherapy, which must include prior treatment with a platinum agent and must not be amenable to potentially curative radiotherapy or surgery Archived or fresh tumor sample available;

prior palliative radiotherapy to bone metastases =&lt; 2 weeks prior to registration (i.e. prior palliative radiotherapy to bone metastases is allowed if it is performed &gt; 2 weeks prior to registration) Prior investigational agents =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration Prior treatment with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or immune checkpoint pathways Known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases; NOTE: symptomatic, and/or if they require immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids (e.g. &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration; patients with treated brain metastases who are deemed clinically stable and without radiological progression on positron emission tomography (PET), MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan performed =&lt; 8 weeks of study entry, are not excluded; NOTE: primary nasopharyngeal cancers that directly invade the skull base and extend into the infratemporal fossa (e) are not regarded as brain metastases and are not excluded History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to nivolumab History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Any of the following: Pregnant women Nursing women Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception NOTE: breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab; women of childbearing potential and men must use two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; they must adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of nivolumab For patients with unknown human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status at the time of enrollment, HIV serology must be tested during screening; patients who are tested positive for HIV could be included if there is an adequate cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count (&gt; 350/ul) on a stable regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with no detectable or minimal viral burden, and no active infections For patients with unknown hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HbsAg) status, must be tested during study screening; patients who are tested positive test for HBsAg are excluded if they have inadequately controlled hepatitis B and/or ChildPugh Class B or C cirrhosis; however, patients with adequately controlled hepatitis are not excluded from the study if they satisfy all of the following criteria: (i) must be receiving a nucleoside analog antiviral drug for 3 or more months;
