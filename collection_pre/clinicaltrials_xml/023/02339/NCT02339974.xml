	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the short term safety (&lt;30 days) and mid and long term efficacy (6 months and &gt;1-year) of the heterotopic implantation of the Edwards-Sapien XT valve in the inferior vena cava for the treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation in patients who are inoperable or at a very high surgical risk for tricuspid valve replacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heterotopic Implantation Of the Edwards-Sapien XT Transcatheter Valve in the Inferior VEna Cava for the Treatment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation (HOVER)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective single center non-blinded (open label), non-randomized safety and feasibility study enrolling patients who have symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation and whom are at extremely high risk for standard tricuspid valve surgery. These patients will undergo inferior vena cava (IVC) stenting with an Edwards-Sapien Transcatheter valve for amelioration of their symptoms. In those patients with favorable anatomic substrate, pre-stenting will be performed at the right atrial (RA) IVC junction to provide a stable scaffold for the transcatheter valve implant</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must be at least 22 years old. 2. The patient must have severe, symptomatic (ACC/AHA Stage D symptoms) tricuspid regurgitation as assessed by 2D echocardiogram, and or evidenced by right heart catheterization of ventricular vwave transmission into the inferior vena cava, with evidence of peripheral and central venous congestion. TR should be functional in nature, without anatomical abnormalities of the tricuspid valve leaflets themselves. 3. The patient must be evaluated by a "heart team" of physicians including an interventional cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and heart failure specialist and presented for review at a multidisciplinary conference. By consensus, the heart team must agree (and verify in the case review process) that valve implantation will likely benefit the patient. 4. The heart team agrees that medical factors preclude operation, based on a conclusion that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity is ≥ 50%. Also, other factors which may increase the patients perceived surgical risk for inclusion in the trial will be clearly delineated if they are present. The surgeons' consultation notes shall specify the medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion. At least one of the cardiac surgeon assessors must have interviewed and examined the patient. 5. The study patient agrees to comply with all required postprocedure followup visits including annual visits through 5 years and analysis close date visits, which will be conducted as a phone followup. 1. Heart Team assessment of operability (the heart team considers the patient to be a good surgical candidate). 2. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1 month (30 days) before the intended treatment [defined as: Q wave MI, or nonQ wave MI with total CK elevation of CKMB ≥ twice normal in the presence of MB elevation and/or troponin level elevation (WHO definition)]. 3. Untreated, severe, left sided valvular heart disease including mitral regurgitation or stenosis, and aortic regurgitation or stenosis. 4. Mean pulmonary artery pressures ≥40mmHG and PVR &gt;4 woods units as assessed by right heart catheterization. 5. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure resulting in a permanent implant that is performed within 30 days of the index procedure. Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is excluded. 6. Patients with planned concomitant surgical or transcatheter ablation for Atrial Fibrillation. 7. Leukopenia (WBC &lt; 3000 cell/mL), acute anemia (Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL), Thrombocytopenia (Plt &lt; 50,000 cell/mL). 8. Hemodynamic or respiratory instability requiring inotropic support, mechanical ventilation or mechanical heart assistance within 30 days of screening evaluation. 9. Need for emergency surgery for any reason. 10. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%. 11. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation. 12. Active upper GI bleeding within 3 months (90 days) prior to procedure. 13. A known contraindication or hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation regimens, or inability to be anticoagulated for the study procedure. 14. Recent CVA clinically confirmed (by neurologist) or neuroimaging confirmed stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (180 days) of the procedure. 15. Estimated life expectancy &lt; 1 year 16. Expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of tricuspid regurgitation 17. Currently participating in another investigational cardiac device study. Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials. 18 .Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 months (180 days) of procedure. 19. Patients with TR secondary to trauma of the tricuspid valve, a history of tricuspid valve endocarditis or carcinoid syndrome. 20. Patients with signs or symptoms of SVC syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis not felt due to passive congestion from TR. 21: Subject unable to personally provide legally effective informed consent</criteria>
