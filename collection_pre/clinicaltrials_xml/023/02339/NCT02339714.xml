	<brief_summary>A multi-centre clinical trial done by us（ISRCEN90807007）showed that active acupuncture had significantly greater effect on symptoms of allergic rhinitis than either sham acupuncture or no active treatment. The object of that study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. As an explanatory research, acupuncture was defined as the only intervention for treatment group and sham acupuncture, no active treatment as its control groups. Besides, acupuncture combined moxibustion showed better and longer effect than acupuncture on allergic rhinitis patients in our previous pilot study. According to this result, we are taking a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to further evaluate whether acupuncture combined moxibustion is more effective than conventional treatment.</brief_summary>
