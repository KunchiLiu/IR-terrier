	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the fixed combination (BID) [Brinzolamide 10 mg/mL / Brimonidine 2 mg/mL eyes drops, suspension] to the unfixed combination (BID) [Brinzolamide 10 mg/mL eye drops, suspension plus Brimonidine 2 mg/mL eyes drops, solution] with respect to intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy. This study will take place in China, Taiwan, and Russia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine Fixed Combination BID Compared to Brinzolamide BID Plus Brimonidine BID in Subjects With Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG) or Ocular Hypertension (OHT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is divided into 2 phases conducted in sequence for a total of 6 visits: Phase I (Screening/Eligibility) which includes a Screening Visit, followed by 2 Eligibility Visits (E1 and E2) and Phase II (Treatment/Follow-up) which includes 3 visits at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. Following washout of any IOP-lowering medication, subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both Eligibility visits and had IOP measurements within the specified range during this period will be randomized to Phase II.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension insufficiently controlled on monotherapy or currently on multiple IOPlowering medications; Mean IOP measurements within guidelines specified in the protocol. Must not be &gt; 36 mmHg at any time point; Able to understand and sign an informed consent form; Other protocolspecified inclusion criteria may apply. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, test positive for pregnancy, intend to become pregnant during the study period, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods throughout the study; Severe central visual field loss in either eye; Unable to safely discontinue all IOPlowering ocular medication(s) for a minimum of 5 (± 1) to 28 (± 1) days prior to E1 Visit; Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease; Ocular trauma within the past 6 months; Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 3 months; Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment; Bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (equivalent to approximately 0.60 logMAR, 20/80 Snellen, or 0.25 decimal); Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may preclude the administration of αadrenergic agonist and/or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI); Intraocular surgery within the past 6 months; Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months; Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry; Any conditions including severe illness which would make the Subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study; History of active, severe, unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, hepatic, or renal disease that would preclude safe administration of a topical αadrenergic agonist or CAI; Recent (within 4 weeks of the E1 Visit) use of highdose (&gt; 1 g daily) salicylate therapy; Current or anticipated treatment with any psychotropic drugs that augment adrenergic response (eg, desipramine, amitriptyline); Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI); Concurrent use of glucocorticoids administered by any route; Therapy with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit; Hypersensitivity to αadrenergic agonist drugs, topical or oral CAIs, sulfonamide derivatives, or to any component of the study medications; Less than 30 days stable dosing regimen before the Screening Visit of any medications (excluding IOPlowering treatments) or substances administered by any route and used on a chronic basis that may affect IOP, including but not limited to βadrenergic blocking agents; Use of any additional topical or systemic ocular hypotensive medication during the study; Other protocolspecified exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
