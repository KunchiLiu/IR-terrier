	<brief_summary>This multicentre randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate a new breast reconstruction technique- autologous fat transfer (AFT). Female patients with breast cancer schedule to receive a mastectomy (or having undergone mastectomy in the past) will be randomized to undergo breast reconstruction with either AFT (intervention group) or reconstruction with implants (control group). AFT will be evaluated in terms of quality of life, aesthetic result, complications, oncological safety and cost-effectiveness.</brief_summary>
