	<brief_summary>Patients with locally confined prostate adenocarcinoma (clinical stage T1c - T2bN0M0, Gleason score 7, PSA 20 ng/ml) are assigned to one of two treatment arms. Low risk patients (T1c-T2a and PSA &lt;10 ng/ml and Gleason Score 6 or less) will receive 5 fractions of 8.0 Gy for a total of 40 Gy. Intermediate risk patients (T2b or PSA &gt;10 ng/ml orGleason Score 7) will receive 1.8 Gy of IMRT for 25 fractions over 5 weeks for a total of 45 Gy. They will then receive a boost consisting of 4, 5.5 Gy fractions after IMRT for a total of 22 Gy.</brief_summary>
