	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this phase II study is to comparing the SBRT and IMRT. The hypothesis for each arm is that the probability of the change in EPIC HRQOL scores (1-year minus baseline) is less than (or equal to) an acceptable limit. If it can be shown that either arm is tolerable in terms of patient-reported outcome (PRO) then that hypofractionated regimen will be considered for further use in a phase III study.</brief_summary>
