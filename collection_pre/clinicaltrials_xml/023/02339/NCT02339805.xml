	<brief_summary>This is a prospective descriptive monocentric study whose purpose is to describe the clonal evolution of the mutational pattern in cfDNA of a cohort of patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (DLBCL) before, during and after standard treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Minimal Residual Disease in DLBCL From Cell-free Circulating DNA by NGS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determinate and to describe the clonal evolution, 30 DLBCL cases with available matched tumor DNA and plasma will be collected and analyzed by routinely applicable next generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of diagnosis, at mid treatment, at the end of treatment and at 12 months after diagnosis.</detailed_description>
