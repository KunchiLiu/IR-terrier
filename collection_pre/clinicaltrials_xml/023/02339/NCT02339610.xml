	<brief_title>Evaluation of Post-Operative Recovery in ATTUNEÂ® Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-comparative, non-controlled study. A sample size of N=200 subjects will be implanted at up to 4 sites in the Netherlands. Each site is expected to implant approximately 50 Subjects (50 knees). This study allows the participating surgeon to choose the type of ATTUNE implant they would ordinarily use in standard practice. Both resurfaced patellae and non-resurfaced patellae are permitted in this investigation; consistent with the surgeons standard of care. Subjects will receive one of four available implants: cruciate retaining fixed bearing (CR FB), cruciate retaining rotating platform (CR RP), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (PS FB), and posterior stabilized rotating platform (PS RP).</detailed_description>
