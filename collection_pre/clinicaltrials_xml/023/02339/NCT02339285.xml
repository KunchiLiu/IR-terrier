	<brief_title>Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central Hypothesis: Non-invasive brain stimulation that suppresses alpha oscillation reduces cortical hyperactivity and causes a clinical improvement Aim 1: To conduct a pilot clinical trial to establish feasibility and to collect first effectiveness data for the use of tACS to renormalize pathological alpha oscillations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-pfc) of unmedicated patients with MDD by comparing MADRS scores from baseline and one month follow up. Aim 2: Compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. Collect EEG data at the one month follow up visit using this data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers.</detailed_description>
