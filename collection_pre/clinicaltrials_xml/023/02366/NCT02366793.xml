	<brief_summary>The potential consequences after breast cancer surgery are joint pain and sensitive disorders, the main sign of which is alterations in shoulder mobility. Global kinesitherapy has been shown to be effective at increasing shoulder range of motion restriction. However, literature does not consider specific manual therapy techniques, which means peripheral nerves and articular capsule have not been taken into account. These two tissues are potentially damaged structures during surgery and they are main responsible for shoulder range of motion restriction The main objective of this study is to pilot the effectiveness of accessory joint and nerve mobilization techniques in order to get an overview of the articular capsule and nerve dysfunctions involvement in shoulder motion restriction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accessory Joint and Neural Mobilizations in Shoulder After Breast Cancer Surgery. Randomized Clinical Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The potential consequences after breast cancer surgery are joint pain and sensitive disorders, the main sign of which is alterations in shoulder mobility. Design: Prospective randomized and double-blind pilot trial. Objective: To pilot the effectiveness of accessory joint and nerve mobilization techniques in order to get an overview of the joint capsule and nerve involvement in shoulder motion restriction. Participants: 18 women who were undergoing unilateral breast cancer surgery and axillary lymph node dissection. Setting: WomenÂ´s Health Research Group at Physical Therapy Department of University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain. Intervention: accessory joint mobilization versus neural mobilization. Follow-up: Six-month follow-up. Key outcomes: Range of motion, sensitive disorder, pain and upper limb functionality.</detailed_description>
