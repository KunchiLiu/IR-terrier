	<brief_summary>This registry is intended as an observational, post-marketing surveillance tool. The registry allows collection of baseline demographics and user experience of the commercially available MUSE system. Data collection aims to aggregate a minimum of 3 years follow-up on a large number of subjects during use outside the constraints of a prescribed clinical study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler (MUSE) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The registry evaluates the MUSE System which creates a transoral anterior fundoplication for the treatment of GERD. The system enables the operator to staple the fundus of the stomach to the esophagus approximately 3cm superior to the Z-line in 2 or more locations. The procedure is performed transorally under general anesthesia. The procedural result is anatomically and functionally similar to standard anterior fundoplication (Dor-Thal operation). The staples are standard, 4.8mm titanium surgical staples. Each application of the device fires a quintuplet of staples (5) in three staggered rows. Anti-retching medications at the time of the procedure are essential. The study population will be primarily adults aged 18-70 years selected by the investigators based on SAGES guidelines for fundoplication and consideration of the indications and contraindications listed in the device Instructions for Use (IFU). Follow-up data will be collected at 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years post procedure.</detailed_description>
