	<brief_title>Study of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of NRX-1074 in Normal Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NRX-1074 is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor functional partial agonist with efficacy in animal models of affective disorders including major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral (PO) ascending doses of NRX-1074 as evidenced by the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), changes in serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, changes in physical examination findings, psychotomimetic findings and subject-reported symptoms.</detailed_description>
