	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective, non-interventional clinical study is to assess the clinical validity of a number of markers (including Heparin Binding Protein (HBP), Procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), White cell count (WCC) and lactate) for indicating the presence of organ dysfunction, or outcome, of patients with organ dysfunctions following emergency department admission or hospitalization. Secondary objectives are to identify novel putative biomarkers and to identify risk factors for negative long-term effects of acute critical illness The HBP assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitative determination of Heparin Binding Protein in human plasma.</brief_summary>
