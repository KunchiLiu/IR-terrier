	<brief_summary>The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States (US) is relatively low. However, immigrant populations in the US from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have substantially higher prevalence than the general population and are consequently at a significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Indeed, the age-adjusted incidence rates for HCC in the US have tripled from 1975 to 2005. As the population demographics have changed, the 2000 US census estimated the number of Somalis in Minnesota at 25,000 but current estimates put the number at around 50,000 due to primary refugee arrivals as well as secondary immigration from other states. There is no available data for Somali immigrants in the US on HBV and HCV prevalence, HBV and HCV genotypes/subgenotypes, and genetic and immunologic risk factors predisposing Somalis to HBV and HCV and the subsequent development of HCC. Therefore. this study will fill these gaps in the Somali population to understand the relative importance of HBV and HCV infections in causation of HCC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Chronic Hepatitis B Infections Among Somali Immigrants in Minnesota Through Community-wide Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To recruit a cohort of Somali immigrants for screening for chronic HBV and and HCV infection and education on prevention and treatment of hepatitis B. The investigators will specifically: 1. Establish a community-based program to recruit Somali African immigrant individuals in Minnesota for screening for hepatitis B and HCV 2. Establish partnerships with Somali African community organizations and physicians to enhance screening and education about prevention and treatment of hepatitis B and HCV and their sequelae, including HCC. Specific Aim 2: To characterize viral factors that contribute to chronic inflammation, cirrhosis and HCC in Somali immigrants. The investigators will specifically: 1. Determine the HBV and HCV viral status of participants using serologic tests and viral load 2. Determine the viral genotypes and viral mutations and their correlation to measures of liver injury, immune function, liver cirrhosis, and HCC. Specific Aim 3: To characterize host factors that contribute to chronic inflammation, cirrhosis and HCC in Somali immigrants. The investigators will specifically: 1. Determine whether variations in host immune phenotypes as measured by a novel multicolor flow cytometry assay correlate to clinical measures of inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC 2. Determine whether variations in host genotypes in genes known to affect the liver disease phenotype correlate to measures of liver disease severity.</detailed_description>
