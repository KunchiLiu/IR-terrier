	<brief_summary>Breast milk is a unique and unmatched nutritional and non-nutritive source of bioactive factors for the health and development of infants.Colostrum, which is produced in low quantities for the first 3 to 4 days after birth, is rich in immunologic components and developmental factors. Breastfeeding difficulties during the first days of life of an infant are common. Moreover, not all infants can be directly fed at the breast. Therefore, breast milk feeding at this early stage is initiated and promoted by the expression of breast milk either manually or by use of a pump. Whether the method of milk expression at this stage has a qualitative impact on colostrum is currently unknown. The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare the effect of manual expression with electric pump expression upon the macronutrient composition of breast milk.</brief_summary>
