	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about transfusion of a human blood component called plasma in patients who have liver problems. Patients are asked to be in this study because they have liver disease and therefore may require the transfusion of plasma. The dose of plasma required to reach certain blood clotting laboratory targets is usually determined by clinicians. Due to the complexity of the patient's blood clotting disorder, determining the appropriate dose of plasma is very difficult. The investigators have developed a dosing table based on information from other patients with liver disease and the investigators are testing it to see if it is a more accurate dosing tool then clinician chosen dosing of plasma in patients with liver disease who need one or more plasma transfusions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Validation of a Plasma Transfusion Dosing Algorithm in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinicians currently transfuse plasma to International Normalized Ratio (INR) targets without an understanding of the dose response characteristics of plasma in bleeding patients with liver disease. Epidemiologic studies show that INR is infrequently corrected to target INR values after clinician chosen plasma transfusion doses in patients with liver disease. Plasma transfusion is frequently given to patients prior to procedures and during active bleeding in this patient population though there are no dosing guidelines to aid clinicians in reaching INR targets in patients with liver disease. Previous studies suggest that patients with liver disease may need more plasma then patients without liver disease to correct any given pre-transfusion INR to the same post-INR target. Current physician dosing of plasma is variable and rarely successful at reaching stated INR targets. The INR thresholds commonly used triggers for plasma transfusion by Gastro-Intestinal (GI), Hepatology and critical care physicians at our institution range from 1.5-3.0 in bleeding or pre-procedural patients with liver disease representing tremendous variability. When we evaluated plasma transfusion dosing practices in bleeding patients with liver disease over 8 years, we demonstrated that these same physicians rarely met stated theoretical targets. Over or under dosing plasma in these patient may lead to serious clinical complications.</detailed_description>
