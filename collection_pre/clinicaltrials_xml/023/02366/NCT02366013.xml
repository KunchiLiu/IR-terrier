	<brief_title>Trial of the Safety and Immunogenicity of an Oral, Replicating Ad26 Vectored HIV-1 Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a phase I dose-escalation randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of rcAd26.MOS1.HIV-Env, an oral replicating adenovirus 26 vector vaccine in healthy HIV-1 uninfected adults. The vaccine will be administered orally at a single time point (Day 0) at one of four dose levels depending on study group: 1 x 10^8 virus particles (vp), 1 x 10^9 vp, 1 x 10^10 vp and 1 x 10^11 vp. Volunteers will be randomized to vaccine: placebo in a 5:1 ratio in each group. Volunteers will be screened up to 56 days before vaccination and will be followed for 12 months after vaccination. Because the vaccine is replication competent, volunteers will be housed in an isolation unit from day -2 through day 9. Household contacts will also be enrolled and tested for possible transmission.</detailed_description>
