	<brief_summary>The purpose of this descriptive and exploratory pilot study is to investigate: (1) sagittal plane hip kinematics and kinetics and (2) metabolic consumption/cost, for bilateral transfemoral walking with passive prostheses versus powered prostheses. The pilot study will collect data from three subjects with bilateral transfemoral amputations. Differences in kinetics, kinematics, and oxygen consumption/cost when comparing passive and powered components may indicate benefits for clinical application of powered devices for persons with lower limb amputation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male or female All causes of limb amputation: congenital, trauma, vascular, limb salvage, infection. All transfemoral residual limb lengths: joint disarticulation, long, medium, short, very short. Subjects currently walk with entirely passive type prostheses daily. Subjects walk without assistive devices OR with single point cane. Highactivity level walkers Ages &lt; 18 or &gt; 45 years Medical comorbidities or existing conditions that may impede the subjects ability to complete the protocol excluding the amputations. Current medications or pharmaceutical interventions that may impede the subjects ability to complete the protocol. Any powered prosthetic component or prosthesis, including but not exclusive to: Ossur Proprio Foot, BiOM or BiOM T2 System Foot, Ossur Power Knee, Ossur Symbionic Leg. Subjects requiring a walker, crutches, quad cane, or other assistive devices excluding a single point cane. Lowactivity level walkers</criteria>
