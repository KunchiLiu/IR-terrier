	<brief_summary>Given that glutamate carboxylation or decarboxylation is key to the metabolic role of osteocalcin (at least in mouse models) and that carboxylation is vitamin K dependent, it is critical to isolate the effect of vitamin K manipulation on carboxylation of osteocalcin and its subsequent effect on glucose metabolism in clinical trials. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults is to determine whether eight weeks of daily supplementation with vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) can improve markers in blood associated with diabetes risk.</brief_summary>
