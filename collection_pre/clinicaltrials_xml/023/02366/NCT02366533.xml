	<brief_summary>The goal of ATN 093 is to determine program-level factors associated with the effectiveness of SMILE in Caring for Youth Linkage-to-Care (LTC) program network at the 15 Adolescent Medicine Trial Units (AMTU). This will be accomplished by evaluating and categorizing the various LTC programs at the AMTUs and then examining the association between the LTC program characteristics (providers, practices, and systems) and the proportion of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected youth, ages 12-24 years old, inclusive, linked to care and maintained in care. As such, this study focuses on LTC programs at the AMTUs as the unit of analysis and not the youth themselves.</brief_summary>
