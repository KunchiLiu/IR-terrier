	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the incidence of major bleeding (including clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding) events in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer with apixaban 2.5 mg BID compared to current standard of care, subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg QD for 28 days post surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Apixaban (Eliquis) Versus Enoxaparin (Lovenox) for Thromboprophylaxis in Women With Suspected Pelvic Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apixaban (Eliquis) is an oral anticoagulant for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. It is advantageous as there is no need to perform routine blood monitoring tests including, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and Factor Xa, to determine clotting in participants receiving treatment. Several studies have shown the efficacy of apixaban for the treatment and prevention of VTE. We anticipate that the same efficacy could be replicated in the prevention of VTE in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer. An oral-anticoagulant for standard treatment for prevention of VTE outcomes following surgery could help improve the surgical mortalities associated with gynecologic oncology surgical patients, improve patient adherence for outpatient treatment, and reduce VTE surveillance and outcomes.</detailed_description>
