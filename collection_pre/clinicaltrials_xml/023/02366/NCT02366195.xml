	<brief_summary>The study is a phase 2, multi centered, single arm study designed to evaluate the correlation between CD8+ cell density and objective response rate in subjects with unresected stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of talimogene laherparepvec.</brief_summary>
