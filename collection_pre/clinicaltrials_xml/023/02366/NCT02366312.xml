	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how well a daily dose of 150 mg of Erivedge (vismodegib) reduces Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) size, and to evaluate the safety of this dose. Erivedge is FDA-approved for use in adults with a specific type of skin cancer. However, the drug is experimental for patients with KCOT.</brief_summary>
