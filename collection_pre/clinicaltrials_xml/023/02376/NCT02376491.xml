	<brief_summary>This trial will compare innovating stimulation parameters, intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation, to the standard high frequency stimulation protocol. The Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, targeted by MRI navigation will be the site of stimulation in both treatment conditions. The study seeks to determine if there is a superiority in therapeutic efficacy with iTBS protocol compared to conventional one.</brief_summary>
