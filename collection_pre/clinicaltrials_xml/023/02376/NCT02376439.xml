	<brief_title>Discordance of Obesity in Adolescent Sibilngs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research studies the energy balance behaviors (usual eating, physical activity, sedentary) and non-shared experiences of siblings discordant for weight (one sibling is lean the other is overweight). To accomplish this, siblings attend four laboratory sessions where they consume one of two types of kool-aid, smell the pizza, or rest quietly. Siblings then eat a dinner meal. Siblings also wear an activity monitor for one week and record their physical activity and sedentary activities in a habit book.</detailed_description>
