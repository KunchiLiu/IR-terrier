	<brief_summary>This is a study of pregnant women undergoing a cesarean delivery. It will compare their microcirculation before and after the anesthetic. Microcirculation means blood flow to the extremely small blood vessels in the body. It will also look at the differences in microcirculation of participants who receive an infusion of phenylephrine compared to participants who don't. The investigators hypothesize that spinal anesthesia will reduce the vascular density and proportion of perfused vessels.</brief_summary>
