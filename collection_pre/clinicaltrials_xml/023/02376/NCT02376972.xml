To note that if the Pap test will be performed at baseline, the result will be known after the randomization visit: patients may be enrolled without this result Any condition or circumstance that would prevent completion of the study or interfere with analysis of study results, including a history of drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness or noncompliance with treatments or visits, immunological (including HIV infection), hematological or neoplastic disease (including all cervical neoplastic diseases) Cervical cryotherapy, loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP), cervical laser, or any other ablative or excisional cervical procedures within the last 3 months Vaginal laser within the last 3 months Patient with clinically relevant pathological laboratory values Known hypersensitivity to rifaximin Known hypersensitivity to excipients present in rifaximin, placebo or metronidazole formulations Known hypersensitivity to metronidazole, either orally or topically administered, or any forms of parabens Concurrent anticoagulant therapy with coumadin or warfarin Menstruating or anticipated menstruation/withdrawal bleed at Entry Visit/V1 and during the drug administration Patient who received antifungal or antimicrobial therapy (systemic or intravaginal) within 14 days of randomization Patient who have participated in another clinical trial or have taken an investigational drug within the last 4 weeks prior screening Patient who has taken disulfuram within the last 14 days Withdrawal of informed consent Patient previously randomized in this study</criteria>
