	<brief_summary>Mental healthcare is severely neglected in resource-limited countries, including Nepal. Nepali clinicians typically spend little time during their clinical education on mental diseases. The authors conducted a needs assessment of Primary Care Providers (PCPs) at a district level hospital in Nepal using focus group discussions, which revealed clinical deficiencies in providing mental healthcare. The authors will develop and implement computer-based educational modules to provide training in mental health for Nepali PCPs. Effectiveness of PCPs' comfort level, knowledge and skills in evaluating, diagnosing and managing mental illness will be assessed by administering pre- and post-tests. Acceptability, feasibility and PCPs' comfort-level with the educational modality will also be assessed. Data from the tests will be analyzed using paired t-tests. Additionally, data from the focus group discussions will be further analyzed to assess for themes that might be common among PCPs in other parts of rural Nepal, or regions where access to psychiatrists is very limited.</brief_summary>
