	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the proposed phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX®B/E combination regimen. Though both DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX®B/E and the combination of the two vaccines have been evaluated in humans and have shown to be safe and well tolerated, this is the first time the combination regimen is being evaluated in HIV-1 uninfected African populations with and without S. mansoni. The secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of S. mansoni infection on the immunogenicity of the combination of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine regimen. Successful vaccination against most viruses requires efficient Th1 response. There is evidence that helminth infections skew the host immune system of human and animals to T-helper type 2 (Th2) and induce immunosuppression. Therefore, there is a potential that helminth infected populations may not generate the desired immune responses to vaccines designed to drive Th1-type and cytotoxic T-cell responses. Furthermore, the influence of helminth infections on the development of protective antibody responses remains unclear. Limited data in animal models suggests that worm infections reduced efficacy of vaccines. The proposed vaccine trial will generate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data of a vaccination regimen with simultaneous administration of a candidate HIV DNA vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123) and a gp120 protein vaccine (AIDSVAX®B/E). This will be the first HIV vaccine trial to prospectively evaluate the impact of the S. mansoni infection on safety and immune responses to HIV vaccines.</brief_summary>

History or evidence of autoimmune disease. 13. Positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), positive for antibodies to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or active syphilis. 14. Receipt of blood or blood products within the previous 6 months 15. History of severe allergic reactions to any substance requiring hospitalization or emergency medical care (e.g. StevenJohnson syndrome, bronchospasm or hypotension) 16. Prior or current participation in another investigational agent trial 17. Current antituberculosis (TB) prophylaxis or therapy 18. If female, currently pregnant (positive serum or urine pregnancy test), planning to get pregnant in the next 9months or lactating 19. History or evidence of any systemic disease or any acute or chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the volunteer's safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine</criteria>
