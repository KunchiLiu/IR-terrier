	<brief_summary>This study will examine the safety profile of SEA-CD40. The study will test increasing doses of SEA-CD40 given at least every 3 weeks to small groups of patients. The goal is to find the highest dose of SEA-CD40 that can be given to patients that does not cause unacceptable side effects. Different dose regimens may also be evaluated to see if more SEA-CD40 can be given within a treatment cycle while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects, biomarkers of response, and antitumor activity of SEA-CD40 will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of SEA-CD40 in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in the following parts: Part A: Dose-regimen finding for solid tumors -- Dose-escalation, and possible dose-interval modification to lengthen the treatment cycle, to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the optimal biological dose (OBD) regimens in patients with solid tumors. The ability to increase the dose intensity (to give additional doses within a treatment cycle) may be evaluated. Part B: Solid tumor expansion cohorts -- Disease-specific solid tumor expansion cohorts may be enrolled where patients will be treated with doses at or below the MTD and/or OBD determined in Part A. Part C: Dose-regimen finding for lymphomas -- Dose-escalation, and possible dose-interval modification to lengthen the treatment cycle, to define the MTD and/or the OBD regimens in patients with lymphomas. The ability to increase the dose intensity (to give additional doses within a treatment cycle) may be evaluated. Part D: Lymphoma expansion cohorts -- Disease-specific lymphoma expansion cohorts may be enrolled where patients will be treated with doses at or below the MTD and/or OBD determined in Part C.</detailed_description>
