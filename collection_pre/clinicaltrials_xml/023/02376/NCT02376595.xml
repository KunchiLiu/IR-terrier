	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is characterize the dose-effect relationship of rocuronium bromide at the adductor pollicis and masseter muscles using an pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model. The hypothesis is that masseter muscle has a greater sensitivity to the neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium), faster onset and slower recovery profile than the adductor pollicis muscle.</brief_summary>
