	<brief_summary>A recent study with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin showed an improvement in the urinary albumin creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Gutzwiller et. Al. have shown that GLP-1 increases renal Na secretion and inhibits renal H secretion, further indicating some direct renal effects of GLP-1. Therefore, it seems likely that treatment with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin evolves several beneficial effects on microvascular and endothelial function beyond glucose control which most probably have an impact on the progression of renal and retinal microvascular disease. The objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of Linagliptin in comparison to placebo on the UACR in patients with high blood pressure and an increased albumin excretion. Numerous, equivalent endothelial, renal, and retinal parameters serve as objectives of the study. All study parameters will be handled in an exploratory sense for the generation of models to further discuss the role of DPP-IV inhibition on renal and retinal physiology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Linagliptin on Endothelial- , Renal-, and Retinal Function in Patients With Hypertension and Albuminuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal tissue damage and an increase in the albumin excretion rate is a strong predictor for the development and progression of endothelial dysfunction and the development of microvascular and/or macrovascular complications. Increased blood pressure as well as increased glucose levels were found to impair renal- and retinal function, and a close association in the incidence and progression rate of retinopathy and nephropathy could be observed. Endothelial dysfunction and alterations in microvascular blood flow are early pathogenetic features in the development of renal and retinal tissue damage as found in patients with arterial hypertension and / or diabetes mellitus. A couple of studies have shown that urinary albumin excretion is associated with morphological and functional alterations in retinal microvascular blood flow. In patients with arterial hypertension blood pressure lowering treatment were shown to decrease the albumin excretion rate and to improve endothelial function of the retinal vasculature. Recently DPP-IV Inhibitors have been introduced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Beside the metabolic effects of this drug class, several pleiotropic effects beyond metabolic control were documented in numerous studies, and are the topic of ongoing clinical research. Treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors was found to improve myocardial and endothelial function, to improve blood lipids, to lower blood pressure and to improve markers of renal function. GLP-1 receptors in vessels, kidney and the heart might account for those glucose independent effects of GLP-1. However, it is also conceivable that DPP-IV inhibition might exert vascular effects independent from GLP-1. In vitro studies demonstrated that DPP-IV is expressed in endothelial cells, and the inhibition of DPP-IV reduced the microvascular tone through direct mediation of the nitric oxide system. Therefore, it seems conceivable that the glucose independent effects of DPP-IV inhibition might be mediated through GLP-1 receptor signaling and /or direct inhibition of the enzyme DPP-IV in vascular, renal, or retinal cells. A recent study with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin showed an improvement in the urinary albumin creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Gutzwiller et. Al. have shown that GLP-1 increases renal Na secretion and inhibits renal H secretion, further indicating some direct renal effects of GLP-1. Therefore, it seems likely that treatment with the DPP-IV inhibitor Linagliptin evolves several beneficial effects on microvascular and endothelial function beyond glucose control which most probably have an impact on the progression of renal and retinal microvascular disease.
