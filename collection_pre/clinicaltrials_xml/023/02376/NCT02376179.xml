	<brief_summary>We have devised a simple method to continuously measure the endotracheal tube cuff pressure (CP) using an invasive pressure monitoring setup (IPMS), which is used routinely in the operating room to monitor arterial or central venous pressures. We have previously confirmed both in vitro and in vivo (previous IRB approved protocol), a clinically applicable agreement of the IPMS readings with the values obtained from a standard manometer (gold standard). In the current study, we will prospectively evaluate the relationship between the patient's head position and CP in patients undergoing otolaryngological surgery and also measure the oxygen and nitrous oxide saturation in the oropharynx.</brief_summary>
