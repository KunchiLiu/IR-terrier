Visual field defects consistent with glaucomatous optic nerve damage with at least one of the following two findings: 1. On pattern deviation (PD), there exists a cluster of 3 or more points in an expected location of the visual field depressed below the 5% level, at least 1 of which is depressed below the 1% level; 2. Glaucoma hemifield test "outside normal limits." 6. Presence of any ocular pathology except for cataract 7. Narrow angle 8. History of leukemia, dementia or multiple sclerosis 9.

Subjects able to understand the written informed consent and willing to participate as evidenced by signing the informed consent 3. BCVA 20/40 or better in the study eye 4. Visual field defects consistent with glaucomatous optic nerve damage based on with at least one of the following two findings: 1. On pattern deviation (PD), there exists a cluster of 3 or more points in an expected location of the visual field depressed below the 5% level, at least 1 of which is depressed below the 1% level; 2. Glaucoma hemifield test "outside normal limits." 5. Glaucomatous optic nerve damage as evidenced by any of the following optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer structural abnormalities: 1. Diffuse thinning, focal narrowing, or notching of the optic disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles with or without disc hemorrhage; 2. Localized abnormalities of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, especially at the inferior or superior poles; or 3. Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural tissue Exclusion Criteria for Glaucoma Group 1. Subjects previously enrolled in either the Maestro AP study or the Maestro2 study 2. Subjects unable to tolerate ophthalmic imaging 3. Subject with ocular media not sufficiently clear to obtain acceptable OCT images 4.
