	<brief_summary>It is common practice to leave a chest drainage catheter after lung surgical resections to manage air leaks. The air leakage will usually stop in the initial postoperative days, but in a few patients, it will last for a longer period of time, preventing the removal of the chest tube that can lead to patient discomfort, increased likelihood to develop postoperative complications and longer length of hospital stay. Pleurodesis is an effective method to address postoperative air leak which consists in injecting an irritating solution into the chest cavity. This is not performed regularly after lung resections for different reasons including associated pain, costs, and fear of infections. Pleurodesis with hyperosmolar glucose solution have been used for years with good results in some Asian countries because of its simplicity and low cost. Its effectiveness for pleurodesis has been reported in cases of spontaneous pneumothorax and chylothorax, but its efficiency to stop air leaks in the postoperative period remains to be defined.</brief_summary>
