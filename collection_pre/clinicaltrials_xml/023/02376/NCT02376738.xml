	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the role of leukocyte activation in coronary artery disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Activation of Leukocytes in Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The primary aim of REAL CAD is to determine regional differences of leukocyte activation in different vascular beds in vivo. 2. The secondary aim is to investigate differences in leukocyte activation between diabetic and CAD subjects and patients suffering from both. 3. The third aim is to investigate the relationship between complement components, triglycerides and leukocyte activation markers in order to gain more insight into the causative processes leading to activation of leukocytes. 4. The fourth aim is to get more insight in the MBL genotypes and serum levels of CAD and/or diabetic patients and the 'healthy' groups included in our study.</detailed_description>
