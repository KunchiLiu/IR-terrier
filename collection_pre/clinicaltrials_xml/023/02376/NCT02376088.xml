	<brief_summary>Patients with GD often present with glucose dysregulation, which, according to most studies, is associated with islet β-cell dysfunctions, enhanced gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance (IR). Current studies focus mainly on IR, and a few that investigate islet β-cell functions show inconsistent results. This study examined the characteristics of glucose dysregulation in Chinese patients with GD, and furthermore evaluated the effects of thyroid dysfunction on islet β-cell functions and subsequently the carbohydrate metabolism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thyroid dysfunction is closely associated with glucoregulation. Carbohydrate metabolism can be affected with decreased levels of thyroid hormone (TH), even more so with an elevated TH level. Epidemiological data shows that 2%-57% of patients with Graves' Disease (GD) present with glucose dysregulation, which might also be related to the changes in islet β-cell functions in patients with GD. The incidence of GD has comparable variations geographically, with possibly different underlying mechanisms, such as an excessive intake of iodine resulting in an aggravation of autoimmune reactions from thyroid and consequently an increment in incidence of GD. The same might also be true in glucoregulation and islet β-cell functions in patients with GD. This study aims to examine the characteristics of glucoregulation and islet β-cell functions in patients with GD in different areas of China, using early-phase insulin secretion index (△I30/△G30), glucose area under curve(GAUC) and insulin area under curve(INSAUC).</detailed_description>
