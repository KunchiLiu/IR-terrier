	<brief_title>Biliary Drainage in Patients With Duodenal Metal Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multinational multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes of endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with a duodenal SEMS. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD), including choledochoduodenostomy, hepaticogastrostomy, antegrade biliary stenting or a combination, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stenting are to be compared. Specifically, the outcomes are to be evaluated according to the timing of distal MBO in relation to GOO and the location of GOO.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who underwent endoscopic placement of a duodenal SEMS for nonresectable malignant GOO. Patients who underwent endoscopic biliary drainage for nonresectable MBO. MBO was located ≥ 2 cm from the bifurcation. Patients who could be followed up more than three months after completion of both biliary drainage and duodenal SEMS placement. Age ≥20 years. Irrespective of sex and a primary disease. Patients who underwent surgical bypass for GOO. Patients who underwent percutaneous and surgical biliary drainage prior to the placement of duodenal SEMS. Patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy (BillrothII reconstruction, RouxenY reconstruction, etc.). Patients who would not give a consent to the report of their own data. Patients considered ineligible for inclusion in the study by an investigator for other reasons.</criteria>
