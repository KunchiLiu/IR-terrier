	<brief_summary>The purpose of this current study is to evaluate whether the size of the endotracheal tube (ETT) that is used impacts the intracuff pressure that occurs when the airway is sealed. If there is excessive pressure in the cuff of a smaller ETT when it is inflated, there may be inherent risks associated with the use of a cuffed endotracheal tube that is less than the appropriate size. The investigators believe that the size of the tube chosen has an impact on the characteristics of the inflated cuff and hence the intracuff pressure and the sealing pressure are variable.</brief_summary>
