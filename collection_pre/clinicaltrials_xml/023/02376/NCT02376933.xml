	<brief_title>Vertebral Augmentation and Radiotherapy of Collapse Spinal Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study quantifies the reduction of pain and changes in quality of life associated with vertebral augmentation. This study is conducted in patients with metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma involving the spine. This study addresses the value of vertebral augmentation in combination with radiotherapy in the setting of cancer to the spine. The patient's pain, overall quality of life, and fracture development/avoidance will be compared to patients treated only with radiotherapy in the past.</detailed_description>
