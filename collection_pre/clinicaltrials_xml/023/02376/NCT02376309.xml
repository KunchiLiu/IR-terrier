	<brief_summary>A decrease in muscle mass can have a profound impact on quality of life, as it can lead to decreased strength, insulin resistance, lower basal metabolic rate and obesity. With this study we investigate whether ingesting leucine or getting a ND injection will reduce the loss of muscle mass and strength.</brief_summary>
