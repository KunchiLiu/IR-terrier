	<brief_summary>Most blunt aortic injuries occur in the proximal proximal descending aorta causing acute transection of this vessel. Generally, surgical repair of the ruptured segment of aorta is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and in this view endovascular treatment seems to be a valid and safer alternative. Aim of this study is to review the experience of a single center with endovascular approach for the treatment of acute traumatic rupture of descending thoracic aorta</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endovascular Repair for the Descending Thoracic Aorta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From April 2002 to November 2014, patients referred to our Department with a diagnosis of acute transection of thoracic aorta will be studied by preoperative Computed Tomography (CT) evaluation in order to perform thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with left subclavian artery coverage. Then patients will be followed up with clinical and instrumental (CT, Duplex ultrasound) controls at discharge, 1, 3 and 6 months and yearly thereafter. We will evaluate the presence of major and minor neurological complications, episodes of left arm claudication, cardiovascular, respiratory and bleeding complications. Furthermore we will evaluate the technical success of the technique evaluating the onset of failure, collapse, leak or distal migration of the graft.</detailed_description>
