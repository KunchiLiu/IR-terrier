	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess imaging methods including Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) and perfusion for the cancer that has spread to the spine. The study aims to see if using these methods will help better see response to treatment with radiation in patients with spine metastases from any solid cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Adult patients 18 years of age or older Known pathological diagnosis of any solid cancer. Metastatic spinal lesions 1 cm or greater in diameter. Patients who are already eligible for and are to be treated with hypofractionated or single dose radiation for their spinal lesions. Note: The patients must have their treatments at MSKCC. Patients with renal failure or history of allergic reaction to Gadavist will be excluded. Patients who would be normally excluded from undergoing an MRI examination as per Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Disease Screening Questionnaire for MRI. Patients with a pacemaker, aneurysm clip or any other condition that would warrant avoidance of a strong magnetic field. Patients with inability to cooperate for an MRI exam due to claustrophobia or high levels of anxiety. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing. Patients with eGFR &lt; 30 are not eligible to higher risk of NSF.</criteria>
