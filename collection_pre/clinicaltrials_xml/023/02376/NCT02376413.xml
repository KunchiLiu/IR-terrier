	<brief_summary>Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the traditional surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients. There are evidences indicating that oncoplastic-BCS (displacement technique) could improve cosmetic outcomes and/or quality of life, and has similar oncological safety as traditional BCS does. However, there are no prospective trial comparing oncoplastic-BCS vs. traditional BCS in terms of cosmetic outcomes and oncological safety. In this study, the investigators are going to address this issue by assigning patients into traditional and oncoplastic-BCS group, based on their preference.</brief_summary>
