	<brief_title>Vitamin Therapy in Concussion Management: A Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, very little data exists on the use of vitamin supplementation to aid in the recovery of concussion. Data previously published shows potential benefit of certain vitamins in the management of migraine headache. These vitamins, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Magnesium, Co-Enzyme Q-10, and Omega-3 fatty acids, at dosages described in the literature, are being used based on the migraine literature findings and anecdotal evidence to help treat complaints of headache in concussion management.</detailed_description>
