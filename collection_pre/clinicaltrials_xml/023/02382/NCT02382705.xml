	<brief_summary>Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive means of visualizing the small bowel. Common indications for CE include obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease like crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and polyposis syndrome. While CE has high diagnostic value for small bowel lesions, a significant limitation of this technology is the finite battery life which results in incomplete examination of the small bowel approximately 16.5% of the time. Numerous attempts of using pharmacological (e.g. prokinetics, purgatives) as well as non-pharmacological measures (e.g. real-time viewer, chewing gum) to improve completion rates, defined by entry of CE into the cecum, led to mixed results. Currently routine use of prokinetics (agents that speeds up gut motility) is not recommended. This study aims to determine whether longer battery of the newer generation capsule endoscopy system improves study completion rate and diagnostic yield.</brief_summary>
