Study objective: 1. The objective of this study is to Identifying the lipid parameter variation when treating patients who have dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes for 3±1 months. 2. After treating patients who have dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes for 3±1 months, identifying the reason why changing method of drug dosage and pharmacotherapy. 3. If the drug dosage and pharmacotherapy have been changed, Identifying the lipid parameter variation when treating patients by altered drugs for 3±1 months,</brief_summary>
