	<brief_title>Effect of Antacid on Bioavailability of Febuxostat After Administration of a Febuxostat 80 mg Extended-Release Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called febuxostat extended-release (XR). Febuxostat XR is being tested to assess if antacids affect how the drug moves throughout the body. This study will look at lab safety and side effects in people who take febuxostat XR. This cross-over study will enroll approximately 36 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment sequences. All participants will receive the following study medications by the end of the study: - Febuxostat XR 80 mg capsules - Maalox Advance Regular Strength liquid containing Aluminum Hydroxide 200 mg, Magnesium Hydroxide 200 mg, and Simethicone 20 mg/5 mL or equivalent All participants will be administered one dose of one or both of the study medications on Day 1 of four separate study periods. This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 84 days. Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic including four 4-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
