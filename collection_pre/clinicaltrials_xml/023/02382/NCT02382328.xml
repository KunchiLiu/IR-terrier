	<brief_title>Alpha Lipoic Acid on Clinical and Electrophysiological Recovery in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Undergoing Surgical Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using an oral supplementation of alpha lipoid acid to improve clinical and electrophysiological recovery after carpal tunnel release surgery. This research is designed as a double blinded clinical trial, with a calculated sample size of 40 patients, divided in two groups of 20 (A placebo, B alpha lipoid acid). All patients will undergo open carpal tunnel release surgery, the procedure will be performed by an expert surgeon. A total of four visits will be performed as follows: T0. baseline 4 weeks before surgery, T1 immediately before surgery, T2: 4 weeks after surgery, T3: 8 weeks after surgery, T4: 12 weeks after surgery. The assessment to be perform on each visit includes: physical examination, Boston Questionary for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Nerve conduction study and ecographic evaluation will be performed on visits T0, T1 and T4. Statistical Analysis: Categorical variables will be assessed as counts and percent frequency and compared using the chi-squared test. All statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS 21.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A two-tailed P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</detailed_description>
