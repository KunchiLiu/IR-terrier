	<brief_summary>The present study grounds on the possible role of hemispheric lateralization in Eating disorders (ED): specifically, hyperactivity of the right frontal regions in Anorexia Nervosa (AN), and hypoactivity of the right frontal regions in Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and food craving behaviors. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that active excitatory tDCS over left prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Anode left/cathode right) may aid in altering/resetting inter-hemispheric balance in AN patients, re-establish control over eating behaviors. On the contrary, active excitatory tDCS over right PFC (Anode right/cathode left) may aid in altering/resetting inter-hemispheric balance in BED patients and people with frequent food cravings, decreasing cravings/appetite binge eating behaviors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design is randomized stratified, double blind, add-on, placebo-controlled. A group of children and adolescents with AN will be selected and randomly assigned to two different conditions: treatment "as usual" plus experimental treatment (active tDCS); treatment "as usual" plus placebo treatment (sham tDCS). Similarly, a group of children and adolescents with Over-weight/Obesity (OW/OB) and BED will be selected and assigned with randomized stratified sampling to the following conditions: treatment "as usual" plus experimental treatment (active tDCS); treatment "as usual" plus placebo treatment (sham tDCS). In this project, the investigators will work to understand whether a brain-based treatment, with the use of tDCS, can improve the outcome of patients with eating disorders. The investigators will test whether tDCS treatment produces improvements in under-eating and over-eating diseases, such us AN and OW/OB with BED and food craving. Our overarching goal is to provide a scientific foundation for devising new rehabilitation strategies in ED.</detailed_description>
