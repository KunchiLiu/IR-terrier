	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether the A-V sequential pacing strategy shown to effectively reduce blood pressure in a dog model of hypertension also reduces blood pressure acutely in patients with hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg) despite medical treatments.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient has hypertension with systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg despite at least one antihypertensive medication. 2. Patient has a clinical indication for a pacemaker or an electrophysiology study involving introduction of transvenous electrophysiology catheters to the right atrium and/or right ventricle. 3. Patient is willing and able to provide informed consent 1. Patient is in atrial fibrillation at the time of the study 2. Patient has an ejection fraction less than 45% 3. Patient has a history of symptomatic heart failure, regardless of EF 4. Patient is undergoing an ablation procedure for a bypass track (WPW) 5. Patient has a history of resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia</criteria>
