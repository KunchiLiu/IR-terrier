	<brief_summary>VAST is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study designed to evaluate treatment of persistent air leak with the SVS as compared to standard chest tube drainage management and other standard-of-care interventions in the control group. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either Spiration Valves (investigational arm) or continue standard-of-care treatment (control arm). Once the air leak has resolved, Spiration Valves should be removed.</brief_summary>
