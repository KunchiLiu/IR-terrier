	<brief_summary>The investigation will employ a longitudinal approach in which every fetus diagnosed to be SGA (Small for Gestational Age ) will be studied at frequent intervals with sophisticated imaging techniques to assess subtle physiologic changes in the brain, heart, and placenta over time. These findings will be correlated with neurological and cardiovascular function in the newborn and early childhood. This research initiative should yield diagnostic and therapeutic templates that will improve the quality of life of IUGR babies in addition to providing important information that will better inform current diagnostic practices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study of Intra-Uterine Growth Restriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching objective is to serially assess changes in the fetal circulation, heart, and brain with sophisticated ultrasound, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and body composition techniques that will provide clues as to how growth restricted babies will tolerate life outside the uterus. Employing a longitudinal study will allow the investigators to correlate perinatal and postnatal outcomes more comprehensively than previous studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with diagnosed SGA by an ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) of less than the 10th percentile or a fetal abdominal circumference of less than the 5th percentile will be included in the study at the time of their first examination. Patients &lt; 18 years of age, and chromosomal anomalies as identified by regular aneuploidy screening.</criteria>
