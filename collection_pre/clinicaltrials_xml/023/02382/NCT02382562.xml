	<brief_summary>Depression and other unhealthy behaviors, such as not taking medication as prescribed and not attending doctor visits have been suggested to increase the worsening of allergic diseases (e.g. asthma, urticaria). We intend to determine whether a one-session behavioral intervention is effective in helping with depression and controlling disease symptoms. We will measure this using pre- and post-intervention surveys.</brief_summary>
