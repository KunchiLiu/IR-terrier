	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II study for previously untreated subjects with advanced NSCLC. The study will take place in two phases. First, a cohort of twelve participants will be enrolled in phase I part and will be treated with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab. A cohort of twelve subjects will be evaluated for safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of therapy. All subjects who receive either nab-paclitaxel or pembrolizumab will be evaluable. If 33% of subjects or less have unacceptable toxicity in the first cohort or any subsequent cohort (if necessary), the study will proceed to the Phase II part. If more than 33% have unacceptable toxicity, 12 additional subjects will be enrolled in a second cohort, if necessary. If unacceptable toxicity is seen in more than 33% in Cohort 2, the study will end due to unacceptable toxicity of this drug combination. The phase II part of the study is a single arm study. All subjects will be treated with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab in 21-day cycles for up to 4 cycles. Mandatory pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to initiating treatment for all subjects (only if adequate archived samples are unavailable). Mandatory tumor biopsies will be obtained in the Phase II part of the study after 4 cycles of study treatment or at the time of progression, whichever comes first. For subjects without progression of disease after Cycle 4, pembrolizumab will continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Phase I, Cohort 1 Induction Therapy: - Carboplatin AUC 6 IV, Day 1 - Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 IV, Days 1, 8, 15 - pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV, Day 1 - Cycle length: 21 days; number of cycles: 4 Phase I, Cohort 1 Maintenance Therapy: For subjects who have confirmed CR, PR, or SD (non-progression) after 4 cycles of induction therapy, maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 2* mg/kg will continue on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1). Subjects who complete 24 months of treatment with pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment if they progress after stopping study treatment provided they continue to meet inclusion criteria requirements. If unacceptable toxicity is seen in Phase I, Cohort 1, 12 additional participants will be enrolled. Phase I, Cohort 2 Induction Therapy (if necessary): - Carboplatin AUC 6 IV, Day 1 - Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 IV, Days 1, 8, 15 - pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV, Day 1 (cycle 2-4 only) - Cycle length: 21 days; Number of cycles: 4 Phase I, Cohort 2 Maintenance Therapy: For subjects who have confirmed CR, PR, or SD (non-progression) after 4 cycles of induction therapy, maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 2* mg/kg will continue on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 2, Day 1 (C2D1). Subjects who complete 24 months of treatment with pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment if they progress after stopping study treatment provided they continue to meet inclusion criteria requirements. Phase II Induction Therapy: - Carboplatin AUC 6 IV, Day 1 - Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 IV, Days 1, 8, 15 - pembrolizumab 200mg IV, Day 1 of each cycle - Cycle length: 21 days; number of cycles: 4 Phase II Maintenance Therapy: For subjects who have confirmed CR, PR, or SD (non-progression) after 4 cycles of induction therapy, maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 200 mg will continue on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1). Subjects who complete 24 months of treatment with pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment if they progress after stopping study treatment provided they meet the requirements. *As additional data from ongoing trials becomes available, the dose of pembrolizumab may be adjusted.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately. Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age. Individuals with stage IIIB or IV, unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received prior chemotherapy for Stage IIIB or IV disease, and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. ECOG performance status (PS) 01 Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria Prior to registration, all subjects must have archival tissue available. For subjects who have no archival tissue, but have PDL1 testing results using the Dako 22C3 antibody, subjects will be permitted to enroll without submitting tissue. If the patient has not had prior testing and no acceptable archival tissue is available, subjects must be willing to consent to providing a pretreatment biopsy for PDL1 testing. Regardless of PDL1 testing status, archival tissue will be requested for research testing if available. Phase II subjects must be willing to consent to providing a mandatory posttreatment core biopsy for research if clinical feasible. Women are eligible to participate if they are of nonchildbearing potential or have documentation of a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine βhCG) within 3 days of registration. Sexually active premenopausal women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate, highly effective contraceptive measures, starting with the first dose of study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of last study drug.
