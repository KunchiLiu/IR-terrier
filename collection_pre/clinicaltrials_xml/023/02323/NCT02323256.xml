	<brief_summary>This study aims at investigating new automatic fitting techniques for cochlear implant patients based on objective measures. For this reason, the evolution of these neurophysiological measures, expressing the encoding of pure tones and speech, will be characterized in cochlear implanted patients as a function of post-implantation time and will be compared to those of normal hearing subjects. Moreover, the effect of auditory training with new tools based on serious games will be assessed.</brief_summary>
