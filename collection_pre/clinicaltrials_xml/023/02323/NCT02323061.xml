	<brief_summary>A BCI system for stroke subjects will be designed in an attempt to train the motor-related areas in their brains responsible for hand open/close function. A robot hand will be used and controlled by the system in real time based on EEG pattern for identification of motion intention for hand movements in the motor cortex. A randomized controlled trial study design will be adopted. All subjects will be assessed by clinical assessments including FMA and neuroimaging assessments using multimodal MR techniques before and after the training to evaluate training effectiveness.</brief_summary>
