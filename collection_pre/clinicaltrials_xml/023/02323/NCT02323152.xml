	<brief_summary>Postpartum depression is a disease with a prevalence of 10% which has not only deleterious consequences for the mother but also for the baby and can delay the physical, social and cognitive development of the baby. Therefore we consider very important to prevent this disease as from the centers of care for women with a multidisciplinary approach. The aim of this study is to determine whether psychoeducation oriented in problem solving is effective in preventing the development of postpartum depression in women with very high risk. Methodology: screening of 1000 women in 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We expect that 25% have at least one risk factor for postpartum depression (250). Of these women, aproximately a 50% will have a very high risk of developing postpartum depressión and will be included in the study (n = 125). These women will be randomized to two groups: treatment with psychotherapy focused on problem solving (6 sessions: 1 individual session + 5 group sessions) or usual care control group (usual postpartum control). After treatment, women will be evaluated twice, at the end of therapy and at 6 weeks. Survival curves will be used tu assess the time it takes patients to develop major depression in the postpartum.</brief_summary>

According VegaDienstmainer (VegaDiesnstmainer JM, 2002), there weren't women with lower score than 7.5 that had been diagnosed with DPP (sensitivity and positive predictive value of 100%). Therefore, we considered selecting those patients with higher score of 7.5 on the EPDS scale. Exclusion criteria 1. Mental Retardation. 2. Severe mental disorder decompensation that prevents understanding of the objectives of the study. 3. Submit language difficulties that impede verbal comprehension / readingwriting. 4. Submit a major depressive episode according to DSMIV TR (depressive symptoms of sufficient intensity and longer duration than 2 weeks). All participants will be informed that they will be randomized to on of the two study groups and will only be included if they give their informed consent to participate in the study. Women in both groups will be evaluated at baseline (preintervention) at 6 and 12 weeks (postinternveción).</criteria>
