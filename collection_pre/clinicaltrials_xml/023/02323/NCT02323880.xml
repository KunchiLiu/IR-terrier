	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor in treating younger patients with solid tumors or high-grade gliomas that have come back (recurred) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as selinexor, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor in Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors or High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the tablet formulation of selinexor in children with recurrent/refractory solid and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. II. To describe the toxicities of selinexor in children with recurrent/refractory solid and CNS tumors. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of selinexor in children with recurrent/refractory solid and CNS tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the antitumor effect of selinexor in a preliminary manner in children with recurrent/refractory solid and CNS tumors. II. To determine the pharmacodynamic properties of selinexor in children and adolescents with refractory solid tumors in plasma proteins and whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA). III. To explore the penetration, pharmacodynamic effects, and biologic effects of selinexor in tumor tissue of patients with recurrent/refractory high-grade gliomas (HGG) requiring resection. IV. To further assess the toxicity and antitumor effects of selinexor in children with recurrent/refractory HGG in expanded cohorts following dose-escalation by measuring rate of objective radiographic response (medical patients) and rate of progression-free survival (PFS) six months from the start of treatment (surgical patients). OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly (days 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, and 17). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a body surface area (BSA) &gt;= 0.84 m^2 Diagnosis: Part A: Patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including lymphoma and CNS tumors, are eligible; patients must have had histologic verification of malignancy at original diagnosis or relapse except in patients with intrinsic brain stem tumors, optic pathway gliomas, or patients with pineal tumors and elevations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum tumor markers including alphafetoprotein or betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) Part B: Patients with recurrent or refractory high grade glioma (World Health Organization [WHO] grade III/IV) including disseminated tumors (excluding diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [DIPG]), not requiring surgical resection; patients must have had histologic verification of malignancy at original diagnosis or relapse Part C: Patients with recurrent or refractory high grade glioma (WHO grade III/IV) and requiring surgical resection (excluding DIPG and disseminated tumors), who in the opinion of treating physicians, are medically stable to receive 34 doses of selinexor (810 days of treatment) before undergoing surgery without compromising the success of the procedure; note that if, in the opinion of treating physicians, current symptoms necessitate surgery before 34 doses will be able to be received, surgery should not be delayed to administer selinexor, and the patient would be ineligible for protocol therapy Disease status: Part A: Patients must have either measurable or evaluable disease Parts B and C: Patients must have measurable disease on imaging Patient's current disease state must be one for which there is no known curative therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life Karnofsky &gt;= 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky &gt;= 50 for patients =&lt; 16 years of age; Note: Neurologic deficits in patients with CNS tumors must have been relatively stable for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment; patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anticancer therapy and must meet the following minimum duration from prior anticancer directed therapy prior to enrollment; if after the required timeframe, the numerical eligibility criteria are met, e.g. blood count criteria, the patient is considered to have recovered adequately Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: At least 21 days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea) Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 14 days after the last dose of a longacting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for shortacting growth factor; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair Biologic (antineoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair Immunotherapy: At least 42 days after the completion of any type of immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines Antibodies: &gt;= 21 days must have elapsed from infusion of last dose of antibody, and toxicity related to prior antibody therapy must be recovered to grade =&lt;
