	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to estimate the annualized relapse rate (ARR) over a 12-month period in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) who are treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as their initial therapy (treatment-naïve), or switching from interferon (IFN) or glatiramer acetate (GA) (after suboptimal response defined as suboptimal efficacy, intolerance, or poor adherence to IFN or GA), as determined by the Prescribing Physician. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are: To assess the impact of DMF over a 12 month period on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and health economic related outcomes; and to evaluate additional clinical outcomes at Month 12.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Have access to the internet and are able to complete online assessments on a computer. Have relapsingremitting MS and satisfy the approved therapeutic indication for DMF per the Canadian Product Monograph. Are either treatmentnaïve or being treated for RRMS with IFN or GA but, per the Prescribing Physician, have a suboptimal response (e.g., suboptimal efficacy, intolerance, or poor adherence) to IFN or GA or have stopped treatment with IFN or GA for RRMS as a result of suboptimal response within 3060 days of enrollment. Key Have major comorbid conditions that would preclude their participation in the study as determined by the Prescribing Physician. Have a history of malignancy. (Patients with basal cell carcinoma that has been completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible.) Are receiving disease modifying therapies other than IFN or GA or have initiated treatment with a new disease modifying therapy since discontinuation of IFN or GA. NOTE: Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
