	<brief_summary>This study will compare meniscal healing augmented or without augmentation with bone marrow stimulation techniques The assessments will include validated, disease specific, patient oriented outcome measures, second look arthroscopy during second step ACL reconstruction. Results of this study will help ascertain whether microfractures improve meniscal healing rates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmentation of Meniscal Repair With Marrow Stimulation Techniques (Microfractures)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role of meniscal in the knee integrity is pivotal and lack or partial role of the meniscus increases rate of joint degeneration. Partial meniscal removal is the most popular procedure and meniscal repair remain in minority of arthroscopic surgeries. As criteria of inclusion to meniscal repair are very rough, still success rates of meniscal repair remain in the 60-80% range for isolated repairs. This rate is greater when performed with ACL reconstruction. We believe that augmentation with bone marrow stimulation techniques will induce more complete and possibly faster healing.</detailed_description>
