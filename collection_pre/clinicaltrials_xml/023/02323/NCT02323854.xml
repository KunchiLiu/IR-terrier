	<brief_summary>Post market prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study, designed to demonstrate dose response of an ablation system using a percutaneous approach in patients with primary, metastatic, or recurrent primary lung tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The EMPrint™ Ablate and RESect Study in Patients With Metastatic Lung Tumors (EMPRESS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: Dose response as indicated by CT imaging, measurement of maximum diameter and volume. Secondary Endpoint: Assessment of complete tumor ablation immediately post-procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject or authorized representative has provided informed consent. Subject is ≥18 years of age. At least one pulmonary metastasis ≤ 3.0 cm in maximum diameter resulting from distant primary cancers or at least one recurrence of primary lung cancer ≤ 3.0 cm in maximum diameter. Subject has been confirmed by a thoracic surgeon to be a surgical candidate for resection of the tumor targeted for ablation. Subject is willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation schedule. ≥1 cm of tumorfree lung parenchyma between target tumor and pleura or fissure. Preprocedure Exclusion Criteria Contraindicated for surgery. Prolonged chest infection, defined as lung consolidation that requires hospitalization and greater than 10 days of antibiotics 30 days prior to surgery. Tumor abutting main stem bronchus, main pulmonary artery branches, esophagus and/or trachea. Tumor with pleural contact. Tumors located &lt; 3 cm of staple lines or other metal objects. Patients diagnosed with GOLD Stage IV Emphysema. Uncontrollable coagulopathy Patients unable to tolerate discontinued use of anticoagulants prior to and during the ablation procedure. Subject is pregnant (documented by a positive pregnancy test according to hospital standard practices) or is actively breastfeeding. Subject has participated in an investigational drug or device research study within 30 days of enrollment that would interfere with this study. The investigator determines that participation in the study may jeopardize the safety or welfare of the subject. Patients with implantable pacemakers and other electronic implants, in accordance with Instructions for Use (IFU). Intraprocedural Exclusion Criteria *Incidental intraprocedural finding that the subject no longer meets the study eligibility criteria.</criteria>
