	<brief_summary>A single-center, randomized, controlled, switching, open-label, parallel cohort study. Smoking subjects will be confined to a clinic for 9 days. During their stay, baseline assessments during ad libitum smoking will occur for the first 3 days. Following baseline, subjects will be switched to either an Electronic Cigarette or Nicotine Gum, and post-product switch assessments will occur for 6 days.</brief_summary>
