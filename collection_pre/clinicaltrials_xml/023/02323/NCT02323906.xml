	<brief_summary>CC-122-HCC-001 is a Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion clinical study of CC-122 in combination with sorafenib for subjects with unresectable HCC who have received no prior systemic therapy for HCC. The dose escalation phase of the study will explore several dose levels of CC-122 in combination with sorafenib, followed by an expansion part of the study using the optimal combination dose regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-122 Combined With Sorafenib for Primary Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of CC-122 administered orally in combination with sorafenib, and to define the non-tolerated dose (NTD), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The secondary objective of the study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 in combination with sorafenib, based on response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)</detailed_description>

Subject has ChildPugh score of less than 7 (ie, class A or better) with neither encephalopathy nor clinically significant ascites (ascites requiring paracentesis within 3 months of signing the ICF is excluded). ChildPugh status is calculated based on clinical findings and laboratory results during the screening period. 10.

Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase of at least 5 times the upper limit of normal 2. Serum total bilirubin of at least 3 mg/dL 3. Serum albumin of at least 2.8 g/dL Note: Laboratories in combination must still be Child Pugh score less than 7 Other laboratory parameters: 1. Serum creatinine of at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal 2. Potassium within normal range or corrected with supplements 11. For subjects with known or suspected cirrhosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy ) within 12 months of signing the informed consent form, showing no evidence of untreated varices or stigmata of active bleeding (such as active ulcer, visible vessel, or blood) is required. Subjects with history of upper GI bleeding must have an EGD of 3 months or less prior to signing the consent form confirming adequate prior endoscopic therapy (eg, no evidence of any untreated varices, recent or active bleeding, stigmata suggesting high risk for bleeding, active ulcer). Subjects with history/suspected esophageal varices must be on optimal medical management (eg, proton pump inhibitor and nonselective betablocker) per local institutional policy. 12. Subject is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 13. Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan 1. Females of childbearing potential must undergo pregnancy testing based on the frequency outlined in Pregnancy Prevention Risk Minimization Plan and pregnancy results must be negative. 2. Unless practicing complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, sexually active FCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods as specified in Pregnancy Prevention Risk Minimization Plan. Complete abstinence is only acceptable in cases where this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (calendar ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable. 3. Males (including those who have had a vasectomy) must use barrier contraception (condoms) when engaging in sexual activity with Female of Childbearing Potential as specified in Pregnancy Prevention Risk Minimization Plan. 4. Males must agree not to donate semen or sperm for 3 months after last dose of CC122. 5. All subjects must: Understand that CC122 could have a potential teratogenic risk.
