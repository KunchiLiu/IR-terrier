	<brief_summary>In this project we will design a control algorithm to identify the focalized motor-related clusters for hand function on each stroke patient. A real-time feedback will control the robotic hand when motor imagery is successfully identified. Finally, the focalized BCI-robot training will be compared in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the training effectiveness and changes in the EEG patterns.</brief_summary>
