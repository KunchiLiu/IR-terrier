	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Phase 1b dose finding phase is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The purpose of the Phase 2 expansion phase is to evaluate preliminary efficacy of TAK-659 in relapsed or refractory AML as measured by overall response rate (ORR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of TAK-659 in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat people who have relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This study will be conducted in 2 phases. The first phase will determine a safe and well-tolerated dose of TAK-659 to be used in the second phase, and the second phase will look at response to treatment in people who take TAK-659. The study will enroll approximately 81 patients (up to 15 in the first phase and 66 in the second phase). There will be two separate cohorts during Phase 2 portion of the study, one for patients with FLT-3 ITD mutations and the other for FLT-3 wild-type patients. Phase 1b: • TAK-659 60 mg tablet starting dose escalated in 20 mg or higher increments to a maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) Phase 2: • TAK-659 tablet at the maximum tolerated dose or RP2D determined in Phase 1b. All participants will be asked to take their prescribed tablets at the same time each day throughout the study. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 24 months (12 months of treatment and 12 months of follow up) unless the treating physician believes the participant would continue to derive benefit from the study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female participants 18 years or older. 2. Must have a histopathologically documented diagnosis of primary or secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia), as defined by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (Jaffe et al, 2001), for whom no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission according to the clinical judgment of the principal investigator, or who refuses standard therapies (phase 1b and 2). 3. Participants for the phase 2 portion of the study must, in addition, meet the following: 1. Must be refractory to or relapsed after no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Reinduction with the same regimen or stem cell transplant will not be considered a separate regimen. 2. Must not have prior exposure to any investigational FLT3 inhibitors. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. 5. a.Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or Are surgically sterile, or If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 180 days after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) b. Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 180 days after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) 6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 7. In the absence of rapid progressive disease, the interval from prior systemic anticancer treatment to time of TAK659 administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents (other than hydroxyurea), or at least 5 halflives for noncytotoxic agents, and participants have to have recovered from acute toxicities of these therapies. Participants who are on hydroxyurea may be included in the study and may continue on hydroxyurea for the first 28 days while participating in this study. 8. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling, including PK and PD sampling and blood transfusion support. 9. Participants must have adequate organ function as specified in the following: Total bilirubin must be ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be &lt; 2.5 x the ULN. Serum creatinine must be &lt; 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min either as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hours). 1. Clinically active central nervous system leukemia. 2. Female participants who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the Screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first dose of study drug. 3. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness, including drug or alcohol abuse, that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially jeopardize the safety of the participant or interfere with the objectives of the study. 4. Prior treatment with investigational agents ≤ 21 days or ≤ 5 x their halflives (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of study treatment. A minimum of 10 days should elapse from prior investigational therapy to initiating protocol therapy. 5. Persistent clinically significant toxicity from prior chemotherapy that is Grade 2 or higher by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (v4.03). 6. Receipt of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within 60 days of the first dose of TAK659; clinically significant graftversushost disease (GVHD) requiring ongoing immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at the time of screening (use of topical steroids for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted). 7.
