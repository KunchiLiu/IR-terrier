	<brief_summary>This project is part of a large multicenter multidisciplinary program that will thoroughly explore the needs and difficulties of patients with BCR as well as those involved in their care. The results of this research program will propose recommendations for better structure and understand the follow up of these patients. From the limited data in the literature, the long-term remission in patients with ovarian cancer reported a significant and persistent fatigue, poor QoL, disorders of sexuality as well as somatic and mental illness; consumption is also a medical records for these patients. In this context, our team has initiated a large case-control study to assess fatigue (identified major problem in the long-term remission in patients with ovarian cancer), QoL and rehabilitation of patients in remission from an epithelial ovarian cancer (regardless of the stage of cancer at diagnosis, early or advanced) 3 years after the initial treatment, compared with women of the same age without ovarian cancer or serious chronic disease , from the general population. Patients and controls complement standardized and validated self-administered questionnaire (part 1). This study investigated 215 patients in long remission from ovarian cancer compared to 215 women of the same age without cancer. Recruitment of patients is currently underway, in close collaboration with teams from the Group GINECO very involved in this project. Following this step, an additional component is planned: it is to offer patients who participated in part 1, a specific gynecological consultation to assess in detail the effects of the treatments in order to better meet the needs of patients .dropoff window</brief_summary>
