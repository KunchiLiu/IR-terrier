	<brief_summary>Results after interventions on lifestyle in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease are not always consistent, and the Guidelines multidisciplinary measures aren't easily achievable. Therefore, the purpose of this research project is the identification of an interventional approach to effective secondary prevention and realistic feasibility, in a field of multifactorial risk. The study is open to patients who totaled a double chronic disease, obesity/overweight and coronary heart disease, and who experienced a first event of ischemic cardiac infarction (AMI). The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a group educational intervention in a sample of overweight and obese patients (BMI &gt; 24.9) incurred in a first episode of acute myocardial infarction (non-STEMI and STEMI), comparing with the classic approach of prescriptive diet therapy.</brief_summary>
