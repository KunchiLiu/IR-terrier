	<brief_title>TEAS to Improve Outcome During Emergence From General Anesthesia After Robotic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During robotic laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, the patients are put in an extremely trendelenburg positon. And a long duration of this position could lead to delayed emergence or agitation. Stimulation at some acupoints were reported to improve homeostasis. In this study we tend to observe whether transcutaneous electrical stimulation at specific acupoints could improve the quality of emergence in patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.</detailed_description>
