	<brief_summary>TransitionCHF aims to recruit a unique cohort of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (NYHA I) to study the progression to symptomatic (&gt;NYHA I) HF and to identify parameters/ biomarkers promoting and predicting the individual risk of transition. Results from TransitionCHF Cohort Study will inform and refine current treatment guidelines. The implementation of common patient data sets and biobanking standards will enable data and biomaterial sharing with other DZHK study groups. This study will set the standard for a unique DZHK heart failure database and Biobank for innovative preclinical and clinical trials.</brief_summary>
