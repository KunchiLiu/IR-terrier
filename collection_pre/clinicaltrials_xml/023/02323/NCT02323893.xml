	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to visualize biodistribution of a PET tracer called [18F]F-AraG through time in healthy human volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Kinetics, Dosimetry and Safety of [18F]F-AraG, a Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Tracer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer will be intravenously injected into healthy human volunteers who provide informed consent. Following injection of this tracer each volunteer will have four whole-body PET scans inside a PET scanner to obtain images of tracer biodistribution at four different time points. This will allow studying the kinetics of the tracer as well analysis of tracer dosimetry. Safety of the tracer will also be analyzed in each volunteer.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy human subjects without history of chronic disease or at present an acute disease will be included. Ability to abide by the study conditions is also a requirement for inclusion. Individuals under the age of 18 years and pregnant women will be excluded from the [18F]FAraG imaging studies. Women who are breastfeeding will be excluded from the study. Individuals unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.</criteria>
