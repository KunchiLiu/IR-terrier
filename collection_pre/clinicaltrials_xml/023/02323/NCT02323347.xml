	<brief_title>Cut-Off Progesterone Values Deleterious for In Vitro Fertilization and Fresh Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is still an ongoing debate on the effect of subtle increased P-hCG concentration on pregnancy outcome after fresh ET. No consensus on the cut-off value to define increased P-hCG seems to exist. It is accepted that high P advances endometrium, leading to asynchrony between the implanting embryo and the endometrium, and resulting in implantation failure. A freeze all embryos policy and postponement of ET in subsequent frozen-thawed cycle has been proposed.</detailed_description>
