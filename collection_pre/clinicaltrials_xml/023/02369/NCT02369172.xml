	<brief_summary>CYP2B6 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. So, it is important to assess in vivo the effect of ASP2151 on that enzyme to determine any possible drug interactions. The aim of this trial is to investigate the potential for interaction of ASP2151 with the CYP2B6 probe substrate bupropion.</brief_summary>

Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG, or laboratory values at the pretrial screening assessment that could interfere with the objectives of the trial or the safety of the volunteer. Any of the following liver function tests higher than 1.5 times the ULN at the screening visit: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ALP, bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGT). Platelet counts outside normal limits (129,000346,000/Î¼L). Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness sufficient to invalidate the volunteer's participation in the trial or make it unnecessarily hazardous. Clinically significant impaired endocrine, thyroid, hepatic, respiratory or renal function, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, or history of any psychotic mental illness. History of bleeding diathesis, head injury, intracranial mass lesions, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, seizures, depression, selfharm (or thoughts of selfharm) or eating disorders. Surgery (eg stomach bypass) or medical condition that might affect absorption of medicines. Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any drug, history of multiple drug allergies (multiple defined as &gt;3), or sensitivity to trial medication. Use, during the 28 days before the first dose of trial medication, of any prescription medicine, or any other medicine or herbal remedy (such as St John's wort) known to interfere with the CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolic pathway. Use, during the 7 days before the first dose of trial medication, of any overthecounter medicine, with the exception of paracetamol (acetaminophen). Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription medicine within the previous 3 months. Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly. Current smoker or history of regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within the previous 6 months. Blood pressure and heart rate in seated position at the screening examination outside the ranges 90140 mm Hg systolic, 4090 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 40_100 beats/min. However, if the investigator deems the result to be not clinically significant the subject may be included. Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the protocol. Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing. Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV1 or HIV2. Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial, eg as a blood donor.
