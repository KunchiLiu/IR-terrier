	<brief_title>Exploratory Study of the Cutaneous Penetration of Biodegradable Polymeric Microparticles in Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatments of inflammatory skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis or atopic dermatitis are primarily topical. They have the advantage of allowing the administration of active substances directly to the skin lesions. However local treatments may have drawbacks (complex application, local and/or systemic side effects...) and cause poor compliance. The use of drug carriers is viewed as one of the most promising strategies to target and control the release of active substances to various skin sites. Polymeric microparticles have shown to have a better stability and a more sustained release pattern than other types of drug vehicles such as liposomes. Based on the results obtained in our preclinical experiments, this proof of concept study aims to assess, in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, if biodegradable polymeric microparticles reach the pilosebaceous follicles of inflamed skin which would in turn serve as a reservoir of active substance.</detailed_description>
