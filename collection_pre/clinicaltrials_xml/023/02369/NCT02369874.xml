	<brief_title>Study of MEDI4736 Monotherapy and in Combination With Tremelimumab Versus Standard of Care Therapy in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global, Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC therapy in the target patient population. The main objectives of the study are to: - assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), in terms of overall survival (OS), regardless of PDL-1 status - assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SOC in patients with SCCHN, in terms of OS, regardless of PDL-1 status Patients will undergo a screening assessment on their tumor tissue sample to determine PD-L1 expression per a pre-specified cut-off level. Patients with ≥25% of tumor cells with membrane staining will be considered PD-L1 positive while those with 0% to 24% of tumor cells with membrane staining will be considered PD-L1 negative. Based on the underlying PD-L1 status, patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive treatment with MEDI4736 monotherapy, MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, or SoC therapy. Patients who discontinue treatment in 1 treatment group may not switch to treatment in a different group. Stratification factors include PD-L1 status, human papillomavirus status, (in patients with oropharyngeal cancer only), and smoking status. Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks until objective tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).</detailed_description>
