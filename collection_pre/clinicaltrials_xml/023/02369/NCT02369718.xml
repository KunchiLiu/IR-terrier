	<brief_summary>Cochlear implant microphones are subject to aging and dirtying. The evolution may affect their efficiency. Several signal coding strategies are used in cochlear implants and their behaviour may be more or less affected by the aging process. In this work the investigators wish to assess this phenomenon.</brief_summary>
