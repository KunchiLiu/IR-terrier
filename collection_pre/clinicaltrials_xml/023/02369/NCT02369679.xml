	<brief_summary>Treatment of lymphedema is based on a combined program called complex decongestive therapy. The components of the complex decongestive therapy are skin care, kinesiotherapy, manual lymphatic drainage and compression. The compression with multilayer bandage has proved to be the most effective of these therapies when analyzed separately.The multilayer bandage produces a gradient compression on the limb where distal pressure is higher than proximal pressure. Several materials are needed for the multilayer bandage, including tubular bandage lining, digit bandages, foam under-cast padding and multiple layers of short-stretch bandages to cover the entire limb. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap fits each patient through a Velcro system. The aim is to compare the effectiveness of a precast adjustable compression wrap (Circaid) with the multilayer compression bandages in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The gold standard of the treatment of lymphedema is based on a combined program called complex decongestive therapy. The components of the complex decongestive therapy are skin care, kinesiotherapy, manual lymphatic drainage and compression. The compression with multilayer bandage has proved to be the most effective of these therapies when analyzed separately. With the multilayer compression bandage the upper limb lymphedema volume decreased a 37.2%. The multilayer bandage produces a gradient compression on the limb where distal pressure is higher than proximal pressure. Several materials are needed for the multilayer bandage, including tubular bandage lining, digit bandages, foam under-cast padding and multiple layers of short-stretch bandages to cover the entire limb. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap fits each patient through a Velcro system. Decreasing compression is achieved by controlling the tension applied to each Velcro through a visual color guide. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap has proved to be safe and effective to treat lower limb lymphedema, but there is little information about its effectiveness in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema. The aim is to compare the effectiveness of a precast adjustable compression wrap (Circaid) with the multilayer compression bandages in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.</detailed_description>
