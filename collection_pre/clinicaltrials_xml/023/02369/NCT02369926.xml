	<brief_summary>This study aims to calibrate the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) for home implementation in a phase 2 trial of lisinopril in multiple sclerosis. In this initial stage, participants are required to travel to the study site one day a week for three weeks to complete the MSFC. They are also required to complete the MSFC at home once weekly for three weeks using remote sensing technology and video conferencing.</brief_summary>
