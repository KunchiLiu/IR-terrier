	<brief_summary>An investigator initiated pilot trial: two arm, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized, parallel group of approximately 750 patients with chronic kidney disease, and who have evidence of overt proteinuria, will be treated with micro-particle curcumin versus placebo over 24 weeks from start of the investigational medication date (approximately 6 months) to test whether curcumin can slow chronic kidney disease progression in patients. Three 30 mg capsules of micro-particle curcumin will be self-administered once daily in the morning to determine the the safety and efficacy of curcumin relative to placebo in reducing albuminuria, reducing urinary interleukin-18 and slowing the loss of eGFR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Micro-Particle Curcumin for the Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limiting the progression from CKD to end-stage renal disease is one of the most important goals in kidney medicine. The evidence implicating inflammation and fibrosis in that process is strong, and there is abundant mechanistic and animal model data to show that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of both inflammation and fibrosis. Two preliminary randomized trials in human CKD hint at curcumin's enormous therapeutic potential in CKD. The Principal Investigator/Sponsor will rigorously test this potential in a broadly selected sample of up to 750 patients with CKD. Compared to previous studies, this study's results will be generalizable across other etiologies of CKD and with a larger sample size; this study will provide more precise estimates of curcumin's benefits and risks. Also, this study proposes to use a new, micro-particle formulation of curcumin that is highly bioavailable. The Principal Investigator/Sponsor will assess curcumin's effects on three key markers of kidney health that encompass the cardinal functions of the nephron. Positive results from MPAC-CKD will lay solid scientific ground-work for a multi-centre trial capable of testing micro-particle curcumin's effect of the most meaningful outcomes: death and the development of end-stage renal disease. To ensure that this study will have the necessary adherence and tolerability data, up to 750 patients with proteinuric CKD will be randomly assigned to 90 mg per day of micro-particle curcumin or matching placebo, for a total of 24 weeks (approximately 6 months). In the last few years, new formulations of curcumin have been shown to substantially augment absorption by improving its aqueous solubility. The micro-particle formulation of curcumin is one of these new formulations and is the only curcumin delivery system proven to increase bioavailability. Compared to traditional curcumin, micro-particle curcumin achieves total serum concentrations that are 27 fold higher. In this study, micro-particle curcumin will allow the study team to administer the equivalent of 3000 mg of traditional curcumin (which would require six 500 mg capsules daily), in a single 90 mg capsule. In addition, as opposed to traditional curcumin, there is no requirement to take micro-particle curcumin on a full stomach. The Investigator/Sponsor has selected a dose equivalent to 3 grams per day of curcumin because this is within the range of doses proven safe and effective and it will minimize pill burden by allowing the full daily dose to be achieved by three small 30 mg capsules daily In rare cases, curcumin has been reported to cause minor nausea, headache, diarrhea, yellow stool, and temporary giddiness. All unexpected reactions reported in previous studies were easily managed and happened at higher doses than what will be used in MPAC-CKD. This study will assess three co-primary outcomes at baseline, 12 weeks (approximately 3 months) and 24 weeks (approximately 6 months) from the date of starting the investigational medication: albuminuria, eGFR, and urinary interleukin-18. Glycemic control will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks (approximately 3 months) and 24 weeks (approximately 6 months) from the date of starting the investigational medication, among patients with diabetes mellitus. Medical history, lab values and vitals will be collected and/or updated at each in-person visit. Each participant will be provided with instructions and study schedule. Participants with diabetes mellitus will be given a home glucose log-book. Protocol compliance will be tested through pill counts and interviews at each follow-up visit. Side effects will be assessed using standardized case report forms at each visit. Participants will be contacted by telephone one week into the trial and then once every 4 weeks (monthly) for 28 weeks (approximately 7 months) for safety monitoring and reporting and to reinforce importance of compliance. In-person visits will occur at 12 and 24 weeks (approximately 3 and 6 months) after randomization and the start of the investigational medication, at which time investigational medication will be counted and supply replenished. First morning at-home urine specimens will be collected at baseline and again arranged at the in-person visits at 12 and 24 weeks (approximately 3 and 6 months). Participants will also be encouraged to report any events they may experience directly to the coordinator(s) and/or PI. Participants who withdraw consent to continue treatments, will be encouraged to undergo the planned assessments. Withdrawal at the request of investigators or medical personnel may include, but are not limited to: 1. Symptoms are deemed to be potentially related to the sue of the investigational medication; 2. New diagnosis of exclusion criteria; 3. Inter-current illness not related to the use of the investigational Natural Health Product (NHP) medication; 4. Unacceptable side effects; 5. Death; 6. Improved health status. Estimated time to complete recruitment: Averaging 136 weeks, approximately 34 months. Long-term outcomes will be tracked using administrative data housed at The Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), an independent research facility in Toronto, Ontario. ICES works with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to study the impact of health care and diseases in Ontario. A panel of external experts and study investigators will comprise the Steering Committee and will ensure the integrity of the study. They will be responsible for reviewing and acting upon the recommendations of the Data Safety Monitoring Board, amendments to the protocol, oversight of publication and dissemination of study results. Additional analysis:The first 30 consented and randomized participants, will have a 4.5 ml blood sample taken at the 12 week (3 month) visit. This sample will be processed and stored at -80 degrees C. for batch testing for plasma micro-particle curcumin concentrations. Two urine specimens obtained from each day of the home collections at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks (average 3 and 6 months) will be processed and stored at -80 degrees C for batch analysis of IL-18 uncorrected for urinary creatinine concentration (primary outcome #3). Specimens will be stored in the Kidney Clinical Research Unit, London, Ontario and shipped for analysis by Yale University,New Haven, Connecticut, USA.</detailed_description>
