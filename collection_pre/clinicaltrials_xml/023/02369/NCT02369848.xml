	<brief_summary>Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.50mm to 7.0mm reference vessel diameter at the target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System is indicated to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure. Up to sixty (60) subjects will be enrolled and treated with Lithoplasty to yield thirty (51) evaluable subjects complete the study assuming a 15% lost to follow-up rate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.50mm to 7.0mm reference vessel diameter at the target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System is indicated for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. Up to sixty (60) subjects will be enrolled at up to 8 centers in Europe and New Zealand to yield at least 51 evaluable subjects (assuming a lost-to-follow up rate of 15%). Subjects will be evaluated at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment/index procedure. Primary endpoints include safety and efficacy. Safety is a composite of new-onset Major Adverse Events through 30 days. Efficacy is target lesion patency at 12 months by duplex ultrasound defined as freedom from ≥50% restenosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is able and willing to comply with all assessments in the study. 2. Subject or subject's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has signed the approved consent form. 3. Age of subject is &gt;18. 4. Rutherford Clinical Category 2, 3, or 4. 5. Resting anklebrachial index (ABI) of ≤0.90, or ≤0.75 after exercise, of the target leg. 6. Estimated life expectancy &gt;1 year. Angiographic 1. Subject is a suitable candidate for angiography and endovascular intervention in the opinion of the investigator or per hospital guideline. 2. Target lesion that is located in a native de novo superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal artery (popliteal artery extends to and ends proximal to the ostium of the anterior tibial artery). 3. Target lesion reference vessel diameter is between 3.50mm and 7.0mm by visual estimate. 4. Target zone is ≤150mm in length. Target lesion can be all or part of the 150mm zone. 5. Target lesion is ≥70% stenosis by investigator via visual estimate. 6. Subject has at least one patent tibial vessel on the target leg with runoff to the ankle (not supported by collateral circulation.) Tibial vessel patency is defined as no stenosis &gt;50%. 7. Ability to pass the guidewire across the atherosclerotic lesion. 8. No evidence of aneurysm or acute or chronic thrombus in target vessel. 9. Calcification is at least moderate. (Presence of fluoroscopic evidence of calcification: 1) on parallel sides of the vessel and 2) extending ≥ 50% the length of the lesion.) 1. Rutherford Clinical Category 5 and 6. 2. Subject has active infection in the target leg. 3. Planned major amputation of the target leg (transmetatarsal or higher). 4. The use of chronic total occlusion (CTO) reentry devices. 5. CTOs greater than 80 mm in length. 6. Any instent restenosis within the target zone. 7. Lesions within 10 mm of ostium of the SFA. 8. Highly tortuous arteries (bends greater than 30 degrees over the arc length of the balloon). 9. Target lesion within native or synthetic vessel grafts. 10. History of prior endovascular or surgical procedure on the index limb within the past 30 days. 11. Subject has significant stenosis (&gt;50% stenosis) or occlusion of inflow tract before target treatment zone (e.g. iliac or common femoral) not successfully treated with POBA or stent and without complications. 12. Subject requires treatment of a peripheral lesion on the ipsilateral limb distal and beyond the 150mm target zone at the time of the enrollment/index procedure. 13. Subject has a known coagulopathy or has a bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 100,000/microliter, or INR &gt;1.5. 14. Subject in whom antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. 15. Subject has known allergy to contrast agents or medications used to perform endovascular intervention that cannot be adequately pretreated. 16. Subject has known allergy to urethane, nylon, or silicone. 17. Myocardial infarction within 60 days prior to enrollment. 18. History of stroke within 60 days prior to enrollment. 19. History of unstable coronary artery disease or other uncontrollable comorbidity resulting in hospitalization within the last 60 days prior to enrollment. 20. History of thrombolytic therapy within two weeks of enrollment. 21. Subject has acute or chronic renal disease (e.g., as measured by a serum creatinine of &gt;2.5 mg/dL or &gt;220 umol/L), or on dialysis. 22. Subject is pregnant or nursing. 23. Subject is participating in another research study involving an investigational agent (pharmaceutical, biologic, or medical device) that has not reached the primary endpoint. 24. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude them from receiving this treatment, and the procedures and evaluations pre and posttreatment.</criteria>
