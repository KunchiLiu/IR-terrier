	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective study is to gather procedural use and safety data on the initial use of the Magellan Robotic System with the Magellan Robotic Catheter 6 Fr and Vascular Accessories 6 Fr. This study will focus on, but not be limited to, endovascular embolization procedures in the peripheral vascular, for example, embolization of the splenic and hepatic arteries, uterine arterial embolization (UAE), prostatic arterial embolization (PAE), and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The data will be analyzed for medical education, societal presentation and/or publication by the investigator.</brief_summary>
