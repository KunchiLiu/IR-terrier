	<brief_summary>Background: The cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve symptoms and outcome of patients with congestive heart failure (HF), and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF &lt; 35 %). The rate of non-responders to CRT is estimated at 30 %. Yet, the impact of frailty on the response to CRT has not been studied, until now. Purpose : To assess the impact of frailty in the elderly, on the response to CRT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frailty Score Assessment for Elderly Patients Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Frailty is evaluated before implant ,and defined as &lt;14/17 points using the ONCODAGE score, in 150 patients of &gt; 70 years age, selected for CRT according to the ESC 2013 guidelines. The response to CRT, estimated at 9 months, is defined as an improvement of at least 5 % of the LVEF and the absence of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death.</detailed_description>
