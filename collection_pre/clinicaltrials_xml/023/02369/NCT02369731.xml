	<brief_title>Registry of Translarna (Ataluren) in Nonsense Mutation Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, observational study of patients receiving Translarna based on inclusion of their data in a registry. This study is intended to enroll 200 patients across ~50 care centers in Europe and other regions over a period of ~ 2 years. The study population will include patients who are receiving usual care treatment with commercial supply of Translarna (or receiving care within a named patient early access program) and who provide consent. Patients will be followed for at least 5 years from their date of enrollment. Safety and efficacy data will be collected in conjunction with routine visits conducted as per usual care. Although there are no protocol-mandated procedures, it is expected that physicians and other caregivers will follow published treatment guidelines and standards of care.</detailed_description>
