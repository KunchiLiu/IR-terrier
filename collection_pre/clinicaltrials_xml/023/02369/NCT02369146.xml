	<brief_title>To Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of UB-421 Monotherapy in HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two multi-dose regimens of UB-421 monotherapy in replacement of HAART in HIV-1 infected adults with virological suppression. In this study, approximately 28 subjects will be enrolled to receive one of the two UB-421 regimens as the monotherapy in replacement of HARRT treatment. Subjects assigned to Cohort 1 will receive UB-421 infusion at 10 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks; subjects assigned to Cohort 2 will receive UB-421 infusion at 25 mg/kg bi-weekly for 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
