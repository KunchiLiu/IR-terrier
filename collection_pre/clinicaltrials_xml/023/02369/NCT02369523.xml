	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to evaluate the length of time to discharge readiness between the groups (continuous femoral nerve blocks (cFNB) vs. liposomal bupivacaine (LB) vs. periarticular infusion cocktails (PIC) following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In addition, the investigators will compare quadriceps strength recovery over time and exploratory variables between the groups.</brief_summary>
