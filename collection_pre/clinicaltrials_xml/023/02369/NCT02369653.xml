	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a blood thinning drug called Apixaban versus no administration of a blood thinning drug, in preventing blood clots in children with leukemia or lymphoma. Patients must be receiving chemotherapy; including Pegylated L-Asparaginase and have a central line (a catheter inserted for administration of medications and blood sampling).</brief_summary>

Platelet Counts â‰¥ 20000/microL Subjects scheduled to have &gt; 3 Lumbar Punctures over the course of the treatment period Prior history of documented DVT or PE in the past 3 months Known inherited bleeding disorder or coagulopathy Major surgery [excluding Central Venous Access Device (CVAD) replacement and bone marrow aspiration and nonopen biopsy] within the last 7 days prior to enrollment that may be associated with a risk of bleeding. Open biopsy is considered a major surgery. Uncontrolled severe hypertension at enrollment. Severe hypertension is defined as a systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 5 mm Hg above the 95th percentile as defined by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group (NHBPEP) established guidelines for the definition of normal and elevated blood pressure in children Extreme hyperleukocytosis, white blood cell (WBC) counts over 200 x 109/L (200,000/microL) at the time of enrollment Liver dysfunction manifested by SGTP (ALT) &gt; 5X Upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;5 X ULN and/or direct (conjugated) bilirubin &gt; 2X ULN Renal function &lt; 30% of normal for age and size as determined by the Schwartz formula International normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.4 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt; 3 seconds above the upper limit of normal for age, within 1 week prior to enrollment. History of allergy to apixaban or Factor Xa inhibitors History of significant adverse reaction or major bleeding related adverse reaction to other anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents History of any significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatotoxicity Any investigational drug being administered during the study</criteria>
