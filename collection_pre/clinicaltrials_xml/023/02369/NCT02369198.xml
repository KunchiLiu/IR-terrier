	<brief_title>MesomiR 1: A Phase I Study of TargomiRs as 2nd or 3rd Line Treatment for Patients With Recurrent MPM and NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TargomiRs are targeted minicells containing a microRNA mimic. They consist of three components: 1. A miR-16-based microRNA mimic. The miR-16 family has been implicated as a tumour suppressor in a range of cancer types. The mimic is a double-stranded, 23 base pair, synthetic RNA molecule. 2. Drug delivery vehicle - EDVs. EDVs are nonliving bacterial minicells (nanoparticles). They function as leak resistant micro-reservoir carriers that allow efficient packaging of a range of different drugs, proteins or nucleic acids. 3. Targeting moiety. The EDVs are targeted to EGFR-expressing cancer cells with an anti-EGFR bispecific antibody. TargomiRs are IV injected. Phase 1 Planned dose levels Dose level 1: 5 billion once a week Dose level 2: 5 billion twice a week Dose level 3: 5 billion once a week with cardiac monitoring Dose level 4: 2.5 billion twice and week with cardiac monitoring Dose level 5: as above with an additional dexamethasone challenge All patients begin on a micro dose of 1 billion once a week and escalate to the full phase 1 dose for their dose level on week 3. Duration of treatment for each dose level is on a patient by patient basis. Officially the cycle is 8 weeks long however a patient can continue on treatment if they are deriving clinical benefit from the treatment. If at any time point before or after the 8 week mark, a patient progresses, experiences ongoing or unreasonable toxicities or withdraws from the study, they will cease treatment. Escalation of dose in cohorts of 3-6 patients per dose level. If at least 2 patients are observed to experience Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), the prior dose level is defined as the MTD. Adherence to the protocol tends not to be problematic in patient groups where the trial treatment is their only treatment option. They are often very keen to participate and motivated to be part of the research.</detailed_description>

Presence of Salmonella antibodies. Herbal supplements (such as St John's Wort), nutritional supplements and also (multi)vitamins taken within the last 30 days prior to dosing on Day 1 (and continued use, if appropriate), must be reviewed and approved by the local investigator.

The patient must not be undergoing acute steroid therapy or steroid tapering (Chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for one month prior to and following screening radiographic studies). Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis: Any hemorrhage or bleeding event of CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of the proposed start of study medication. Renal failure requiring hemoor peritoneal dialysis. Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results. Known hypersensitivity to bacterial proteins. Any medical condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the patient and his/her compliance in the study. Unresolved toxicity higher than NCICTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 2 attributed to any prior therapy/procedure excluding alopecia.</criteria>
