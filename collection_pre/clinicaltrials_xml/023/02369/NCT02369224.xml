	<brief_summary>A Cross- Sectional study; To assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of a hand-held dynamometer (HHD) in the assessment of lower extremity strength in patients with multiple sclerosis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Validation of The Evergreen Myometric Strength Test for Lower Extremities (EMST-LE) in Multiple Sclerosis: Protocol for Strength Testing and Reliability Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be tested at two visits separated by 1-21 days. At each visit, the patients would undergo bilateral lower extremity strength assessment by two physical therapists, independently and in the same order. Testing would include: hip flexion, knee extension, knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion Testing performed with 1) HHD (three trials recording maximum voluntary force) and 2) manual muscle testing (MMT), British Medical Research Council grade 0-5)</detailed_description>
