	<brief_summary>Emergency Medicine (EM) Residents routinely conduct bedside ultrasound exams in the Emergency Department (ED) employing the two point compression method. This study endeavors to investigate the accuracy and utility of bedside ultrasound for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the ED by EM Residents by comparing the results of that exam against the gold standard of a DVT ultrasound performed in the Radiology Department and interpreted by a Radiologist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DVT Ultrasound in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For subjects with suspicion of DVT to the Emergency Department, an EM Resident will perform a bedside non-diagnostic two point compression DVT Ultrasound. Subjects will then receive a diagnostic DVT Ultrasound in the Radiology Department with official radiologist interpretation. The bedside ultrasound will not interfere with or delay the diagnostic ultrasound. Patient demographic and clinical data will be collected for validation purposes. Validation of the The EM Resident interpretation will be accomplished by comparison to the official Radiologist interpretation.</detailed_description>
