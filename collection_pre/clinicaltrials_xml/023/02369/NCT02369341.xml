	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performing any study specific procedure. A male or female aged 18 years or above at the time of vaccination. Healthy subjects with wellcontrolled chronic diseases as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine during the period starting 30 days before the dose of study vaccine (Day 29 to Day 0), or planned use during the study period. Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs during the period starting six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs (e.g. rituximab, infliximab, etc.) within 6 months before study start, or planned administration during the study. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the study vaccination and during the entire study period. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting 3 months before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Administration of an influenza vaccine within the 6 months preceding the study start or planned use of such vaccines during the study period.. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device). Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within the six months preceding the study vaccination. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F, measured by any means. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Chronic underlying disease (such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease under oxygen therapy, insulindependent diabetes mellitus), not stabilised or clinically serious. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. History of GuillainBarré syndrome. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, including latex. History of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination. Anaphylaxis following the administration of vaccine(s). Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
