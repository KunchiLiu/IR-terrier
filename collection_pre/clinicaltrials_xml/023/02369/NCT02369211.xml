	<brief_summary>To examine pharmacoeconomics of IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev). Specifically, to examine its potential to improve hospital efficiency and patient outcomes. The investigators compare the addition of IV acetaminophen versus placebo on postoperative PACU recovery times, inpatient hospital length of stay (LOS), patient satisfaction scores, postoperative pain scores, consumption of opiates as rescue agents and side effects, and costs associated with postoperative medications among patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).</brief_summary>
