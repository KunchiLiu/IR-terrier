	<brief_title>Compassionate Treatment : An Exploratory Clinical Trial to Assess Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot clinical trial is design to see the safety and possible efficiency of ADSCs treatment in a ALS patient. one subjects will be treated (n=1). The patient will receive brain transplantation of ADSCs and combines intravenous infusion ADSCs 4 times. Subjects will be assessed by adverse effects and functional outcomes of clinical: PI max , PE max,and Haloscale respiration, ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS) are analyzed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months 9 months and 12 months. Brain MRI scans will be obtained before and after the treatment. Long term follow-up will be performed at 1, 6 , and 12months for safety reasons. Brain CT for check operation safety before and after brain implantation. Timing of Study: 12months recruitment period after approvals</detailed_description>
