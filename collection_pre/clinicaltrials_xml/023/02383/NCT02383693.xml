	<brief_title>Maintenance rTMS for Treatment-resistant Depression (TRD): a One-year Double Blind Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involves 40 TRD patients in a single site trial which consisted of two phases: an acute phase (phase I) in which all the participants receive active high-frequency stimulation during 4 blocks of five consecutive working days (Monday to Friday) in an open-label design and a maintenance phase (phase II) in which responders (&gt; 49% HDRS-17 reduction from baseline) at the end of the phase I are randomized in two arms with sham or active high-frequency rTMS maintenance treatment for the eleven following months. The rhythm of rTMS sessions in this maintenance phase is gradually reduced as follows: 3 sessions per week for 2 weeks, 2 session per week for the 2 following weeks, 1 session per week the third (M3) and fourth month (M4) and then 1 session every fortnight the last eight months (M5 to M12).</detailed_description>
