	<brief_summary>Cocaine-use disorders continue to be a significant public health concern, yet no effective medications have been identified. The goal of this study is to establish a research platform for the development of medications for treatment of cocaine abuse and dependence. This study will incorporate choice self-administration procedures between drug and a non-drug alternative reinforcer presented during maintenance on d-amphetamine, which has been previously shown to reduce cocaine use.</brief_summary>
