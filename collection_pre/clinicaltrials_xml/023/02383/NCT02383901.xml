	<brief_title>A Retrospective Non-intervention Study to Characterize FOlate Rescue Treatment in Osteosarcoma Patients Treated With HDMTX</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methotrexate is one of the most effective chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of osteosarcoma. However, it has severe side effects. The physicians tries to save or "rescue" normal cells from the side effects of methotrexate by giving folinic acid. Folinic acid administration starts 24 hours after methotrexate and given regularly until methotrexate levels are low and not dangerous to normal cells anymore. Despite this rescue, side effects are still a problem and many patients are not well enough to receive subsequent chemotherapy on time. This is a multi-center, observational retrospective study with osteosarcoma patients, 2 years of age or older, who have received at least one (1) course of HDMTX treatment with folate rescue in a MAP schedule between 01January 2009 and 31 May 2014, both dates included. Patients must have initiated their HDMTX treatment after 01 January 2009, received at least one (1) course of HDMTX treatment with folate rescue, and received their last MAP intervention (regardless if the patients received all planned HDMTX treatments or terminated prematurely their treatment) by 31 May 2014. Patient data collected for the study will be extracted from hospital medical records and will include information related to scheduled and/or received HDMTX courses. The collected data will include: laboratory values confirming suitability to receive next chemotherapy intervention at scheduled time, drug administration regimen (both HDMTX and supportive care), toxicity management (hydration and folate rescue regimens), and toxicity monitoring.</detailed_description>
