	<brief_summary>Asthma is one of the main chronic diseases in childhood and it is characterized by the inflammation of airways. Individuals with chronic lung disease are more susceptible to present reduction in exercise tolerance due to pulmonary limitations. The pulmonary rehabilitation may improve the physical capacity in asthmatic patients, as observed in other chronic lung diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Asthmatic Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The asthmatic patient's clinical changes may impair their functional capacity and exercise tolerance. Thus, the treatment of these individuals should be extended to pulmonary rehabilitation. Randomized clinical trials have shown interesting results, whether in cardiopulmonary conditions, quality of life or in the number of crises, after applying pulmonary rehabilitation program in asthmatic children and adolescents. In a systematic review on physical training with asthmatic children and adolescents the authors concluded that physical activity should be recommended to this population, although some issues have not yet been clarified due to limitations in the clinical trial. The control of the disease has not been evaluated by specific questionnaires in any study. The assessment of inflammatory markers was rarely addressed and the same occurred in the quality of life after physical training. In addition, it is possible to question the intensity and frequency of training, factors that can significantly contribute to the intervention results. All these information let us know that is necessary a randomized control trial to answer questions about physical characteristics, quality of life, inflammatory markers, and muscles strength.</detailed_description>
