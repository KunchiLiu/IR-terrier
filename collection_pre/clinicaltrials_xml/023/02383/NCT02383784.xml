	<brief_summary>Background/Aims: Verify the effects of glycemic index (GI) on body composition, and on inflammatory and metabolic markers concentrations. Methods: Eighteen type 2 diabetics, (aged 42.4 + 5.1 years, BMI 29.2 + 4.8 kg.m-2) were randomly allocated to low GI (LGI) or high GI (HGI) groups. High or low GI meals were provided in the laboratory twice a day during 30 consecutive days. The other meals were consumed under free living condition and subjects were instructed to select foods presenting GI values corresponding to the allocated group. Body composition (body mass index, body fat percentage, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio), and inflammatory markers concentrations (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, high molecular weight adiponectin, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) and metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, free fatty acids, triglycerides and fructosamine) were assessed at baseline and after intervention. Food intake was monitored during the study. The criterion for statistical significance was P&lt;0.05.</brief_summary>
