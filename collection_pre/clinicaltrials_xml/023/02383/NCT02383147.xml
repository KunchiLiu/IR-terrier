	<brief_summary>Chronic tinnitus affects about 10-15% of the population in industrialized countries. Investigations of the brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG) showed that in localized regions of the hearing system brain activity was decreased. This reduction of activity is thought to be one of the reasons that keep the perception of the tinnitus going. Recent studies have shown that neurofeedback is a viable option for treatment of chronic tinnitus. By using neurofeedback it is possible to train brain functions by the simple principle of rewarding wanted changes and punishing unwanted ones. The purpose of the investigators study is to show the efficacy of specific localized neurofeedback training in comparison to global relaxing neurofeedback training. In order to achieve decreased tinnitus symptoms or even disappearance of the tinnitus, 15 neurofeedback trainings are planned. Before and up to 6 month after the training EEG-recordings are performed.</brief_summary>
