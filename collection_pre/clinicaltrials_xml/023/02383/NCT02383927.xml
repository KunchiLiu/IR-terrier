	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Tipifarnib in Squamous Head and Neck Cancer With HRAS Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic, relapsed and/or refractory tumors that carry HRAS mutations and for whom there is no curative therapy available. Subject with information available on tumor HRAS status previously generated are eligible. All subjects must consent to provide at least 10 tumor slides from a prior diagnostic biopsy for a retrospective testing of RAS gene status at a central facility. Subjects will be enrolled into two nonrandomized cohorts: - Cohort 1: Malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations. - Cohort 2: Squamous Head and Neck Cancer with HRAS mutations.</detailed_description>
