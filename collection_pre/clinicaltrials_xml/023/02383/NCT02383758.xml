	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to try to treat bowel movement (BM) accidents differently with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study will use over-the-counter (OTC) medications to evoke predictable bowel movements. This will make it possible for investigators to use certain strategies to reward BMs in the toilet. Independence will be increased by fading out the use of medications. The investigators will also train caregivers to implement the procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Treatment of Encopresis in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large percentage of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are delayed in achieving continence with bowel movements or never achieve it at all (i.e., they meet criteria for encopresis). This problem has tremendous ramifications for these individuals and their families because encopresis restricts them from integration with peers, limits access to educational opportunities, and carries significant social stigma. Previous interventions for encopresis in this population have either been unsuccessful or required implementation over very long periods.</detailed_description>
