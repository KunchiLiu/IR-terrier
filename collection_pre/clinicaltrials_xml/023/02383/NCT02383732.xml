	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the Elopement Prevention Safety (EPST) program in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who have engaged in eloping. This is a program created by the Behavior Treatment Clinics to help caregivers come up with a safety plan to prevent their children from running away or wandering off.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A large number of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a current or past history of elopement. For parents of a child with ASD, having their child go missing is potentially dangerous and far more likely compared to typically developing children. This behavior interferes with household routines, engenders vigilance, and restricts the family's participation in their community. Such restrictions contribute to the family's isolation and hinders development of community supports. Elopement can result in injuries and deaths of children with ASD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males and females, ages 4 to 12 inclusive 2. Diagnosis of ASD as determined by clinical interview and supported by standardized measures (i.e., Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule2, Vineland, StanfordBinet V) 3. Engages in elopement in the form of bolting or wandering, as determined by structured interview 4. A caregiver who expresses a willingness to participate in treatment and complete baseline/outcome assessments. 1. Unmanaged psychopathology or problem behavior other than elopement that warrants immediate clinical care, determined by clinical interview and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) 2. Child and family currently in therapy that is likely to be redundant with the treatment program or interfere with proposed treatment 3. Presence of both of the types of elopement under investigation (i.e., both bolting and wandering).</criteria>
