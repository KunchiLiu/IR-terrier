	<brief_title>Dermal Suturing Only Versus Layered Cutaneous Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single layer dermally sutured wound results in superior outcomes to a layered closure. Our aims are to compare outcomes using a split wound model, where half the wound is sutured with one technique and the other half is sutured with the other. This will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument and via wound width. Our hypothesis is that wounds with a single layer closure will result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.</detailed_description>
