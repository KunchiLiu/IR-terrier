	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well regorafenib and gemcitabine hydrochloride work as second-line therapy (treatment given when initial treatment doesn't work) in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving regorafenib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regorafenib Plus Gemcitabine in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy (progression-free survival) of regorafenib and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in previously treated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of regorafenib in combination with gemcitabine. II. To assess response rate (RR). III. To assess overall survival (OS). OUTLINE: Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (or any mixed pathology if adenocarcinoma is predominant) Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan Prior Therapies: Patients must have received at least one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen for metastatic pancreatic cancer. They should have experienced disease progression or intolerable toxicity from that regimen. Patients who have received prior nongemcitabinebased systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease at any time 4 weeks prior to enrollment, or those who are beyond 12 months of exposure to gemcitabinebased chemotherapy regimen are allowed. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, concurrent chemoradiation are allowed if used for treatment of nonmetastatic disease. Any chemotherapy must have been completed 4 weeks prior to enrollment Any radiotherapy must have been completed 2 weeks prior to enrollment Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months) Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed consent form;
