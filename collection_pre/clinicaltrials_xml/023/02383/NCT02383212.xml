	<criteria>Key 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy with demonstrated progression of a solid tumor (nonlymphoma) with no alternative standardofcare therapeutic option (certain exceptions may apply). 2. At least 1 measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for response assessment (certain exceptions may apply) 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Key 1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for immunerelated adverse events (irAEs). The following are not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood asthma that has resolved, residual hypothyroidism that required only hormone replacement or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment. 2. Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed death1/ programmed deathligand 1 (PD1/PDL1 pathway) (certain exceptions may apply) 3. Prior treatment with other immune modulating agents within fewer than 4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810. Examples of immune modulating agents include blockers of CTLA4, 41BB (CD137), OX40, therapeutic vaccines, or cytokine treatments. 4. Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (ie, without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), and there is no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and the patient does not require any systemic corticosteroids for management of brain metastases within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810 (certain exceptions may apply). 5. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810 The information provided above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to potential participation in a clinical trial ,therefore not all inclusion/ exclusion criteria are listed.</criteria>
