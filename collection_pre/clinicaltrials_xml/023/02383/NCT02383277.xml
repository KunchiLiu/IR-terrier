	<brief_title>Acute Effects of a Stretching Program of the Rib Cage Muscles on Patients With COPD During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the effects of a stretching program for the muscles of the rib cage or control in patients with COPD during exercise and / or the immediate post-exercise, using the following parameters: - Tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), minute volume (MV), inspiratory time (Tins) and expiratory (T exp). - Change in volumes of total and regional chest magazines (pulmonary rib cage, abdominal rib cage and abdomen). - Diaphragmatic mobility. - electrical muscle activity - endurance time. - Dyspnea sensation.</detailed_description>
