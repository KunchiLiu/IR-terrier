	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to compare electrocardiograms using ambulatory holter monitor with dry electrodes in a harness versus using an ambulatory holter with standard sticky electrodes (Red Dot) on monitored patients within the hospital. Patients will be simultaneously be hooked up to two ambulatory Holter monitors for the period of time to be not less than one hour. One holter will use standard electrodes in a standard electrode distribution. The second holter will use dry electrodes in a derived.</brief_summary>
