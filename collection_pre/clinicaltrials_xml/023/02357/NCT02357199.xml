	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the prevalence of oral infection in chronic renal disease patients and to examine whether a focused oral hygiene intervention can reduce oral infection leading to reduced systemic inflammatory parameters in chronic renal disease patients in hemodialysis, chronic renal disease patients waiting for kidney transplantation, and chronic renal disease patients who has been transplanted 1-1½ year previously. The results will be compared to a gender- and age-matched healthy control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interventional Study Targeting Oral Infections in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: The aim is to examine if a focused oral care procedure to reduce oral infection will be mirrored in reduction of systemic inflammatory parameters in chronic renal disease patients. Specific research questions: Can oral infection and systemic inflammatory parameters in chronic renal disease patients be reduced by 1 month of professional oral care and individual prophylactic instruction and can a potential reduction of inflammation be continuously achieved at a 3 months follow-up. Study design: Randomized, double-blinded (investigator, outcomes assessor), controlled study. For Eligibility Criteria and Outcome Measures, please see elsewhere in the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System. Participants: A: Hemodialysis patients, inclusion n=34, B: Hemodialysis patients on a kidney transplant waiting list, inclusion n=34, C: Patients who have had a kidney transplant (1-1½ years after transplantation), inclusion n=34. D: Gender- and age-matched healthy control group. Number of included patients is estimated from a hypothesis-generating pilot study, a statistical power analysis and the estimated loss to follow-up based on experience from previous research projects in the Nephrology Department. Intervention and control: The intervention consists of professional oral care (addressing periodontal and oral mucosal infections, salivary gland dysfunction and caries prevention) and a didactic approach to individual instruction in oral hygiene/prophylactic measures performed by a dental hygienist at three visits: baseline, 2 weeks after baseline and 1 month after baseline. The research data will be registered by a blinded investigator before the first visit at the dental hygienist and after 3 months. The control group will follow best-clinical-practice procedures currently implemented in the hospital.</detailed_description>
