	<brief_summary>The 3D-systems have emerged also to the world of surgery, and the three-dimensional laparoscopic systems are gradually entering the operating rooms. In the normal laparoscopy there are only two-dimensional view, which is somewhat challenging when operating in three-dimensional environment. Even though the 3D-systems have been widely studied in laboratory circumstances, there are still no evidence of benefits of 3D vs 2D in clinical point of view and no prospective randomized trials have been published. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate is there something to gain in changing into 3D laparoscopic system for cholecystectomy (LCC).</brief_summary>
