	<brief_summary>Phase 2 clinical trial, single site, randomized, subject-masked study to determine safety and efficacy of intravitreal injections of Sirolimus in subjects with wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD) with persistent intraretinal or subretinal edema due to neovascular AMD despite previous Anti-VEGF treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus Versus AntiVEGF for Wet AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty subjects will be randomized to receive intravitreal Sirolimus or standard of care treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Over the course of the six month trial plus a 6 month optional extention, subjects will be evaluated monthly. Treatment with Sirolimus will be given at baseline, month 2 and month 4 with sham injections given at months 1, 3 and 5. For subjects in the extension Sirolimus will also be given at months 6, 8 and 10 with sham at month 7, 9, and 11. Subjects in the standard of care group will receive anti-VEGF injections or sham monthly. Retreatment criteria will be based upon continued subretinal edema, intraretinal edema or active chorioretinal neovascularization (CNV)</detailed_description>
