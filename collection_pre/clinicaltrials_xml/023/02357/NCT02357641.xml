	<detailed_description>Patients with cardiac disorder have to undergo time- consuming and expensive examinations such as laboratory of cardiac biomarkers or ischemic diagnostic. To save time and money in this observational registry the probable distinction between cardiac and non- cardiac disorder in patients with vague thoracal disorder and the probability for coronary artery disease (determined via Grace Score) is examined via echographic myocardial strain analysis in 300 patients retrospectively to establish a cut off value corresponding to acute coronary disease also to prevent coronary angiography. Therefore patients undergo echography routinely with consecutive evaluation of systolic, diastolic and strain analysis to elevate exact statements with reference to deformation of the myocard and its velocity. Several study have shown that these strain parameters (circumferential and radial strain) enable vitality and ischemic diagnosis and therefore could be eligible for this purpose.</detailed_description>
