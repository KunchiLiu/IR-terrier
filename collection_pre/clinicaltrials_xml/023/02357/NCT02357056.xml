	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to objectively compare various training modalities currently available in minimally invasive and robotic surgery to determine the most effective training methods specific to robotic cardiac surgery. We hope to recruit medical trainees with minimal robotic surgery training experience, randomly assigned to one of three groups (Dry wab, da Vinci Simulator and Wet lab). Trainees will be evaluated at baseline for a standardized tasks common in robotic cardiac surgery and then divided into one of the three training modalities. Trainees will be given sufficient time to become proficient with a variety of predetermined tasks unique to each training group. The trainees will then undergo a reevaluation with the cardiac surgery specific tasks at the end of a standard training period. We will then be able to compare our three groups to show if any have benefits over the others in regards to improvement in technical ability, understanding of the robots functions, efficacy of training, speed of technical skill development, accuracy and efficiency of movement. We will rate each modality on their reproducibility, accuracy of representation, and ease of set up and perform a cost analysis for each of the training methods.</brief_summary>
