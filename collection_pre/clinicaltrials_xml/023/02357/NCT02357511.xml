	<brief_title>Validation of Pulse Waveform Analysis-based Continuous Noninvasive Blood Pressure Measurement Sensor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitor is compared to invasive arterial measurement at postoperative care unit after a planned operation. Monitor captures also saturation and ECG, which are compared to traditional monitoring.</detailed_description>
