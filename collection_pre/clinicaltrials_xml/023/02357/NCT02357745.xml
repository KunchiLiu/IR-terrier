	<brief_summary>Neopterin has been identified as a marker of cellular immune system activation. It is synthesized by macrophages upon stimulation with the cytokine interferon-gamma and is indicative of a pro-inflammatory immune status. Neopterin concentration increases with increasing severity of periodontal disease in diverse body fluids like Urine, Saliva and Plasma. Hence Neopterin can be considered as an important inflammatory marker in periodontal disease as well as other systemic diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Neopterin Levels in Pre and Post-menopausal Women With Periodontitis Following Non Surgical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline - plasma, urine and saliva samples were collected and analysed for neopterin levels from the pre and post-menopausal women with periodontitis . Followed by scaling and root planing done in both the groups. After 3 months again these 3 samples were collected and analysed for post treatment neopterin levels</detailed_description>
