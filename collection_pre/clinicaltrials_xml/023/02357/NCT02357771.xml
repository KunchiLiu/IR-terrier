	<brief_summary>Advances in orthodontics have improved the quality of appliances and treatment protocols, raising the standard of patient care. However, enamel demineralization is still a problem associated with orthodontic treatment, leading to the formation of white spot lesions; this is a grave concern to orthodontists and patients. The overall prevalence of white spot lesions among orthodontic patients has been reported to be between 4.9% and 84%.1 When basic oral hygiene is poor, orthodontic appliances create areas of plaque stagnation, especially around brackets, bands, wires, and other attachments. Levels of acidogenic bacteria, present in the plaque, notably Streptococcus mutans (S mutans), are higher in orthodontic patients than in non-orthodontic patients. This causes demineralization around the brackets and leads to white spot lesions. They are most prevalent around the cervical region of bands in the posterior region, whereas in the anterior region, the lateral incisors in both arches, followed by the canines, are most commonly affected.</brief_summary>
