The investigators will also look at associations of abnormal cardiovascular findings and immediate complications among a high risk cohort of pregnant African American women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Cardiovascular Outcomes in Women With Preeclampsia Using Echocardiography: The SCOPE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective cohort study. Exposed cases will be admitted to the inpatient obstetrical unit (labor &amp; delivery or antepartum unit) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with concern for severe preterm preeclampsia. Unexposed controls will be matched by gestational age and other clinical factors and will be obtained from the outpatient setting (Helen O Dickens clinic or Penn ObGyn Associates at 3701 Market Street). The investigators will compare cardiovascular risk factors between these two groups.</detailed_description>
