	<detailed_description>Each subject enrolled in the study will be requested to follow the device instructions and perform his/her own finger-stick test using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). Immediately after the subject tested him/herself a trained nurse/technician will collect another blood sample from the subject for testing by the YSI. The subject will complete a usability questionnaire on his/her experience using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) and the nurse/technician will complete a questionnaire assessing the subject's performance. A venous blood sample for CBC will be taken by the nurse/technician and sent for analysis.</detailed_description>
