	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Refractory Hypertension (Carvedilol)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Refractory hypertension refers to high blood pressure that is failing conventional antihypertensive therapies. In a retrospective assessment of such patients in our clinic we observed that resting clinic heart rates were higher in patients with refractory hypertension compared to patients with controlled hypertension. This observation has led to the hypothesis that refractory hypertension is caused by excessive sympathetic output. This protocol is designed to test this hypothesis by comparing the BP response to carvedilol verses chlorthalidone in patients with refractory hypertension. If their extreme treatment resistance is neurogenic is etiology, a significantly larger BP response to carvedilol should occur compared to chlorthalidone.</detailed_description>
