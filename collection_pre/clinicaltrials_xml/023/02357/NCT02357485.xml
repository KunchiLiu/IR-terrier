	<brief_summary>This safety and feasibility study used autologous adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSC), the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), to treat 8 osteoarthritic (OA) knees in 6 patients of grade I to III (K-L scale) with initial pain of 4 or greater on a 10 point scale, under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This safety and feasibility study used autologous adipose-derived stromal cells, the stromal vascular fraction, to treat 8 osteoarthritic knees in 6 patients of grade I to III (K-L scale) with initial pain of 4 or greater on a 10 point scale, under IRB-approved protocol. Evaluation of the safety of intra-articular injection of the stromal vascular fraction cells was the primary objective of the study. Adipose-derived stromal vascular cells were obtained through enzymatic disaggregation of lipoaspirate, resuspended in 3 ml of Lactated Ringer's Solution, and injected directly into the intra-articular space with a mean of 12 million viable nucleated SVF cells per knee.</detailed_description>
