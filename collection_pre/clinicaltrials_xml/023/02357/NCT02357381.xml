	<brief_title>eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational US Study of Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multi-center observational study designed to evaluate the use of the SpringTMS system in reducing the frequency of headache days. Note: This is a NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK (NSR) study of a NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK (NSR) Device. It is a post market study of a NSR device cleared by FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process. The cleared indications for use are provided above. This NSR study is designed to collect information on additional applications of the SpringTMS device. These additional applications include: 1. Use of the device to evaluate the potential for regular use of sTMS to reduce the frequency, severity, and/or duration of migraine. 2. Delivery of additional treatments (pulses) to evaluate the acute treatment efficacy of breakthrough migraine attacks with and without aura.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients 18 to 65 years of age; 2. Patients able to understand and communicate in English; 3. Migraine with or without aura; 4. 425 headache days per month (confirmed by 1month baseline diary, minimum of 5 complete headachefree days/month); 5. Understand and willing to provide diary and survey data. Subjects will be excluded from participating in this trial if they meet any of the following criteria 1. Severe coexisting disease having a life expectancy of less than 1 year; 2. Currently involved in any other investigational clinical trials that have not completed their primary endpoint or that may interfere with the SpringTMS study results; 3. Mental impairment or other conditions which may not allow the subject to understand the nature, significance and scope of the study and to cooperate with followup requirements; 4. Known drug and/or alcohol addiction or use of illicit substances; 5. Patients with epilepsy or history of seizure; 6. Severe active major depression or major psychiatric illness; 7. Concurrent use of other neurostimulation devices (Cefaly®, TENS, implantable devices); 8. Use of Botox® within past 4 months; 9. Extracranial nerve block (e.g. occipital, supraorbital) within past 3 months; 10. Use of Cefaly for prevention within past month; 11. Patients with metal containing implants as follows: The SpringTMS may not be used in patients who have metals, conductive materials, or metalcontaining implants in their head, neck or upper body. Patients with implants that are affected by a magnetic field should not use the SpringTMS. Examples of such implants include: Aneurysm clips or coils • Radioactive seeds Cochlear implants • Magnetically programmable shunt valves Cerebral spinal fluid shunts • Stents Bullets or pellets lodged in the head or upper body • Metal plates, screws, staples or sutures in skull, neck, shoulders, arms or hands Filters • Metallic artificial heart valves Electrodes • Facial tattoos with metallic ink Dental implants, fillings, or other dental appliances are okay and are not affected by the device. Note: although not explicitly excluded, safety and effectiveness have not been established in pregnant women. Please defer to the judgment of the investigator when considering the eligibility of this population.</criteria>
