	<brief_summary>Charcot Marie Tooth 1A (CMT 1A) is a common inherited disorder of the nerves in the body. The disease can result in difficulties with strength and balance as well as in foot deformities such as high arches, hammer toes, and tight ankles. Because of these difficulties, the disease may affect driving, especially because driving requires quick responses at times such as slamming on the brakes or turning the steering wheel quickly. The following study determines driving performance in individuals who have CMT 1A.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Driving Ability in Patients With CMT 1A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with CMT 1A will drive in a driving simulator, which involves a car located in a room in the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC). Individuals will drive in the car as if they are driving in real life and the whole experience is like playing a car video game with a big animated screen. The driving results will be compared to similar aged patients who don't have CMT 1A and have also taken the driving test. If patients with CMT 1A do have driving difficulties compared to those who do not have CMT 1A, the results of the study will try to help patients with CMT1A drive better by ultimately creating devices that might help them use the steering wheel or brake pedal in a safer way.</detailed_description>
