	<brief_summary>Children between the ages of 5-17 years old who have or display symptoms of emotional dysregulation (explosiveness, mood swings, irritability, and/or violent behavior) are invited to participate in a 12-week research study to determine the effectiveness and safety of the natural treatment N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for children with emotional and behavioral problems. After undergoing a comprehensive evaluation by medical doctors with a specialty in this area, children who are found eligible to participate in this research study will be treated with NAC. Following the evaluation period, this research study requires 12 weekly visits, either in our office or over the phone, in an effort to closely monitor each child's response to the medication. Eligible participants will receive study-related evaluations and weekly study visits with our study doctors at no cost.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study of N-Acetylcysteine in Children and Adolescents 5-17 With Bipolar Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a 12-week, open-label study of NAC in the treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. Subjects will include youth ages 5-17 years with a bipolar spectrum disorder (type I, II, or NOS), mixed, manic, or hypomanic state, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The primary outcome measures will be improvement in manic symptoms as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Child Depression Rating Scale (CDRS). Bipolar diagnoses will be made according to the DSM-5 in a clinical evaluation by a Child Psychiatrist and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children - Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E)(Orvaschel, 1994). All subjects must have a YMRS score of at least 20. Only patients who are not responding to their current treatment regimen will be tapered from their medications; youth on concomitant psychiatric medications will be permitted to continue those medications as listed in the concomitant medication section.</detailed_description>
