	<brief_title>A Trial of E-cigarettes in Current Cigarette Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study initiation will commence after the first telephone contact (phone pre-screen), at the baseline visit. Additional lab visits will occur at days 8, 15, and 22 (visits 2-4). At the first study visit, 2/3rds of the participants will be randomly assigned to sample e-cigarettes and 1/3rd will not. Participants in the e-cigarette group will be provided with sufficient product to sample and use as they wish, but with minimal instruction on purpose and level of use (non-use is an outcome). Smokers in the control group will smoke their own brand of cigarettes, as they wish, for the duration of the sampling period. All participants will engage in ecological momentary assessments, which will be completed 3 times daily for 3 weeks. In-person follow-up assessments will be conducted at 1, 2, and 3 months after the final lab visit (Day 22). Overall, each participant will be contacted 8 times: at the phone pre-screening, the 4 lab visits, and 3 follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
