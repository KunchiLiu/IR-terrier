	<brief_summary>A multicenter, randomized phase III study to compare chemo- versus endocrine therapy in combination with dual HER2-targeted therapy of Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and Perjeta® (pertuzumab) in patients with HER2 positive and hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Especially for diseases that are not curable such as metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the maintenance of quality of life is one of the main aims of treatments. Adverse events are well-known side effects of any cytostatic treatment and impact the patients' quality of life. Therefore, new treatment options are developed that should stop or at least slow down metastatic spread of cancer without causing negative side effects in terms of high-grade adverse events. For patients with hormone-receptor positive and HER2 positive MBC the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with endocrine therapy has already been proven to be an effective and in many cases valuable alternative to the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy. The high relevance of HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combinations derives from the fact that potential chemotherapy-related toxicity can be avoided, which in turn positively affects quality of life.The combination of dual HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus endocrine therapy might offer a better treatment option in patients with HER2 positive and hormone-receptor positive MBC. However, this combination has not been evaluated and compared to the combination of dual HER2-targeted plus chemotherapy in a prospective randomized phase III clinical trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients will be included in the study only if they meet all the following criteria: Signed, written informed consent in study participation The primary tumor and/or biopsies from metastatic sites or locoregional recurrences have been confirmed as HER2positive (FISHpositive or immunohistochemistry IHC 3+) and hormone receptor positive breast cancer by histopathology. Metastatic breast cancer which cannot be treated by surgery or radiotherapy only No more than two prior chemotherapies for the metastatic disease Tumor evaluation has been performed within 4 weeks before randomization Age ≥ 18 years Left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% at baseline (as measured by echocardiogram) ECOG Score ≤ 2 Adequate organ function within 14 days before randomization, evidenced by the following laboratory results below: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/µL, platelet count ≥ 100000 cells/µL, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.0 × upper limit of normal ULN (≤ 3.0 × ULN in case of liver metastases) AST (SGOT, aspartate aminotransferase ) ≤ 2.0 × ULN (≤ 3.0 × ULN in case of liver metastases) bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome) creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or 177µmol/L In case of patients of child bearing potential: Negative serum pregnancy test at baseline (within 7 days prior to randomization) and agreement to remain abstinent (if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle) or use single or combined nonhormonal contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons: History of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to trastuzumab or pertuzumab or to other components of drug formulation Mandatory need for cytostatic treatment at time of study entry based on clinical judgment and relevant guidelines Any concurrent severe, uncontrolled systemic disease, social or psychiatric condition that might interfere with the planned treatment and with the patient's adherence to the protocol Previous treatment with pertuzumab Treatment with any other investigational agents during trial Life expectancy &lt; 3 months History of serious cardiac disease, including but not confined to: history of documented heart failure or systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 50%) highrisk uncontrolled arrhythmias i.e., atrial tachycardia with a heart rate ≥100/min at rest, significant ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia) or highergrade AVblock (second degree AVblock Type 2 [Mobitz 2] or third degree AVblock) angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication clinically significant valvular heart disease evidence of transmural infarction on ECG poorly controlled hypertension (e.g., systolic &gt;180 mm Hg or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg) any other cardiac condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient Dyspnea at rest or other diseases that require continuous oxygen therapy Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or with evidence of clinically significant diabetic vascular complications Patients with known infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus Male patients Pregnant, lactating or women of childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test (serum) within 7 days prior to randomization, irrespective of the method of contraception used Medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the subject to complete the study or sign informed consent Participation in another clinical study within the 30 days before registration Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity</criteria>
