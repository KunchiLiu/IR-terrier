	<brief_summary>The study is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, with additional infrastructure support provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. People infected with HIV are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study will evaluate the use of pitavastatin to reduce the risk of CVD in adults infected with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Use of Pitavastatin to Reduce the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in HIV-Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there are few strategies to prevent CVD in HIV-infected people, even though they are at high risk for developing CVD. Statin medications are used to lower cholesterol and may be effective at reducing the risk of CVD in people infected with HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of pitavastatin to reduce the risk of CVD in adults infected with HIV who are on ART. This study will enroll adults infected with HIV who are on any ART regimen (ART is not provided by the study) for at least 6 months before study entry considered low-to-moderate risk using the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline thresholds for recommended statin initiation. Total study duration will be approximately 72 months from the time the first participant is enrolled. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 4 mg of pitavastatin or placebo once a day for the entire time they are enrolled in the study. Study visits will occur at study entry (Day 0) and Months 1 and 4. Starting at Month 4, study visits will occur every 4 months for the rest of the study. Depending on when participants enroll, they will be in the study for a total of 3 Â½ to 6 years. Study visits will include medical and medication history reviews, physical examinations, blood collections, assessments and questionnaires, urine collections (for some participants), and an electrocardiogram (ECG) (at study entry only). Some participants will have the option of enrolling in a substudy (Effects of Pitavastatin on Coronary Artery Disease and Inflammatory Biomarkers: Mechanistic Substudy of REPRIEVE [A5333s]). The substudy will evaluate the effect of pitavastatin on the progression of non-calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque (NCP) and inflammatory biomarkers in adults infected with HIV. Participants in the substudy will attend study visits at study entry and Months 4 and 24. The visits will include questionnaires and assessments, a blood collection, and a coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).</detailed_description>

NOTE: Use of oral prednisone less than or equal to 10 mg/day is allowed. Current use of erythromycin, colchicine, or rifampin Use of any statin drugs, gemfibrozil, or PCSK9 inhibitors in the 90 days prior to study entry Current use of an investigational new drug that would be contraindicated Serious illness or trauma requiring systemic treatment or hospitalization in the 30 days prior to study entry Current pregnancy or breastfeeding Alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with completion of study procedures Other medical, psychiatric, or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with completion of study procedures and or adherence to study drug</criteria>
