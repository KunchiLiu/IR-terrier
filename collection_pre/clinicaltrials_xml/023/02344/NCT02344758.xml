	<brief_title>Gluten-free Diet Monitoring in Urine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, the mainstay of the management of CD is a strict life-long adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). Follow-up monitoring of the improvement of patients on GFD is essential to assess symptomatic recovery and to monitor complications, as well as to assist patients with dietary compliance. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance and to detect the origin of an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available. In this study, we have overcome these challenges and shown the feasibility of measuring gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine samples in healthy and celiac individuals by solid phase extraction and estimating the peptide concentrations with a reader of anti-GIP moAb immunochromatographic strips (IC-strips).</detailed_description>
