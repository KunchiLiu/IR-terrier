	<brief_title>Nerve Stimulator Versus Ultrasound-guided Infraclavicular Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound (US)-guided peripheral nerve block has increased in popularity. It has many advantages such as improved success rate, faster onset time, fewer needle passes, shorter performance time, and reduced procedural pain and vascular puncture. However, there is no information about postoperative analgesia. Therefore, the investigators tested whether ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block enhanced the postoperative analgesia for upper extremity surgery compared with nerve stimulator (NS) guidance.</detailed_description>
