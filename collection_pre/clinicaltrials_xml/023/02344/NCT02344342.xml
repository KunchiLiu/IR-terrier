	<brief_title>University of Michigan Advanced Heart Failure Tele-Monitoring and Flexible Diuretic Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed project is a 2x2 factorial designed study aimed at assessing the impact of 1) a home tele-monitoring system and 2) a flexible diuretic regimen among high risk heart failure patients in the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS). The first intervention consists of the use of a home monitoring tool utilizing a tablet interface. The device facilitates collection of heart failure patient self-care information, including weight, blood pressure, heart rate and heart failure symptoms. This information is collected and stored on a secured server provided by the vendor, and can be viewed by the physician and nursing team. The second intervention is a flexible diuretic regimen strategy. This intervention will be applied in an independent randomized fashion. The flexible regimen will be prescribed by the patient's physician. The two interventions will be applied to heart failure patients treated at the University of Michigan. A total of 400 patients will be enrolled into the study.</detailed_description>
