	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluates adding high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to standard of care treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (a type of brain tumor) in adults. All subjects will receive high-dose ascorbate in addition to the standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial of High-Dose Ascorbate in Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involves maximum safe surgical resection followed by radiation combined with temozolomide (a chemotherapy pill you take by mouth). After radiation, patients receive additional cycles of temozolomide (adjuvant chemotherapy). Participants will: - receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate three times a week during the combined radiation and chemotherapy phase - receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate twice a week during adjuvant chemotherapy (after radiation) - complete health-related quality of life questionnaires pre-radiation, 4 weeks into radiation, 4 weeks after radiation, and then every 3 months. In addition, patients will complete neurocognitive testing pre-radiation, 4 weeks into radiation, 4 weeks after radiation, and approximately 9 months after initiating radiation therapy. The adjuvant chemotherapy portion of this study lasts for 6 months. After that is completed, participants will go back to standard therapy for their cancer. Participants will continue to have life-long follow-up for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have newly diagnosed (i.e., within 5 weeks), histologically or cytologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme. Diagnosis must be made by surgical biopsy or excision. Therapy must begin ≤ 5 weeks after surgery or biopsy Age ≥ 18 years ECOG performance status 02. (KPS &gt; 50) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells per mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000 per mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ALT ≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal AST ≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal Tolerate one test dose (15g) of ascorbate. Not pregnant. Recurrent high grade glioma G6PD (glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency. Patients actively receiving insulin or using a fingerstick glucometer daily for blood glucose measurements History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to temozolomide. Significant comorbid central nervous system disease, including but not limited to, multiple sclerosis. Patients who are on the following drugs and cannot have a drug substitution: warfarin, flecainide, methadone, amphetamines, quinidine, and chlorpropamide. Prior invasive malignancies (except nonmelanomatous skin cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder) unless disease free for ≥ 5 years. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy (including Gliadel wafers) for the current glioma. Prior radiation therapy to the head or neck resulting in overlap of RT fields. Patients receiving any other investigational agents (imaging agents are acceptable) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women. Breastfeeding women. Known HIVpositive individuals. Highdose ascorbate acid is a known CYP450 3A4 inducer, which results in lower serum levels of antiretroviral drugs.</criteria>
