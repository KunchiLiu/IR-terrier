	<brief_summary>Brugada syndrome is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome with an increased risk of syncope and sudden death resulting from episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachychardia and fibrillation. Currently, there is no medical therapy for the Brugada syndrome and the only treatment available is the implantation of an ICD. There is no discussion on the interest of the ICD implantation in secondary prevention and in patients who experienced syncope but the best therapeutic is more difficult to draw in asymptomatic patients. Recently we demonstrated that in asymptomatic patients with a spontaneous type 1 aspect of Brugada syndrome, (i) there was a significant risk of ventricular arrhythmia, (ii) the problem of inappropriate shocks can be solve with a good ICD programming and (iii) the problem of lead failure remains the main problem in this young population very active and represent the main limitation to larger indication of ICD implantation in this population with a very long life expectancy as these patients had a normal life expectancy except the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. In this context the S-ICD System (Boston Scientific Inc.) which is an implantable defibrillator technology that treats ventricular tachyarrhythmias using a subcutaneous pulse generator and electrode system rather than a transvenous lead system, represents a very attractive opportunity as it gives the possibility to protect the patients of the risk of ventricular arrhythmia with no risk of lead failure. However, as this is a new technology and as Brugada syndrome patients are a very specific population (very active patients, specific and changing over time ECG aspect that is at risk of T wave over sensing and high risk of SVT), it seems important to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of S-ICD in this specific context.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient with type I Brugada syndrome eligible for implantation of an SICD system: Symptomatic : (history of resuscitated sudden death, syncope) with an ECG showing an aspect of Brugada syndrome type I before or after pharmacological tests (ajmaline or flecainide test) according to the criteria of the consensus conference and after ECG validation by the Clinical Events Committee experts. Asymptomatic: with an aspect of spontaneous type I Brugada syndrome after ECG validation by the Clinical Events Committee experts. Brugada syndrome patient with Indication for ICD replacement. No contraindication for SICD implantation (anatomic or physiologic criteria) with particular attention to the validation of the ECG prescreening implantation. For this study at least 2 vectors must be suitable for SICD implantation. Patients whose age is 18 years or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and national law. Patients who are willing and capable of providing informed consent, participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an approved clinical investigational center. Incessant ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or documented spontaneous, frequently recurring VT that is reliably terminated with antitachycardia pacing. Patients with unipolar pacemakers or implanted devices that revert to unipolar pacing. Presence of any severe medical condition such that the patient is not expected to survive for the planned study followup period. Minor, patient under trusteeship or under guardianship. Patients who currently participate in an investigational drug or device that clinically interferes with the SICDBrugada registry study endpoints and results. Female of childbearing potential without adequate contraception at the time of the implantation. Inability to comply with the followup schedule.</criteria>
