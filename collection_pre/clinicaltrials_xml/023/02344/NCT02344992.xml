	<brief_summary>The addition of BioChaperone to already marketed prandial insulin analogue accelerates the onset and shorten the duration of action of insulin lispro due to facilitation of the absorption of the insulin after subcutaneous injection. This trial is intented to compare the post-prandial blood glucose control of BioChaperone insulin lispro and Humalog® when injected after a standardized meal as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of BioChaperone insulin lispro and Humalog® in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover phase Ib trial to compare the blood glucose control after ingestion of a standardized meal, with BioChaperone Lispro at 0.2U/Kg and Humalog at 0.2U/Kg.</brief_summary>
