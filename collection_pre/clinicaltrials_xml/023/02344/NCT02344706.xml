	<brief_summary>A large proportion of patients (up to 20%) who suffer from an epileptic seizure and remain unconscious suffer from a non-convulsive epileptic seizure. The condition is difficult to diagnose, and impossible without the required instruments. Electroencephalogram is required in the diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus. Presently, the diagnostic value and implementation of such a device in the prehospital field is little studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of the acquired electroencephalogram with a prototype EEG/EKG adapter connected to a Physio-Control LifePak 15 defibrillator/monitor. The EEG is registered in a otherwise normal fashion with scalp-electrodes, but only three channels are monitored, as this is deemed sufficient for the prehospital field, as well as for monitoring the epileptic seizures.</brief_summary>
