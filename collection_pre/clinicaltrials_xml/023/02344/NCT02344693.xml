	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac death can occur due to a multitude of causes. The underlying case can affect the overall prognosis. A return of spontaneous circulation not exceeding 30 minutes following a successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation is usually deemed imperative, if the patient is to survive. Monitors for evaluating the cardiac function during and after resuscitation are implemented on a daily basis (ekg, pulseoxymetry, blood pressure monitoring, cardiac sonography), but no devices for registration of the cortical brain activity exist. The aim of this study is to provide a 3-channel electroencephalogram using a prototype EEG/EKG adapter, connected to a Physio-Control LifePak 15 monitor/defibrillator, in patients who regain spontaneous circulation following non-traumatic cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>
