	<brief_summary>Urodynamics are performed in the evaluation of urinary incontinence in women considering surgery or who have failed conservative therapies. Urodynamic testing requires the placement of small catheters into the bladder and the vagina or rectum. Many women experience anxiety around the procedure which can affect patient satisfaction. Lavender aromatherapy has been associated with decreased anxiety in a variety of clinical situations. The purpose of this study is to determine a difference in self-reported anxiety and pain levels before, during, and after multichannel urodynamics in patients given lavender aromatherapy versus placebo. This study design is a randomized control trial. Women scheduled for urodynamic testing at the Los Angeles County University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Urogynecology clinic will be invited to participate. Participants will be randomized to the aromatherapy or the placebo group after informed consent is obtained and immediately before undergoing multichannel urodynamics. The participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Survey (HADS) at baseline. They will be asked to rate their level of anxiety and pain before, during, and 15 min after the study using the visual analogue scale and Wong-Baker pain scale. At the end the participants will also be asked to rate their satisfaction with the visit overall. The primary endpoint is defined as anxiety immediately after catheters are placed. Data will be entered into a coded database for analysis using the independent samples t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the chi square test. Intention to treat analysis will be used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lavender Aromatherapy for Anxiety During Urodynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design is a randomized placebo control trial. Aside from randomization to aromatherapy versus placebo, no procedures will be performed for study purposes that would not be normally performed in the clinical evaluation. Women scheduled for urodynamic testing at the Los Angeles County University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Urogynecology clinic will be invited to participate. Participants who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to the aromatherapy or the placebo group after informed consent is obtained and immediately before undergoing multichannel urodynamics. Sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing the identity of the study arm will be used for randomization. The urogynecology clinic nurse will prepare the aromatherapy versus distilled water on the paper towel that the patient is routinely given to hold over their mouths when asked to cough during the procedure; two drops of each will be utilized. Before the physician comes in, the nurse will ask the participant to take a deep breath while holding the towel 3 inches from her face and will instruct the participant to continue to take normal breaths subsequently. It will not be possible to blind the participants or the examiner to the assigned group since the lavender oil will have a different scent than the placebo. However, the use of distilled water on the towel will allow the possibility that the deep breathing accompanying the instruction may have an effect on reported pain and anxiety. The participant will undergo the standard clinic exam in standardized order. The participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Survey (HADS) at baseline. The HADS is reliable instrument for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of a hospital medical outpatient clinic; it is available in English and Spanish versions. This will be used to establish their baseline anxiety levels. Participants will then be asked to rate their level of anxiety and pain immediately before beginning the exam, immediately after catheter placement, and 15 min after termination of the study using a 10 point visual analogue scale and the Wong-Baker pain scale.</detailed_description>
