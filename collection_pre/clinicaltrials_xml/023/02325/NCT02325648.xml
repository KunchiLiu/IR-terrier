	<brief_summary>The most popular surgical treatment of peritoneal cancer is the type known as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC), a type of cytoreductive surgery for which a significantly high survival rate has been demonstrated by several studies. It is widely known that HIPEC entails severe physiological changes and precautions during anesthesia. However, very few studies have systematically outlined and organized these changes for each system, and most existing studies only report retrospective data or are limited to gynecological surgeries. Therefore, the present researchers planned a prospective observational study to determine the physiological changes that occur in patients during HIPEC cytoreductive surgeries performed in the colon and rectal surgery department of the investigators hospital. The investigators planned to monitor the patients' body temperature, metabolism, cardiovascular and respiratory changes during HIPEC cytoreductive surgery and analyze the anesthetic methods applied to identify the optimal anesthetic management strategy for HIPEC cytoreductive surgeries.</brief_summary>
