	<brief_title>A Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Heterologous and Homologous Prime-Boost Ebola Vaccine Regimens in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of 3 parts: the first and third part with standard doses and the second part with higher doses. All parts are randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different doses, sequences and schedules to healthy adult participants. The study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1) followed by a boost on Day 15, 29, or 57, and third vaccine 1-year post-prime (3rd vaccination is optional for subjects in groups 1-8). The total duration of the study will be about 1 year for participants who wiil receive boost vaccine and about 3 months for participants who will receive placebo and 2 year for participants who will receive a 3rd dose. Safety will be monitored during the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and the investigator's clinical judgment Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5 and &lt;35.0 kg/m2 Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening, a negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior to each study vaccine administration, and practice adequate birth control measures from 28 days before the prime vaccination until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination as specified in the study protocol. If not heterosexually active at screening, must agree to practice adequate birth control measures if they become heterosexually active during their participation in the study (from screening onwards until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination). Agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during participation in the study (from screening onwards until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination) Women of nonchildbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal (&gt;45 years of age with amenorrhea for ≥2 years or any age with amenorrhea for ≥6 months and serum folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 mIU/mL) or surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), are not required to use the birth control methods as specified in the study protocol A man who has not had a vasectomy and is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a doublebarrier method of birth control, such as either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. In case the female partner is using an adequate method of birth control, a singlebarrier method of birth control for the male subject is acceptable. Men must also agree not to donate sperm during their participation in the study (from screening onwards until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination) Must be available and willing to participate for the duration of the study visits and followup, provide verifiable identification, and have a means to be contacted Has been vaccinated with a candidate Ebola vaccine Has been diagnosed with Ebola disease or exposed to Ebola including travel to West Africa in the last 12 months. West Africa includes but is not limited to the countries of Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone. Participants who anticipate traveling to epidemic Ebola areas before the start of the longterm followup period will also be excluded from enrollment into the study Has received any Ad26 or MVAbased candidate vaccine in the past Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine products (including any of the constituents of the study vaccines), including known allergy to egg or aminoglycosides A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in the study or within 3 months after the boost vaccination History of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone; thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12 months; uncontrolled hypertension as defined in the study protocol; or, major psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12 months that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation</criteria>
