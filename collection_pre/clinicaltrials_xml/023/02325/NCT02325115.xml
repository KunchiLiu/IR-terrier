	<brief_summary>Background: Despite current popularity, positive mental health is under researched. This is possibly due to a lack of consensus on appropriate measuresThe Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) is a 14 positively phrased Likert-style list of items developed to measure mental well-being. Its validation has been internationally explored. This report presents the French validation of the WEMWBS (F-WEMWBS) in non-clinical and clinical populations. Methods: Two non-clinical populations comprised of 319 working adults (WORK), and 75 students (STUD), and one clinical population of 121 patients with remitted schizophrenia (PRS) were included in the validation study. Participants completed the F-WEMWBS as well as complementary measures of psychological constructs potentially related to well-being.</brief_summary>
