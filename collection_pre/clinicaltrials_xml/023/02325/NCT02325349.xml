	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the use of labelled RGD ligand in PET/CT to predict and/or to early assess the efficacy of chemotherapy including an agent with antiangiogenic effect. The predictive value of this approach will be determined by independent assessors on basis of data at the end of the treatment: RECIST 1.1 criteria for CT or MRI, PERCIST criteria for FDG PET/CT, clinical, endoscopic and histological findings.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective, multicentre, open label, phase II clinical trial with diagnostic radiopharmaceutical on efficacy and tolerability of 18F or 68Ga labelled RGD peptide for detection of malignant tissues expressing integrins, to predict the therapeutic response of lesions of advanced head and neck cancer or advanced non-small cells lung cancer to treatment including an agent with antiangiogenic effect.</detailed_description>
