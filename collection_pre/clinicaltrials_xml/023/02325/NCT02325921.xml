	<brief_summary>Diagnostic imaging for renal masses of unknown nature using conventional imaging modalities such as 3 phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is not always conclusive. After (partial) nephrectomy, 10-20 % of the resected tumors show benign histology which could not be identified on diagnostic imaging. With improved imaging techniques available, leading to improvements in characterisation of renal tumors, the number of unnecessary resections may be reduced. The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRl) in assessing the nature of renal masses, including the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Therefore patients &gt;18 years of age scheduled for undergoing (partial) tumor nephrectomy will undergo one additional MRI examination.</brief_summary>
