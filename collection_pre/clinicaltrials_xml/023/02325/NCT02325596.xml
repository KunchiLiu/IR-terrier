	<brief_summary>This study aimed to evaluate the upstream events of Th17/Treg imbalance in CRS and their immune regulatory factors. Then the investigators aimed to explore the regulatory role of miRNA on DC-Th axis and its dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CRS, in order to determine the miRNA expression profile in CRS and clarify the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of CRS by regulating the DC-Th axis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigate the Role of microRNA in Chronic Rhinosinusitis From DC-Th Axis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), commonly encountered in the Ô¨Åeld of clinical otorhinolaryngology, is still a challenging proposition for doctors because of its high incidence and the unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. Nowadays, studies on the pathogenesis of NP are still attached great importance by researchers from each country. NP has become a global health problem with a considerable socioeconomic burden. Recently, research showed that the impaired balance of Th17/Treg was the significant basis of NP. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of Th17/Treg imbalance was unclear. In this study, DC-Th axis was designed as the main line, and the regulation of miRNA on DC was designed as the entry point. This study aimed to evaluate the upstream events of Th17/Treg imbalance in CRS and their immune regulatory factors. Then the investigators aimed to explore the regulatory role of miRNA on DC-Th axis and its dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CRS, in order to determine the miRNA expression profile in CRS and clarify the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of CRS by regulating the DC-Th axis. This study will play an important role in clarifying the pathogenesis of CRS eventually and will fill the blanks of the research between miRNA and CRS in the investigators'country. This study is with important clinical value for establishing control strategies for CRS.</detailed_description>
