	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to define an effective therapeutic approach, using currently available medication, to prevent or mitigate the loss of bone mass and bone strength that occurs after acute spinal cord injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Bone Loss After Acute SCI by Zoledronic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of zoledronic acid to evaluate its efficacy and safety over a 2 year period for the prevention of bone loss and maintenance of bone strength in individuals with recent onset SCI (see diagram below). Subjects will be randomized at the baseline visit to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo. At the end of the first year of the study, each treatment group will be re-randomized to either zoledronic acid or placebo to evaluate the durability of response to zoledronic acid and the utility of serum bone markers to guide therapeutic decision making. DXA imaging, CT imaging and bone markers will be obtained at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months.</detailed_description>
