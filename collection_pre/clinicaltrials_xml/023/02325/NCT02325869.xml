	<detailed_description>Coronary arterial disease (CAD) is defined as obstruction of blood flow into the coronary arteries (i.e. the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle). Patients with symptoms of coronary artery disease usually suffer from stable angina pectoris (chest pain or discomfort), unstable angina pectoris, or a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms range from mild angina, to moderate or severe angina. In some cases of CAD the blood vessel is chronically totally blocked (total occlusion), stopping blood flow through the blocked blood vessel. In these cases a minimally invasive treatment or a surgery may be needed. "Minimally invasive procedures" consist of angioplasty or stent placement. The procedure is performed under local anesthetic with the patient lying on their back. Angioplasty is a routine, well known, non-surgical procedure that is performed by making a small incision of the skin in the groin through which a catheter (narrow tube) and a guidewire (a thin metal wire) are inserted to reach the blocked artery. After reaching the blocked artery and crossing the blockage with a guidewire, a tiny balloon is inflated inside the artery to open the blockage. During the course of this procedure small pieces of the material that is causing the blockage may break off and be carried by the blood stream to other parts of the body where they may lodge and cause damage by blocking the blood flow . The Bell Balloon Catheter is designed to help the physician capture some of this material that may have broken off.</detailed_description>
