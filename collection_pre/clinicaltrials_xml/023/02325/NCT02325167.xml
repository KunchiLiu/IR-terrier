	<brief_title>Short-term Existential Behavioural Therapy for Informal Caregivers of Palliative Patients: a Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have developed and pilot-tested a short-term manualised individual psychotherapy, called Existential Behavioural Therapy (EBT), to reduce psychological distress in informal caregivers of palliative patients. The investigators propose to conduct a two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of EBT against usual care for the reduction of distress and the promotion of quality of life. Two one-to-one manualised psychotherapeutic sessions will be compared to a treatment-as-usual control group.Treatment-as-usual includes two supportive sessions. The design will be an unblinded RCT consisting of two conditions (EBT and Treatment-as-usual), with assessment at pre- and post-treatment and follow-ups at four weeks and six months. The trial will take place in the Clinic of Palliative Care, University of Munich (Klinik und Poliklinik für Palliativmedizin der LMU München).</detailed_description>
