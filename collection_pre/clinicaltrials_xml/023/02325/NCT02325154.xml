	<brief_title>Cerebral Oxygenation in Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship between cerebral oxygenation and blood pressure in patients undergoing hypotensive epidural anesthesia has not been completely elucidated. Previous publications have demonstrated a low incidence of post-op cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing hypotensive epidural anesthesia for total hip replacement (1-3) and that cerebral blood flow velocity is preserved as measured by transcranial Doppler (4). An earlier investigation by Dr. Yadeau demonstrated infrequent cerebral oxygen desaturation in spontaneously breathing patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy, even in the presence of hypotension (4), but did not investigate outcomes in the cognitive domain or have a control group of patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. There has only been one study looking at cerebral oxygenation and hip surgery, which was performed in elderly patients with fractures. It demonstrated that patients with low pre-op regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) had higher incidence of delirium (5) but many of those patients had surgery under general anesthesia. Given the costs associated with post-op delirium, cognitive dysfunction and stroke (6) and based on the fact that previous publications from this institution have demonstrated both a low incidence of cognitive dysfunction and preservation of cerebral blood flow velocity using this anesthetic technique, we hypothesized that cerebral oxygen desaturation will not occur in this population.</detailed_description>
