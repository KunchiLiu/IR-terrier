	<brief_summary>The purpose of this First-in-Human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability after single ascending oral doses of GLPG1837 given to healthy subjects, compared to placebo. Also, the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG1837 given to healthy subjects daily for 14 days compared to placebo, will be evaluated. Furthermore, during the course of the study after single and multiple oral dose administrations, the amount of GLPG1837 and its metabolite present in the blood and urine (pharmacokinetics) will be characterized. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of GLPG1837 and its metabolite will also be evaluated. The potential of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 induction after repeated dosing with GLPG1837 will be explored as well.</brief_summary>
