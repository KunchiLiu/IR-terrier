	<brief_summary>This is a 16-week, Single-center, Randomized, Open Label, Parallel Controlled Group Comparison of the Comprehensive Glycemic Control of Exenatide and Insulin Glargine on Type 2 Diabetes Patients Inadequately Controlled With Metformin Monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Exenatide and Insulin Glargine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening will be made to select eligible patients, then 44 patients receiving a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg daily) will be randomized (1:1) to receive exenatide or insulin glargine for 16 weeks. Exenatide will be administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection 30- 60 minutes before breakfast and dinner; the dose was 5 μg twice-daily for the first 4 weeks of treatment and 10 μg thereafter. Insulin glargine will be administered once daily at bedtime by subcutaneous injection. The dose of insulin glargine will initiate at ≥8 IU once-daily, and titrate based on a dosing algorithm targeting fasting blood glucose (FPG)&lt;6.1 mmol/L. Titration is only allowed in first 4 weeks. At the end of the study, data will be collected and analyzed.</detailed_description>
