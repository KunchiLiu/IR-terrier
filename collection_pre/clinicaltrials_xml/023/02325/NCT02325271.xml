	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the intra-individual variability of VEGF levels over a period of 6 months as well as the circadian variation of VEGF levels, both under standardized conditions in patients with type 2 diabetes without DME and matched subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the relationship of individual VEGF-levels to biomarkers of inflammation, HbA1c and major cardiovascular risk factors.</brief_summary>
