	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety of CNTO 1959 (Guselkumab) in Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque-type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know about the study treatment), placebo-controlled (a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study of CNTO 1959 (Guselkumab) in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis.
