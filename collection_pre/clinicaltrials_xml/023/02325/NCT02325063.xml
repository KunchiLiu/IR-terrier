	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the evolution of pain profiles among patients suffering from lateral epicondyalgia (tennis elbow) following three types of treatment: PRP-L injection versus type A botulinum toxin injection versus corticoid injection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Three Types of Injection for the Treatment of Lateral Epicondylalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives are to compare the following among the three groups: A- The global efficacy of each treatment defined by a minimum reduction of 25% in average pain over the last 24 hours between 0 and 6 months. B- The evolution of average pain over the last 24 hours between 0 and each different time frame (3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months). C- The evolution of maximum pain scores using nocturnal post-effort (Jamar grip test) visual analog scales (VAS) between day 0, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. D- The perception of change on the Patient's Global Impression of Change score (PGIC) at 3 and 6 months E- The evolution of PRTEE scores at 0, 3 and 6 months F- Adverse events at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. G - Quality of life and utility via the SF-12 at 3 and 6 months. H- The consumption of analgesics.</detailed_description>
