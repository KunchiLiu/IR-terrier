	<brief_summary>Leakage is the most common complication after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy which may amount to 20% in some studies. We hypothesize that Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) injection into the pyloric sphincter during the operation may decrease the risk of postoperative gastric leakage.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) provides similar weight loss and resolution of obesity comorbidities to that of duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Inspite of its encouraging results, the pretended feasibility of the operative procedure can be associated with a remarkable operative morbidity. The main reason is gastric leakage from stable line which occurs in about 0-20% of the cases. The main accepted cause of leakage is formation of a high gastric tube pressure. Injection of BTX-A into the pyloric sphincter intraoperative will cause temporal paralysis of pyloric sphincter muscles postoperatively; so the pressure inside the gastric pouch will be decreased abolishing the formation of high pressure tube with subsequent leakage.</detailed_description>
