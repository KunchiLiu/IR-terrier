	<detailed_description>Patients included into the study will be randomized into two groups and receive either standard therapy alone (as control group) or standard therapy plus DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg three times daily (as DLBS1033 group). Standard therapy used in the study will consist of: aspirin 80 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, vitamin B complex, and citicholine 250 mg/2 mL twice daily.
