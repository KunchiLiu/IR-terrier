	<detailed_description>Study enrolls opiate addicted patients who are motivated for a long term treatment and full opiate abstinence. Patient is offered to take part in a study. Information is provided regarding protocol, aim and course of study. Patients who are eligible and consent for study commit to follow the pre-study recommendations. Study consists of: Primary assessment - information about study. Assessment of patient according to predefined criteria. Consent form. Allocation of the treatment date. Stabilization - Buprenorphine. Assessment according to SOWS and OWS. Total amount of buprenorphine is recorded. Repeated evaluation - patient after successful stabilization course undergoes urine test for psychotropic substances, blood alcohol level is recorded. If any test is positive patient is not enrolled to study. Correction of opioid withdrawal symptoms - all of the patients receive medicines for opioid detoxification, infusion therapy in predefined doses. Antagonist induction - patients receive opioid antagonist (incremental or standard dose). Withdrawal symptoms are assessed and correction with lorazepam is given if needed.
