	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to document what course of action physicians choose for their patients when they develop taxane acute pain syndrome (TAPS) and to identify patients at the greatest risk of TAPS by examining specific human genome markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Copy Number Variations (CNVs) that may explain the genetic (hereditary) component.</brief_summary>
