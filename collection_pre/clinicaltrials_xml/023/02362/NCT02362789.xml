	<brief_summary>The study is designed to explore the kinetics of psoriasis symptoms, pruritus intensity and lesional biomarkers during 16 weeks of treatment with 300 mg secukinumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and a high pruritus involvement at baseline. For patients who achieve extensive remission defined as a PASI response of 98-100%, the kinetics of psoriasis and pruritus symptoms will be further explored during a randomized withdrawal phase of 16 weeks. Biopsies will be taken to investigate lesional biomarkers related to the pathogenesis of pruritus in psoriasis patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Chronic moderate to severe plaque type psoriasis as diagnosed by a qualified physician at least 6 months prior to baseline and with a PASI score &gt; 10 at baseline. Psoriasis patients with pruritus intensity of â‰¥ 30 on a 100point VAS, with a recall period of 24h as part of the PGACP, both, at screening and at baseline. Key Underlying conditions other than psoriasis which in the opinion of the investigator currently cause or influence pruritus of the skin (e.g. drug induced pruritus, renal insufficiency, diabetes). Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaquetype (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic, and guttate) at screening or study start. Ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis and nonpsoriasis treatments. Washout periods have to be adhered to. If the use of any of the prohibited treatments is required, then the subject may not be included into the study.
