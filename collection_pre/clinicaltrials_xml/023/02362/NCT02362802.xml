	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the impact of antitachycardia pacing ( ATP) on the myocardial tissue with respect to its potential micro damage measured by several myocardial markers, especially by high-sensitive TroponinT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>All patients for denovo implantation of a transvenous ICD (single chamber, dual chamber or cardiac resynchronization tehrapy) with left pectoral device position and planned apical location of the right ventricular defibrillation electrode. Resuscitation, cardiac surgical procedure, acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, cardioversion or ablation during the past 4 weeks, if baseline highsensitive Troponin T is elevated Known stenosis of coronary vessels with indication for coronary intervention or operative revascularisation Intracardiac thrombus or general contraindication against ventricular burst stimulation or intraoperative ICDtesting Atypical lead implantation with indication for defibrillation threshold testing by induction of ventricular fibrillation Right sided implantation of ICD Planned electrical cardioversion Lead explantation or extraction during procedure Redo procedure (except of additional implantation of a right ventricular ICD lead) Present temporary pacemaker electrode ASA &gt;= IV or NYHA IV Cardiogenic shock Pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular insult or dialysis in the past 4 weeks Lack of consent of patient Minority of patient</criteria>
