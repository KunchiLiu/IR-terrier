	<brief_summary>This study will assess whether post-resection adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab improves recurrence-free survival (RFS) as compared to placebo for high-risk participants with melanoma (Stage IIIA [&gt; 1 mm metastasis], IIIB and IIIC). The study will also assess whether pembrolizumab improves RFS versus placebo in the subgroup of participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumor expression. Participants will be stratified for stage of disease and region and then will be randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or placebo.</brief_summary>
