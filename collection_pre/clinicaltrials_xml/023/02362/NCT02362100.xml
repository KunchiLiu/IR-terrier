	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine if a difference exists in functional outcomes, as measured by the Constant score, when comparing nonoperative management and locking plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced proximal humerus fractures in the elderly population over a 2-year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will include an assessment of the ASES score, the SF-36 quality of life score, complication rates, re-operation rates, radiographic time to union, radiographic malunion, hardware position and evidence of avascular necrosis or posttraumatic osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Displaced 2 or 3part proximal humerus fractures by the Neer classification. 2. Displaced 4part proximal humeral fractures by the Neer classification that are deemed amenable to surgical fixation. 3. &gt; 60 years of age 4. Low energy mechanism of injury 5. Acute fracture (&lt;3 weeks) 1. 4part proximal humerus fractures that are not deemed amenable to surgical fixation (eg. due to osteopenic bone, thin head or tuberosity fragments); fractures that are better suited to treatment with arthroplasty 2. Isolated greater tuberosity fractures 3. Ipsilateral upper extremity significant injury, concomitant fracture or polytrauma 4. Open fracture 5. Previous ipsilateral shoulder surgery 6. Patients with active worker's compensation claims (due to the expectation of lower rates of success in this patient population) 7. Active joint or systemic infection 8. Patients with convulsive disorders, collagen diseases, and any other conditions that might affect the mobility of the shoulder joint 9. Major medical illness (life expectancy less than 2 years, unacceptably high operative risk, or not medically cleared by preoperative anesthesia consult) 10. Unable to speak or read English/French 11. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent 12. Unwilling to be followed for 2 years</criteria>
