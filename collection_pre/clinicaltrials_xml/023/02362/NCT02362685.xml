	<brief_summary>Exertional symptoms are the hallmarks of metabolic myopathies, supporting the concept of using functional tests when this diagnosis is suspected. Exercise increases the concentration of muscle metabolites in the venous blood supply (e.g. lactate, pyruvate, and ammonia) especially during recovery. The purpose of this study is to compare the results of exercise testing with to the data from muscle biopsy or genetic analysis.</brief_summary>
