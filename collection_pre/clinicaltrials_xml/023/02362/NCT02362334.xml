	<brief_title>IOL Power Calculation Using Dual Schiempflug Analyzer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measured keratometry, axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, white-to-white corneal diameter, and calculated IOL powers using various formulas including Hoffer Q, Holladay I, SRK II and SRK T measured by dual Schiempflug analyzer and optical low-coherence refelctometry will be compared.</detailed_description>
