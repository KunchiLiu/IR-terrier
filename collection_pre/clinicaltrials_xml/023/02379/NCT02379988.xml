	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to determine whether the addition of inspiratory hold (breath holding) can decrease the radiation dose that the heart and lung receive for patients being treated for left sided breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prone Breath Hold Technique to Decrease Cardiac and Pulmonary Doses in Women Receiving Left Breast Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects have a standard of care CT simulation, which includes an additional breath hold CT. Inspiratory gated breath-hold will be used. Two radiation plans will be generated: one for the CT scan performed free breathing, and one for the CT scan performed with inspiratory gated breath hold. The cardiac and lung doses will be determined. At the discretion of the treating physician, the plan with the lower cardiac and lung dose may be used to treat the patient.</detailed_description>
