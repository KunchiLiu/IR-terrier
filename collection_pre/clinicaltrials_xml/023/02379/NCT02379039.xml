	<brief_title>Multimodal Monitoring of Radiotherapy Response in Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head &amp; neck, anal canal, cervix, esophagus or lung will be assessed before start of radiotherapy and 1-2 weeks after start. Multi-parametric MRI and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET will be performed in parallel to metabolomic analyses of tumour tissue. The investigators will correlate changes in imaging bio-markers to corresponding changes in tissue or blood bio-markers by repeated imaging and biopsies for better understanding of the image parameters. The data from the two assessments will be used for identifying imaging bio-markers, predictive for outcome. The patient data will be divided into one set of data for hypothesis generation and another set for validation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Morphologically (pathology or cytology) verified, previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, oropharynx, uterine cervix, oesophagus or lung. 2. The patient should be planned for treatment with radiotherapy alone or in combination with concomitant medical therapy 3. The tumour shall be radiologically and/or visually identifiable and accessible for biopsy without the need for general anaesthesia or other major interventions 4. The patient must be at least 18 years of age, able to understand the given information and, leave a written informed consent to participate 1. The patient is unwilling to participate in the study 2. Patients with adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (i.e. no visible remaining tumour) 3. Pregnancy or lactation 4. Contraindications to investigations with MRI, gadolinium contrast or PETtracers 5. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2. 6. Severe comorbidities that are judged to significantly compromise survival in a twoyears perspective.</criteria>
