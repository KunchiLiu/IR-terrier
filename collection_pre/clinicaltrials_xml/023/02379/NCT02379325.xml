	<brief_summary>Smoking cessation is a priority for preventing smoking-attributable disease and reducing its burden. Quitting smoking at any age confers substantial and immediate health benefits, including reduced risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease and smoking-related cancers, and quitting smoking by the age of 30 reduces the risk of dying from tobacco-related diseases by almost 90%. The World Bank suggests that if adult cigarette consumption were to decrease by half in the year 2020, approximately 180 million tobacco-attributable deaths could be avoided. Therefore, promotion of smoking cessation has been proposed as a primary focus of tobacco control efforts, especially in developing countries where smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption are both still relatively high</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>most risk factors are associated with more than one disease, and targeting those factors can reduce multiple causes of disease. Since smoking has 9% contributions on the leading global risk towards mortality in the world and this risk factor has resulted in multiple causes of disease for example, lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic respiratory disease and other conditions therefore by quantifying the impact of this risk factors on diseases, may help to decrease the number of burden disease that is caused by smoking. University students age of 18 -24 are among the group of age that has the highest prevalence on smoking, thus it is necessary to targeting the high-risk people, who are most likely to benefit from the intervention. Population-based strategies seek to change the social norm by encouraging an increase in healthy behavior and a reduction in health risk. University students are in transition between the adolescence and early adulthood and developed unhealthy behaviors like cigarette smoking</detailed_description>
