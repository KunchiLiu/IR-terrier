	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority in term of radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) of cabazitaxel versus either enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone in patients with metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) who have disease progression while receiving AR targeted therapy (abiraterone plus prednisone or enzalutamide) within 12 months of treatment initiation (≤12 months). Secondary Objective: - To compare efficacy for: - Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and Time to PSA progression (TTPP). - Progression Free Survival (PFS). - Overall Survival (OS). - Tumor response rate and duration of tumor response. - Pain response and time to pain progression. - Symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE. - To analyze messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) including androgen-receptor splice variant 7 messenger RNA (AR-V7) as a biomarker in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). - To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel Versus the Switch to Alternative AR Targeted Therapy Enzalutamide or Abiraterone in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Primary Resistant Patients to Abiraterone or Enzalutamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study per patient will be approximately 2 years. Each patient will be treated until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal of further study treatment, and each patient will be followed after completion of study treatment until death, study cutoff date, or withdrawal of patient consent.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma. Metastatic disease. Progressive disease (PD) while receiving AR targeted therapy with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide within 12 months of treatment initiation (≤12 months) by at least one of the following: Progression in measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2). Rising PSA defined (PCWG2). A PSA value of at least 2 ng/mL is required at study entry. Effective castration (serum testosterone levels ≤0.5 ng/mL). Prior AR targeted therapy (abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) must be stopped at least 2 weeks before study treatment. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, except estramustine and except adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment completed &gt;3 years ago. No further anticancer therapy after the previous AR targeted therapy and before inclusion. Prior docetaxel in hormone sensitive setting is allowed if completed &gt;1 year before randomization. Prior immunotherapy is allowed. Less than 28 days elapsed from prior treatment with immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery to the time of randomization. Adverse events (excluding alopecia and those listed in the specific exclusion criteria) from any prior anticancer therapy of grade &gt;1(National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] v4.0) at the time of randomization. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt;1. History of brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease. Prior malignancy. Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin or superficial (pTis, pTa, and pT1) bladder cancer are allowed, as well as any other cancer for which treatment has been completed ≥5 years ago and from which the patient has been diseasefree for ≥5 years. Participation in another clinical trial and any concurrent treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related illnesses or known Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease requiring antiretroviral treatment. Any severe acute or chronic medical condition including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, severe renal impairment, history of cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled hypertension, arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, congestive heart failure, severe or unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infraction within last 6 months or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia), which could impair the ability of the patient to participate to the study or interfere with interpretation of study results, or patient unable to comply with the study procedures. Patients with reproductive potential who do not agree to use accepted and effective method of contraception during the study treatment period and up to 6 months after the last administered dose. The definition of "effective method of contraception" will be based on the Investigator's judgment. Known allergies, hypersensitivity or intolerance to prednisone or excipients of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. History of hypersensitivity to docetaxel or polysorbate 80. Known history of mineralocorticoid excess or deficiency (not applicable to patients who have already been treated with abiraterone acetate in first line before inclusion). History of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past 12 months, cerebral vascular accident, brain arteriovenous malformation or the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold (not applicable to patients who have already been treated with enzalutamide in first line before inclusion). Unable to swallow a whole tablet or capsule. Inadequate organ and bone marrow function as evidenced by: Hemoglobin &lt;10.0 g/dL. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5 x 10^9/L. Platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5 x Upper limit of normal (ULN). Total bilirubin &gt;1.0 x ULN. Potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L. Serum albumin &lt;3.0 g/dL. ChildPugh Class B and C. Contraindications to the use of corticosteroid treatment. Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy grade ≥2 NCI CTCAE v4.0. Concomitant vaccination with yellow fever vaccine. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
