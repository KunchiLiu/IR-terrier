	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical efficacy of repeat subcutaneous (SC) doses of dupilumab, compared with placebo, to relieve symptoms in adult patients with active, moderate to severe eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The study comprises 2 sections with double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study and an open label extension (OLE) to evaluate long-term safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Dupilumab in Adult Patients With Active Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, multicenter study that consists of: 1) a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of dupilumab in adult patients with EoE, followed by 2) an OLE to evaluate long-term safety. The study will consist of 4 periods: screening, double-blind treatment (with or without follow-up), OLE treatment, and OLE follow-up. The maximum duration of the double-blind study is approximately 33 weeks including screening and follow-up. The expected duration of the OLE is up to an additional 2 years with a 12 week follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key inclusion criteria: 1. Documented diagnosis of EoE by endoscopy prior to or at screening 2. History of on average at least 2 episodes of dysphagia (with intake of solids off antiinflammatory therapy) per week in the 4 weeks prior to screening and on average at least 2 episodes of documented dysphagia per week in the weeks between screening and baseline; dysphagia is defined as trouble swallowing solid food, or having solid food stick, by patient report 3. Must remain on a stabilized diet for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and during the course of the study; stable diet is defined as no initiation of single or multiple elimination diets or reintroduction of previously eliminated food groups 4. Documented history of or presence of any of the following: allergic disease (eg, allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, AD, or food allergies), peripheral eosinophil counts ≥0.25 GI/L, or serum total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) ≥100 kU/L 5. Participation in R688EE1324 clinical trial of dupilumab for EoE and received study treatment and adequately completed the assessments required for at least the treatment period of the doubleblind study as defined in the protocol (for OLE only). Key 1. Prior participation in a dupilumab (antiIL4R) clinical trial 2. Other causes of esophageal eosinophilia or the following diseases: hypereosinophilic syndromes, ChurgStrauss vasculitis, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis 3. History of achalasia, active Helicobacter pylori infection, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and prior esophageal surgery prior to screening 4. Any esophageal stricture unable to be passed with a standard, diagnostic, adult (9 to10 mm) upper endoscope or any critical esophageal stricture that requires dilation at screening 5. History of bleeding disorders or esophageal varices 6. Use of chronic aspirin, nonsteroidal agents, or anticoagulants within 2 weeks prior to screening. Patients should not stop these agents solely to become eligible for entry into this study 7. Treatment with an investigational drug within 2 months or within 5 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to screening 8. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 3 months or swallowed topical corticosteroids within 3 months prior to screening 9. Use of inhaled (pulmonary or nasal) topical corticosteroids within 3 months prior to screening and during the study, except stable dose for at least 3 months prior to screening biopsy, which cannot be changed during the study 10. Treatment with oral immunotherapy (OIT) within 6 months prior to screening 11. Allergen immunotherapy unless on stable dose for at least 1 year prior to screening 12. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study 13. Patients who, during their participation in a previous dupilumab clinical trial, developed an AE that was deemed related to dupilumab and led to study treatment discontinuation (OLE only) Note: The list of inclusion/ exclusion criteria provided above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in this clinical trial.</criteria>
