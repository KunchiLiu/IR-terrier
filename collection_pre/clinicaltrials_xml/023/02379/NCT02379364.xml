	<brief_summary>The aim of the study will be to assess the effectiveness of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis technique on pain, range of motion (Patellofemoral joint mobility test and muscle length test), strength and function in patients with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome and muscle shortening. Muscle imbalance is one of most important factor associated with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. Shortening of lateral muscles of the thigh have a close relationship with patella position and tracking and patellofemoral pain. The scientific evidence for effectiveness of any soft tissue mobilization technique in patellofemoral pain syndrome patients is poor. Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is a non-invasive physiotherapeutic technique to release adherences and fibrosis between the different musculoskeletal structures. Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is applied by a set of metallic hooks having the advantage of allowing a deeper and more precise application, which could not be achieved manually. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis technique applied in the soft tissues more related with patellofemoral pain.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Unilateral or bilateral patellofemoral pain longer than three months Anterior or retropatellar pain of nontraumatic origin that is provoked by at least two of the following activities: prolonged sitting or kneeling, squatting, running, hopping, jumping, or stair ascending/descending. The presence of pain on palpation of the patellar facets, on step down from 25 cm step, or during a double leg squat. Pain over the previous week equal to or greater than 3 on a 10cm visual analogue scale. The presence of muscle shortening in rectus femoris or tensor fascia lata muscle length test and/or hypomobility or stiffness in the compartmental muscle play.
