	<brief_summary>Patients will be randomly assigned to perform the training program in center or home-based . The training program will be conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine. All training sessions will be preceded by stretching of large muscle groups and heating (5 minutes) and at the end by cool down and stretching (5 minutes). The program will consist of 24 weeks with three sessions per week on alternate days. The aerobic training will be continuous, with an increment of 10 minutes in duration every 4 weeks. The intensity will be prescribed according to ventilatory threshold, characterized by the highest intensity of physical exertion fully maintained by aerobic energy pathways. The intensity control was done by means of the heart rate value obtained at ventilatory threshold. Both groups receive the same intervention. However, a group exercise held in the center on a treadmill with the direct supervision of a physical education teacher. The other group will exercise at home with telephone follow-up weekly and once a month will be held at the training center under the supervision of a physical education teacher. It will also constituted a control group remain without performing any activity during the study period. After 24 weeks patients receive the same advice the team conducting the training at home.</brief_summary>
