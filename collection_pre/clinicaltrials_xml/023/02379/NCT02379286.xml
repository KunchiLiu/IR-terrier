	<brief_title>Impact of Media Images, Alcohol and Tobacco to Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research extends existing research conducted by Cristel A. Russell to assess the relationships between French teenagers' attitudes and beliefs towards alcohol and tobacco products and the degree to which they watch and relate to television series and music videos. We test whether the consumption of media (TV series and music video) are related to French youth's perceptions of the consequences related to the use of alcohol and/or tobacco and ultimately their intentions and behaviors. To do so, an online questionnaire will be passed. Teenagers will be recruited through a private research firm, Cint. Because the study focuses on teenagers (14-17 y.o), parental consent to participate to the study will be obtained prior to the teenager's one.</detailed_description>
