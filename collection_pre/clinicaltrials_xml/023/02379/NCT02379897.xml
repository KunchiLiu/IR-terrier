	<brief_summary>Controversy exists about the role of dietary glycemic index (GI) and fat content and cardiovascular risk. Our aim was to assess the long term effects of altering dietary GI, carbohydrate, and fat on body weight, lipids, glucose homeostasis, and C reactive protein (CRP) in overweight and obese subjects. Men and post-menopausal women with body mass index values between 28-38 kg/m2 were placed on an isoweight average American diet for 5 weeks, then randomized to one of 4 diets which differed in GI, carbohydrate and fat content with calorie restriction for 12 weeks. The same diets were continued for 5 weeks under isoweight conditions, and in the free-living state for 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
