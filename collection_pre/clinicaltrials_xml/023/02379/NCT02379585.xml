	<brief_summary>This study is to see how safe the use of short-term fasting is in breast cancer patients who will receive chemotherapy before undergoing surgery and to examine if the use of short-term fasting will decrease the side effects of chemotherapy and how much a tumor shrinks while receiving chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Short-term Fasting on Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the eligible patients will fast 24 hours before and 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy which will consist of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks for four cycles followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks for four cycles (dose-dense AC + T) For patients with HER2 negative breast cancer, or for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer: docetaxel (T) every 3 weeks for four cycles. Trastuzumab (H) and Pertuzumab (P) will be given concurrently with docetaxel for a total of 4 cycles before surgery. For patients who do not achieve pathological complete remission (pCR), adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin (A) plus cyclophosphamide (C) every 3 weeks for four cycles will be given, followed by trastuzumab every 3 weeks to complete 1 year of treatment. For patients with pCR, only trastuzumab every 3 weeks will be given adjuvantly to complete 1 year of treatment (TPH + AC).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 years of age with histologically, and radiographically confirmed nonmetastatic breast cancer with minimal tumor size over 1 cm (≥T1c lesion) to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy recommended by the treating physician For estrogen receptor (ER) strongly positive, human epithelial receptor (HER2) negative breast cancer, Oncotype Dx study is required.
