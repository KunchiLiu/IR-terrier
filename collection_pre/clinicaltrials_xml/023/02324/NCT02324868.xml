	<brief_summary>Venous catheters are necessary for the treatment of many patients. Showering with a venous catheter is often prohibited due to the infection risk when the insertion site becomes wet. Therefore these patients are challenged to keep the catheter insertion site dry and always covered with a dressing. Washing themselves is often impossible without assistance of a nurse or significant other. For patients with a catheter connected to an infusion line, it is even more difficult. Showerpatch is a newly developed dressing that safeguards the insertion site of an IV catheter from water during bathing activities. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the impact of the availability of Showerpatch by comparing the outcomes in patients regarding the patient's autonomy in bathing activities, the material use and the time needed from caregivers in home care. Additionally qualitative data on patient's bathing activities and the use of Showerpatch will be collected.</brief_summary>
