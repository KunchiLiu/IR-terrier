	<brief_summary>Mammography remains an imperfect screening test especially in women with extremely dense breast tissue, missing biologically aggressive cancers especially in younger population and picking up indolent cancers that do not need treatment. The most sensitive test for breast cancer detection at our disposal is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The preliminary study of Dr Kuhl provide strong arguments that Ultra FAST Breast Magnetic Resonance is suitable for breast cancer screening with high sensitivity and specificity values. Data clearly demonstrates that FAST breast MRI could be the standard for breast cancer screening: it is safe, does not induce cancers, and can find more cancers than mammography. However this study was performed in women with low to moderately increased risk.The value of FAST Breast Magnetic Resonance in normal screening population has to be assessed before a modification of current strategy of breast cancer screening with mammography.</brief_summary>
