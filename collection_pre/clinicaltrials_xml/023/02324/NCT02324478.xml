	<brief_summary>The autonomic nervous system state (ANSS) and the autonomic nervous system state index (ANSSi) - two indices derived from the pulse photo-plethysmography analysis - have been recently advocated as a measure of sympathetic activity in the anesthetized patients, but their validity has not been yet demonstrated. We will conduct a study aiming to assess if ANSS and ANSSi reflect autonomic nervous system modulation on cardiovascular system in healthy humans under general anaesthesia.</brief_summary>
