	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the long-term side effects of the continuation of oral ONC201 in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body who have previously benefited from receiving this drug. Oral ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuation of Oral ONC201 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ONC201 (oral ONC201) administered orally in patients with advanced cancers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of ONC201. II. To assess serum biomarkers of therapeutic response to ONC201. III. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of ONC201 as a single agent in advanced solid tumors. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
