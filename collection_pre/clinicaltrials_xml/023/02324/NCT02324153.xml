	<detailed_description>This trial will randomize older aged patients undergoing general anesthesia for orthopedic surgical procedures to three perioperative doses of a melatonin agonist, ramelteon, and placebo in a masked double blind fashion. The primary outcomes are 1) the incidence of post-operative delirium in the recovery period in the Postoperative Anesthesia Care Unit and on post-operative days 1 and 2 following surgery, and 2) the safety of ramelteon as documented by the presence of adverse events in the follow-up period.</detailed_description>
