	<brief_summary>The study investigates inflammatory and antiinflammatory response in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis needing either surgical treatment (surgical aortic valve replacement) or interventional cardiology treatment (transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the transfemoral access route or the transapical access route).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Surgical and interventional therapy for aortic valve stenosis exposes the patients to a immune reaction, which is different depending on the type of the treatment. In this study, the investigators would like to better understand the inflammatory and antiinflammatory response in this patient population by monitoring the perioperative cytokine response (interleukins), the human leukocyte antigen expression (HLA-DR) and assessing soluble plasma factors (CD62L) involved in inflammatory processes. Objective Characterisation of inflammatory and antiinflammatory response in patients receiving aortic valve prosthesis selected for different treatment options. Methods Whole blood analysis at different time points (preoperatively, 4 / 24 /48 hours postoperatively) for different inflammatory and antiinflammatory markers: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CRP, TNF, soluble CD62L.</detailed_description>
