	<brief_title>Non-Ambulatory SCI Walk Using a Robotic Exoskeleton: Effect on Bone and Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, the treatment of muscle and bone deterioration after SCI is very limited; therefore, there is a definite need to further understand the mechanism of breakdown in the musculoskeletal system after a SCI, and, more importantly, find a clinical strategy that will treat muscle and bone loss. This pilot research grant will collect results that will be used for the design of a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether a Robotic Exoskeleton training [100 sessions; 1hr/session; 4-5 sessions/week] can improve musculoskeletal outcomes more than other current interventions. If the overall objective is to use the progression of technology to enhance functional ambulation for persons with a spinal cord injury, then the investigators need to evaluate the health benefits associated with continual use of the device. The study will be a prospective, single-group, repeated measure design using a 2 -month lead in to establish stability, 5-month intervention phase and 2 -month follow-up phase for retention will be performed. Each participant will be used as his or her own control. This project will be completed at two sites: Kessler Foundation will be the lead site that will be under the direction of Dr. Gail F Forrest (Principal Investigator) and Spinal Cord Damage Research Center, James J Peters VA Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Ann M. Spungen (collaborator). Both sites have exoskeletal-assisted walking programs.</detailed_description>
