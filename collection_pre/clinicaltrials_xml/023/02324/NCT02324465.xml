	<brief_summary>The investigators plan to conduct a randomized trial comparing the intubation success rate and time of the King Vision Video Laryngoscope to the Glidescope video laryngoscope in order to demonstrate the comparability of the devices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>King Vision Video Laryngoscope Versus Glidescope Video Laryngoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both the King Vision and Glidescope video laryngoscopes are advanced airway devices that are relatively low cost and are designed to improve the efficiency of both routine and difficult intubation. Both systems use disposable blades, which eliminates the need for blade sterilization and may minimize the risk of infectious exposure to patients and improve cost and efficiency associated with the sterilization processing of non-disposable laryngoscopes. The Glidescope has been commercially available longer than the King Vision, and has been more frequently studied. Although similar in many respects, the King Vision and Glidescope systems have differing designs which may result in differences in speed and success in the management of routine and/or difficult airways.</detailed_description>
