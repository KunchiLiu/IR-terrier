	<brief_summary>This study will enroll up to 192 children less than 18 years of age, who will receive electrocardiographic guidance for placement of a PICC in addition to radiography done as standard care. The investigators will determine the location of the PICC tip from both ECG and radiograph, and then measure the degree of correlation between the two methods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Electrocardiographic Guidance in Accurate Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement in Children.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The placement of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) is an important component of medical care for a variety of patients. Current practice requires radiographic confirmation of catheter tip placement prior to use of the line for administration of medications. Often the final catheter tip position may be uncertain based on radiographic imaging. Other times, the catheter is malpositioned and requires adjustment and repeat radiographic imaging. In adult patients, a system of confirmation that is based on electrocardiographic activity has been implemented and is FDA approved. This study will enroll up to 192 children less than 18 years of age, who will receive electrocardiographic guidance for placement of a PICC, in addition to radiography done as standard care. The investigators will determine the location of the PICC tip from both ECG and radiograph, and then measure the degree of correlation between the two methods.</detailed_description>
