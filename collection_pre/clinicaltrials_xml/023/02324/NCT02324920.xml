	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether the Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) in addition to the DDD pacing is effective in reducing syncopal recurrences. The study hypothesis is that DDD pacing with CLS stimulation is able to prevent syncopal recurrences completely or partially by transforming syncope in pre-syncope.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients affected by clinical diagnosis of reflex syncope who meet all the following criteria: age &gt;=40 years significant limitation of social and working life due to unpredictable or frequent syncope recurrences, â‰¥2 within the last year. type 2B cardioinhibitory response to TT (according to the VASIS classification). Alternative therapies have failed or were not feasible. exclusion of other possible competitive causes of syncope. Any other indication to IPG, implantable defibrillator (ICD), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), according to current guidelines Any cardiac dysfunctions possibly leading to loss of consciousness: overt heart failure; ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% (Echoassessed within 3month prior to study participation); myocardial infarction; diagnosis of hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy; clinically significant valvular disease; sinus bradycardia &lt;50 bpm or sinoatrial block; Mobitz I seconddegree atrioventricular block; Mobitz II second or thirddegree atrioventricular block; bundlebranch block; rapid paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia; preexcited QRS complexes; prolonged QT interval; Brugada syndrome; arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension diagnosed by standing BP measurement; Nonsyncopal loss of consciousness (eg, epilepsy, psychiatric, metabolic, dropattack, cerebral transient ischemic attack, intoxication, cataplexy). Symptomatic cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity.</criteria>
