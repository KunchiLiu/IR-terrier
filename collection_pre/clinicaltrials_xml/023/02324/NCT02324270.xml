Subject has a diagnosis of uncomplicated acute minor ankle sprain: Grade I and II (as defined by the America Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons AAOS) 4. Ankle sprain must have occurred &lt; 48 hours before study entry with baseline pain score of &gt; 50 mm on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) upon active mobilization 5. Female subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 1 year), in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control during the study from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last administration of study drug.

A sterile sexual partner is NOT considered an adequate form of birth control. 6. All male subjects must agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their partners, from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last administration of study drug. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control. Female partners should use an acceptable method of birth control as described in Item Number 5. 7. Subject is free from any systemic or dermatologic disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk of adverse events. 8. Subject shows willingness and capability to cooperate to the extent and degree required by the protocol. 9. Subject is willing to refrain from using any other pain medication during their participation. 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding female. 2. Sprain occurred &gt; 48 hours prior to study enrollment. 3. Ankle sprain requires an orthopedic or surgical treatment. 4. Ankle sprain treated prior to study entry by topical, oral, or parenteral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), physiotherapy, ultrasound, physical therapy or acupuncture. 5. Baseline selfevaluation of pain on active mobilization by the VAS &lt; 50 mm. 6. Nonintact or damaged skin within the area to be treated, e.g., eczema, psoriasis, exudative, dermatitis, infected lesion, burn or wound. 7. Medical history of asthma, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, edema, heart failure or cardiovascular disease. 8. Medical history of any chronic pain disorder. 9. Coagulation defects. 10. Severe cardiac, renal or hepatic impairment. 11. Severe systemic disease (e.g., cancer, severe acute infection). 12. Use within one month prior to randomization of 1.) immunomodulators or immunosuppressive therapies, 2.) interferon, 3.) oral or parenteral corticosteroids or 4.) cytotoxic drugs. 13. Use within 7 days prior to randomization of any topical agents on the affected ankle. 14. Use within 7 days prior to randomization of topical, oral or parenteral treatment with NSAIDs or aspirin. 15. Use within 12 hours prior to randomization of an analgesic. Eg. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®). 16. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to diclofenac, aspirin or other NSAIDs, or any excipient in the test product or brand product (Flector). 17. History of uncontrolled chronic or acute concomitant disease which, in the Investigator's opinion, would contraindicate study participation or confound interpretation of the results.</criteria>
