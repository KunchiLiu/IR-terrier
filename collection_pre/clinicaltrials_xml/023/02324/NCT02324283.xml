	<brief_summary>Which is more adequate general anesthetic agent, desflurane or propofol, for emergence and recovery time, and perioperative oxygenation in lung resection surgery?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Emergence and Oxygenation During One-lung Ventilation With Desflurane and Propofol Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to investigate the effects of desflurane on oxygenation (prevention of HPV) of OLV compare with propofol which is used in general anesthesia for lung resection. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) wiill be used to measure pulmonary blood flow during surgery visible and successively. To confirm the effect of HPV by measuring the change in pulmonary blood flow. The correlation between the blood oxygen concentration and attenuation of blood flow will be investigated.</detailed_description>
