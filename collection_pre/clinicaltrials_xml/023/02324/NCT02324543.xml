	<brief_summary>This study will be looking at whether gemcitabine, taxotere, and xeloda (GTX) in combination with cisplatin and irinotecan is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study of Gemcitabine/Taxotere/Xeloda (GTX) in Combination With Cisplatin and Irinotecan in Subjects With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is being done in 2 parts. The first part is the dose escalation part where the dose of irinotecan is increased until the highest safe dose of irinotecan is defined that can be given with gemcitabine, taxotere, xeloda, and cisplatin. After the safe dose of irinotecan in combination with gemcitabine, taxotere, xeloda, and cisplatin is defined, the second part will use these defined doses to look at how effective these drugs are against advanced pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
