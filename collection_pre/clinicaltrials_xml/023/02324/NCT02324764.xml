	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the rate of radial artery occlusion and vascular access site complications following transradial angiogram using a new Terumo (Tokyo, Japan) Glidesheath Slender, in comparison with the currently used 6 French (6 Fr.) radial sheath.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Glidesheath Slender to Reduce Radial Artery Occlusion and Vascular Access Site Complications Following Transradial Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on previously reported studies the rates of radial artery occlusion using a standard 6 Fr. sheath is around 5-10%, compared to the single feasibility study of the Glidesheath Slender by Aminian et al (see reference in the citations), the rate of radial artery occlusion was reported 0.88%. This study will be a prospective randomized, single-blinded (patient-blinded) study, comparing the rate of radial artery occlusion and vascular access site complications between the Glidesheath Slender (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and the standard 6 Fr. radial sheath in patients undergoing transradial coronary catheterization. - The study will enroll patients who will undergo elective or emergency coronary angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) via transradial approach at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. - A baseline clinical vascular &amp; ultrasound assessment will be performed prior to the procedure to document patency of the radial artery. - Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to either receive the Terumo Glidesheath Slender versus the currently used 6 Fr. sheath. - The standard angiogram/ PCI will be performed as per usual practice. - Following the angiogram, clinical vascular assessment as well as an ultrasound will be performed prior to discharge. - At 30 days follow up the patient will come back for clinical and ultrasound assessment of radial artery patency and access site vascular complications.</detailed_description>
