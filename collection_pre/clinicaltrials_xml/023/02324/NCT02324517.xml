	<brief_summary>Therapy of patients with severe hemophilia (including hemophilia with inhibitors) and other severe bleeding disorders could be monitored and guided based upon special clotting assays , eg thrombin generation and thromboelastography. In this study blood sampled from patients with bleeding disorders will be evaluated applying ex- vivo spiking assays with various coagulation concentrates to potentially address the feasibility of replacement /bypass agents/ combined therapy for future bleeding episodes. Patients that will be further treated by any regimen potentially suggested (as standard care- not within trial) will be thereafter followed , including repeated lab studies to assess the impact of therapy upon hemostasis.</brief_summary>
