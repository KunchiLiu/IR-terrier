	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1.To examine whether the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin can prevent the increase in HGP following institution of canagliflozin therapy and produce an additive or even synergistic effect to lower the plasma glucose concentration and A1c. Specific Aim 2: To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin can produce an additive, or even synergistic, effect to promote weight loss and reduction in hepatic and visceral fat content. Specific Aim 3. To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin can produce an additive or even synergistic effect to reduce systolic/diastolic blood pressure and 24-hour integrated blood pressure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1.To examine whether the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin can prevent the increase in HGP following institution of canagliflozin therapy and produce an additive or even synergistic effect to lower the plasma glucose concentration and A1c. We will examine this hypothesis by comparing the effect of administration of liraglutide alone, canagliflozin alone, and the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin on:(i) the rate of HGP; (ii) decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration; (iii) counter-regulatory hormone response and (iv) A1c. We anticipate that the addition of liraglutide to canagliflozin will prevent the increase in plasma glucagon concentration, augment insulin secretion, and blunt/block the increase in HGP in response to canagliflozin, resulting in a greater decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration and A1c than observed with each therapy alone. Specific Aim 2: To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin can produce an additive, or even synergistic, effect to promote weight loss and reduction in hepatic and visceral fat content. Specific Aim 3. To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin can produce an additive or even synergistic effect to reduce systolic/diastolic blood pressure and 24-hour integrated blood pressure.</detailed_description>
