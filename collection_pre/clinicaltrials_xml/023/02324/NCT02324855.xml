	<brief_summary>The main aim is to analyze whether the routine use of chest physiotherapy in non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) improves the cough severity and the quality of life in this population. In addition, the secondary end-points include incidences of exacerbations, changes in lung function, exercise capacity, airways inflammation, sputum analysis and eventual adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Airway Clearance Therapy in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present project will be a single-blind , randomized, controlled trial of 12-month daily performing chest physiotherapy compared with usual care, followed by a 3-month intervention-free in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Intervention group will perform daily autonomous airway clearance techniques (positive expiratory pressure technique through Acapella device and autogenic drainage technique). Patients will receive professional sessions once a month. Control group will receive their usual care and educational sessions about their disease. Physiotherapist will call them once a month. During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged</detailed_description>
