	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this clinical study is to characterize the fusion rate of geneX速 ds bone graft substitute in comparison to autograft, which is considered the gold standard for posterolateral fusion. Assessments are made using AP and Lateral x-rays, F/E x-rays, and CT scans geneX速 ds has been cleared by the FDA for use in these procedures; however this study will allow more detailed characterization of geneX速 ds performance in the long-term (1 year). By using the patient as their own control, direct comparison to autograft can be performed while minimizing other variables.</brief_summary>
