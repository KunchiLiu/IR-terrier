	<brief_summary>This study evaluates two L-Carnitine-based products on muscle function in healthy older adults (55 to 70 years old). These products are suspected to improve muscle function and possibly promote building of muscle mass. One third of the subjects will be on Carnipure Product 1, one third will be on Carnipure Product 2 and one third will be on placebo.</brief_summary>
