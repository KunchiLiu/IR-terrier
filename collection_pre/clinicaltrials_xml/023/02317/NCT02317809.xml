	<brief_summary>Some women cannot have children because they cannot produce enough follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). When this happens the ovaries fail to produce an egg during the menstrual cycle - a condition known as anovulation. Anovulation can be treated by giving replacement FSH and LH. Pergoveris is a medication that contains both FSH and LH. It is used for the treatment of anovulation in women who do not produce enough FSH and LH. A new, liquid formulation of Pergoveris is being tested in this study. It will be compared with the current freeze-dried marketed formulation to see if the new formulation gets into the blood stream as easily as the current formulation. This study will involve 38 healthy female subjects and 2 treatment periods and will last for approximately 77 days. Each subject will receive a single dose of the new liquid formulation and a single dose of the current marketed formulation separated by an interval of two weeks in a randomised (by chance) order. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals over 2 weeks after each dose to measure levels of FSH and LH. To participate female subjects must have normal ovaries on internal ultrasound scan, a normal result from a cervical smear test, be taking the combined oral contraceptive (OC) pill. Eligible subjects will have their usual OC pill replaced with another called Marvelon throughout the study. After 14 days subjects will have their levels of FSH and LH checked and if sufficiently reduced will only then proceed to dosing. Subjects will then receive one of the formulations. An ultrasound scan of the ovaries will be performed 7 days later, and another one 7 days later just before the next dose. Subjects whose ovaries show signs of stimulation will not be given the second dose. The ultrasound scan will be repeated 7 days after the second dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Premenopausal women aged 18 to 40 years (both inclusive) at Screening Taking a combined oral contraceptive (COCP) for at least 1 year prior to Screening and willing to recommence taking their own COCP from Day 43 of the Marvelon cycle until followup Normal folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) (less than [&lt;] 12 international units per liter [IU/L]) and estradiol levels (&lt;100 picogram per milliliter [pg/mL]) Gave written informed consent prior to any trialrelated procedure Forearm veins suitable for cannulation or repeated venipuncture Body weight of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 48 kilogram (kg) and a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) (both inclusive) Clinically acceptable values for vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], pulse rate, and body temperature), as assessed by the Investigator Nonsmoking or having refrained from smoking for at least 6 months prior to Screening and with a history of &lt;10 pack years [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20)*number of years smoked] Able to communicate well with the Investigator, understanding the protocol requirements and restrictions, and willing to comply with the requirements of the entire trial Negative pregnancy test at Screening, before the start of the Marvelon cycle, and at admission (Day 1 Period 1 and Day 1 Period 2) Willing to use additional nonhormonal contraceptives (for example, condoms or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] with spermicide, nonhormonal intrauterine device, previous sterilization of the subject or her partner, being sexually inactive) from Day 1 of the Marvelon cycle up to followup Normal liquidbased cervical cytology assessment (Papanicolaou test score &lt;II) within the last 12 months before Screening. If not performed as part of routine clinical care, a cervical cytology assessment must be performed as part of the Screening assessments and the result must be normal Any surgical or medical condition, including findings in the medical history or in the pretrial assessments, that in the opinion of the Investigator, constitutes a risk or a contraindication for the participation of the subject in the trial or that could interfere with the trial objectives, conduct, or evaluation Any clinically relevant abnormality in the safety laboratory parameters, as judged by the Investigator Any clinically significant abnormality on the 12lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG), as judged by the Investigator Positive results from the serology examination for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, or the human immunodeficiency virus Contraindications to COCP use shown by a history of conditions specified in the protocol History of tumors of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus Clinically significant abnormalities of the genital organs as determined by gynecological examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and based on the Investigator's judgment for example, ovarian tumors, nonfunctional ovarian cysts, endometrial hyperplasia) Not successfully downregulated by showing luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) levels above 1.0 IU/L and estradiol levels above 100 pg/mL before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration or showing more than12 immature follicles per ovary. In that case there should be no signs of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) morphology Polycystic ovarian syndrome as defined in the protocol Ovarian folliclelike structures larger than 13 millimeter (mm) during COCP use (at Screening) Contraindication to treatment with gonadotropins (ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to PCOS and of unknown origin, gynecological hemorrhages of unknown etiology, ovarian, uterine, or mammary carcinoma, tumors of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, hypersensitivity to gonadotropins or to any of the excipients, extrauterine pregnancy in the previous 3 months, and medical history or risk factors for thromboembolic events) Pregnant or breastfeeding a child Prior treatment with FSH and or LH containing products Definite or suspected personal history or family history of an adverse drug reaction or hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure to FSH or LH History or presence of asthma (with the exception of childhood asthma) or any serious allergy (requiring hospitalization or prolonged systemic treatment) History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse Positive test for drugs of abuse (including alcohol) Loss or donation of more than 500 mL of blood within 90 days prior to the first IMP administration Administration of any IMP or use of any investigational device within 60 days prior to the first IMP administration Use of drugs that may reduce the effectiveness of COCP from the start of the Marvelon cycle until last pharmacokinetic sample. For example, phenytoin, barbiturates, primidone, carbamazapine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, felbamate, rifampicin, nelfinavir, ritonavir, griseofulvin, oral ketoconazole, and herbal remedies containing Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort) Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and trialrelated restrictions for example, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup, and improbability of completing the trial Is (or is a relative of) the Principal Investigator or any Subinvestigator, Research Assistant, Pharmacist, Trial Coordinator, or other staff directly involved in the conduct of the trial Vulnerable subjects (for example, persons kept in detention)</criteria>
