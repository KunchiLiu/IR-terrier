	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib when given together with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Talazoparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving talazoparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BMN 673 (talazoparib) seven day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BMN 673 three day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of BMN 673 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. II. To determine whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of BMN 673 when given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel correlate with thrombocytopenia. III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of BMN 673 alone after the combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and BMN673. IV. To observe the safety and tolerability of BMN 673 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin and BMN 673 alone after the combination therapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To serially evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters and use indirect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models to correlate with tumor response and resistance to the combination BMN 673, carboplatin, and paclitaxel therapy. II. To explore mechanisms of resistance to the combination of BMN 673 with carboplatin and paclitaxel. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talazoparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 dosing schedules. SCHEDULE A: Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SCHEDULE B: Patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-3, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At any time after 4-6 courses of treatment, patients may continue combination study therapy with talazoparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, talazoparib and carboplatin, talazoparib alone (continuous dosing), or observation without therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed solid malignancy (excluding lymphoma) that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, and for which: a) there is reasonable expectation of response to the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel OR b) breast cancer (BRCA) 1/2 germline mutation is present; results from Myriad will be acceptable; if testing for BRCA 1 and 2 germline mutations is done through another organization, a report from a genetics consult with a qualified medical professional confirming that the laboratory results show a recognized germline deleterious BRCA 1 or 2 mutation or rearrangement is required; if the latter cannot be obtained, principal investigator (PI) or study chair review of the lab results and confirmation of BRCA mutation or rearrangement will be required OR c) BRCA 1/2 somatic mutation previously identified using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified assay Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;

abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately;
