	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Psoriasis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Able to provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any study specific procedures Has a diagnosis of moderately severe plaque psoriasis that has been moderately stable for 6 months and has failed at least one line of systemic or phototherapy and is a candidate for additional systemic therapy Has a PASI of ≥ 12 within the 24hour period prior to the first dose of study drug Has at least 10% of body surface area that is affected by plaque psoriasis within the 24hour period prior to the first dose of study drug Willing to avoid tanning devices Willing to forgo other systemic and topical treatments for psoriasis during the course of the study Adequate bone marrow function Negative urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) documented within the 24hour period prior to the first dose of study drug Must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (&lt; 1% per year failure rate) during the study and for 1 month after the termination of the study. Effective birth control includes implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence, or vasectomized partner Willing to complete all study measurements and assessments in compliance with the protocol Has nonplaque or druginduced (antimalarials, lithium) psoriasis (If subject is taking angiotensin II receptor blockers or beta blockers doses must be stable for 6 months prior to study entry) Use of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry except for Class 5 or weaker topical corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapies to the face, groin, or scalp. Use of methotrexate, acitretin, or cyclosporine within 4 weeks prior to study entry Using phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry Using biologic therapies, including antibodies to IL17, within 3 months prior to study entry Has concomitant condition requiring treatment with moderate to high dose steroids in the 12 weeks prior to screening Has viral, fungal, or bacterial skin infection Is a pregnant or lactating woman History of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery including bariatric surgery, or any gastrointestinal condition that might interfere with drug absorption Currently participating in another study with an investigational drug or within 28 days of study entry Has history or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions that would make the subject, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study (such as poorly controlled psychiatric disease or coronary artery disease) Regular and excessive use of alcohol within the 2 years prior to study entry defined as alcohol intake &gt; 14 drinks per week in a man or &gt; 7 drinks per week in a woman. Approximately 10 g of alcohol equals one "drink" unit. One unit equals 1 ounce of distilled spirits, one 12ounce beer, or one 4ounce glass of wine History or presence of any of the following: 1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2.0 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening. (Subjects with an isolated AST elevation of any magnitude, or a ratio of AST:ALT &gt; 1.5 should be interviewed regarding use of alcohol, have levels repeated and participation in the study should be discussed with the medical monitor.) 2. Renal disease and/or serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN at screening Has QTc(F) interval (QT interval data corrected using Fridericia's formula) of &gt; 450 msec at the screening or predose ECG Has had previous exposure to KD025 or known allergy/sensitivity to KD025 or any other ROCK2 inhibitor</criteria>
