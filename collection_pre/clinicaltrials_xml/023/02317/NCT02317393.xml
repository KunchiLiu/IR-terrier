	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the contribution of the imaging to the expression of intégrines αvβ3 for the characterization of the residual masses of non-seminoma tumors at the end of chemotherapy. The investigators hope that the results of this first stage of the clinical trial come to consolidate the preclinical results obtained by the investigators team to characterizing the interest and the strong contribution of the use of a tracer resting on the expression of αvβ3 integrine for the diagnosis of simple necrosed mass at the end of the treatment of a non-seminoma tumor, so allowing to defer a surgery to about 40 % of the patients.</brief_summary>
