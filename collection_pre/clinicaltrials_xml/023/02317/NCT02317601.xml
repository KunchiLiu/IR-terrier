	<detailed_description>Patients with Hip Fracture are exposed for two traumas that can trigger a stress response. The first is the fall that causes the Fracture. The second is the surgery. In this study the intervention is dispensed early in the disease course - as soon as the Fracture has been diagnosed and booked for surgery.</detailed_description>
