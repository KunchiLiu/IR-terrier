	<detailed_description>Objectives 1. To assess the safety, tolerability and initial anti-diabetic activity of MLR-1023 in subjects with uncontrolled mild to moderate type 2 diabetes mellitus 2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MLR-1023 and the major metabolite, MLR-1023-M1 following 28 days of repeat dosing Design and Outcomes The study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of MLR-1023 in adult subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus who are on diet and exercise therapy. A subset of subjects per dose group will have additional samples analyzed to measure signs of MLR-1023.</detailed_description>
