	<brief_summary>This study evaluates four test formulations of a glucose lowering drug (LY900014) administered by injection under the skin of the abdomen. The study will be conducted in healthy people to investigate how the human body handles LY900014 and the effect of LY900014 on blood sugar levels. Side effects and tolerability will be documented. The study will be conducted in two parts (Part A and Part B) to achieve its objectives. Each part of the study will last for about 11 to 12 weeks, including screening and follow up. Screening is required within 28 days prior to entering into either study Part A or Part B.</brief_summary>
