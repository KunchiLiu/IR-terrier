	<brief_summary>This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 study of RO6927005. The study will establish the safety and tolerability profile of RO6927005 and will be conducted in two parts. In Part A, the first dose escalations will be carried out using cohorts of 1 patient. Single patient cohorts will be used to investigate increasing doses until a first dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is reached or until grade-2 related toxicity (except infusion-related reactions), whichever comes first. At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort thereafter, which, if required, can be expanded with additional patients. Part B of the study will consist of a multiple ascending dose phase (multiple patients cohorts - &gt;/= 3 patients) followed by an extension phase of RO6927005 given in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Preliminary clinical activity will be explored throughout the study. Patients will be treated until disease progression and/or lack of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicities, withdrawal from treatment for other reasons, death, pregnancy or termination of the study by the Sponsor, whichever comes first.</brief_summary>
