	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new therapy (Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure with intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (AutoEPAP iVAPS)) designed to treat respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure and/or nocturnal hypoventilation with upper airway obstruction. The study will be performed in two phases: In a sleep unit and in the home environment. The new therapy will be compared against two existing ventilator therapies: "Spontaneous Timed (ST) mode" and "Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS)".</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Juno Perth Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I: To compare sleep and sleep-breathing parameters for patients who use AutoEPAP iVAPS (experimental arm) compared to iVAPS (commercially available therapy) Participants already established on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) will be recruited to participate for 3 nights in a monitored sleep unit. They will have a sleep study each night: Night 1 will involve an evaluation of their current NIV settings. Some of these settings will be used to set up AutoEPAP iVAPS and iVAPS. Night 2 &amp; 3: the participants will be randomised to AutoEPAP iVAPS or iVAPS. They will have sleep studies on each therapy, whereby their sleep and sleep-breathing will be monitored and evaluated. After each night, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how well they slept. Phase II: To compare sleep-breathing and therapy adherence for patients who use AutoEPAP iVAPS (experimental arm) compared to their usual therapy (Spontaneous Time (ST) mode). Participants already established on non-invasive ventilation (NIV; ie. ST mode) will be recruited to participate for 14 nights. This study will occur at home. The participants will be randomised to trial AutoEPAP iVAPS or ST mode therapy for Week 1 and 2. Data will be collected onto the respiratory device (i.e. Juno) detailing objective usage, air leak and breathing parameters (e.g. oxygenation). Participants will also complete a questionnaire after each week to evaluate subjective sleep quality and comfort. Blood samples will also be collected Pre-week 1, and after week 1 &amp; 2 to measure oxygen, carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels in the blood. Blood samples will be taken from the ear lobe.</detailed_description>
