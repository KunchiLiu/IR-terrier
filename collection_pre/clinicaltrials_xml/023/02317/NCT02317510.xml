	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to compare general anesthesia (GA) and combined (epidural and spinal) anesthesia (CA) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. General anesthesia is a gold standard for laparoscopic cholecystectomy(LC). The use of combined anesthesia may offer several advantages over general anesthesia. Fifty patients will be randomly assigned to either the CA LC (25 patients) or GA LC (25 patients). All patients has symptomatic gall stone disease or polyp of gall bladder. Intraoperative events related to combined anesthesia , postoperative complications, pain score and duration of operation time will record.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective of study : The aim of this study was to compare general anesthesia (GA) and combined (epidural and spinal) anesthesia (CA) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. General anesthesia is a gold standard for laparoscopic cholecystectomy(LC). The use of combined anesthesia may offer several advantages over general anesthesia. Material and methods : Fifty patients will be randomly assigned to either the CA LC (25 patients) or GA LC (25 patients). All patients has symptomatic gall stone disease or polyp of gall bladder. Intraoperative events related to combined anesthesia : abdominal discomfortable, shoulder pain, abdominal pain, nausea, anxiety, dermatomal level of sensory blockade, respiratory depression. We compare between two group; shoulder pain, postoperative complications, pain score, duration of operation time and length of hospital stay. Fifty patients will select prospectively for LC, under low pressure (10 mm Hg) pneumoperitoneum and under combined anesthesia and general anesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia was performed at L1-L2 interspace using 2 ml of 0.5% (10 mg) hyperbaric Bupivacaine mixed with 0.5ml (25 micrograms) of Fentanyl. Epidural catheter was inserted at L1- L2 interspace too.</detailed_description>
