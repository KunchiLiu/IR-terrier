	<brief_summary>The current pilot study aims to close the existing gap in our knowledge about effective psychosocial treatments for Latino families by providing preliminary data regarding the acceptability and efficacy of a culturally-modified ADHD treatment and possible moderators that will support a future R01. Specifically, the current pilot study is the first step in a larger program of research aimed at definitively determining if culturally-modified ADHD treatment outperforms standard treatment when examining engagement and acceptability outcomes, as well as symptomatology and parental functioning, and if so, which treatment modifications are necessary and for whom. The following study aims will be examined. 1. Aim 1 is to explore if the culturally-modified treatment results in better engagement and acceptability outcomes (i.e., parental attendance, retention, engagement, and satisfaction) than standard treatment and to determine the strength of these effects. 2. Aim 2 is to explore if the culturally-modified treatment results in improvements in ADHD symptomatology, as well as parental functioning (i.e., parenting stress and efficacy), to explore if the modified treatment results in similar or greater improvements than standard treatment, and to determine the strength of these effects. 3. Aim 3 is to explore possible moderators (i.e., socioeconomic status (SES) and behavioral and cognitive acculturation) that may explain the relationship between treatment type (i.e., standard versus culturally-modified) and outcomes and to determine the strength of these interactions.</brief_summary>
