	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effects of a low-intensity blood-flow restricted exerciser protocol on patient reported physical function, in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis. The study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled trial with a treatment group and a control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood-flow Restricted Exercise in Inclusion Body Myositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is a disease characterized by skeletal muscle inflammation and severe muscle atrophy especially in the muscles in the thigh and the finger flexors. In time the muscle weakness will cause the affected person to become unable to walk and carry out basic tasks in the every day life. Currently no effective treatment exist for sIBM patients, however several studies indicate that exercise may be beneficial for the patients. In the resent years a lot of research attention has been directed toward low-intensity training with partial vascular occlusion as an alternative to the conventional high intensity strength training. Interestingly the low-intensity blood-flow occluded training is found to be at least as beneficial in causing muscle growth as the conventional strength training but with very little mechanical load on joints and tendons. Furthermore the blood-flow occluded training seem to result in a hyper-activation of muscle stem cells which play an important role in muscle regeneration. This make the blood-flow restricted training modality a very interesting treatment possibility for sIBM patients because it might be able to restore and/or maintain the skeletal muscle tissue and therefore also muscle function.</detailed_description>
