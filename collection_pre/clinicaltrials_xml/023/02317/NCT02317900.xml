	<brief_summary>Dengue viruses are widespread in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This study will evaluate the safety and protective efficacy of a dengue vaccine (called TV005) against viremia and rash induced by a DENV-2 vaccine virus (called rDEN2∆30-7169) in healthy adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of a Single Dose of a Dengue Vaccine (TV005) in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are four types of dengue viruses (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each of which can cause mild to life-threatening illness. This study will evaluate the protective efficacy of TV005 (a dengue virus vaccine) administered at Day 0 against viremia and rash induced by rDEN2∆30-7169 (a live attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine) administered at Day 180. The safety and immunogenicity of the TV005 and rDEN2∆30-7169 vaccines will also be evaluated. This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous infection with a dengue virus or a flavivirus. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single injection of TV005 or placebo at study entry (Day 0). All participants will receive a single injection of rDEN2∆30-7169 on Day 180. For at least 30 minutes after each vaccination, participants will remain in the study clinic to be monitored for any adverse effects of the vaccines. Participants will record their temperature three times a day for 16 days after the first and second vaccinations. In addition to study visits at Day 0 and 180, participants will attend study visits at Day 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. At select study visits, participants will undergo a physical examination, medical history review, blood collection, and a pregnancy test for female participants.</detailed_description>

Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization, intrauterine device, and abstinence (6 months or longer since last sexual encounter). All female participants will be considered having childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or postmenopausal status documented as at least 1 year since last menstrual period. Females Only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive betahuman choriogonadotropin (HCG) test, breastfeeding Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator affects the ability of the participant to understand and cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol Screening laboratory values of Grade 1 or above for absolute neutrophil count (ANC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine, as defined in this protocol Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a participant in the trial or would render the participant unable to comply with the protocol Any significant alcohol or drug abuse in the past 12 months which has caused medical, occupational, or family problems, as indicated by participant history History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis Severe asthma (emergency room visit or hospitalization within the last 6 months) HIV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, by screening and confirmatory assays Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening Any known immunodeficiency syndrome Use of anticoagulant medications Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 28 days prior to or following vaccination. Immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids is defined as greater than or equal to 10 mg prednisone equivalent per day for greater than or equal to 14 days. Receipt of a live vaccine within 28 days or a killed vaccine within the 14 days prior to vaccination or anticipated receipt of any vaccine during the 28 days following vaccination Asplenia Receipt of blood products within the past 6 months, including transfusions or immunoglobulin or anticipated receipt of any blood products or immunoglobulin during the 28 days following vaccination History or serologic evidence of previous dengue virus infection or other flavivirus infection (e.g., yellow fever virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus) Previous receipt of a flavivirus vaccine (licensed or experimental) Anticipated receipt of any investigational agent in the 28 days before or after vaccination Participant has definite plans to travel to a dengue endemic area during the study Refusal to allow storage of specimens for future research Inclusion Criteria for Second Vaccine: Good general health as determined by physical examination and review of medical history Available for the duration of the study, approximately 26 weeks after the second dose Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent document Females Only: Female participants of childbearing potential willing to use effective contraception for the duration of the trial. Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization, intrauterine device, and abstinence (6 months or longer since last sexual encounter). All female participants will be considered having childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or postmenopausal status documented as at least 1 year since last menstrual period.
