	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing Conventional Radiotherapy With Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Patients With Bone Metastases - VERTICAL Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Bone metastases are a frequent distant manifestation of solid tumours, and many bone metastases are located in the spine. These patients mostly present with severe (back) pain which reduces quality of life. The primary treatment for pain management is a single-fraction low dose external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), effective in achieving pain reduction in around 60% of patients, of whom 0-23% experience complete pain response. Recently, there is growing evidence that Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) achieves a much higher pain response due to the higher dose administered. In retrospective and a few prospective case series, SBRT for spinal, and also non-spinal metastases has been demonstrated to be safe, and efficacious. However, no randomized controlled trials have been performed. Objective: To study whether the pain response after three months in patients with osseous metastatic disease increases after SBRT in comparison to low dose EBRT. Study design: Randomized controlled trial, the VERTICAL study, nested within the PRESENT cohort. Study population: Eligible patients are MRI-compatible patients with radiographic evidence of bone metastases at the radiotherapy department. Fifty-five patients are recruited in both control and intervention arm. Intervention: Patients will undergo MRI-based, cone beam CT-guided SBRT and will receive a single dose of 18 Gray (Gy) on the visible metastasis, and 8 Gy on the bony compartment containing the metastasis (e.g. the affected vertebra or pedicle). Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is pain control at three months after radiotherapy. Secondary outcomes are, among others, the occurrence of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) and radiation-induced myelopathy, local tumour control and evaluation of quality of life.</detailed_description>
