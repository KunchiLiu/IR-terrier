	<brief_summary>The investigators study is testing models of contraceptive care that were developed as part of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. CHOICE is a prospective cohort study of 9,256 women designed to: 1) promote the use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods which include interuterine devices (IUD) and subdermal implants; 2) remove financial barriers to contraception; 3) evaluate continuation of and satisfaction with reversible methods; and 4) reduce unintended pregnancies in the St. Louis region. CHOICE demonstrated that interventions such as comprehensive contraceptive counseling, increased access, and removal of financial barriers increase the uptake of LARC methods and reduce unintended pregnancy. The investigators objective is to determine whether the CHOICE model of contraceptive care can be equally successful in the real world of community clinics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project involves comparing two models of contraceptive care; 'enhanced care' which is usual care plus the CHOICE contraceptive counseling, and the 'complete CHOICE model' which includes the contraceptive counseling as well as provider training and cost support for IUDs and implants. Participants will be enrolled at three partner community clinics by a staff member (site coordinator) dedicated to the research study. All participants will undergo contraceptive counseling as well as a baseline survey with the coordinator. Participants will complete telephone surveys at 3, 6, and 12 months post-enrollment and will be asked about contraceptive method chosen, satisfaction and continuation of the method, and any pregnancies experienced since enrollment.</detailed_description>
