	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized clinical trial in patients with thymic carcinomas who failed prior systemic therapy. All subjects will receive MK-3475 treatment intravenously once every three weeks until unacceptable toxicity, death, progressive disease or withdrawal.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MK-3475 in Patients With Thymic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II study of MK-3475 in thymic carcinoma patients after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Exploratory studies will be performed on archival tumor material (PDL-1 expression, next-generation sequencing) and fresh biopsies (culturing, next-generation sequencing). Simon's two-stage optimal design is used. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 5% will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage 9 subjects will be accrued. If there is no response in these 9 subjects, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional subjects will be accrued for a total of 17. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 3 or more responses are seen in 17 subjects.</detailed_description>

Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Has known sensitivity to pembrolizumab or its formulation Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with the requirements of the trial Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after trial treatment.
