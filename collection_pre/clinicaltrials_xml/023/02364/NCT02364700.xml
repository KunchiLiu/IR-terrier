	<brief_title>Portable EMG-triggered Hand Robot for Individuals After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HOH will be used to provide hand training for patients with decreased hand ability after stroke. The HOH is a light-weight, non-invasive, portable hand robot that provides physical assistance when a patient activates the muscles that open and close the hand. The HOH works by detecting surface EMG muscle activity and therefore requires active participation from the patient throughout the session. Video games linked to the HOH device are specifically designed to work on opening and closing the hand facilitating mass practice and high repetition needed for improving strength and range of motion of muscles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of stroke &gt; 6 months ago 2. Presence of some active range of motion (AROM) in the affected hand, measured by a score of at least 1 on the Box and Block test. 3. Intact sensation in the affected hand 4. Full passive range of motion (PROM) in mass flexion and extension of the hand 5. MAS score &lt; 3 for finger flexors and intrinsics 6. MAS score &lt; 3 for finger extensors 7. Visual tracking is intact in all directions 8. Patient must be otherwise medically stable in the opinion of the principal investigator 1. Patient is receiving active occupational or physical therapy for the affected arm 2. Patient has joint contractures that prevent proper fit into the HOH device 3. Patient has other concurrent neurological or orthopedic diagnoses that affect motor ability of the arm such as Parkinson's or Multiple Sclerosis, or arthritis 4. It has been less than 3 months since last botulinum toxin injection in the affected arm</criteria>
