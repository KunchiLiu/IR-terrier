	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy works in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer. Measles virus, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MV-NIS or Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian, or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare clinical efficacy of Arm A (MV-NIS therapy) and Arm B (standard cytotoxic chemotherapy), as measured by overall survival (OS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 12 months (OS12), progression-free survival at six months (PFS6), and objective response rate (ORR) between MV-NIS therapy and standard chemotherapy. III. Assess safety and tolerability of MV-NIS, and compare with standard chemotherapy. IV. Compare quality of life as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) between MV-NIS and standard chemotherapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS using single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging within the MV-NIS treatment arm. II. Assess viremia, viral replication, and viral shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration within the NV-NIS treatment arm. III. Measure humoral and cellular immune responses to MV-NIS within the NV-NIS treatment arm. IV. Measure changes in anti-ovarian cancer (OC) immune responses in both treatment arms. V. Perform transcriptomic analysis on tumor biopsy specimens to determine a gene expression profile predictive of therapeutic response to MV-NIS. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PREREGISTRATION INCLUSION CRITERIA: Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Study participants will be women who have gone through a bilateral oophorectomy procedure Willingness to be evaluated for surgical placement of an intraperitoneal port and undergo biopsy if feasible for a research sample REGISTRATION/RANDOMIZATION INCLUSION CRITERIA: Recurrent, persistent, or progressive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer after treatment with bilateral oophorectomy and either cisplatin or carboplatin and either paclitaxel, albuminbound paclitaxel, or docetaxel; histologic confirmation of the primary tumor is required; eligible histologies include serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, transitional cell, undifferentiated, or mixed carcinoma Platinumresistant or platinumrefractory disease, defined as either 1) less than a complete response to the most recent carboplatin or cisplatincontaining chemotherapy regimen, 2) serum cancer antigen (CA)125 &gt;= 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 180 days of last dose of carboplatin or cisplatincontaining chemotherapy, confirmed by a second CA125 (the second CA125 does not have to be within 180 days of chemotherapy), or 3) CT or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT evidence of cancer recurrence within 180 days of last dose of carboplatin or cisplatincontaining chemotherapy Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/uL Platelet (PLT) &gt;= 100,000/uL Total bilirubin =&lt;

patients who are randomized to Arm B (cytotoxic chemotherapy) may receive chemotherapy at any oncology clinic able to provide the protocoldirected therapy and willing to send laboratory data to the participating institution; however, patients must be willing to return to the participating institution every two months for evaluation; patients who are randomized to Arm A must be willing to receive all treatment and followup at a participating institution Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks Willingness to provide all biologic specimens as required by the protocol Measurable disease by physical exam or CT scan, or evaluable disease by CA125;
