	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to temporally evaluate the impact of abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) therapy on Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and on clinical outcomes in the chemotherapy-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) population. Safety data, levels of health care resource utilization associated with abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) therapy will also be prospectively collected and analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Canadian Observational Study in Metastatic Cancer of the Prostate: A Study of ZYTIGA Use in the Community Urology Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-interventional, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient number of persons over a sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the selection of the study group), observational (clinical study in which participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions) study. This observational study will focus on chemotherapy-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) participants initiating abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) therapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. All treatment decisions will be made at the discretion of the Investigator per clinical practice and in accordance with approved local Product Monograph and treatment algorithms. The planned study duration will be three years from initial first participant enrolment. Participants will be followed for a maximum of 72 weeks from the time of initiation of abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) treatment, or up to the time of early study withdrawal/termination. Data will be collected in both paper-based and electronic data capture (eDC) and primarily collected for PROs and clinical outcomes. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
