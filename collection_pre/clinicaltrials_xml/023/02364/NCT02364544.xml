	<detailed_description>The goal of the Improving Care and Reducing Cost (ICRC) Program, is to improve disease management and the overall process of care in treating the chronic illness schizophrenia in order to reduce ER visits and hospital days while providing better care, better health and increased patient satisfaction. This will be done by fostering innovation in the use of technology and by training and deploying a new cadre of personnel in the behavioral health field: Mental Health/Health Technology (MH/HT) Case Managers. The specific treatments we propose to use are evidence based, but their dissemination has been limited because of lack of trained personnel and cost. The model we propose, the Health Technology Program (HTP), will address these problems through use of the web and mobile phone based training and interventions. The components of the HTP program that are being tested in the pilot program include: 1) evidence-based pharmacological treatment facilitated by a web-based prescriber decision support system-Prescriber Decision Assistant (PDA) 2) brief, in-person, relapse prevention counseling with supplemental web-based learning modules, 3) a daily support website that offers web- and phone-based resources to support persons with schizophrenia and their family members or others. The resources include a patient and family Psycho-Education Treatment program, which includes electronic peer groups facilitated by mental health professionals, providing medication reminders via web and phone, and conducting monitoring of early warning signs of relapse via web and phone 4) an interactive smart phone text-messaging application to support medication adherence, facilitate coping with symptoms and improve daily functioning in individuals with schizophrenia 5) a web-based, self-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for the management of hallucinations. All patients will be provided with pharmacological treatment (PDA), brief in-person relapse prevention counseling, and an Android mobile phone. The other program components will be provided to patients using a shared decision-making approach to assess need and preference.</detailed_description>
