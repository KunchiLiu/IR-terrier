	<criteria>Male and female patients age at least 18 years of age, or age of consent in the region. Newly diagnosed Stage IIIB or IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (according to Revised International System for Staging Lung Cancer criteria of 2010) or recurrent nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of predominately nonsquamous NSCLC. Be eligible to receive study treatment of bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin based on local standard of care, for the treatment of advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or combination SCLC and NSCLC. Squamouscell tumors and mixed adenosquamous carcinomas of predominantly squamous nature. Evidence of a tumor that compresses or invades major blood vessels or tumor cavitation that is likely to bleed. Known sensitizing EGFR mutations (for example, deletion 19 or L858R) or EML4ALK translocation positive mutations. Prior systemic therapy for NSCLC; prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is allowed if surgical resection for primary disease was performed.</criteria>
