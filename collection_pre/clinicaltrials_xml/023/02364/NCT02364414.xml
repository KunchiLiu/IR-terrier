	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of measurements derived from a commercially available direct intra-oral scanning system with those taken from plaster study models, and to compare cost implications of both systems. The investigators will test the hypotheses: - There is no systematic difference between measurements taken from the Trios scanner and study models. - There is no difference in the cost of producing digital models.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Accuracy of Direct Digital Intra-oral Scanning Measurements Compared to Measurements on Study Models</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plaster study models produced from moulds of the teeth are a standard component of orthodontic records. They are fundamental to diagnosis and treatment planning, evaluation of treatment progress and results as well as record keeping. (Santoro et al., 2003) Plaster models must be retained for a minimum of 11 years for a medico legal reasons. This leads to problems of storage in terms of space and cost, in addition to the risk of damage because of the brittle nature of the models. These problems therefore highlight the need for an alternative method for producing and storing study models. This study aims to compare the accuracy of measurements derived from a new commercially available direct intra-oral (inside of the mouth) scanning system (3Shape TRIOS (R)) with those taken from plaster study models, and to compare cost implications of both systems. We will use the results to conclude whether direct intraÂ¬oral scanning can replace traditional plaster models produced from moulds of the teeth.</detailed_description>
