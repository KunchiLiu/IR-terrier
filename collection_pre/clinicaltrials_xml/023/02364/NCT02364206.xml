	<brief_summary>Glioblastomas are extremely resistant to treatment, including radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Activation of p38 MAPK has been associated with a poor prognosis among patients with glioblastoma during the temozolomide (TMZ) era and represents a compensatory response by tumor cell to environmental stress such as radiation or chemotherapy. LY2228820 is a potent and selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and reduces phosphorylation of its cellular target, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2) . LY2228820 is a good candidate to target malignant glioma resistance to the gold standard treatment combining radiation and TMZ by acting on both tumor and stromal cells. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the recommended dose of LY2228820 in combination with TMZ and radiotherapy during chemoradiotherapy period (phase I) and to estimate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients treated with LY2228820 when administered at the recommended dose in combination with radiotherapy and concomitant TMZ (phase II)</brief_summary>
