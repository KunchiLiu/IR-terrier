	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study to analyze the outcome of provisional main vessel stenting on side branch by utilizing Two-Dimensional (2D) and Three-Dimensional (3D) frequency domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT). To analyze the fate of side-branch after provisional main vessel stenting based on morphology defined prior to PCI by OCT. Offline analysis of side branch impingement of the ostium of SB leading to acute loss in SB diameter area, carina shift and plaque shift will be also be performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-centre, Registry Trial, the Patients Presented With Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with stable coronary artery disease with angiographic main vessel lesion not involving side branch (SB) in whom provisional stenting strategy is planned will be recruited. All the participants of the registry will receive same stent. OCT will be performed to analyze plaque morphology, SB size, SB angle and side branch ostial involvement.</detailed_description>
