	<brief_title>Reporting Patterns and Results of Initial Antibiotic Treatment in Patients With cUTI, cIAI,NP Including VAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an observational, historical cohort study from medical chart review of adult hospitalized patients for each of the three conditions of interest (complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP) including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)). For this study, the proposed patient selection period extends for 12 months, from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. Patients selected during this period will be followed from diagnosis (i.e., diagnosis of cUTI, cIAI or NP) until symptom resolution, discharge or 30-days post discharge [based on data availability to assess readmission and outpatient visits], death while hospitalized, loss to follow-up or the end of study period if not yet discharged from index hospitalization [December 31, 2014]).</detailed_description>
