	<brief_summary>The aim of this 2-part study is to assess B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as well as other circulating and imaging biomarkers in myocardial function. Part 1 assesses biomarker levels in healthy participants and participants with cardiac dysfunction. Part 2 assesses BNP and other circulating biomarker levels, and performs imaging in participants with cardiac dysfunction who continued from Part 1. The primary hypothesis is that compared to healthy participants, biomarker levels are elevated in participants with mild/moderate and severe cardiac dysfunction.</brief_summary>
