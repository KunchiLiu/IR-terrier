	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to determine both patient-reported and performance-based outcomes, specifically muscle function and kinematic/kinetic outcomes, between four different surgical total knee prostheses in individuals following TKA. Change scores will be determined based on patient-reported outcomes, kinematic/kinetic data, knee extension strength/power, static/dynamic balance control, mobility measures and functional performance testing during functional tasks (i.e. walking, ascending/descending stairs, sit-to-stand). After evaluating the pattern of change in lower-extremity function, the investigators will be better prepared to address residual functional impairments and prognostic factors linked to maximal recovery over two years.</brief_summary>
