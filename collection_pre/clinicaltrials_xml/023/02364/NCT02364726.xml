	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of acupuncture on reducing nerve damage. Acupuncture is a medical technique of inserting very thin needles into the "energy points" on the body with the aim to restore health and well-being. It has been used widely to treat pain, such as lower back pain and joint pain. In this study the investigators will assess if acupuncture can be used to ease the pain, tingling and numbness that may be caused by chemotherapy and improve quality of life during chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
