	<brief_summary>Imagio breast imaging system, is an opto-acoustic (OA) imaging system designed to concurrently collect images in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound ( co-registered OA and B-mode imaging). This medical device has CE-marking and is approved for use in Europe and other nations. This is a post-market, non-randomized multi-center surveillance study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMAging With Opto-acoustics to downgradE BI-RADS claSsificaTion Relative tO Other Diagnostic Methodologies (MAESTRO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a post-market surveillance study that is prospective, controlled, multi-center, and observational, to evaluate if Imagio OA can downgrade BI-RADS ( Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) classification following CDU (Conventional Diagnostic Ultrasound) for the visualization and characterization of suspicious masses prior to core needle biopsy (CNB) or excision. Investigators will perform CDU to reach a diagnosis and decision to biopsy. Imagio OA will not be used as the reason to perform or to defer a CNB (Core Needle Biopsy) or excision.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Female 18 years of age or older Have an undiagnosed suspicious finding which may include more than one solid or complex cystic suspicious mass, classified by CDU as BIRADS 4a or 4b within 3 weeks of their baseline Imagio Scan Have a condition or impediment that could interfere with the intended field of view (within one probe length or 4 cm of the mass), (i.e., breast implants within the previous 12 months, or tattoos) Pregnant or lactating Patient has received chemotherapy for any type of cancer within 90 days from date of screening CDU</criteria>
