	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether a prewarming period of at least 30 minutes during induction of general and combined epidural anesthesia reduces the core temperature drop normally occuring in patients undergoing cyto-reductive and major abdominal surgery. In addition the effect of prewarming on intra and postoperative body core temperature will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
