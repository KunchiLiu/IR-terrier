	<brief_summary>The study entitled "Acupuncture vs. placebo acupuncture and vs. standard therapy for pain control after elective caesarian section - a randomized controlled trial" aims to investigate whether acupuncture with indwelling fixed needles reduces pain and analgesic requirement as compared to placebo and standard therapy in patients after after elective caesarian section (CS) in the period from January 2015 to May 2016. For that purpose 180 adult patients scheduled to elective elective CS in spinal anesthesia will be recruited according to eligibility criteria. 120 patients will be randomized either to verum or placebo acupuncture, 60 patients will be included in non-randomized "standard therapy" arm. The outcome measures are: postoperative analgesic requirement, pain intensity, incidence of side effects and physiological parameters.</brief_summary>
