Sample size: 216 patients (108 in each group) Variables:Main: Complete healing after 12 weeks follow-up. Secondary: Degree of healing (Resvech 2.0). Quality of life (CCVUQ-e). Adverse reactions. Related to the healing process: comorbidities, topical and systematic treatments, exercise, BMI. Prognostic factors: location, number and duration of ulcer. Sociodemographic factors Data analysis: By intention to treat. Comparative analysis of the two groups (chi-squared or t-test).
