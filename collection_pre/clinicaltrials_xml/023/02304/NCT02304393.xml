	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of RO7009789 administered in combination with atezolizumab (ATZ) in participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in three Parts (I, II, and III), with part I divided into Parts IA and IB. All participants will be followed up for survival until death or loss of follow-up after the last visit or withdrawal of consent.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors, which are not amenable to standard therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 16 weeks Adequate hematologic and end organ function Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 Ability to comply with the collection of tumor biopsies; tumors must be accessible for biopsy Agreement to use effective methods of contraception per the protocol requirements; female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine/serum) within 7 days prior to the first study drug administration If one of the following laboratory results obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) are: soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sCD25) &gt;2 Ã— upper limit of normal (ULN); Serum ferritin &gt;1000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) Any approved anticancer therapy that includes chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment; the following is, however, allowed: Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases &lt;/= 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Adverse events from prior anticancer therapy that have not resolved to Grade &lt;/= 1 except for any grade alopecia and &lt;/= Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Bisphosphonate therapy for symptomatic hypercalcemia. Use of bisphosphonate therapy for other reasons (example: bone metastasis or osteoporosis) is allowed Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites that require recurrent drainage procedures (one monthly or more frequently). Participants with indwelling catheters are allowed Known clinically significant liver disease which includes active viral, alcoholic, or other hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver, and inherited liver disease History (within the previous year) of congestive heart failure, stroke, arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction History of peripheral venous thrombosis or thromboembolic event (within 12 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) Significant cardio or cerebrovascular disease within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Known hereditary or acquired coagulopathies Clinically meaningful proteinuria Requiring dialysis (peritoneal or hemodialysis) Known primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases: participants with asymptomatictreated CNS metastases may be enrolled after consultation with the Medical Monitor, provided they meet the following criteria: Radiographic demonstration of improvement upon completion of CNSdirected therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNSdirected therapy and the screening radiographic study No stereotactic radiation or wholebrain radiation within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Pregnancy, lactation, or breastfeeding Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the RO7009789 formulation or to components of atezolizumab formulation History of autoimmune diseases (participants with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible; participants with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen may be eligible for this study) History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (excluding infectious diseaseinduced), organizing pneumonia, or evidence of active pneumonitis. History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted Participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active hepatitis B (chronic or acute), or hepatitis C infection Active tuberculosis Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Signs or symptoms of infection within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Received oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study Malignancies other than disease under study within 3 years prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and with expected curative outcome Prior treatment with anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte associated protein 4 (antiCTLA4), antiprogrammed death1 (antiPD1), or antiprogrammed death ligand1 (antiPDL1) therapeutic antibody Previous treatment with any other compound that targets cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) (like Chi Lob 7/4 and ADC1013) Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to interferon (IFN)gamma, Interleukin2 (IL2) within 4 weeks or 5 times the halflife of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Treatment with investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (or within 5 times the halflife of the investigational product, whichever is longer) Concomitant treatment with anticoagulants (example: Coumadin, heparin) except low dose molecular weight heparin for prophylactic purposes Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Participants who have received acute, lowdose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (example: a onetime dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled in the study after discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor. The use of inhaled corticosteroids and the use of mineralocorticoids (example: fludrocortisone) for participants with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins Participants with prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the participants at high risk from treatment complications</criteria>
