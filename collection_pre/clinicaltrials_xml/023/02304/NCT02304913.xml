	<brief_title>Hypoglossal Acupuncture for Dysgeusia in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taste disorders are frequent side effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy (CTX). Dysguesia has prevalence rates of 16% to 1000% during CTX with sometimes also persistent courses. Impact of dysguesia on appetite, body weight as well as health-related quality of life was shown. Until now, evidence for adequate treatment options is limited to specific diary recommendations. Acupuncture in the treatment of side effects of chemotherapy was investigated for nausea and xerostomia, but not for dysguesia. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial aims to investigate hypoglossal acupuncture in comparison to sham acupuncture and standard medical treatment (dietary recommendations) in the treatment of dysgeusia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
