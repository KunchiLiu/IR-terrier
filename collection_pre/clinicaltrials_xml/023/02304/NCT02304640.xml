	<brief_summary>There is a paucity of studies that focus on the symptom burden of cancer patients in Singapore, particularly the clinical effects of cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Knowing that early-stage breast cancer is curable, it is of paramount importance to evaluate the clinical and biological determinants of lingering symptoms in breast cancer survivors so that appropriate psychosocial interventions can be formulated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence, Severity and Determinants of Cancer-related Fatigue (CRF) in Asian Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that variations in clinical and biological determinants contribute to different severities of CRF among Asian breast cancer patients. Through this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the prevalence and severity of CRF among Asian breast cancer patients, and to identify the biological and clinical determinants of CRF among these patients. This will be a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study conducted at the National Cancer Centre Singapore and KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Informed consent will be obtained from participants before the investigators proceed with data collection. The study participants will be assessed at relevant time points. Biological determinants and symptoms associated with CRF will be assessed. The associations between changes in CRF, plasma cytokines levels, serum cortisol levels, and other clinical determinants will be elucidated.</detailed_description>
