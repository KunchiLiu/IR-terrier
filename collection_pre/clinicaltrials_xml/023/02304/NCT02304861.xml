	<brief_summary>Objective of this study is the comparative assessment of the beneficial impact of the Viscoat viscoelastic (OVD) and Visthesia OVD on endothelial cells and corneal edema following torsional-ip cataract extraction surgery. Participants will be recruited from the Cataract Service of the University Hospital of Alexandroupolis (UHA) in a consecutive-if-eligible basis. Eligibility criteria include diagnosis of senile cataract with stage 3 nuclear opalescence according to the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS-3) grading scale. By means of a custom computer randomization program all participants will randomly populate two study groups according to the OVD used (ie. viscoat or visthesia).</brief_summary>
