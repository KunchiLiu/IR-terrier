	<brief_summary>The cataract surgery (550 000 operations per year in France) is to replace the cloudy lens with a refractive implant. Two colors of implants are available: white implants, filtering out ultraviolet and yellow implants, filtering and more blue light. No clinical data are available to assert the superiority of an implant according to its color and the choice is made according to the preference of the surgeon and / or "markets". It is established in humans that blue light has an important role on the secretion of melanopsin, a key mediator of the circadian cycle. This "clock" regulates most neuroendocrine functions in the nycthémère (sleep, mood, temperature, cortisol, ..). The question of the impact of these neuro endocrine functions of the installation of a blue light filter into the eyes of patients operated thus arises.</brief_summary>
