	<brief_title>Eccentric Exercise or Radiofrequent Microtenotomy as Treatment of Lateral Epicondylalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of those affected by lateral epicondylalgia will 90% be free of symptoms within 8 months to 2 years with conservative treatment. In this study surgical radiofrequency microtenotomy and eccentric exercise for chronic (more than two year) lateral epicondylalgia that is unilaterally will be used as treatment. Patients is randomized to a group with eccentric exercise or a group with surgical radiofrequency microtenotomy and postoperatively eccentric exercise. Home based eccentric exercise program is instructed by a physical therapist and is performed for three months. Women start with 0.5 kg and men 1.0 kg weight, they perform 3 sets with 5 reps once a day and register pain and exercise in a diary. Function, pain and quality of life will be followed and are carried out after 6 weeks and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The surgery and eccentric exercise is instructed and followed at the investigators clinic.</detailed_description>
