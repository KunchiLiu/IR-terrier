	<brief_summary>Children are admitted in intermediate units when the severity requires continuous monitoring. In France, Resources allocated to intermediate units are determined from lists of diagnoses and associated acts to additional budget. A score to assess the severity of illness may be associated with acts to develop an activity indicator easy to use. The investigators have chosen 2 scores to assess severity in intermediate cares : the Paediatric Advanced Warning Score (PAWS) and the Bedside Pediatric Early System Score (PEWS). In France, they have not been validated. The correlation between the severity of children and the associated diagnoses and acts has not been studied. The main objective of this study is to validate these 2 scores. The secondary objective is to determine a simplified activity indicator.</brief_summary>
