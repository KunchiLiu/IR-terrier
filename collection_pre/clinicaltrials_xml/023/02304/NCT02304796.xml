	<brief_summary>The current pilot study will examine and compare the effectiveness of two group psychotherapies for mixed anxiety disorders: 1. unified cognitive-behavioral protocol, adapted to a group format. 2. combined cognitive-behavioral and dance/movement therapy. In addition, change in proposed mechanism in each therapy will be examined, along with their association with change in outcome measures during therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unified Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) vs. Combined CBT and Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT) for Anxiety Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current pilot study will examine and compare the effectiveness of two group psychotherapies for mixed anxiety disorders: 1. unified cognitive-behavioral protocol, adapted to a group format. 2. combined cognitive-behavioral and dance/movement therapy. 24 patients will be randomized to 1 of the two treatment arms and treated with 20 weekly 1.5-2 hours therapy sessions. Independent evaluator and self-reports measures will be collected at intake, pre-treatment, session by session, post-treatment and and follow-up. Hypotheses: 1. Both groups will show effectiveness, as revealed by reduction in anxiety severity and increase in valued living. 2. Changes in process measures (proposed mechanism of change - emotion regulation, working alliance, fear of bodily sensations, bodily/movement awareness) will be predictive of change in outcome measures (anxiety severity and valued living). 3. Changes in bodily/movement awareness will be more predictive of change in outcome measures in the CBT-DMT group than in the unified protocol group.</detailed_description>
