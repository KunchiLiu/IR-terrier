	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of CDFR0612 and CDFR0613 for Bowel Cleansing Before Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, parallel, 3-treatment, multi-center clinical trial. A total of 297 subjects scheduled for colonoscopy will participate to this study and be assigned to 3 groups - CDFR0612, CDFR0613, or a comparator (Coolprep Powder). A subject will admit to hospital one day before colonoscopy and be administrated with study drug. In early morning at the that day of colonoscopy, he/she will be administrated with study drug again. Any subject will be carefully monitored for safety during hospitalisation (1 night) and additional 4 weeks follow-up period because this study is the first human trial of CDFR0612 and CDFR0613.</detailed_description>
