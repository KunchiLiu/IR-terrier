	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn if the medication Memantine Hydrochloride (the study medication) can help adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. Dr. Alberto Costa and his research team want to see if a 16-week treatment with this medication can improve the participant's ability to learn and remember things. In this study, memantine hydrochloride will be used. Thus, the researchers want to learn whether the study drug can help improve memory in young adults with Down syndrome. To test the effect of the study medicine, half of the people in the study will receive the study medicine and half will receive a placebo (an inactive substance). Memantine is an approved medication to treat memory and thinking problems in persons with Alzheimer disease. However, little is known about the effect of this medication in persons with Down syndrome and it has not been approved for use in persons with Down syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Down Syndrome Memantine Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to investigate if the medication Memantine Hydrochloride can help young adults with Down syndrome. Two hundred persons with Down syndrome from both genders and between 15 and 32 years of age will be recruited from two sites: Cleveland, OH, USA and SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Participants will be assigned randomly to either a placebo group or a group taking the active medication with a 50% probability of being on either group. Neither the participants nor the investigators will know who will be taking the study medication and who will be taking the placebo during the study. Only the investigational pharmacist will have access to this information. Up to 60 people with Down syndrome of the recruited study participants will take part on an optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. This investigation is aimed at helping to make the EEG study more precise and to find out whether the study medication has any significant effect on the structure of the brain. Additionally, we will recruit a control group of 60 age- and gender-matched participants without Down syndrome. The goal is to investigate how different groups of people activate their brains when they hear or see something, and if he can use high-density EEG and MRI to see how this study medication works in persons with Down syndrome. In other words, this additional control group should help us ascertain which parts of the test results are due to a person having Down syndrome and which ones are not. Persons without Down syndrome will only come for one EEG visit and one MRI visit, and not be asked to take the study medication. The visits for the participants with Down syndrome will be as follows: Screening visit (approximately 2-hour long). The subject will be asked about his/her health, medical history, social background, and work background, as well as some simple questions to determine performance on tests of memory and function that are part of this study. Informed consent and assent will be obtained in this visit. At the end of this visit, an EEG machine will be used to access brain responses to different auditory and visual stimuli. Some will be asked if they would be willing to have an MRI performed, but this portion is not imperative. A urine sample will be collected and used to obtain cells that will be kept frozen for potential future studies. If the date of the screening visit is not convenient, this sample can be collected during any of the next five visits. Visit 1 (approximately 1 hour). Pulse, blood pressure, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be taken. At the end of the visit, urine and blood samples will be taken. Pregnancy will also be checked. Visit 2 (2-3 hours). Tests of memory, learning, and reasoning skills will be conducted before the start of the study medicine or placebo. At the end of this visit, a 60-day supply of either the study medicine or the placebo will be given. This will need to be taken for 16 weeks. Visit 3 (approximately 30 minutes). Eight weeks after the beginning of the treatment, the participant will return to assess how she/he is doing under the treatment. Pulse, blood pressure, a physical exam, and pregnancy will be checked. At this visit, another supply of study medicine will be given. Visit 4 (2-3 hours). Sixteen weeks after starting the medicine, the participant will take a second series of tests in learning, memory, and reasoning skills to find out whether there were any changes in these skills. Visit 5 (approximately 1 hour). In the 16th or 17th week after starting the medicine, the participant will meet one more time with the doctor from visits 1 and 3. Vital signs, a physical exam, and an ECG will be taken, as well as a blood sample to ensure nothing has changed with the participant's general health. For women, a pregnancy test will be performed. If for some reason the subject withdraws from this study prior to Visit 5, he/she will be asked to return to the clinic for a "Treatment Discontinuation Visit." In addition, if the participant discontinues the medication prior to the end of the study, he/she will be asked to complete a "Retrieved Dropout Visit" on the date that should have represented Visit 5. Study medication will not be provided beyond the study period.</detailed_description>
