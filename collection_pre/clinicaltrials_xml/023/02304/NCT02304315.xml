	<brief_summary>This is a proof-of-concept study for GC1102 to demonstrate preventing the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection following liver transplantation and a dose-finding study to determine its optional dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of GC1102 (Recombinant Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin) in HBV-related Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GC1102 is a new recombinant hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. It is a monoclonal antibody and has high affinity and avidity to hepatitis B surface antigen and several advantages compared to HBIg derived from blood plasma of human donors. Forty volunteers will participate in the study, receive 24-week treatment with low dose (50,000IU) of GC1102 or with high dose (80,000IU) and be followed up till 28 weeks.</detailed_description>
