	<brief_title>Sildenafil in Heart Failure With Reactive Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be screened at the time of a diagnositic Right Heart Catheterization. Patients will be selected based on pressures measured during this procedure, current medications, and current symptoms. At baseline a 6 minute walk test and quality of life questionnaire will be administered. Medical records will be reviewed and results of recent testing will be recorded. Qualifying participants will be randomized to receive 90 days of either placebo or sildenafil 20 mg three times a day. Randomized patients will be followed for safety and efficacy by phone and as otherwise clinically indicated. At the end of the 90 day treatment period, patients will be evaluated via 6 minute walk, quality of life questionnaire, and other diagnostic tests as clinically indicated. Primary outcome will be change in the 6 minute walk distance. Secondary outcomes will be based on clinically available results such as change in heart pressures measured by right heart catheterization and echocardiogram. At the end of the treatment period, providers and patients will be unblinded in order to optimize further treatment. To achieve statistical significance, 64 patients will be enrolled and randomized.</detailed_description>
