	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effects of additional sensorimotor training (proprioceptive postural training, PPT) to conventional therapy in the treatment of chronic low-back pain. Half of the participants will receive instructed treadmill training as an active comparator against PPT. All participants receive conventional physiotherapy as prescribed by their treating medical doctors. It is expected that the PPT group will improve in postural control, proprioceptive, as well as pain and function outcomes to a significantly greater extent than the active control group.</brief_summary>
