	<brief_summary>Coadministration of drugs is common in the pharmacologic treatment of dyslipidemia, with statins and ezetimibe generally constituting the medication of choice. By acting at different levels, the combination of these drugs allows the therapeutic objective to be achieved. However, it is not known how these drugs qualitatively affect the composition of lipoprotein subfractions, which differ in size and atherogenic potential. The investigators set out to evaluate this effect as well as their effects on inflammatory, oxidative stress and endothelial function parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Simvastatin and Ezetimibe on Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Patients With Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of a randomised parallel trial and took place during a period of 2 months. A total of 42 hyperlipidemic patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: one received simvastatin (40 mg/day) and the other received ezetimibe (10 mg/day) for 4 weeks, after which both groups were administered combined therapy for an additional 4-week period. Lipid profile, lipoprotein subfractions of LDL and HDL, inflammatory, oxidative stress and endothelial function parameters were evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>LDL cholesterol concentration of between 160190 mg/dl in patients with less than 2 cardiovascular risk factors LDL concentration of between 130160 mg/dl in patients that presented 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular risk factors were defined as: age (≥ 45 years in men and ≥55 years in women), a smoking habit, hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg), diabetes mellitus, a highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration of ≤ 40mg/dl, and a family history of cardiovascular disease.
