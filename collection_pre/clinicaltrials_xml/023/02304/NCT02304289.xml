	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Artesunate in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Artemisinins, compounds extracted from the herb Artemisia annua, are safe and effective FDA-approved antimalarial drugs. Recent studies have suggested that artemisinins also exert anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells. Artesunate (ART) is a water soluble semisynthetic artemisinin with improved pharmacokinetic properties. A single-center phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral Artesunate in patients with Advanced HCC. Approximately 15 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Dose-escalation protocol: The first patient will receive 200 mg Artesunate once-daily for 14 days. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed after 14 days, the next patient will start at a daily dose of 300 mg Artesunate. If no DLT is observed after 14 days, a cohort of 3 patients will receive 400 mg once-daily for 14 days. For each subsequent cohort of 3 patients 200 mg will be added to the dose, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.</detailed_description>

Liver mass measuring at least 2 cm with characteristic vascularization seen on either triphasic computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium Patients must have refused treatment with sorafenib or must have had treatment with sorafenib, which was either stopped due to intolerance or therapeutic failure.

Women who are pregnant or breast feeding are ineligible for this study. For women who are not postmenopausal (12 months of amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to use adequate methods of contraception (e.g., hormonal implants, combined oral contraceptives, vasectomized partner), during the treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study treatment For men: agreement to use a barrier method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of the study treatment.
