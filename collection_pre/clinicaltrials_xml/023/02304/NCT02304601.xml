	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this research is the development and testing of a brief cross-indication instrument (screening) for use in the approval process of medical rehabilitation services. In addition to the empirical foundation, this generic instrument should have a high level of acceptance of both applicants and payers of rehabilitation services. Furthermore, an everyday and economic use for the routine application process for medical rehabilitation services at the German statutory pension insurance scheme should be provided. In the first study phase, a long instrument was tested with a sample of rehabilitees that received approval of medical rehabilitation services. This assessment including the measurement of rehabilitation-related somatic, psychological and social impairments was first tested for its psychometric properties and then reduced to a short instrument (screening) using quantitative methods. In the second study phase, the then-existing screening will be part of the application documents for medical rehabilitation services to assess its management properties and practicability in everyday use of the German statutory pension insurance scheme.</brief_summary>
