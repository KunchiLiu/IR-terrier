	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled trial of subjects with advanced (Barcelona stage B/C) hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects will be receive one treatment with Trans-Arterial Chemo-Embolization (TACE) prior to randomization. Subsequently, subjects will be randomized to observation or, if indicated, up to an additional TACE treatments, or to Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT). Tumor response following interventions will be evaluated at three months.</brief_summary>
