	<brief_title>Outcome After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improvements in the surgical treatment of coronary artery disease are possible only when implementation of current methods and development of new methods are based on the solid ground of large and reliable clinical data. Furthermore, clinical findings assume even more significance when detected in study populations from different institutions with heterogeneous referral pathways, baseline clinical characteristics and perioperative treatment strategies. The rationale of this European multicenter study is therefore to prospectively collect data on baseline characteristics, operative and anesthesiological methods and postoperative outcome of patients undergoing CABG in eleven cardiac surgery centers from five European countries. This multicenter prospective registrywill provide data to evaluate the prognostic impact of a number of patients' risk factors as well as the efficacy and safety of operative methods and drugs used during the pre-, peri- and postoperative period.</detailed_description>
