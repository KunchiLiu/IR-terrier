	<brief_summary>Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first line therapy recommended by NICE for the treatment of SUI. Due to poor motivation and compliance only 15-20% of women comply with the regimen. Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise has been developed as a new modality in the field of physiotherapy. The Galileo machine is a unique device for applying whole-body vibration. The investigators are currently using this therapy as an alternative to traditional pelvic floor muscle therapy. The investigators aim to audit the investigators treatment of whole body vibration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibration Training and Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength in Females With Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first line therapy recommended by NICE for the treatment of SUI. It was first described by Arnold Kegel almost 60 years ago. PFMT exercises help the patient strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor by the repeated high-intensity, rapid pelvic muscle contractions of both slow and fast twitch muscle fibres. The training of these muscles is difficult particularly when women have trouble in the perception of their PFM. This results in poor motivation and compliance with a Cochrane review suggesting that only 15-20% of women comply with the regimen. Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise has been developed as a new modality in the field of physiotherapy. Whole body vibration (WBW) has a positive effect on muscle strength and rate of force. Stochastic WBV causes up to 12 muscle contractions per second which cannot be achieved by routine PFM exercise with supervision of a physiotherapist. The Galileo machine is a unique device for applying whole-body vibration. The investigators aim to audit their treatment of whole body vibration. This would be done using the patient global impression of improvement scale (PGI-I) and routine quality of life and symptoms questionnaires (International Consultation on Incontinence Female lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire -ICIQ-FLUTS and Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - PFDI) to be completed by the patient at initial appointment and 12 weeks after treatment and pelvic floor muscle assessment carried out at initial appointment and at 12 weeks. Patients will also have a qualitative interview with the Urogynaecology team to assess if therapy was found to be suitable and acceptable to patients.</detailed_description>
