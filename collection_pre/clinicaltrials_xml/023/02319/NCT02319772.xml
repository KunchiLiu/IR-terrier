	<brief_summary>This is a 2-part, first-in-human dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of BCX4430 administered via intramuscular (IM) injection in healthy subjects. In part 1, subjects will receive a single dose of BCX4430; in part 2 subjects will receive BCX4430 for 7 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of BCX4430</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single, ascending doses of BCX4430 versus placebo in healthy subjects. Up to 6 ascending dose cohorts will be enrolled in a sequential manner. Eight subjects will be treated with a single dose of study drug per dose cohort: 6 subjects per cohort will receive BCX4430, and 2 subjects per cohort will receive matching placebo. Part 2 of the study will be initiated following review of all available data from Part 1 by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee Part 2 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 7 days of daily dosing with BCX4430 versus placebo in healthy subjects. Up to 4 ascending dose cohorts will be treated in a sequential manner. Ten subjects will be treated with study drug per dose cohort (8 subjects will receive BCX4430 and 2 subjects will receive placebo per cohort). The planned doses and dosing regimens for each of the Part 2 cohorts will be determined based upon data collected during Part 1.</detailed_description>
