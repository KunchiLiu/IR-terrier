	<brief_title>This Study Performed to Develop a New Technique for Measuring the Intra Abdominal Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective study, 40 patients undergoing elective surgery were included. Patients were divided into four groups of 10 patients. The control group (Group C) was not subjected to laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopic surgery was respectively performed with an intra-abdominal pressure of 9, 12 and 15 mmHg in Groups L (low), M (medium), and H (high pressure). Intraocular pressure was measured binocularly in each patient at three different time (before, during and end of surgery) using a contact tonometer.</detailed_description>
