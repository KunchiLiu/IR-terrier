	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers for controlling tourniquet induced blood pressure increase in patients undergoing carpal tunnel operations with IVRA. For this purpose files of patients undergoing operation under IVRA were retrospectively examined in terms of demographical and hemodynamic variables.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Calcium Channel Blockers and Beta Blockers on Tourniquet-induced Hypertension During Intravenous Regional Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After approval of the University Research Ethics Committee, the files of patients who have been operated under intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) in orthopedics clinics between January 2009 and January 2010 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 312 patients, 164 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 148 patients with trigger finger have been operated under IVRA. Out of 164 patients who have been operated due to carpal tunnel syndrome, 50 patients in which either calcium channel blockers or beta blockers were used for treatment of critical blood pressure increase after tourniquet inflation and in which whole data were obtained, were included to the study.The patients with systolic blood pressure above to 150 mmHg following tourniquet inflation and in which bolus dose of diltiazem 10 mg (Group I) or calcium channel blocker 0.5mg/kg (Group II) have been administered by intravenous route constituted the study groups. Demographical characteristics and hemodynamic parameters were recorded from the patient files.</detailed_description>
