	<brief_summary>This observational cohort study is designed to obtain product safety information from the routine clinical setting within large, diverse, community-based populations. In the setting of acute major bleeding in which patients are treated for Vitamin K antagonist reversal, the risk of thromboembolic events (TEE) in patients treated with Kcentra® and in patients treated with plasma will be assessed.</brief_summary>
