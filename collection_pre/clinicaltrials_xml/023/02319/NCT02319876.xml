	<brief_title>Expression of TIM-3 on Lymphocytes in Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunosuppression is the leading cause of death in septic patients.Lymphocyte apoptosis has been recognized as an important step in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Previous studies indicated that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein 3 (TIM-3) is a type I cell surface protein and was identified as a marker of lymphocyte dysfunction. The current project was designed to examine the express TIM-3 on lymphocytes and monocytes and its further role in immunosuppression during sepsis.</detailed_description>
