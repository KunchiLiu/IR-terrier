	<brief_summary>This pilot, phase I trial studies the safety of cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1)-specific T cells (a type of immune cell) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing sarcomas that have spread to other places in the body and are receiving palliative (relief of symptoms and suffering caused by cancer) radiation therapy. Placing a modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Palliative radiation therapy may help patients with advanced sarcoma live more comfortably. Giving NY-ESO-1-specific T cells following palliative radiation therapy may be a better treatment for patients with sarcomas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells when given following high-dose, hypo-fractionated palliative radiation to patients with advanced NY-ESO-1 expressing sarcomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To look for preliminary evidence of systemic efficacy of NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell therapy following radiation on non-radiated tumors. II. To determine whether radiation increases trafficking of adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1-specific T cells by comparing tumor biopsy specimens from radiated and non-radiated tumors. OUTLINE: Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1-specific T cells intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes 2-3 days after completion of radiation therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 2 weeks, at 4-6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks, and then for up to 6 months.</detailed_description>
