	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to estimate the effects of different strong enzyme (CYP3A4) inhibitors, itraconazole, diltiazem, or verapamil on the single dose pharmacokinetics of PF-00489791 in healthy volunteers. The study will enroll approximately 18 subjects that are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. The study is also intended to determine the safety and tolerability of single-dose PF- 00489791 when it is administered with steady-state itraconazole, diltiazem, or verapamil.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive (healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests) with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs.) and with a personally signed and dated informed consent document and who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Participating female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria: achieved postmenopausal status; have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Subjects cannot be included in the study if there is: the presence/ history of any disorder that prevents study completion Evidence/history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease Any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the absorption distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug A positive urine drug screen or history of regular excessive alcohol consumption or use of tobaccoor nicotinecontaining products in excess or from 24hours prior to admission until discharge Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 halflives preceding the first dose of study med. Out of range blood pressure including current evidence of orthostatic change in blood pressure Abnormal ECG or history or current evidence of clinically important cardiac conduction abnormalities. Also excluded are: pregnant or breastfeeding female subjects; male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male and female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as described in the protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product.</criteria>
