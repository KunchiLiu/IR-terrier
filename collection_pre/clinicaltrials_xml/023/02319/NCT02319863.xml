	<detailed_description>The only hope of long-term survival for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgical resection or liver transplantation, the former of which is more feasible at present. However, postoperative recurrence or metastasis is an ominous feature for this disease. Innovation of the surgical procedure for improving prognosis is under emergency request. This study examines the role of this simple technique on postoperative metastasis and long term survival. During the past 20 years, more 600 patients with primary HCC were performed hepatectomy with the new hemorrhage control technique, and prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was applied. We further applied a mice model ligating the pedicle of the lesion-located hepatic lobe before hepatectomy to imitate the clinic practice, and evaluated the role of the new technique on postoperative metastasis and survival.</detailed_description>
