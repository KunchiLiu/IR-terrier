	<brief_summary>Chicago is an epicenter for asthma health disparities in the U.S., with African-American children 5-11 yrs bearing a disproportionate share of the burden. Among the most visible of these disparities is the high rate of visits to the Emergency Department (ED) for uncontrolled asthma. Clinical uncertainties regarding the real-world effectiveness of guideline recommendations for ED discharge and strategies to reduce environmental triggers at home contribute to practice variation and poor adherence to guidelines. The CHICAGO Trial tests both ED- and home-level interventions to improve clinically meaningful outcomes in a minority pediatric ED population with uncontrolled asthma.</brief_summary>
