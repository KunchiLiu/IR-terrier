	<brief_title>Web-based Intervention to Prevent Risky Driving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a web-based intervention to prevent risky driving teen drivers licensed in the previous 90 days. The intervention will focus on promoting teen driver attention to the roadway. The investigators will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) experimental design for this feasibility study, randomizing to the intervention or control group. The investigators will complete a baseline assessment and follow up with participants at 1-month, 3-months and 6-months post-intervention delivery. This study will provide information on the feasibility of the web-based intervention to prevent risky driving and estimation of effect size of the intervention on simulated driving performance, self-reported driving behaviors, crash and citation data.</detailed_description>
