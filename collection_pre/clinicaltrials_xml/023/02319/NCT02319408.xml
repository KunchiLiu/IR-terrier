	<brief_summary>Insufficient migration and activation of tumour specific effector T cells seems to be the one important reason for inadequate host anti-tumour immune response. Ionizing radiation can induce a variety of immune responses. The goal of this randomized trial is to assess if a preoperative single fraction low dose radiation is able to improve anti-tumour immune response in operable early stage lung cancer.</brief_summary>
