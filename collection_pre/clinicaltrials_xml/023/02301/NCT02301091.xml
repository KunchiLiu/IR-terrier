	<brief_title>Combine TACE and RFA Versus TACE Alone for HCC With PVTT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the second most common cause of death from cancer globally. Although the development of imaging techniques has improved early HCC diagnosis, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is still identified in 12.5-39.7% of HCC patients at their initial visits. Patients suffering from extremely aggressive HCC with PVTT have a median survival time of only 2.7-4.0 months if left untreated. The current standard of practice recommends sorafenib, which has been shown to prolong overall survival (OS) by nearly 3 months in advanced HCC patients and by 1.5-3.2 months in those with PVTT. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the main treatment modality for unresectable HCC patients. Some recent prospective studies have demonstrated that TACE can serve as a safe and effective procedure in selected HCC patients with PVTT. TACE is recommend for a part of patients with HCC and PVTT by the treatment guidelines in China and Japan. However,due to the poor blood supplement of PVTT,the local control rate of PVTT after TACE treatment is low. Besides,as to some hypovascular intrahepatic tumors, TACE also could not controlled effectively. As regard to the high local control rate of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for intrahepatic lesions and PVTT reported in some studies, we thus suggested that the combination of TACE and RFA might have higher tumor control rate and survival benefit than TACE alone. We design this study to compare survival outcomes of TACE plus RFA and TACE alone in patients with HCC and PVTT.A total of 240 patients are needed according to statistician's calculation.They will be divided into two groups randomly by computer after sign the informed consent form.One group of patients received TACE plus RFA and the other group of patients received TACE alone.After treatment,patients will be followed-up on their survival, tumor response and adverse events.</detailed_description>
