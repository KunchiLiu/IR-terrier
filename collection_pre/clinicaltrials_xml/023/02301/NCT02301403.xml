	<brief_summary>This study is a 2-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT). Participants motivated to quit smoking will be randomized to one of two treatments: 1) a Modern Usual Care (M-UC) vs. 2) Abstinence-Optimized Cessation Treatment (AOCT). The components for the optimized treatment have strong theoretical and empirical support from the investigators previous screening studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a chronic care treatment package for smokers that will address the challenges and opportunities of each phase of the cessation process - motivation, preparation, cessation, maintenance, and relapse recovery. That is, to develop treatments for smokers not yet ready to quit, those who are preparing to quit, those actively engaged in the quitting process and those who have tried to quit but relapsed. To achieve this goal, this research comprises three distinct research studies, each of which represent a phase in a comprehensive chronic care treatment model for clinical intervention with smokers in the primary care setting: the Motivation Study, the Cessation Study, and the Long-term Quitting Study. The goal of each study is to test and identify effective intervention components for distinct phases of the smoking cessation process. These components will then be combined for future research on the effectiveness of this chronic care treatment package</detailed_description>
