	<brief_summary>One of the most powerful predictors of stroke is hypertension, with estimates of approximately 33% of adults in the United States experiencing this condition. Hypertension is very prevalent in the emergency department (ED), but significantly undertreated. The overall goal of this project is to develop a text messaging intervention to improve hypertension care in the ED. This will first be done by testing the feasibility of identifying hypertensive patients in the ED, and the response rate to text messages.</brief_summary>
