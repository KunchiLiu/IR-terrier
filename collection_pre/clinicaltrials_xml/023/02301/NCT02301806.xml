	<brief_summary>To investigate whether single administration of sitaglitpin can restore acute endothelial dysfunction and ameliorate impaired increase of the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) after oral glucose loading in patients with T2DM. To compare the effect of sitagliptin and glimepiride on endothelial function evaluated by flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and the number of circulating EPCs in patients with T2DM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Sitaglpitin on Endothelial Function During the OGTT in T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute and chronic improvement of endothelial function is expected through the pleiotropic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors. A randomized, prospective, open-labeled, parallel design. The duration of treatments with sitagliptin or glimepiride is 12 weeks. The number of study centers is a single (Dokkyo Medical University Hospital). Participants will be randomized into the two treatment groups; (a) 50mg sitagliptin (N=15) and (b) 1mg glimepiride (N=15). Anti-Hyperglycemic effect is expected to be similar according to our study</detailed_description>
