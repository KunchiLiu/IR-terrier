	<brief_title>Effects of Implicit Messaging by Cigarette Pack Color on Smoking Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will recruit 360, current daily Marlboro, non-menthol, red (n=180) or gold (n=180) cigarette smokers to a 50-day protocol using a randomized factorial design with two factors: (1) cigarette pack color manipulation (within subject: red, gold, plain packaging) and (2) warning label manipulation (between subject: graphic vs. standard text). The randomization will be stratified by own brand cigarette. To evaluate effects of changes in cigarette package coloring, participants will smoke commercially available cigarettes that may or may not be similar to their preferred brand of cigarettes throughout the study, but in different colored packages during three 15-day study periods (i.e., one period will be Marlboro plain (tan-olive) packs, one will be Marlboro gold packs and one will be Marlboro red packs; order counterbalanced). Participants will visit the Center every 5 days to complete assessments (11 total sessions).</detailed_description>
