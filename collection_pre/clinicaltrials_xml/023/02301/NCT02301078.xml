	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate short-term pain and function associated with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA) and injections of the enzyme collagenase clostridium histolyticum in patients with Dupuytren's disease. Scores on outcome measures will be compared between groups to determine whether treatments differ in terms of hand function and pain during the early post-treatment period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Function and Pain After Treatment for Dupuytren's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA) and injections of the enzyme collagenase clostridium histolyticum are two non-invasive treatment options for patients with Dupuytren's disease. While PNA has been offered for decades, injectable collagenase is relatively new. The effectiveness of each treatment has been compared in the literature; however, recovery, in terms of pain and short-term function has not been formally evaluated. The objective of this study is to objectively compare short-term function and pain outcomes associated with each of these two procedures in patients presenting with untreated Dupuytren's disease.</detailed_description>
