	<brief_title>A Trial of Aspirin on Recurrence and Survival in Colon Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 80mg acetylsalicylic acid (given orally once daily for 5 years) on 5 year overall survival (OS) for stage II and III colon cancer patients of 45 years of age and older. Preclinical, epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggest that acetylsalicylic acid use may reduce overall cancer risk and mortality in colon cancer patients. It is a phase III double blind placebo controlled, randomized trial of adjuvant low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in colon cancer patients. Patients will be stratified at randomization by centre, age (&lt;70 and ≥70 years) chemotherapy use (any versus none) and disease stage.</detailed_description>
