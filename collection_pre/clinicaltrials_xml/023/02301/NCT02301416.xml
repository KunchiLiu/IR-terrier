	<brief_summary>This study tests the efficacy of the medication, Qsymia, as an adjunct therapy in superobese individuals planning to undergo weight loss surgery. Individuals taking the medication before and after surgery will be compared to historical controls who had surgery without taking the medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qsymia as an Adjunct to Surgical Therapy in the Superobese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While there is obvious focus on the obesity epidemic that affects approximately one-third of the U.S. population, one subgroup within the epidemic remains on the fringe of scientific study and effective treatment options. The super obese patient, in this instance defined as those with a BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2, presents a difficult treatment challenge in managing this level of obesity. While bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, have been shown to be effective in severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2), the risks involved with surgical intervention in the super obese patient are high. Qsymia provides a potential opportunity to develop an effective treatment plan that would be an adjunct to surgical intervention in the super obese patient. Use of Qsymia in addition to a low-calorie dietary prescription pre-operatively would effectively decrease weight prior to surgical intervention, lowering surgical risk to some extent. Additionally, if continued post-operatively, Qsymia as an adjunct to the post-surgical dietary plan would potentially extend the weight loss horizon so that the probability of the typical weight loss plateau at 12-18 months is decreased.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2 Determined to be a good candidate for surgery based on medical and psychological exam. Willing to participate in a 36 month medically supervised weight loss plan prior to surgery. Planning to remain in the reasonable vicinity of the Wake Forest Baptist Health Weight Management Center for the duration of the study. History of prior weight loss surgery (removal/conversion from band to sleeve will not be excluded) Pregnant (women of childbearing potential will complete a pregnancy test (blood draw) to make sure they are not pregnant at the time that they initiate the medication).
