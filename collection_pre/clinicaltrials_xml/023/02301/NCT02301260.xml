	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a computerized technique designed to improve processing speed (i.e. the amount of time it takes for a person's brain to process information) in a multiple sclerosis (MS) population. The study is designed to study how well this technique can help people with MS increase their processing speed and their ability to function better in everyday life. This treatment protocol has been studied extensively with older adults, showing improvements on standard laboratory measures of processing speed and performance of activities of daily living.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Speed of Processing Training to Improve Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a double-blind, placebo-control randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of Speed of Processing Training (SPT) for improving processing speed (PS) deficits in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Slowed PS is one of the most common deficits in individuals with MS and such deficits have been shown to exert significant negative impact on multiple aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite these findings, few studies have attempted to remediate PS deficits in order to improve the everyday functioning of individuals with MS. This study is designed to (1) apply a treatment protocol for PS impairments well-validated in an aging population to individuals with MS with objectively observable deficits in PS and document its efficacy on standard neuropsychological outcome measures. In addition, the investigators will (2) assess the effectiveness of the intervention utilizing global measures of everyday life, including an objective measure (the Timed Activities of Daily Living; TIADL), as well as additional questionnaires to be completed by both the participant and a significant other. This study is also designed to (3) examine the influence of degree of PS impairment on treatment efficacy using neuropsychological tests, (4) evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment protocol and (5) examine the utility of booster sessions to facilitate long-term treatment effects.</detailed_description>
