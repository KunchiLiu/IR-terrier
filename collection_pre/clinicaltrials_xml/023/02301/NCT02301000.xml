	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of a 10-day course of per oral Metronidazole versus a one-time rectal instillation of an anaerobically cultivated human intestinal microbiota for the treatment of a first occurrence of clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Recurrent CDI is common after standard antibiotic treatment. We hypothesize that the instillation of a healthy intestinal microbiota will be more effective in inducing a durable cure than Metronidazole for primary CDI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to one third of patients with clostridium difficile infection treated with antibiotics experience recurrent or relapsing symptoms within a few weeks. Even with subsequent antibiotic treatment, multiple recurrences/relapses are frequent. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be significantly more effective in curing recurrent CDI than repeated antibiotic treatment. In current guidelines, FMT is proposed as a treatment option after multiple recurrences/relapses of CDI. The rationale to reserve transplantation of donor feces for recurrent and difficult cases of CDI is a possible risk of pathogen transmittance and the cumbersome and costly process of finding a donor and screen for communicable disease. The effect of FMT for recurrent CDI, however, suggests that this therapy may be more effective than antibiotics in inducing a durable cure also for primary CDI. We aim to use an anaerobically cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) that has been extensively tested for pathogens, from a donor screened for communicable diseases, to avoid the need for a case-by-case donor screening. The term Intestinal Microbiota Therapy (IMT) will be used to describe the ACHIM treatment. Patients with a first occurrence of CDI defined by diarrhea, as defined by the World Health Organization, and a positive stool test for Clostridium difficile toxin A or B will be randomized 1:1 to either a 10-day course of Metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. or a rectal instillation of 60 ml ACHIM suspension. Patients will be contacted on day 4 by an unblinded study investigator and on days 35 and 70 by a blinded study investigator to evaluate the treatment effect. In addition, the patients will register the frequency of bowel movements on days 1-4, 7, 14 and 21. In the case of clinical deterioration, appropriate measures will be undertaken according to current guidelines. A second instillation of ACHIM suspension will be considered on day 4 in the absence of clinical improvement. The primary endpoint is the rate of primary cure from CDI and no sign of relapse/recurrence within 70 days, or persistent diarrhea that could be explained by other causes with three consecutive negative stool tests for C. difficile toxin A or B. Treatment failure is defined as persistent diarrhea with a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin A or B. Relapsing or recurrent CDI is defined as diarrhea and a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin within 70 days of treatment initiation after an initial resolution of diarrhea. Preliminary sample size is estimated from a hypothesis of a primary cure rate without recurrence within 70 days of 75 % with Metronidazole vs. 87.5 % with IMT. An interim analysis is planned after inclusion of the first 40 patients to guide the final sample size estimation. Patients will be recruited at six hospitals in South-East Norway.</detailed_description>
