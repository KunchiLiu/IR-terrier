	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of ublituximab, a novel monoclonal antibody, to ibrutinib compared to ibrutinib alone in previously treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients with high-risk cytogenetic features. Half of the participants will receive ublituximab in combination with ibrutinib, while the other half will receive ibrutinib alone.</brief_summary>
