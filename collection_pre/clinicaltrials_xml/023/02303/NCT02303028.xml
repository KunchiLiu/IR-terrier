	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, dose escalation study where topotecan will be administered at lower doses given more frequently on a prolonged schedule (low dose metronomic; LDM), in combination with a fixed dose of pazopanib. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be evaluated for LDM topotecan in combination with pazopanib in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumours including CNS tumours. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies will be conducted to further define the exposure to and activity of LDM topotecan in combination with pazopanib.</brief_summary>
