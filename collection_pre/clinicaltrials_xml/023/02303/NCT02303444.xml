	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare time to symptomatic progression (TTSP) from study entry in asymptomatic patients with RAI-refractory progressive DTC for whom there is a decision to initiate MKIs at study entry with that of asymptomatic patients with RAI-refractory progressive DTC for whom there is a decision to not initiate MKIs at study entry.</detailed_description>
