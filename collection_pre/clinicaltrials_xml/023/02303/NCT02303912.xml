	<brief_summary>A first in human experimental treatment in which an experimental medicine,Nuc-1031, is used in combination with a standard cancer medicine, carboplatin, to treat ovarian cancer which reappear after standard cancer treatment. The aim of the trial is to determine safety, effectiveness, and clinical activity of this combination treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Nuc-1031 and Carboplatin Combination to Treat Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nuc-1031 and carboplatin combination is a new experimental treatment for ovarian cancer which reappear after standard chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the name for drug treatments to kill or control the growth of cancer cells. Although there is some evidence from laboratory and clinical studies that Nuc-1031 is effective in the treatment of ovarian cancer, it has not yet been tested in combination with another chemotherapy drug. So this combination treatment is classed as a first in human study(Phase1B). The aim of the study is to investigate whether adding Nuc-1031 to carboplatin can improve the benefits of chemotherapy. Other purposes are to find out whether Nuc-1031 is safe to give with carboplatin, to identify the correct dose of Nuc-1031 when given with carboplatin and establish how effective the combination is at treating ovarian cancer. This study is also designed to enable us to find out whether Nuc-1031 adds further benefit, over and above that achieved by carboplatin alone, when treating ovarian cancer. and carboplatin combination will be given in six cycles. Each cycle is 3 weeks long. On first day of first week of each cycle (day1), selected study participants will receive one dose of both Nuc-1031 and Carboplatin chemotherapy. Following this, the study participant will receive a second dose of Nuc-1031 alone on first day of second week (day 8). This schedule will be repeated every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.</detailed_description>

Adequate renal function assessed as glomerular filtration rate(GFR) ≥ 60 mL/min using Cr51ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) method. Ability to comply with protocol requirements. Participants must be postmenopausal (12 months of amenorrhea), surgically sterile or they must agree to use a physical method of contraception. Oral or injectable contraceptive agents cannot be the sole method of contraception. Participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within seven days prior to the first study drug administration.

Symptomatic Central Nervous System (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases. Prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy (other than short cycle of palliative radiotherapy for bone pain), or immunotherapy within 28 days of first receipt of study drug (within 6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C). Hormone therapy within 14 days of first receipt of study drug. Prior toxicities from chemotherapy or radiotherapy which have not regressed to Grade ≤ 1 severity [National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, (NCICTCAE) version 4.03] except for neuropathy and alopecia. Another active cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma) within the last 3 years. Participants with uncontrolled concomitant illness or active infection requiring IV antibiotics. Participants with serious illnesses, medical conditions, or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with a their participation in the study, or with the interpretation of the results. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or known active Hepatitis B or C. Any condition (e.g., known or suspected poor compliance, psychological instability, geographical location, etc.) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect the participant's ability to sign the informed consent and undergo study procedures.
