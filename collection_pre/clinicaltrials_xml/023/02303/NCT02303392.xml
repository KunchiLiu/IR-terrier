	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor when given together with ibrutinib in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as selinexor, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving selinexor together with ibrutinib may be a better treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor and Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose for the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia(SLL)/B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL/PLL or aggressive NHL. II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL/PLL or aggressive NHL. III. To obtain preliminary evidence on efficacy of the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL/PLL or aggressive NHL. IV. To obtain preliminary evidence of response in CLL/SLL/PLL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients receiving the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib as related to CLL/SLL/PLL karyotype and immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status and DLBCL subtype, respectively. V. To evaluate the inhibition of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL/PLL who receive the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib. VI. To evaluate the change in localization of tumor suppressor and growth regulation proteins in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL/PLL following treatment with selinexor in general and as related to response. VII. To preliminarily assess potential causes for primary and secondary resistance to selinexor and ibrutinib. VIII. To measure intracellular levels of selinexor and metabolites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to identify how this relates to pharmacodynamics effects and clinical outcomes. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor. Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) on days 8-28 of course 1 and on days 1-28 on subsequent courses and selinexor PO twice daily (BID) weekly on day 1 or bi-weekly on days 1 and 3. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A histologically confirmed diagnosis of CLL according the International Workshop on CLL/SLL/Bcell PLL or variant of these (IWCLL or World Health Organization [WHO] Criteria) and meet criteria for treatment or have need for cytoreduction for stem cell transplantation or alternative cell therapy; OR A histologically confirmed diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) de novo or in the setting of transformation from an indolent lymphoma (including DLBCL not otherwise specified) according to the World Health Organization criteria for diagnosis of NHL; AND Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for CLL or NHL, need additional treatment, and meet criteria for relapsed or refractory disease; they may not be a candidate for curative therapy; relapsed disease is defined as a patient who previously achieved a complete remission (CR) or a partial remission (PR), but after a period of six or more months demonstrates evidence of disease progression; refractory disease is defined as progression within six months of the last antileukemic or antilymphoma therapy, or any response less than a CR or PR Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2 Patients with NHL must have objective, documented evidence of disease prior to study entry Platelet count &gt;= 50,000/mm^3 in the absence of bone marrow involvement; patients with bone marrow involvement only require a platelet count of 30,000/mm^3 Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1000/mm^3 in the absence of bone marrow involvement Creatinine clearance (as calculated by Cockroft Gault equation = [140age] * mass [kg]/[72 * creatinine mg/dL) &gt;= 30mL/min Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;
