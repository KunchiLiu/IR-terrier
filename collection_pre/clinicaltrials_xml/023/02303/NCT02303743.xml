	<detailed_description>Background: Getting ready for a colonoscopy is difficult and involves a lot of steps. The information given to patients is very important to adherence to treatment. The investigators have created a novel smart phone application (SPA) aimed to increased bowel preparation quality and patient satisfaction, using different educational tools. Methods: The investigators have performed a prospective, endoscopist-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. The investigators have enrolled 260 outpatients owners of a smartphone. Patients were randomly allocated to two different protocols: instructions provided by SPA (SPA group; n=108) or written instructions with visual aids (control group; n=152). All procedures were performed in afternoon time and patients received the same purgative regimen (2-L PEG solution plus ascorbic acid), in a full-dose same-day regimen. The day before colonoscopy (Baseline), patients initiated low fiber diet. The study was designed to detect an improvement in quality of bowel preparation using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS) scale. The effect of protocol on patient satisfaction was assessed with a specific questionnaire at time of the colonoscopy.</detailed_description>
