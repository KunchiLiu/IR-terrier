	<brief_summary>This project seeks to identify neural mechanisms underlying the tendency for anxious individuals to pay more attention to threatening information than to other types of information. A computerized treatment designed to train individuals to reduce their attention towards threat will be tested, with a focus on understanding the aspects of brain function that predict response to the treatment. This work could ultimately lead to the ability to treat anxiety more effectively by directly targeting the aspects of brain function that are altered in a given patient.</brief_summary>
