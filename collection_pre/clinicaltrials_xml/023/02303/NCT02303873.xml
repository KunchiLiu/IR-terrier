	<brief_summary>Alendronate should be considered as an alternative therapy of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) because it significantly increased areal bone mineral density (BMD) and its Z score, decreased fracture incidence, inhibited bone resorption biomarkers. Alendronate exerted beneficial roles in different age brackets, especially in young patients with OI.</brief_summary>
