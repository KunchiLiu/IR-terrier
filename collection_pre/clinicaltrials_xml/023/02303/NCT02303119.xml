	<brief_summary>Patient will receive either one infusion of rituximab IV and seven administrations of rituximab SC (experimental arm) or four infusions of rituximab IV (standard arm). The hypothesis is that the use of rituximab by sub cutaneous route and the scheme of administration could: - optimize rituximab exposure leading to improve response rate - increase adaptative response and then improve long-term control disease.</brief_summary>
