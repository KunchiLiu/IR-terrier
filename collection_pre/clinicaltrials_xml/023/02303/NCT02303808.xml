	<brief_summary>This trial aims to analyze whether the inhalation of hypertonic saline combined with a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device increases the amount of sputum expectorated during the chest physiotherapy session ( inhalation + bronchial drainage).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positive Expiratory Pressure During Inhalation of Hypertonic Saline in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will perform two different arms of treatment in a crossover randomization. Each arm of treatment will be applied during 5 consecutive days. The wash-out period will be one week. Before starting the trial all patients will do an inhalation formation. During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remains unchanged</detailed_description>
