	<brief_title>Effects of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Glioma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical stable patients with 1) low grade glioma (LGG) or 2) anaplastic glioma under age 70 will undergo a home-based exercise program (intervention) or will be assigned to the active controle group. Patients in the intervention group will undergo a 6-month home-based exercise intervention. An individual exercise prescription will be based on the patients' level of aerobic fitness (VO2peak) as measured with cardiopulmonary testing (CPET; on a cycle ergometer with ECG and gas exchange measurement) at baseline. Patients will exercise (e.g., running, biking, swimming) three times per week for 6 months. Session duration will vary between 20 minutes and 45 minutes. Patients in the active control group will be advised to walk regularly based on brochures from 30minutenbewegen.nl. All primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0; prior to randomization), and at completion of the 6-month exercise intervention (T1), and at a similar time-point for patients in the active control group. These will include indicators of feasibility (accrual, adherence, compliance and attrition), subjective and objective physical fitness measures, neuropsychological performance scores, and self-reported cognitive symptoms and mental wellbeing.</detailed_description>
