	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify genetic variations in survivors of testicular cancer and connect these variations to differences in risks of late effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Identification of late-effects through questionnaires and linkage to national registries. DNA samples will be gathered through buccal swabs or saliva kits and analysed with whole exome-sequencing.</detailed_description>
