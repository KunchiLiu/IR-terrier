	<brief_summary>Medication use, especially NSAIDs and PPIs, prior to diagnosis is considered a risk factor for MC development. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is unclear. It is hypothesized that NSAIDs, PPIs, and SSRIs may have an effect on the colon permeability, due to an idiosyncratic reaction which results in a local immune response. MC patients are considered to be susceptible hosts, prone to react on administration of abovementioned drugs. In order to test this hypothesis and to generate new insights in the pathophysiology of MC, we want to perform an Ussing chamber experiment using fresh colon tissue samples. The primary objective is to assess ex vivo the effect of NSAIDs and PPIs on epithelial permeability of colon biopsy specimens of MC and non-MC patients, using the Ussing chamber system</brief_summary>
