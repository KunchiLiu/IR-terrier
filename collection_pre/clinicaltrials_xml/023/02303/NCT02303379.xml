	<brief_summary>It is the aim of our study to compare the effects of 6 and/or 2 years of either HIT (carried out at correctly assessed 85-95% of maximal heart rate), pyramid, or continuous endurance training, on changes of physical exercise capacity in cardiac patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Endurance Training Protocols in Cardiac Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three exercise arms (isocaloric) are composed as follows: Endurance training: 31 min at 65-75% HRmax, making it a total of 25min; HIT: 4x4min intervals at 85-95% HRmax divided by 3x3min of active recovery at 60-70% HRmax, making it a total of 25 min; Pyramid: One pyramid consists of 8 one-minute blocks. Those are grouped starting with one block of 70-75% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and another one at 80-85% HRmax. The top of the pyramid are 2 blocks of 85-90% HRmax. Intensity is lowered afterwards with one block of 80-85% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and last one at 70-75% HRmax. Two more pyramids follow, each divided by 2min of active recovery at 65-70% HRmax, making it a total of 28min. All protocols are initiated by 5min of warm-up and end with 5min of cool-down, both at 60-70% HRmax. Primary Outcome: Individual maximum power output in watt (Pmax). Secondary Outcome: Change of power output in watt at lactate tresholds at 2 and 4mmol/l.</detailed_description>
