	<brief_summary>This is a prospective single center trial to examine the rate of negative biopsy result and quality of life after focal ablation by radiofrequency energy. The primary evaluation involves assessing the rate of negative biopsy result using MR-US fusion biopsy six months after focal ablation of the prostate. Urinary and sexual quality of life will be assessed through validated measures. The hypothesis of our study is that focal ablative therapy will result in a greater likelihood of negative biopsy on followup biopsy than that observed in men who elect not to undergo therapy.</brief_summary>
