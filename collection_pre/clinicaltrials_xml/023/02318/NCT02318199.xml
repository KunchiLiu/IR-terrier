	<brief_summary>Emergence agitation is a frequent complication that can have serious consequences during recovery from general anesthesia. However, agitation has been poorly investigated in patients after craniotomy. In this prospective multicenter cohort study, adult patients will be enrolled after craniotomy and emergence agitation will be evaluated. The incidence, risk factors and outcome will be investigated.</brief_summary>
