	<brief_summary>Abstract This is a multi-center, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK) study examining the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose of treprostinil delivered intravenously or subcutaneously in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Subjects will be divided into 5 cohorts by age. A blood sample will be obtained from each subject at steady state. Additional blood samples will be obtained from a small subset of subjects with a 15% increase or with at least a 15ng/kg/min increase in dose from steady state. Samples will be sent to a pharmacokinetic laboratory for analysis. Linear regression analysis will be used to determine the relationship between the steady state plasma concentration and drug dose. A power model will be used to assess dose proportionality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Sub-q and IV Treprostinil in Kids With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information and Rationale Treprostinil has not been adequately studied to determine its safety and efficacy in children â‰¤ 16 years old. However, the drug's use and tolerance in children with PAH has been demonstrated in studies with small sample sizes. Although the pharmacokinetic relationship of treprostinil has been established in adult patients with PAH, the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose for children requires further investigation because of physiologic differences, such as the maturity of enzyme systems and drug clearance mechanisms, between children and adults. The subjects in this study will be divided into cohorts by age to address the physiologic changes that occur throughout childhood. Currently, no data exists demonstrating the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose for children treated with intravenously or subcutaneously delivered treprostinil. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil among different age cohorts in children will provide the data to make an informed recommendation for dosing based on age (and possibly weight).</detailed_description>
