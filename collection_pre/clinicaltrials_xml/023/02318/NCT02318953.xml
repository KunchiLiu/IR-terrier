	<brief_summary>This study evaluate if in an ambulatory breast reconstruction patient population at Women's College Hospital (WCH), can we avert in-person follow-up care through the use of mobile app home monitoring compared to conventional, in-person follow-up care in the first 30-days following surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Mobile App Home Monitoring on the Number of In-Person Visits Following Ambulatory Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women's College Hospital offers specialized surgical procedures, including breast reconstruction. Patients often travel great distances to undergo surgery. The average ambulatory breast reconstruction patient travels 76 km from home to hospital, with the furthest patient coming from 540 km away. Most patients receiving ambulatory breast reconstruction have a low rate of postoperative events necessitating clinic visits. However, regular follow-up is still considered important in the early post-operative phase. Increasingly, telemedicine is used to overcome the distance patients must travel to receive specialized care. Telemedicine data suggests that mobile monitoring and follow-up care is valued by patients and can reduce costs to society (1-3). Currently, Women's College Hospital is using a mobile application (QoC Health Inc., Toronto) to complement in-person postoperative follow-up care for breast reconstruction patients.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergoing breast reconstruction at Women's College Hospital. They must be able to use a mobile device and communicate in English. They must be nonsmokers because smokers carry increased rates of complication and both surgeons have a policy to solely operate on nonsmokers (minimum smokefree period of one month leading to surgery). Pain ratings captured in the VAS and QoR9 are important for judging quality of postoperative recovery. Preexisting pain or an inability to take narcotics would compromise the reliability of these measures. Therefore, patients must not suffer from chronic pain. They must not be taking narcotic (morphinelike) medication for pain on a regular basis. They must not have an allergy to local anesthetics or morphinelike medications. Accommodation of special populations: Patients with hearing or speaking impairments will be accommodated with the help of translator. The person who regularly attends visits with her will facilitate this, or if no such person is available, we will use a hospital translator. All patients will receive an explanation of the study and the consent form in writing. All material will be understandable by patients with a grade 6 reading level. If our patients have lower than a grade 6 reading level, we will ask them if there is a family member at home who could assist them with the use of the mobile device.</criteria>
