	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of fresh, frozen or lyophilized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via colonoscopy in patients with recurrent C. difficile associated diarrhea (RCDAD). We will generate a frozen, lyophilized or fresh fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) inoculum from well-screened healthy volunteer donors of â‰¥150 gram/sample. Delivery of FMT will be performed colonoscopically. Fecal samples from donors and recipients will be saved for later metagenomic studies to characterize the microbiome of the gut in patients before and after FMT. Donors will be enrolled and screened at the Center for Infectious Disease laboratory for enteric pathogens at University of Texas School of Public Health (EPDL-UT-SPH) which is College American Pathologist and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified laboratory. The donors will come from a variety of places, including the University of Texas School of Public Health. We will screen at least 70 donors to recruit at least 20 qualified donors. Recipients All patients to be treated must have a physician who is willing to care from them after discharge from our facility. Recipients will need to have insurance or be willing to self-pay for this therapy. Attending physician of recipients/patients will order the FMT and make clinical decisions related to overall health for his/her patients. All patients undergoing therapy will be handled as outpatients at either Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in the Texas Medical Center, the Digestive Disease Center at Memorial Hermann in the Texas Medical Center, or Kelsey-Seybold Clinic - Main Campus on Holcombe Blvd. Once the procedure is completed, the recipient will be transferred back to their original medical treatment facility or be released to home care under the care of their physician. A gastroenterologist with privileges at Endoscopy procedure site will perform the FMT via colonoscopy. The Center for Infectious Disease enteric pathogens laboratory at the University of Texas School of Public Health will prepare donor stool for administration via a colonoscope. We will screen at least 120 recipients to recruit 100 qualified recipients. Evaluation of the safety of FMT and recurrence of clinical symptoms of CDAD will be performed by the primary physicians and research coordinators from the EPDL-UT-SPH. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of the FMT (fresh or frozen or lyophilized health donor feces) for the treatment of patients with 3 or more episodes of RCDAD. A second efficacy endpoint is to evaluate the recurrence of clinical symptoms and CDAD after initial therapy. In order to monitor any health effects for safety, participants will be contacted quarterly for three years following study completion. The recipient will be contacted by the investigator pre- and approximately 7, 14 and 30 days after the procedure is performed. The following procedures will be completed: review recipient diary with the recipient to ensure that the following information is recorded correctly and a fresh stool sample will be collected from recipient, tested for C. difficile toxins and an aliquot (2 mL) stored at -80C for future analysis (e.g. microbiome). The recipients will be contacted by phone for their diarrhea status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fresh, Frozen or Lyophilized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Multiple Recurrent C. Difficile Associated Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following safety endpoints will be evaluated in this study. Medical conditions Clinical improvement is monitored by telephone/email and or E-mail during 90 days after FMT. Minor clinical management of the subject with over the counter medication (e.g. loperamide, acetaminophen and Saccharomyces boulardii [probiotic]) will be performed in the case of mild diarrhea and abdominal pain. All subjects will be followed up by phone the day after FMT to assess health status during week one. Study subjects will be monitored on approximately days 7, 14 and 30 after FMT, at which time we will review the recipient diary with the recipient to review any adverse experience or medication taken since the medical history obtained at FMT. Investigators should determine if any adverse experience or medication need to be further studied. Donor will be contacted and tested if it is necessary. All actions will be recorded on with medical condition, dates of adverse experience and medication taken, indication for new medication taken, and total daily dose (Patient Data Collection Form). Recipients should be instructed at FMT to contact the Investigator if they have any questions regarding adverse experience or the appropriateness of a medication after FMT. Monitoring for safety The following definitions of terms are guided by the International Conference of Harmonization and US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 312.32). An adverse experience is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, of disease temporally associated with FMT procedure, whether or not considered related to the procedure, including, but not limited to: - Any symptom not previously reported by the recipients (Recent Medical History) - An exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, increases in the frequency and/or severity of the signs or symptoms of CDAD (defined as positive C. difficile toxin test and enteric symptoms) - A significant increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition - A condition first detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even through the condition may have been present before the procedure Details of all adverse experiences that occur after FMT through approximately day 90 visit will be collected as indicated above. Serious adverse experience is any adverse experience that: - Results in death - Is life threatening (at immediate risk of death from the procedure as it occurred) - Requires inpatient hospitalization (overnight stay) or prolongs a current hospitalization - Causes a persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Medical important (any event that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The investigator will exercise medical and scientific judgment when deciding whether expeditious reporting is appropriate in other situations not strictly meeting the listed criteria above. The investigators will meet/discuss with experts in the field if there is a question of whether the adverse experience would be considered serious. Severity - The adverse experience will be documented on the appropriate page in the Patient Diary according to the following descriptors: - Mild: associated with no limitation of usual activities or only slight discomfort - Moderate: associated with limitation of usual activities or significant discomfort - Severe: associated with inability to carry out usual activities or very marked discomfort Relationship - the relationship of adverse experience to FMT will be assigned by the Investigator according to the following definitions: - Probable: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the procedure that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected procedure and that could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of that patient's clinical state - Possible: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the procedure that follows a known or expected response pattern to the procedure but could readily have been produced by a number of other factors - Unlikely: a reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the procedure but for which causality from FMT cannot be ruled out. - Not related: a reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is unrelated to the procedure Pre-existing signs and symptoms and medical conditions Medical conditions that are present at or before the procedure that manifest with the same severity or frequency will not be recorded as adverse experience. Similarly, signs or symptoms related to a pre-existing disease will not be recorded as adverse experience unless there is an increase in the severity or frequency of the signs or symptoms. These pre-existing conditions, signs, or symptoms will be recorded on the Recent Medical History Form. Progression of underlying conditions as an adverse experience If the progression of the underlying condition might be reasonably anticipated given the nature and severity of the underlying condition, then the progression of the underlying condition per se will not constitute an adverse experience. However, if the progression of the underlying condition is fatal, then the progression of the underlying condition should be reported as an adverse experience. Recording and documenting adverse experience The Investigator must completely and promptly record each new adverse experience and serious adverse experience, even if the relationship of adverse experience to the procedure is assessed by the Investigator to be "unlikely" or "not related". In addition, the investigator must document and follow serious adverse experiences that occur from the procedure through 90 days after the FMT. The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis based on the presenting signs and symptoms. If an adverse experience meets the definition of a serious adverse experience then the Investigator must also complete the serious adverse experience, and also send any supporting source documents directly to the University of Texas Health Science Center IRB as soon as the event is discovered. At each visit, after the patient has had an opportunity to mention any problems spontaneously, the Investigator (or designee) will inquire about adverse experience by asking the standard questions listed in, such as: - Have you had any medical problems since your last visit? - Have any medical problems present at your last visit changed, i.e., stopped, worsened, or improved? - Have you taken any new medicines, other than study drug, since your last visit? Any spontaneous adverse experience information provided by the patient will be reported. If an adverse experience has not resolved at the time of the Final Visit, the Investigator should evaluate the status of the adverse experience at the Follow-Up telephone/email contact (day 60) and update to reflect the status of the adverse experience (e.g. ongoing or resolved). Investigator reporting of serious adverse experience All serious adverse experience must be reported to the University of Texas Health Science IRB using the serious adverse experience facsimile or email or by telephone/email as soon as the serious adverse experience is discovered, and within 24 hours after the Investigator recognizes or classifies the event as a serious adverse experience. A brief description of the event must be provided at the time of the initial serious adverse experience report. The initial serious adverse experience report should be followed up by additional information using the serious adverse experience within 48 hours. The reports should identify the patient by their unique patient number instead of names. The completed serious adverse experience Form will be used by the investigators in regulatory filings. The investigator is responsible for continuing to report to the University of Texas Health Science IRB any new or relevant follow-up information obtained concerning the serious adverse experience. The results of any additional assessments conducted must be also reported to the University of Texas Health Science IRB. Notification of post-study serious adverse experience Investigators are not obligated to actively seek follow-up information for patients with adverse experience after the conclusion of the study (i.e., &gt; 90 days after the FMT procedure). However, if the investigator becomes aware of an adverse experience that occurs after the patient completes and the adverse experience is considered by the Investigator to be at least possibly related to study procedure, the investigator must notify the University of Texas Health Science Center IRB.</detailed_description>
