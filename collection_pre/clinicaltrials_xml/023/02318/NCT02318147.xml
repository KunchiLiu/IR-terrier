	<brief_summary>Infectious complications are responsible for most of deaths in acute pancreatitis.Intestinal barrier dysfunction and increased intestinal permeability was associated with bacterial translocation which is believed to prompted these infections.The purpose of this clinical trail is to observe the potential capability of FMT in reduce the bacterial translocation and alleviate infectious complications by the reconstruction of a gut functional state.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Pancreatitis With Infectious Complications(FMTPIC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators aims to restore the intestinal bacteria homeostasis through FMT by retention enema with fresh bacteria,thus minimizing bacterial translocation and alleviating infectious complications. The investigators will further examine the effect of FMT on the incidence of infectious complicationsï¼Œduration of clinical course and mortality.</detailed_description>
