	<detailed_description>This is a first-time-in-human (FTiH) Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study of MEDI0562 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics and preliminary anti-tumor activity in adult subjects with selected advanced solid tumors.</detailed_description>
