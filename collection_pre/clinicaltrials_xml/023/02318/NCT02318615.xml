	<brief_title>Immediate Axillary Plasty With a Pedicled Muscle Flap for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper limb lymphedema is the main complication of axillary dissection. It is estimated that as many as 50% of patients undergoing lymph node dissection go on to develop lymphedema, with significantly decreased quality of life with frequent infections, decreased range of motion, and a cosmetic deformity. The treatment of lymphedema was be frustrated by technical difficulties and gave rise to a heavy budget burden. Some retrospective studies revealed that immediate and delayed breast reconstruction with lattismus dorsi flap brought unexpected relief to the upper limb lymphedema. The current study was composed to assess whether transferring a pedicled partial latissimus dorsi muscle flap to the axilla would prevent the occurrence of post-mastectomy lymphedema. This prospectively designed cohort study have two parallel arms. Patients undergoing axillary dissection would be recruited to one of the two groups, according their own preference.</detailed_description>
