	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Folic Acid Supplementation in Adolescent Epileptics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background, significance and impact value of the project: Homocysteine is a thiol‑containing amino acid formed as an intermediate product during the methionine metabolism. Re-methylation pathway recycles Homocysteine back to methionine and requires vitamin B12 and folic acid as cofactors. [1] The concentration of circulating total homocysteine is a sensitive marker of inadequate folate and vitamin B12 status. Elevated homocysteine concentrations are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease. [2] The total homocysteine level is the lowest in children and an increase with age is higher in male sex. [2] The cutoffs for homocysteine level in adolescent range from 4.3 to 9.9 µmol/l, and hyperhomocysteinemia is defined as homocysteine &gt;10.9 µmol/l. [3] Lower folate and higher homocysteine concentrations may put adolescent on AEDs at special risk for atherosclerosis in their adulthood. [4] This demands early intervention as Asian Indian adolescents are genetically more exposed to cadiovascular disease(CVD) risks, AED therapy is an additional risk for developing future CVDs. Adolescent epileptics on AED have to take it for long time, and homocysteine elevation itself has got epileptogenic potential and can cause the risk developing refractory epilepsy. [5] Literature search reveals several studies depicting role of vitamin B12 in regulation of blood homocysteine levels. [6, 7] However, the studies confirming role of folic acid supplementation in hyperhomocysteinemia and related CV diseases are fewer and scarce in AEDs induced hyperhomocysteinemia. Few studies have reported negative correlation between hyperhomocysteinemia and low folic acid levels in patients on AEDs. [8] At the same time few studies have reported effectiveness of folic acid supplementation to normalize the homocysteine levels. [9] Considering the results of various studies many doctors are now prescribing folic acid along with AEDs, although there is a scarcity of data from India. In this context, the present study is planned to study effect of folic acid supplementation on homocysteine levels and CV risk factors such as BP and lipids in adolescent epileptics taking AEDs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed epileptic patients of either sex with age between 1019 yrs (&lt;19yrs), coming to the medicine Out Patient /In Patient Departments and undergoing AED therapy for more than 6 months. Epileptics with high homocysteine levels i.e. &gt; 10.9 µmol/L (Normal homocysteine levels are 4.39.9 µmol/L for male and 3.37.2 µmol/L for female adolescent and a high homocysteine concentration is deaned as at least 11.4 µmol/L for male and at least 10.4 µmol/L for female. Gender mean of high homocysteine concentration is 10.9 µmol/L) [5] Pregnancy and lactation Patients with diabetes, Ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, malignancy and psychiatric diseases are excluded from study. The patients receiving vitamin supplements or who had clinical evidence for an acute illness, renal dysfunction, thyroid dysfunction, chronic inflammatory diseases, inborn errors of homocysteine, cobalamin or folate metabolism, or any other condition known to interfere with homocysteine metabolism will be excluded Patients who are already involved in any other trial. Patients not willing to fill consent/ assent form are also excluded from study.</criteria>
