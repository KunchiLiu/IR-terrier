	<brief_title>Effects of Beer (Alcohol) on Social Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs and it is often used in social settings to enhance sociability. There are few data showing that acute alcohol consumption affects facial emotion recognition. However the acute effects of alcohol in social drinkers on different aspects of social cognition are largely unknown. In the present study, we will therefore evaluate effects of beer (alcohol) on social cognition. The study will include 60 subjects (30 male, 30 female) and use a placebo-controlled, crossover design with the two experimental conditions alcoholic beer (individually calculated amount aiming to achieve a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.4g/kg), and non-alcoholic beer (placebo). We primarily aim to evaluate whether beer (alcohol) affects the ability to correctly decode emotions in facial expressions using different facial emotion recognition Tasks. Additionally, appraisal of visual erotic stimuli following alcohol consumption will be evaluated. Subjective social and mood effects will be assessed using validated questionnaires. Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma levels of the "social hormone" oxytocin as well as blood alcohol levels to test possible associations with effects on emotional processing.</detailed_description>
