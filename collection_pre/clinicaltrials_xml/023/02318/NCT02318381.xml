	<brief_summary>Aim of this prospective double blind randomized clinical trial is to understand the correlation of suprascapular neuropathy in the setting of large and massive tears of the shoulder rotator cuff and to investigate whether arthroscopic dissection of the superior transverse scapular ligament is positively related to the improvement of this neuropathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suprascapular Neuropathy in the Setting of Rotator Cuff Tears: Results of Arthroscopic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The suprascapular nerve originates from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus with participation from the A5 and A6 spinal nerve roots and occasionally from the A4 root. It is treading behind the clavicle and to the upper border of the scapula and then enters through the scapular notch of the shoulder and below the transverse superior transverse ligament to the rear surface of the scapula. This entry point is an important factor of pressure and surgical dissection of the ligament enlarges the space through which the nerve travels. The rotator cuff consists of the tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus , infraspinatus and minor teres muscles. Cadaveric studies have shown that tears in the cuff , particularly massive ruptures a gap more than 5cm, change the path of the suprascapular nerve and create conditions that pressure. Until now, there are no prospective studies that compare the improvement of suprascapular neuropathy after arthroscopic dissection of the superior transverse scapular ligament in patients with rotator cuff tears , or that study the degree of neuropathy compared with the extent of the rupture .</detailed_description>
