	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed primary diagnosis of Stage IV NSCLC (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 7th edition lung cancer staging criteria). Measurable disease according to RECIST v.1.1. An EGFR exon 19 deletion and/or an exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation. BDX004 Positive Label. Have received no prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or biologic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Subjects may have previously been treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage lung cancer or chemo radiotherapy for locally advanced disease provided this was completed at least 6 months prior to enrollment. No prior EGFR TKI therapy is allowed for any stage of NSCLC. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Exclusion Criteria History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational agent or erlotinib. History of known brain metastases. Prior treatment with any other investigational drug or biologic agent within 5 half lives prior to randomization, or any investigational device within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Any unresolved toxicity from previous radiation therapy. Significant cardiovascular disease, including: Echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) showing left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 55%. Cardiac failure New York Heart Association class III or IV. Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within 6 months prior to randomization. History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). Significant thrombotic or embolic events within 3 months prior to randomization (significant thrombotic or embolic events include but are not limited to stroke or transient ischemic attack). Any uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease. History of prior malignancy within 3 years prior to randomization (except for adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix, superficial bladder cancer, or early stage prostate cancer, without evidence of recurrence). Radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease.</criteria>
