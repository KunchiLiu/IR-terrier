	<brief_title>Influence of Elastic Tape on Activation of the Quadriceps Muscle During Selected Resisted and Weight Bearing Exercises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: This cross over design study will be used to determine the influence of elastic kinesiology tape on the speed and amplitude of quadriceps activation (anterior thigh) during selected resisted and weight bearing exercises. Background: Compliant tape, such as Kiniseoâ“‡ Tape (KT), is highly elastic and claimed by the manufacturer to mimic skin. It is commonly used by physical therapists and sports medicine practitioners to treat musculoskeletal conditions and to enhance physical performance. The creators of KT teach a variety of applications techniques to affect the underlying musculature. Current theory regarding elastic tape application suggests that if the tape is applied over a muscle from the proximal to distal attachments, it will facilitate the underlying muscle while applying the tape from distal to proximal will inhibit the musculature.1 While studies have investigated the effect of elastic tape on muscle activation, few studies to date have compared the direction of application on muscle activation.2-7 Methods and Measures: Healthy subjects between 18-35 years old will be recruited from the Upstate Medical University community via email and word of mouth. Potential participants will report to the Institute for Human Performance and will be asked to complete all documentation including informed consent and a health-screening questionnaire. If eligible, qualified participants will perform 2 functional jumping exercises (vertical jump and single-leg triple hop for distance) 8 and isokinetic knee flexion and extension at 60 degrees/sec and 120 degrees/sec using the Biodex System 3 Pro Dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). The Biodex isokinetic machine has been shown to be a reliable and valid source of measuring peak torque, position and velocity.9 Surface electromyography (EMG) recordings will be collected from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis during isokinetic testing. Testing will occur over four sessions. In the first session, baseline measurements and measurements immediately after KT application will be collected. In the second session, the participant will be retested after wearing the KT for up to two days (48 hours). This process will be repeated one week later during sessions three and four with KT applied in the opposite direction of the initial testing condition. KT application direction and the order of activities will be randomized for each participant.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The Physical Activity and Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ)(British Columbia Ministry of Health) will be used as a general screen of exercise safety. Additionally, researchers will ask participants to identify possible cardiovascular and/or orthopedic risks to resistance exercise, dominant leg injuries/surgeries, and regarding history or familiarity of elastic tape. Subjects who are at risk due to recent (within the last year) musculoskeletal injury to lower extremities will be excluded from the study. Additionally, we will exclude subjects who report significant respiratorycardiovascular disease, subjects with a history of surgery on their dominant leg, or individuals who have been trained in elastic tape theory and application. Any participant with a known allergy to adhesives will also be excluded from the study. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at the start of each session. Per ACSM's guidelines for exercise testing, if a participant's resting systolic blood pressure is greater than &gt;200 mm Hg or diastolic BP is &gt;110 mm Hg then he/she will be excluded from exercise testing and the study</criteria>
