	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to see if a single wrist injection (intra-articular) of dexamethasone at the time of treatment will reduce the incidence of early-onset of post traumatic osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-Articular Dexamethasone to Prevent Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis is that the intra-articular administration of dexamethasone soon after joint injury will prevent the subsequent development of PTOA, and restore normal joint homeostasis. We plan to generate the data needed to test this hypothesis in a Phase 0 (pilot) clinical trial using patients who have suffered distal radius fractures.</detailed_description>
