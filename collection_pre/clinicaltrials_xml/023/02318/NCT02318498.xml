	<brief_summary>Myocardial infarction with angiographically normal coronary arteries (MINCA) is common (7-8 % of all myocardial infarctions). There are several different causes behind MINCA where "true infarction" due to thromboembolism, myocarditis or Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy are the main findings. The underlying diagnosis is often made by clinical findings sometimes with the help of cardiac MRI (CMR). Investigators have previously shown that it was possible to give 50 % of the patients a diagnosis made by the combination of clinical findings and CMR made in median 12 days after the acute event. The present study aim at improve the diagnostic accuracy by an early CMR with latest technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stockholm Myocardial Infarction With Normal Coronaries (SMINC)-2 Study on Diagnosis Made by Cardiac MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study aim at improve the diagnostic accuracy in MINCA with an CMR made 2-4 days after the acute event. The aim is to give 70 % of all patients with MINCA (35-70 years old) a definitive diagnosis made by CMR only. One-hundred and fifty patients will be included and compared with a similar historical sample where 50 % of the patients received a diagnosis made by a late CMR and clinical findings. The study has 80 % power to detect this 20 % absolute difference (p &lt;0.05).</detailed_description>
