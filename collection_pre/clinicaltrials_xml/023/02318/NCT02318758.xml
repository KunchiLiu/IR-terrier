	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Oral Treprostinil and Ethanol in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the effects of ethanol on the PKs of a 1 mg dose of UT-15C in healthy volunteers to determine the in vivo effects of ethanol, including the timing of ethanol consumption in relation to UT-15C ingestion. This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, four-way (period), crossover study in which 28 healthy volunteers will receive a single 1 mg oral dose of UT-15C and/or ethanol. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment sequences such that all subjects will receive all four sequences in a pre-specified order.</detailed_description>

The subject is pregnant or lactating. 2. Subject has any clinically relevant abnormality identified during the screening physical examination, 12lead ECG, or laboratory examinations. 3. Subject has a history of anaphylaxis, a previous documented hypersensitivity reaction, or a clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to any drug. 4. Subject has a clinically significant history of neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, hematological, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, pulmonary, and/or musculoskeletal disease; glaucoma; a psychiatric disorder, or any other chronic disease, whether controlled by medication or not. 5. Subject has a history of postural hypotension, or unexplained syncope. 6. Subject has a blood pressure that is less than 85 mmHg systolic or 50 mmHg diastolic at Screening or Baseline. 7. Subject has a pulse rate that is greater than 90 bpm after sitting at rest for 5 minutes at Screening or Baseline. 8. Subject has a blood pressure that is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic at Screening or Baseline. 9. Subject has a predisposing condition that could interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs. 10. Subject has tested positive at the screening visit for HIV infection, HBsAg, or the HCV antibody. 11. Subject currently uses tobacco products or has a history of tobacco use within two months prior to Baseline. 12. Subject has a history of ethanol abuse or a history of or current impairment of organ function reasonably related to ethanol abuse. 13. Subject has a history of or current evidence of abuse of licit or illicit drugs, including a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse at Screening or Baseline. 14. Subject has a history of abnormal bleeding tendencies. 15. Subject has donated blood or plasma or has lost a significant volume of blood within four weeks prior to Baseline. 16. Subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory values in the opinion of the treating Investigator. 17. Subject has participated in a research study within the last 30 days.</criteria>
