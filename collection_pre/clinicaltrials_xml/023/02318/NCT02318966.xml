	<brief_title>Glycosade v UCCS in the Dietary Management of Hepatic GSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>'Glyde' is a prospective, randomised double blind crossover trial to compare the effects of 2 different starches used in the dietary management of GSD. The study will recruit 64 patients from approximately 6 centres in the UK, USA, France and The Netherlands. The planned duration per participant is 2 years. Participants will be randomised into 2 two equally sized groups: Arm A- Glycosade intake given first, followed by UCCS 1-6 weeks later Arm B- UCCS intake given first, followed by Glycosade 1-6 weeks later. The objective of this trial is to establish whether Glycosade速 improves outcomes for patients with GSD compared to UCCS therapy by comparing the duration of normal blood sugars, lactate and ketone levels of patients with hepatic GSD (Types I, III, VI and IX) post equivalent intakes of UCCS and Glycosade速. The first part consists of two (blinded) 12 hour starch load tests administered randomly within a maximum 6 week period. Participants will be randomised to receive either UCCS or Glycosade速 for the initial intervention period crossing over to the other product for the second intervention period (part 1). The second part (unblinded) is a 24 month open follow up whereby participant's will continue on the product considered most suitable by the clinician and patient.</detailed_description>
