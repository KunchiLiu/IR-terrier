	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are at increased risk of macrovascular events as well as microvascular complications. It is well known, that the pathophysiologic process of type 2 diabetes starts many years before the diagnosis can be made on the basis of elevated fasting blood glucose. In particular the data of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) study and the UKPDS post trial monitoring highlighted the importance of an early glucose lowering intervention in patients with T2DM with respect to micro- and macrovascular complications. The investigators and in particular the Euro Heart survey on Diabetes and the Heart demonstrated, that in a cardiovascular high risk population, namely patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), about 35% suffer from manifest type 2 diabetes. In addition, another 9 to 15% of CAD patients have postchallenge diabetes, diagnosed on the basis of an oral glucose tolerance test, which means that approximately a half of all patients with CAD have diabetes. Recently the investigators could demonstrate that not only established type 2 diabetes diagnosed on the basis of fasting hyperglycaemia is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, but also postchallenge hyperglycemia (i.e. impaired glucose tolerance or postchallenge diabetes). Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase endogenous glucagon like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and GLP-1 in turn increases the insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells in a glucose dependent manner as well as suppresses glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Investigations in type 2 diabetic patients showed that this drug class lowers both, fasting and postchallenge or postmeal glucose levels and hence, HbA1c and is well tolerated. However, the lowering of the surrogate measurement HbA1c has not necessarily turned out to translate into a reduced number of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. In contrary in particular for the thiazolidinedione Rosiglitazone concerns about an increased risk of cardiovascular events have been raised despite a robust HbA1c lowering effect.Therefore the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued in 2008 and 2010, respectively, guidance for new glucose lowering drugs, requiring proof of at least cardiovascular safety. Cardiovascular outcome trials with Linagliptin are currently being performed (CAROLINA, CARMELINA), however, it will take a couple of years until the results are available.A well known and validated cardiovascular surrogate parameter is endothelial dysfunction. The investigators and others have shown previously, that endothelial dysfunction is present in patients with coronary artery disease and early diabetes and can be improved by pharmacological intervention. This surrogate measurement could be helpful in better understanding the cardiovascular effects of Linagliptin while awaiting the results of the definitive outcome trials. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Linagliptin in coronary patients with early T2DM on various cardiovascular surrogate measurements including mechanical and biochemical endothelial function assessments. The overarching aim of our study is to investigate the effects of Linagliptin on endothelial function, arginine bioavailability ratios and postchallenge glycaemic control in patients with early diabetes and coronary atherosclerosis.</detailed_description>
