	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a laboratory-based assay that will be a real-time PCR test to detect the organism N. gonorrhoeae and its most important genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. This study will also determine factors associated with gonorrhoea and describe sexual behaviours of men who have sex with men, to inform parameters for a mathematical model of gonorrhoea transmission and antimicrobial resistant gonorrhoea.</brief_summary>
