	<brief_title>Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized double-arm pilot trial. Patients with acute ischemic stroke who meet inclusion criteria would be followed up for 90 days upon enrollment. There will be 150 intervention patients enrolled. Patients who agree to participate in observation but refuse intervention for various reasons will be assigned to the medical arm. The main reason for refusal to intervention is expected to be financial, as the cost of the intervention devices far exceeds that of hospitalization and pharmaceutical agents in China. Not all patients can afford or are under insurance that pay for these devices. We expect two thirds of the patients who agree to participate in this study will refuse intervention. These patients are expected to be similar in demographics to the intervention patients. Although patient selection bias is inevitable with this design, we believe this design is appropriate for a pilot study and is critical to provide the missing natural history data in Chinese population for future trial design. The intervention patients will be treated for mechanical recanalization with Solitaire within 12 hours after stroke onset plus standard medical therapy. The medical arm will be treated with standard medical therapy alone. During the trial, multiple indicators will be assessed in all patients at baseline, 24hours,14days(or at discharge, whichever occurs first)and 90 days. Primary efficacy endpoint will be functional independence as defined by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 2 at 90 days or function improvement by mRS shift analysis.Primary procedure efficacy endpoint will be arterial recanalization of the occluded target vessel measured by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score equal or superior to 2b right following the use of the Study Device. Primary safety endpoint is systematicICH with 24 ±3hrs post procedure.The secondary endpoints include: rate of device-related and procedure related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) at 14 days or discharge; volume of cerebral infarction as measured by a CT scan at 24 ±3hrs post procedure; arterial reperfusion measured by reperfusion ratio on CT scan 24 ±3hrs post procedure; infarction in subjects who achieved TICI 2b‐3 reperfusion without intracranial hemorrhage;death due to any cause at 14days or discharge and at 90 days; change in NIHSSat 24±3hrs post procedure;change in NIHSS at 14 days or discharge post procedure; change in NIHSSat 90 ± 7days; quality of life at 90± 7days; the proportion of patients who suffer a Safety Outcome : the proportion of patients with the composite of: (i) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ii) major bleeding due to femoral artery access complications including groin hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma (iii) contrast nephropathy;economic (cost-effectiveness) analysis;evaluation of waiver/deferral of consent process; the total radiation dose (CT, CTA, angiography) reported as a continuous measure;the proportion of patients with malignant MCA infarction;the proportion of patients undergoing hemicraniectomy. Because a substantial number of patients in the intervention group are expected to have intracranial atherosclerosis, subgroup analysis will also be carried out on this group of patient. The clinical outcomes, the final TICI score after angioplasty and possible stenting, and symptomatic ICH (including SAH) and immediate re-thrombosis rate will be included in the subgroup analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 1880 years 2. Clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke, stroke symptoms present for at least 30 minutes and has not significantly improved before treatment 3. No prestroke functional dependence (prestroke Modified Rankin Score ≤ 1) 4. NIHSS ≥ 8 and &lt; 30 at the time of enrollment 5. Patient is able to be treated within 12 hours of stroke symptoms onset with minimum of one deployment of the Solitaire Device. (onset time is defined as the last time when the patient was witnessed to be at baseline) 6. Patient is confirmed to have symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA/MRA or DSA, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M2MCA equivalent affecting at least 50% of MCA territory. 7. Patient or patient's legally authorized representative received information about data collection or if mandatory, has signed and dated an Informed Consent Form. 1. Baseline noncontrast CT or DWI reveals a moderate/large core defined as extensive early ischemic changes of ASPECTS 06 in the territory of symptomatic intracranial occlusion or DWI lesion volume &gt; 50ml. 2. Other confirmation of a moderate to large core defined as one of three ways: i. On a single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA: no or minimal collaterals in a region greater than 50% of the MCA territory when compared to pial filling on the contralateral side (multiphase/dynamic CTA preferred) OR. ii. On CT perfusion (&gt;8 cm coverage): a low CBV and very low CBF ASPECTS &lt;6 in the symptomatic MCA territory OR. iii. On CT perfusion(&lt;8 cm coverage): a region of low CBV and very low CBF &gt;1/3 of the CTP imaged symptomatic MCA territory. 3. Groin puncture is not possible within 70 minutes of the end of CTA/MRA acquisition. 4. Seizure at onset of stroke. 5. Prior stroke within the last 3 months. 6. Investigators thought the cause of occlusion were not atherosclerosis 7. Subject with a preexisting neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound the neurological and functional evaluations. 8. Presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial endocarditis. 9. Life expectancy of less than 90 days. 10. Known history of ICH, SAH, AVM or tumor. 11. Known disease with increased bleeding risk during the last 3 months, e.g. severe liver disease, ulcerative gastrointestinal disease, esophageal varices, hepatic failure. 12.
