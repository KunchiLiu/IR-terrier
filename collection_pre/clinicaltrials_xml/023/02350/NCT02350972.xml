	<brief_summary>In patients with multiple metastatic nodules of melanoma, the investigators evaluated whether autologous cytokines injected into cutaneous metastases would induce a systemic immune response as evidenced by the accumulation of dense lymphocytic infiltrates in metastases that had never been injected. Such immune responses were observed, and often the never-injected metastasis regressed completely. 20% of patients remained free of disease for greater than 5 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inducing Systemic Immunity and Regressions in Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphocytic infiltrates were seen in never-injected nodules only after several weeks of injections elsewhere. No adverse events were seen. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were able to kill autologous melanoma ex vivo. Some patients who experienced complete regressions of all metastases lived without disease for over 10 years.</detailed_description>
