	<brief_summary>All patients with acute aneurysmal hemorrhage are treated in accordance with our institutional protocol. After securing of the aneurysm, some smokers with acute aneurysmal hemorrhage are randomly assigned to transdermal nicotine replacement (NRT). The short- and long-term effect of NRT will be studied comparing non-smokers, smokers without NRT and smokers with NRT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Various aspects of the study: - Study cerebral circulation with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) prior to and after NRT. - Study cardiac output and peripheral vessel resistance minimally invasive (LiDCO) prior to and after NRT in patients that already have established LiDCO. - Monitor intracranial pressure prior to and after NRT in patients that have established an intracranial pressure sensor. - Register the frequency of cerebral vasospasm and complications in non-smokers, smokers without NRT, and smokers with NRT. - Register the use of opioids, opioidanesthetics, propofol og psycholeptics in non-smokers, smokers without NRT, and smokers with NRT.</detailed_description>
