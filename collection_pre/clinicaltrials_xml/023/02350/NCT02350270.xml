	<brief_summary>The main objective of the GOOD initiative was to determine which spatio-temporal gait parameters and/or combination(s) of spatio-temporal gait parameters best differentiate between cognitively healthy individuals (CHI), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those with mild and moderate dementia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait, cOgnitiOn &amp; Decline (GOOD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gait disorders are frequent in individuals with cognitive disorders. However, the profile of spatio-temporal gait parameters in the different cognitive status in aging (from normal cognition to dementia) has been poorly studied. Determining this profile associated with the severity of cognitive disorders may be helpful to understand the complex interplay between gait and cognitive disorders and, thus, may have important implication for the diagnosis process of patients with and without dementia. For instance, defining a motor phenotype of the severity of cognitive disorders by using quantitative gait measurements could be used to improve the prediction and the diagnosis of dementia. The investigators hypothesized that, compared to CHI, people with MCI and mild dementia could be characterized by specific phenotypes of spatio-temporal gait parameters measured with the GAITRiteÂ® system, and that these profiles could be explained by declines in domain-specific cognitive performance.</detailed_description>
