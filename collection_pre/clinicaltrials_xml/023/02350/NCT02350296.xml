	<brief_summary>The present bioequivalence phase I study is needed to compare the bioavailability and the concentration-time profile of the new immediate release formulation of KLS 40 mg with the reference compound OKi®, ketoprofen lysine salt 80 mg granules for oral solution (bipartite sachets). The objective of the study is to investigate the bioequivalence between two formulations containing ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) when administered as single oral dose in two consecutive study periods to healthy male and female volunteers under fasting conditions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As a part of the Dompé extension line program, Dompé develops a new immediate release tablets formulation of ketoprofen lysine salt 40 mg. The new immediate release tablets formulation of KLS 40 mg (corresponding to 25 mg of ketoprofen free acid) is expected to be essentially similar to the formulations of ketoprofen 25 mg for oral administration, that are already available in the European Community with the same indications: pain such as episodic tension-type headache, dental pain, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, postpartum pain, muscular and osteoarticular pain. The objective of the study is to investigate the bioequivalence (Cmax and extent of absorption of ketoprofen after single dose administration)between two formulations containing ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) when administered as single oral dose in two consecutive study periods to healthy male and female volunteers under fasting conditions. Furthermore, to collect safety and tolerability data after single dose administration of test and reference. Due to the lack of information about the PK profile of the new formulation it was not possible to calculate the sample size properly. For this reason it was decided to use a "two stage" bioequivalence study design. The sample size of 30 subjects is regarded as sufficient to satisfy the primary objective for the first stage of the study. After the end of study stage 1, PK parameters will be calculated and an ad interim bioequivalence test will be performed on the calculated PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. To safeguard the overall type I error, the Pocock spending function will be used to determine the α level of the bioequivalence test. Should bioequivalence be proven with the results of the subjects of the first stage and with an a posteriori calculated power of at least 80%, the primary objective of the study would then be satisfied and the second study stage will not take place. Should bioequivalence not be proven with the results of the subjects of the first stage or should it be proven with an a posteriori calculated power lower than 80%, the overall sample size for the study (stage 1 plus 2) will be calculated on the basis of the ad interim bioequivalence results. The Sponsor will decide whether the study has to continue or not. In the first case, the additional subjects will be enrolled into the second study stage. After completion of stage 2, the PK analysis and the bioequivalence test will be performed on the pooled subjects of the two study stages. The second stage will be performed after notification of the sample size to the local Ethics Committee and to the central Swiss authority (Swissmedic). An open design was chosen as it was considered adequate to evaluate objective measures such as pharmacokinetic parameters. All the personnel involved in the analytical determinations of the ketoprofen in the plasma samples withdrawn from the volunteers will be maintained in blinding. The sequence of treatments in the two study periods will be assigned to each randomised subject according to a computer generated randomisation list. A wash-out period of at least 4 days between the two administrations is justified by the elimination half-life of the ketoprofen (1-2 h).</detailed_description>
