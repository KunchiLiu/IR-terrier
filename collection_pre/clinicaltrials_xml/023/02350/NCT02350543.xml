	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the continuation (non-discontinuation) of Aspirin during TURBT. Half of participants will continue their usual low-dose Aspirin regimen during TURBT and throughout the perioperative period, while the other half will discontinue Aspirin use ten days prior to surgery (standard recommendation) and restart therapy two weeks post-discharge.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently, the American College of Chest Physicians in their 2012 clinical guidelines on perioperative anti-thrombotic therapy associated TUR of bladder tumour (TURBT) with an increased risk of bleeding associated with anti-thrombotic therapy. Despite this, contemporary series of TURBT identify the rate of significant in-hospital postoperative bleeding at only 2-3.4%. Previous prospective work by our group demonstrated no increase in postoperative hemorrhagic complications with early initiation of Aspirin following TURBT. These findings are supported by a recent retrospective work on TURBT showing a similar complication profile between continued perioperative antiplatelet therapy and antiplatelet naive patients. The risk associated with Aspirin withdrawal prior to surgery, including increased thrombogenicity, has been extensively studied. Following cessation of Aspirin, full platelet recovery is expected within 12-14 days, however, hemostasis may be regained with as little as 20% of normal platelet activity. Further, evidence supports a platelet rebound phenomenon in the setting of acute Aspirin withdrawal and a resultant clinical prothrombotic state, with thrombotic events peaking ten days following drug cessation. Finally, the acute stress response postoperatively is well known; one component being hypercoagulability which lasts at least seven days after major and uneventful abdominal surgery, predominantly caused by increased platelet activity. Whereas TURBT generally carries a low overall risk of cardiac morbidity, the general requirement to discontinue Aspirin pre-operatively potentially increases certain patients' cerebrovascular or cardiac risk (eg. post-coronary stent placement). As shown above, the risk of significant post-operative hematuria is minimal, and as such, Aspirin withdrawal may be unnecessary. We will perform a prospective, randomized controlled trial to address the safety and tolerability of continued Aspirin use during TURBT.</detailed_description>
