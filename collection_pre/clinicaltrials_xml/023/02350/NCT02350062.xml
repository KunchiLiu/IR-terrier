	<brief_summary>Different neuromuscular monitors may be available in the same care structure. Two different monitors are available in the investigators' institution in the operative room and the recovery room. However, these two monitors have not been compared and may not be interchangeable. Starting the monitoring with one device and continuing with another device may be inaccurate and may lead to inadequate medical decisions. The investigators therefore conducted this observational study to compare the two devices available in our institution.</brief_summary>
