	<brief_summary>Endometriosis is a benign chronic gynaecological disease that affects 10% of women of reproductive age and takes 40% of them to assisted reproduction techniques. The purpose of the study is to compare the antimüllerian marker (AMH) and antral follicular count (AFC) , with the most common serological markers of ovarian reserve. The investigators intend to confirm their clinical utility in the assessment of ovarian function, and to promote their use in predicting decreased ovarian reserve. The work therefore moreover arises the objective to validate the bibliographic data about using the laser for haemostasis after stripping endometriomas, to amplify knowledge available in the literature on the surgical treatment of ovarian endometriomas and on the diode laser application in minimally invasive surgery, appraising the trend of AFC and AMH levels and the possible surgical implications on fertility .</brief_summary>
