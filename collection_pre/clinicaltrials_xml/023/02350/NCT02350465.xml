	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to: 1) validate a rapid, portable, cost-effective method for screening myosteatosis and sarcopenia using diagnostic ultrasound, and 2) investigate a novel approach to progressive resistance exercise involving eccentric muscle actions that will counter the local effects of myosteatosis and sarcopenia in African Americans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection and Treatment of Sarcopenia and Myosteatosis in Older African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale for this study is the need to proactively address health disparities associated with age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction. Age-related changes in muscle may be characterized by sarcopenia (i.e., loss of muscle mass) and/or myosteatosis (i.e., excessive intramuscular adipose tissue). These changes may result in physical impairments that may be exacerbated by the lack of a formal screening and diagnosis process for older adults in standard healthcare settings. Myosteatosis may compound the effects of sarcopenia and play a significant role the age-related functional decline and higher incidence of type 2 diabetes observed in African Americans in comparison to other ethnic/racial groups. The initial phase of the study will involve the assessment of older African Americans (n = 70) to characterize muscle size and quality in comparison to a younger reference group (n = 70). Participants randomly selected from the older subject pool will be assigned to either the Eccentric Exercise Group or the Concentric Exercise Group for 12 weeks of a supervised strengthening exercise regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria you are eligible to participate if: 1. You are an African American adult. 2. You are between 18 and 30 years of age, or between 65 and 85 years of age. 3. You are able to independently walk at home and in your community (use of an assistive device like a cane or a walker is acceptable). Exclusion Criteria you are not eligible to participate if: 1. You have uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiovascular disease. 2. A Body Mass Index of 32.5 or above may be an exclusion criterion if the Xray technician determines that dimensions of the scanning bed are not adequate for a reliable examination. 3. You have a musculoskeletal condition that would stop you from performing the physical assessment tests. 4. You have muscle weakness due to neurological disease or injury (such as stroke or spinal cord injury). 5. You have moderate to severe sepsis (blood infection) or edema (such as swelling of a limb). 6. You have been hospitalized over the last three months. 7. You have a history of a broken arm or leg bone because of osteoporosis.</criteria>
