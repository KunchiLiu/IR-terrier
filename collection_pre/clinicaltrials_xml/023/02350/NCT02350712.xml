	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test a study drug called patritumab. Patritumab may work when combined with other medications that are approved in the UK for treating Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), called cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin. It is hoped that patritumab may have some benefit in treating patients with cancer. This study will help identify how much patritumab can be given in combination with cetuximab, and cisplatin or carboplatin. This study will also show how safe and how well tolerated patritumab is when these medications are given together.</brief_summary>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 14 days prior to enrollment (where demanded by local regulations, test may be required within 72 hours prior to enrollment). 10. Adult subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use doublebarrier contraceptive measures, oral contraception, or avoidance of intercourse during the study and for 90 days after last study dose received. 11. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. 1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%. 2. Prior epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted regimen. 3. Prior antiHER2, antiHER3, or antiHER4 therapy. 4. Prior treatment for recurrent/metastatic disease. 5. History of other malignancies, except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu disease, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years. 6. Known history of and active brain metastases. 7. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 160 mm Hg or diastolic &gt; 100 mm Hg). 8. Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) changes in RR, pulse rate, QT, QTc and QRS intervals. 9.

In case of platinumcontaining drug therapy with radiotherapy, &lt; 6 months before study drug treatment. 11. Therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy or major surgery within 4 weeks before study drug treatment. In case of chemotherapy with radiotherapy, &lt; 6 months before study drug treatment. 12. Participated in clinical drug trials within 4 weeks before study drug treatment. Current participation in other investigational procedures. 13. Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, known Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active hepatitis B or C infection, or undergoing medical treatment for infection. 14. Uncontrolled type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. 15. Known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction against any of the components of the trial treatment. 16. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or unwilling/unable to use acceptable contraception. 17. Psychological, social, familial, or geographical factors that would interfere with study participation</criteria>
