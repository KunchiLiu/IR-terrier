	<brief_summary>Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that involves the hair follicles. Topical corticosteroids are the established agents for treating this disorder. There are several case reports and case series which have demonstrated the efficacy of topical prostaglandins. The two agents have not been compared head-to-head in the published literature. The investigators attempt to compare the efficacy and safety of topical betamethasone and topical latanoprost in the treatment of localised alopecia areata.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that involves the hair follicles. Topical corticosteroids are the established agents for treating this disorder. Topical prostaglandins like latanoprost have also been used for this disorder. There are several case reports and case series which have demonstrated the efficacy of topical prostaglandins. However, the two agents i.e. topical corticosteroids and topical latanoprost have not been compared head-to-head in the published literature. The investigators attempt to compare the efficacy and safety of topical betamethasone and topical latanoprost in the treatment of localised alopecia areata.</detailed_description>
