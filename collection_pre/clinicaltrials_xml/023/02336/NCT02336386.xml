	<criteria>Male or female patients from 18 to 80 Biopsyproven EMP with relapsed or refractory Myeloma disease. Patients may be proteasome inhibitorexposed or naive, but cannot be refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy Disease requiring further treatment Measurable disease such as M protein and Objective and measurable of EMP Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to 2 Meet the clinical laboratories criteria as specified in the protocol Voluntary written consent Female patients who are lactating, breastfeeding or pregnant Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions as specified in study protocol Requirement for other concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, which would be considered as a treatment of EMP. Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens Ongoing or active infection, known HIV positive, active hepatitis B or C infection Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Known allergy to any of the study medications</criteria>
