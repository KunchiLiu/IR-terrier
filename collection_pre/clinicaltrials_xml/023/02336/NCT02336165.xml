	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter Phase 2 study of MEDI4736 with three non-comparative cohorts: Cohort A: 37 subjects with newly diagnosed unmethylated MGMT GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2 weeks in combination with standard radiotherapy. Cohort B: 30 bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2 weeks as monotherapy. Cohort B2: 32 bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2 weeks + bevacizumab every 2 weeks (10 mg/kg). Cohort B3: 32 bevacizumab-naïve subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2 weeks + bevacizumab every 2 weeks (3 mg/kg). Cohort C: 17 bevacizumab-refractory subjects with recurrent GBM will receive MEDI4736 every 2 weeks in combination with continued bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of MEDI4736 in Patients With Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors. MEDI4736 is an experimental antibody that is made in the laboratory. Antibodies stimulating the immune system have been developed for treatment of human cancers. The idea behind developing this type of experimental drug is that stimulating the immune system could be a different way of preventing cancer growth or killing cancer cells. This study will also evaluate how much MEDI4736 is in the blood at various times, whether the immune system becomes activated following treatment and the effect of treatment on cancer. In subjects with newly diagnosed GBM (Cohort A), MEDI4736 will be administered with standard treatment which includes radiation following surgery. The idea to add MEDI4736 to standard radiation is that the radiation will cause cell death and release tumor proteins which will increase the immune activity of MEDI4736. Subjects with recurrent GBM and who have never been treated with Avastin (Cohort B), will receive MEDI4736 alone. In Cohorts B2 and B3, subjects with recurrent GBM and who have never been treated with Avastin will receive MEDI2736 in combination with standard or low dose Avastin respectively. Subjects with recurrent GBM and who have currently progressed on Avastin (Cohort C), will continue receiving Avastin in combination with MEDI4736. Avastin is another type of antibody that prevents the growth of blood vessels that feed the tumor. Despite Avastin being approved by the FDA for cancer based on tumor response, essentially all patients eventually progress due to resistance. The idea to treat cancer with MEDI4736, with or without Avastin, is to identify alternative treatment options for cancer, by stimulating the immune system to prevent cancer growth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cohort A: 1. Subjects with newly diagnosed, untreated, unmethylated MGMT GBM who are eligible for standard radiation therapy. Cohorts B, B2, B3 and C: 2. First or second recurrence of GBM by diagnostic biopsy or contrast enhanced MRI per modified RANO criteria (122), with last baseline MRI confirmation within 14 days prior to Study Day 1. NOTE: Recurrence is defined as progression following therapy (i.e., chemotherapy; radiation). If the subject had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor therapy was administered for up to 12 weeks, and the subject has further evidence of tumor growth or undergoes another resection, this will be considered as one episode of recurrence. 3. On Study Day 1, at least 12 weeks from prior radiotherapy (unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or histopathologic confirmation of unequivocal tumor). 4. Cohort B, B2, B3: No prior VEGF/VEGFR targeted therapy; Cohort C: No more than one prior bevacizumab regimen. 5. Recovery from any prior treatment clinically significant, related adverse events to grade ≤ 1 or pretreatment baseline with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values listed per inclusion criteria. Cohorts A, B, B2, B3 and C: 6. Subjects with measurable or nonmeasurable disease. 7. Histopathologic confirmation of glioblastoma. 8. At the time of Study Day 1, subjects must be at least 4 weeks since major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury; there should be no anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. There should be no core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to Study Day 1. 9. Subjects who have previously been treated with the Optune device are eligible for the study as long as toxicity related to the treatment has resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. 10. ECOG ≤ 1 or Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70. 11. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function, as defined below: Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; or if subject has Gilbert syndrome, then total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.0 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault formula): Female CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 /72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL Male CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00/72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL Cohorts B2, B3 and C Urinary protein quantitative value of ≤ 30 mg/dL in urinalysis or ≤1+ on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is &lt; 1000 mg in a 24 hour urine sample. 12. Age must be greater than or equal to 18 years at date of consent. 13. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] in the USA) obtained from the subject/legal representative prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations.
