	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies giving radiation therapy to the liver in patients with uveal (eye) melanoma who have a specific chromosome loss (monosomy 3) or are DecisionDx Class 2 and therefore more likely to have their disease spread from the eye to the liver. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Early radiation to the liver may reduce the development of tumors in the liver and the overall risk of disease recurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Preventing Liver Metastases in Patients With Uveal Melanoma Who HaveMonosomy 3 or DecisionDx Class 2 Disease and Are More Likely to Develop Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Progression free survival in patients treated with prophylactic hepatic irradiation. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Acute and late term toxicity and overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy daily over 20 minutes on Monday-Friday for 10 fractions over approximately 2 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
