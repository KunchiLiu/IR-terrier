	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of BBI-4000 in Subjects With Axillary Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Multicenter, Randomized, Double Blind, Vehicle-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 3 concentrations of Topically Applied BBI-4000 in Subjects with Axillary Hyperhidrosis. Participating subjects will apply BBI-4000 once a day for 4 weeks in their axillae. The 4 week treatment period will be followed by a 2 week follow-up period. Safety will be assessed through collection of vital signs, adverse events, local skin responses, hematology and serum chemistry laboratory testing and ECGs. Efficacy will be assessed using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (patient reported outcome) and through gravimetrically measured sweat production. PK blood samples will be taken from study subjects from selected centers.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Hyperhidrosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Primary axillary hyperhidrosis of at least 6 months's duration Hyperhidrosis disease severity score of 3 or 4 at baseline Gravimetric test at baseline indicating at least 50 mg of sweat production at rest in each axilla, in 5 minutes (room temperature) Willing to refrain from using any other antiperspirant agent for the duration of the study. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while participating in the study. Any skin or subcutaneous tissue conditions in the axilla or near the axillary area, other than hyperhidrosis. Prior use of any prohibited medication(s) or procedure(s) within the specified timeframe, including: 1. Botulinum toxin to the axillary area within 1 year of the baseline visit. 2. Axillary iontophoresis within 12 weeks of baseline visit. 3. Axillary thermolysis, sympathectomy or surgical procedures of the axillary area at any time in the past. Use of systemic and/or topical anticholinergic treatment within 30 days of the baseline visit. Subjects with hyperhidrosis symptoms initiated or exacerbated with their menopause. Subjects with history of diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, thyroid disease, malignancy, glaucoma, intestinal obstructive or motility disease, obstructive uropathy, myasthenia gravis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), neurological conditions, psychiatric conditions, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, Sicca syndrome, or cardiac abnormalities that may alter normal sweat production or may be exacerbated by the use of anticholinergics. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to glycopyrrolate, anticholinergics, or any of the components of the topical formulation. Pregnant or lactating women. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the baseline visit. Prior treatment with the study drug in a previous trial. Any major illness within 30 days before the screening examination. Any other condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject at unacceptable risk for participation in the study or may interfere with the assessments included in the study.</criteria>
