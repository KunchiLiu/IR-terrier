	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2b, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of selinexor 80 mg plus dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd) dosed twice weekly in four-week cycles, in patients with penta-refractory MM (Parts 1 and 2) or quad refractory MM (Part 1 only).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2b, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of selinexor 80 mg plus dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd), both dosed twice weekly in each four-week cycle, in patients with MM previously treated with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and refractory to prior treatment with glucocorticoids, an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 mAb. This study consists of two parts: - Part 1 enrolled patients with both quad-refractory MM and penta-refractory MM. - Part 2 will enroll patients with penta-refractory MM only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Measurable MM based on modified IMWG guidelines. Defined by at least one of the following: 1. Serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5 g/dL by serum electrophoresis (SPEP) or for IgA myeloma, by quantitative IgA 2. Urinary Mprotein excretion ≥ 200 mg/24 hours 3. Free Light Chain (FLC) ≥ 100 mg/L, provided that the FLC ratio is abnormal 4. If serum protein electrophoresis is felt to be unreliable for routine Mprotein measurement, then quantitative Ig levels by nephelometry or turbidimetry are acceptable Must have previously received ≥ 3 antiMM regimens including: an alkylating agent, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, either daratumumab or isatuximab, and a glucocorticoid. There is no upper limit on the number of prior therapies provided that all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. MM refractory to previous treatment with one or more glucocorticoids, parenteral PI (i.e., bortezomib and/or carfilzomib), IMiD (i.e., lenalidomide and/or pomalidomide), and antiCD38 mAb (i.e., either daratumumab or isatuximab). Refractory is defined as ≤ 25% response to therapy, or progression during therapy or progression within 60 days after completion of therapy. Active smoldering MM. Active plasma cell leukemia. Documented systemic amyloid light chain amyloidosis. Active CNS MM.</criteria>
