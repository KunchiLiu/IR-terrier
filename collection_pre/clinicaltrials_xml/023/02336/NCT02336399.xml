	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).HBsAg loss/seroconversion is considered to be the ideal endpoint of antiviral therapy in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, and the ultimate treatment goal in CHB. However, some patients achieved HBsAg loss would reverse back to HBsAg positive, even occur HBV reactive. in this study, the viral and HBsAg response in patients achieved HBsAg loss by interferon treatment will be observed for two years after completed IFN treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sustained HBsAg and Viral Response in Patients Achieved HBsAg Loss by Interferon Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with chronic hepatitis B and achieved HBsAg loss by interferon treatment will be enrolled and observed for 96 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe will be measured every 3 months during the observation period, liver function tests were performed every 3 months also. The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken every 3-6 months. The primary endpoint is HBsAg reverse back to positive. The secondary endpoints is HBV DNA reaction.</detailed_description>
