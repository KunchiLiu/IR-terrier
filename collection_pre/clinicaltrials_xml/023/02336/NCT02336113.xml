	<brief_summary>Earlier studies have shown that pharmacists detect and solve drug related problems (DRPs) when they are a part of the multidisciplinary treatment-team at hospital wards. However, in the Norwegian health care system, there is a lack of studies on the effect of pharmacist intervention on clinically relevant outcomes. Hospital readmissions has both clinical and economical negative effects, and time outside the hospital until an eventual readmission is considered as a clinical relevant outcome measure. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial at an internal medicine ward at Oslo University Hospital. 400 acute admitted patients using minimum 4 regular drugs from minimum 2 drug groups will be enrolled in the study. Patients randomized to the Control group will receive standard care (without a pharmacist involved) and patients randomized to the Intervention group will receive a pharmacist in their treatment team during the hospital stay. The study hypothesis is that including a pharmacist in the multidisciplinary treatment team at a hospital ward, will improve the patients drug treatment, hence lead to an increased time outside the hospital until an eventual readmission.</brief_summary>
