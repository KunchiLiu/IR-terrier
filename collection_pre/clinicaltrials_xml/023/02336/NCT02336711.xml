	<brief_title>Molecular Imaging-based Dose Escalation in HPV Negative Patients With Locally Advanced SCC of the Oropharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to assess the feasibility (i.e. early toxicity) of an adaptive dose escalation through 18F-FDG-PET-based dose painting by numbers in 10 HPV negative patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. Treatment will be delivered with Helical Tomotherapy® or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Dose adaptation will be performed at 2 time-points with per-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans.</detailed_description>
