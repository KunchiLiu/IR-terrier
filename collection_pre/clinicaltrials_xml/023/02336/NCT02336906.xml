	<brief_summary>Constipation treatment has been found to ameliorate symptoms in some patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (including day time or combined day time/night time urinary incontinence). This study aims to explore if treatment of patients without overt constipation (As defined by the ROME III criteria) will also respond to anti-constipation treatment with reduction of their urinary tract symptoms. Assessment of severity and response of lower urinary tract dysfunction will be based on the Vancouver NULTD/DES questionnaire.</brief_summary>
