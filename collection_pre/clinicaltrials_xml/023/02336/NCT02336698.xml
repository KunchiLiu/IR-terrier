	<brief_title>Study of Efficacy, Safety of Fulranumab Monotherapy for OA of Hip or Knee, PAI3002</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is given to one group of participants while active drug is given to another group of participants to see if there is a difference in response), parallel-group (study drugs given to participants in all treatment groups during the same time period) to evaluate the efficacy (capacity of the investigational drug to produce an effect), safety, and tolerability of fulranumab administered as monotherapy (alone; not in combination with other drug therapy) to participants with chronic moderate to severe pain and functional impairment from knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) that is not adequately controlled by current pain therapy. The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 67 weeks (includes a screening period of 3 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 16 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up period of up to 48 weeks).). All participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatments (placebo, fulranumab 1mg, fulranumab 3mg) and given a single injection subcutaneously (under the skin) once every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks. Blood samples will be collected from each participant at time points during the study. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, physical examinations, laboratory tests and vital signs which will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
