	<brief_summary>Persistent pain after breast cancer surgery (PPBCS) affects 25-60% of breast cancer survivors and nerve damage has been implicated as the cause of this neuropathic pain condition. Local anaesthetic blockade of tenderpoints and the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) could provide clues to pathophysiological mechanisms as well as aiding diagnosis and treatment of PPBCS but has never been attempted. The aims of this study is to examine clinical effect of ultrasound guided blockades of the ICBN and tenderpoints of pain.</brief_summary>
