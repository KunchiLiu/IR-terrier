	<brief_summary>In patients with locally advanced tumour, neoadjuvant treatment has been proposed in various modalities as a way to decrease size and downstage the tumour leading to a re-sectable disease. The HybridTherm probe (HTP), (ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) com-bines bipolar RF-ablation with cryogenic induced cooling. It is well known that a bipolar radiofrequency system creates ablation with less collateral thermal damage than standard monopolar systems but with the trade-off to lose overall efficiency.</brief_summary>
