	<brief_summary>This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label, five-arm study in which the efficacy and safety of oral ceritinib treatment will be assessed in patients with NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges harboring a confirmed ALK rearrangement, using the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including positivity criteria). If documentation of ALK rearrangement as described above is not locally available, a test to confirm ALK rearrangement must be performed by a Novartis designated central laboratory. Patients must wait for the central laboratory result of the ALK rearrangement status before initiating treatment with ceritinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Ceritinib in Patients With ALK-positive NSCLC Metastatic to the Brain and/or to Leptomeninges</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 160 patients diagnosed with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC (according to the 7th edition of the AJCC [American Joint Committee on Cancer] Cancer Staging Manual) and active lesions in the brain and/or diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis will be included in the study, approximately 40 patients in Arm 1 and Arm 2, approximately 30 patients in Arms 3 and Arm 4, and approximately 20 patients in Arm 5. Additional patients may be enrolled in Arm 4 to achieve approximately 60 patients in Arms 3 and 4 together (i.e. ALKi naïve patients), if enrollment rate in Arm 3 is slow. - Arm 1 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain and with prior exposure to an ALKi. - Arm 2 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain but with prior exposure to an ALKi. - Arm 3 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain but with no prior exposure to an ALKi. - Arm 4 will include patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain and with no prior exposure to an ALKi - Arm 5 will include any patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with or without evidence of active lesion at the baseline Gadoliniumenhanced brain MRI. Note: Previous treatment with ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib is not allowed in Arms 1, 2, and 5. Ceritinib will be administered orally once daily at a dose of 750 mg (five 150 mg capsules) on a continuous dosing schedule. The treatment period will start on Cycle 1 Day 1. Complete tumor assessments including gadolinium enhanced brain MRI will be repeated at Week 8 (on Cycle 3 Day 1) and every 8 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) thereafter or earlier if clinically indicated. Safety evaluations will include (S)AEs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, laboratory parameters and WHO performance status. Blood and CSF samples for PK will also be collected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC according to the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. In addition, the NSCLC must harbor an ALK rearrangement, as assessed using the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including positivity criteria). If documentation of ALK rearrangement as described above is not locally available, a test to confirm ALK rearrangement must be performed by a Novartis designated central laboratory. Patients must wait for the central laboratory result of the ALK rearrangement status before initiating treatment with ceritinib At least one extracranial measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. A previously irradiated site lesion may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation. Patients may or may not have neurological symptoms but must be able to swallow and retain oral medication. Be neurologically stable within at least 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy, crizotinib (other ALK inhibitors are not allowed), biologic therapy or other investigational agents. Patients must have recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03). Patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study. Patient has life expectancy ≥ 6 weeks. Patient has a WHO performance status 02. Patients in Arm 1 to 4 must also meet the following inclusion criteria: Patients must have active brain metastases from NSCLC, confirmed by Gadoliniumenhanced MRI without concomitant leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Dose of steroids must be stable for 5 days before the baseline brain MRI. Patients in Arm 5 must also meet the following inclusion criteria: Patients must be diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Patients who need whole brain radiation to control the brain metastases. Patients will not be eligible unless treated brain lesions are progressive or new brain lesions are observed since the post whole brain radiation therapy MRI. Planning of any brain local treatment (including but not limited to surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation, intrathecal chemotherapy) following the administration of the first dose of study drug. Patient with a concurrent malignancy or history of a malignant disease other than NSCLC that has been diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past 3 years. Exceptions to this exclusion include the following: completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type. Patient has impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of ceritinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or malabsorption syndrome). Patient is receiving unstable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation, or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
