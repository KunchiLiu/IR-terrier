	<brief_summary>In this study, 6 volunteer participants with chronic spinal cord injury will be invited to use an autonomous hand exoskeleton device controlled by a brain/neural-computer interaction (BNCI) system fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) to detect the intention of the user to grasp objects of daily life. The BNCI system consists of a lightweight hand exoskeleton connected to portable motors, rechargeable batteries and a computerized control system integrated into a wheelchair. Before, during and after use of the BNCI system the volunteers will perform standardized assessments and complete questionnaires to assess the functional and psychological effects of the exoskeleton. Functional outcomes primarily focus on motor function in performing daily life actions while psychological outcomes primarily focus on safety, reliability as well as predisposition and perceptions of disability.</brief_summary>
