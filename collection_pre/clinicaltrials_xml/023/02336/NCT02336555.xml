	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine whether MK-8291 is effective in reducing pain in participants with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) with allodynia. The primary hypothesis is that when compared to placebo, treatment with MK-8291 reduces the change from baseline in participant-reported pain intensity by 1 on an 11-point numeric rating scale.</brief_summary>
