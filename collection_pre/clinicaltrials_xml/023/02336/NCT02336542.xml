	<brief_summary>96 TB subjects and 96 non-TB subjects with lung disease who all meet the standard are divided into different groups through a randomized, blind methods.Every subject inject intradermally ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD in different arms of the same person.Specific γ- IFN(gamma interferon) detection is needed before the injection.Evaluate the sensitivity (positive coincidence rate) ,the specificity (negative coincidence rate) and the coincidence rate of ESAT6-CFP10 in the tuberculosis patients and non-tuberculosis patients with lung diseases, and determine the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10 for clinical auxiliary diagnosis of tuberculosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIb Clinical Study of Recombinant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Allergen ESAT6-CFP10</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Firstly,96 TB(Tuberculosis ) subjects which meet the standard respectively are divided into different groups through a randomized, blind methods. 1. ESAT6-CFP10 （5μg/ml）in left arm； 2. ESAT6-CFP10 （5μg/ml）in right arm； 3. ESAT6-CFP10 （10μg/ml）in left arm； 4. ESAT6-CFP10 （10μg/ml）in right arm； Inject intradermally ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD(tuberculin purified protein derivative ) in different arms of the same subject.For each of the participants in this clinical research, this study uniform that left arm inject a drug(ESAT6-CFP10 or TB - PPD) first, observe 30 min and no no obvious adverse reaction ,then another drug(ESAT6-CFP10 or TB - PPD) inject in right arm. We need draw blood to detect specific γ- IFN before the injection.Observe and record the vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature),the skin reaction diameter of injection site (flush and induration) , local reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous membrane) and a variety of adverse events. Secondly, 96 non-TB subjects with lung disease are divided into different groups and the procedure are as the same as 96 TB subjects above . Finally,we evaluate the sensitivity (positive coincidence rate) ,the specificity (negative coincidence rate) and the coincidence rate of ESAT6-CFP10 in the TB patients and non-tuberculosis patients with lung diseases,determine the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10 for clinical auxiliary diagnosis of tuberculosis,and further evaluate the safety of ESAT6-CFP10 for the clinical auxiliary diagnosis of tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
