	<brief_summary>The general objective is to precise the role of HPA axis activity in neuropsychological consequences of type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that hyperactivity of HPA axis is associated with higher scores of depression and changes in hippocampal volume and mean diffusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothalamo-pituitary Adrenal Axis Activity and Neuropsychological Consequences in Type 1 Diabetes in Childhood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Background: Type 1 diabetes could be associated with hyperactivity of hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Type 1 diabetes is associated with higher frequency neuropsychological consequences as mood disorders and structural changes in brain, particularly in hippocampus. - Purpose: To describe the association between HPA axis activity and anxiety and depression scores in 6-12 year's old diabetes children. - Abstract: The general objective is to precise the role of HPA axis activity in neuropsychological consequences of type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that hyperactivity of HPA axis is associated with higher scores of depression and changes in hippocampal volume and mean diffusion.</detailed_description>
