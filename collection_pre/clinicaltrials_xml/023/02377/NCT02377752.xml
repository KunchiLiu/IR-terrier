	<brief_summary>This study consists of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). The main purpose of Part A is to evaluate safety and side effects of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin in Japanese participants with a group of rare cancers (advanced solid tumors, especially advanced soft tissue sarcoma [STS].) The main purpose of Part B is to evaluate how much olaratumab gets into the blood stream of Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part A: Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic solid tumor, especially STS, which is not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. Part B: Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of solid tumor that is advanced or metastatic. Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Have given written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures. Have adequate organ and coagulation function Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (PS) of less than or equal to 1. Have discontinued previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. (Part A only) Have a prestudy echocardiogram with an actual left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50%, within 21 days prior to first dose of study medication. All participants agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate sperm during the study and for at least 16 weeks following last dose of study drug. Female participants: are women not of childbearing potential due to surgical sterilization confirmed by medical history, or menopause. are women of childbearing potential who test negative for pregnancy within 7 days before the first dose of study drug based on serum or urine pregnancy test and agree not to breast feed during the study and for 4 months following the last dose of the study drug(s) Have an estimated life expectancy of more than or equal to 3 months in the judgment of the investigator. Have received treatment within 21 days of the initial dose of study drug with an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or device for noncancer indications or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. (Part A only) Have received prior treatment with doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, and/or other anthracyclines and anthracenediones (Part A only) Have received prior radiation therapy to the mediastinal/pericardial area. Have symptomatic central nervous system malignancy or metastasis. Participants with treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible for this study if they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their disease is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 60 days. Have an elective or a planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the study. Have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure greater than class II of the New York Heart Association guideline, severe myocardial insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Have unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac stenting, or myocardial infarction 6 months prior to study entry. Have a known allergy to any of the treatment components. Have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biologic composition similar to that of olaratumab. Have a known active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection Have a corrected QT interval of greater than 470 milliseconds (msec) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) Have a second primary malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor, may affect the interpretation of results.</criteria>
