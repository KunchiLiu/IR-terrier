	<brief_summary>The efficiency of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in hypercapnic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown in numerous studies. There is only a limited number of therapeutic options for patients with severely progressed interstitial lung disease (ILD). The question whether chronic hypercapnic ILD-patients are able to profit from nocturnal NIV and thus increase their performance in physical training has been left unknown. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the initialization of a NIV for hypercapnic ILD-patients during pulmonary rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
