	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of GS-6615 in adults with chronic stable angina and coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving a stable daily dose of up to 2 antianginal medications. The study will consist of two periods: a 1 to 3 week Qualifying Period and a Treatment Period lasting 13 days (± 3 days). During the Qualifying Period and at the end of the Treatment Period, participants will undergo exercise tolerance testing.</brief_summary>
