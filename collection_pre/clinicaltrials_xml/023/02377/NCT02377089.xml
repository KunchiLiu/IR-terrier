	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to use a clinical trial to test Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) to examine the efficacy of TNS as a new treatment for PTSD in veterans. Recruitment will take place at the PTSD Outpatient Clinic at the VA GLA. Study participants will be asked to complete, at most, 9 assessments/questionnaires regarding their PTSD symptoms and quality of life, use the TNS device every night for 8 hours, log their use of the device, and attend weekly visits to monitor safety and complete assessments. Each subject will be asked to attend 8 visits over the course of 8 weeks. Subjects who receives the sham-controlled treatment will have an additional follow-up phone visit 4 weeks after the week 8 endpoint to examine symptom improvements. Enrollment and subject-related procedures are projected to take approximately 36 months. Preparations for clinical trial, clinical trial/study procedures and data analysis will occupy a 6 month period, a 36 month period, and a 6 month period, respectively. The duration of this project is approximately 4 years.</brief_summary>
