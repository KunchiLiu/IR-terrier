	<brief_summary>When comparing targeting precision between DBS in parkinsonian patients and OCD patients, an unexpected deviation from the planned targets was discovered in OCD patients (Nuttin et al., 2013). The objective of this trial is to investigate whether the use of a micro-electrode assisted technique improves targeting precision in DBS at the BNST.</brief_summary>
