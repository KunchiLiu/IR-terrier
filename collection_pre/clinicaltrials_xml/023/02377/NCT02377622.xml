	<brief_summary>The study investigates the performance of a new dialyzer (Theranova 400) containing a membrane with increased pore sizes. The performance will be determined by the removal of middle molecules (with different molecular size) from the blood compartment. Two different Theranova 400 prototypes (AA and BB) operated in hemodialysis mode will be compared with a Cordiax Fx-80 dialyzer, operated in hemodialysis mode, and with a Cordiax Fx-800, operated in high volume hemodiafiltration mode. Safety events and albumin loss into the dialysate will be monitored</brief_summary>
