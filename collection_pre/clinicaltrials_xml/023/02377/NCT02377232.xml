	<brief_summary>At the University of Colorado Hospital primary care clinics, only 59% of eligible patients are up to date with current colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This is below the national average of 65% and well below the healthy people 2020 goal of 70.5%. Several screening methods exist to screen patients for CRC ranging from invasive (i.e., colonoscopy) to less invasive (i.e., testing the stool for blood). Although choice between screening methods is recommended, patients are not currently offered an unbiased choice and physicians generally recommend only colonoscopy. Further, the investigators know from research that choice increases screening rates. Unfortunately, many people do not follow through when only colonoscopy is offered. However, participants in one study were nearly twice as likely to be screened if they were offered a choice between colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing rather than being offered colonoscopy alone. Thus, in this project, the investigators aim to examine the feasibility of incorporating a patient decision aid (DA) for patients in CRC screening surveillance with the Ambulatory Health Promotion (AHP) using a pre/post design. The investigators will answer the following questions: 1) Is it feasible to incorporate a DA in the AHP protocol?; 2) Is it feasible to incorporate mailing patients a stool blood test?; 3) Does the DA change CRC screening decision quality, using proxy measures such as knowledge and intent; and 4) Does the DA change the proportion of participants that complete a CRC screening test? To answer these questions the investigators will compare survey responses and CRC test type completed between two AHP CRC surveillance patients groups - those that received usual care versus those that received the DA.</brief_summary>

Individuals that do not speak English Individuals that have limited cognitive function/developmental disabilities Individuals that have a personal or family history of CRC (previous adenomatous polyp), and/or, have a signs and symptoms colonoscopy order from their primary care physician Not eligible for CRC screening surveillance from AHP Have a terminal medical illness that would otherwise categorize them as inappropriate candidates for CRC screening as noted in their EPIC EMR: The individual exhibits any of the following: personal history of CRC, colectomy, colostomy, or ileostomy; currently prescribed anticoagulation medications (ReoPro (abciximab), Aggrenox (aspirin plus dipryridamole), Persantine (dipyridamole), Integrillin (eptifibatide), Ticlid (ticlopidine), Aggrastat (terofiban), Heparin, Coumadin (warfarin), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Xarelto (rivaroxaban)); currently prescribed plavix (clopidogrel); on chronic oxygen; have endstage renal disease; have unstable angina; have arrhythmia/atrial fibrillation; have cardiomyopathy; currently weighs &gt;350 pounds; have cystic fibrosis; and/or, are insured by the Colorado indigent care program (CICP) or MedicaidOld age pension, AARP Medicare/Secure Horizons (except PFFS), Denver Health Managed Medicaid, Evercare; Kaiser (not the prescriber of origin), Medicare Complete, New Medicaid, New CICP. Furthermore, dependent on the severity of the condition, the following are gauged for exclusion criteria and noted in the AHP CRC screening surveillance test notes to then inquire about appropriate candidacy for a colonoscopy: diabetes mellitus (insulin, oral, or both), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, reactive airway disease; chronic renal disease; multiple sclerosis; seizure disorder; murmurs; hepatitis; human immunodeficiency virus /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; aortic aneurysm; history of coronary artery bypass graft; heart valve issues (prolapse, regurgitation, etc.); tachycardia; bradycardia; history of myocardial infarction.</criteria>
