	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective study in adult patients with cirrhosis and grade 3 or 4 HE (West Haven Criteria) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lactulose retention enema in the treatment of deep grade HE (West Haven Criteria). The study will be conducted retrospectively in a single center of a multispecialty tertiary care hospital in India, in which lactulose retention enema is the mainstay of management of cirrhotic patients with grade 3 or 4 HE (West Haven criteria). Dosing of lactulose retention enema in this study will be done according to the dosing described for rectal administration of lactulose (India): 300ml of lactulose mixed with 700ml of potable water to be used as a retention enema; the enema is to be retained for 30-60 minutes and repeated every 4-6 hours until the patient is able to take oral medication. This treatment regime is also the standard protocol of management of deep grade HE (West Haven criteria) in the study center. The standard treatment protocol of deep grade HE (West Haven criteria) of the study center will also ensure that all known contraindications of lactulose will be respected before administration of lactulose retention enema to the study patients. The retrospective hospital records of the patient population of interest within the past 6 months will be identified, and these records will be used to collect data required for analysis.</brief_summary>
