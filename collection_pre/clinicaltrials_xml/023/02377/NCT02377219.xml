	<brief_summary>Our goal is to prospect the relationships between Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure (measured as its free and conjugated forms in blood and urine) and embryo implantation rate (measured as the ratio between the number of gestational sacs and the number of transferred embryos) after assisted reproductive technology. In order to reduce the confusion factors, the population study is limited to young women (aged 28 to 34), with regular menstrual cycles and without any medical event that could affect the implantation process</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bisphenol A Exposure, Ovarian Function and Assisted Reproductive Technology Outcome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among the various suspected adverse effects of BPA on human health, studies on the possible effects of BPA on reproduction are limited. Animal and in vitro studies indicate that BPA exposure can lead to disrupted oocyte maturation, E2 suppression and early pregnancy loss caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In the woman, studies about the consequences of BPA exposure on reproduction is a very difficult task since gametogenesis in the woman spreads over decades, from the intra-uterine life where meiosis is initiated to the end of the reproductive period at menopause. Recently, a decreased survival of human foetal oocytes cultured in vitro in the presence of BPA has been shown suggesting that in vivo exposure in foetal life could affect the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, a negative association between urinary BPA level and serum peak E2, oocyte yield and blastocyst formation has been suggested on a limited population of women performing ART. These results suggest that, in adulthood, both quantity and quality of human oocytes could be affected by BPA exposures. The study aims to respond to these questions by evaluating the relationships between BPA exposition levels and embryo implantation rates (as a marker of oocyte quality) and anti-Mullerian hormon (AMH) levels (as a marker of ovarian reserve) in large population of young adult women performing ART. BPA exposure will be assessed at two times in both blood and urine: 1°) before the ovarian stimulation at the time of ovarian reserve tests and 2°) at the end of the ovarian stimulation the day of the ovarian puncture for IVF.</detailed_description>
