	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study of Function and Participation in Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain damage may lead to various motor deficits, which further influence the function and participation. Cerebral vascular accident (CVA) is the common disorder for acquired brain damage. Neural network in patients with brain damage could also be used to determine their clinical behavior by identifying altered neural network associated with behavioral improvement. The investigators hypothesize that the level of brain image and biomechanical will change with time in patients with stroke. Under this hypothesis, the measures of biomechanical change are correlated with neural changes. The aim of this study is to investigate the function and participation in patients with stroke evaluated by clinical measures, biomechanical, psychological, physiological and multimodal brain image. The primary goal of this study is to establish, evaluate and follow-up biomechanical- and image-based biomarkers for the impairment of function and participation information processing present in patients with stroke.</detailed_description>
