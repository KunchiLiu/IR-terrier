	<brief_title>Risk Assessment for Postoperative Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Postoperative delirium (PD) - a temporary state of confusion - is a frequent complication of surgery, which most commonly occurs in elderly patients. Depending on the risk profile, 9-87% of patients are affected. Regarding the increasing age of surgical patients, prevention of PD is of even greater importance. New data lead to the assumption that medical preventive strategies may influence the frequency or at least the severity or duration of PD. Preventive measures in patients at increased risk for developing PD could possibly be administered; however, clinical predictors for PD are rare and/or unspecific. Different scores and test batteries to assess the preoperative risk of PD have been developed, but these tools are time-consuming and require trained personnel. In 2014, a computer program was developed at the Department of Anesthesia of the University Hospital Basel. This program called Delirium Risk Profile (DRP) may assess the risk of developing PD. It was developed for patients above the age of 65 years. The first part records patient details, such as age, level of training, language, sensory impairment, and regular drug intake. The second part tests different cognitive functions, more precisely cognitive self-assessment, temporal orientation, episodic memory, working memory, attention, and executive functions. In contrary to already available tools, this application can be operated by the patient alone without the help of trained staff. It was tested in healthy individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment and should now be evaluated in a clinical setting to determine whether or not it meets validity requirements. Study design: Prospective observational cohort study with a derivation cohort including patients scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Number of participants: Patients will be enrolled until a collective of 50 patients with PD is reached. Each study participant in the collective of delirious patients represents 2% in the final analysis. With an expected incidence of PD of 25%, an overall sample size of about 200 patients will be recruited. Recruitment: Eligible study participants (patients scheduled for surgery at the University Hospital Basel) will be identified from the appointments calendar of the Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic. Methods: This study is designed to calculate the accuracy of a computer program run as a tablet computer application (DRP). Before surgery, in the Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic, the patient performs in the tablet computer program to obtain a DRP score, which is the basis of this research program. A high score attained in the computer program suggests a low risk to develop PD. The score is then compared with results of postoperative tests conducted daily from day 1 after surgery. The tests used during this second stage are the Delirium-Rating-Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), which can be used to diagnose delirium and assess its severity, the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) Scale, and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). These tests are repeated for 5 days, until the patient is discharged or - if the patient develops delirium - until the symptoms of delirium have subsided. Endpoints: Primary endpoint: Correlation between the test score attained by the patient in the self-administered computerized test and the incidence of PD. To determine whether DRP scores can be used as a reliable predictor of PD, the patient will be scored using the application before surgery. This score will be compared with the results of delirium screening tests - the DRS-R-98, DOS Scale, and CAM, which will be conducted postoperatively after having conducted all tests. The threshold to answer the main issue with the DRS-R-98 is 15 points in the severity section - ≤15 points speak against, &gt;15 points speak for delirium - or an overall score of &gt;18 points speaking for delirium. The primary endpoint will have been reached when all tests have been conducted. Secondary endpoint: Severity of PD compared to the score attained by the patient in the self-administered computerized test. The severity of delirium in the respective patient will be determined using the DRS-R-98. A severity score of &gt;15 points (using only the severity part) or an overall score of &gt;18 points will be indicative of for delirium. Above these thresholds, the severity of delirium will be measured. The higher a patient scores, the more severe delirium. To assess the severity of delirium in a specific patient in this study, the highest score of all test results the patient attains, will be looked at. This score will then be compared with the patient's DRP-derived score using the application.</detailed_description>
