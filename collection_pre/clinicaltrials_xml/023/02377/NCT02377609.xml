	<brief_summary>The principal aim of this study is to define the relationship between tacrolimus concentrations determined from the finger prick DBS (Dry Blood Spot) method and those determined from blood samples collected by venepuncture in transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Validate an Analytical Method to Measure Concentration of Tacrolimus in Blood Taken From Finger Pricks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a bioanalytical assay method cross-validation study using blood samples donated by up to 100 liver and 100 kidney transplant patients. Subjects who will be attending a routine outpatient follow-up visit will be asked to provide 3 whole blood venepuncture samples (each sample = 3 mL blood) and 3 finger prick DBS blood samples at predose and at 1 and 3 hours postdose. All subjects will be discharged from the study and clinical site at 3 hours postdose. Subjects will derive no benefit from the blood collection procedures and will be paid a predetermined stipend for participating in the study.</detailed_description>
