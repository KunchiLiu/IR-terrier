	<brief_summary>Purpose: For the target population of adult patients with end stage osteoarthritis, this randomized clinical trial will be used to evaluate the benefit of three months of physical therapy compared to no treatment in patients indicated for total knee arthroplasty. Participants:Patients that are diagnosed with end stage osteoarthritis who are indicated for total knee arthroplasty. Procedures: Patients will be randomized to either receive physical therapy or no treatment. They will be scheduled to return in 3 months for discussion of operative versus continued nonoperative treatment of their osteoarthritis.This will be determined by change in PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) score and prevention of surgery.</brief_summary>
