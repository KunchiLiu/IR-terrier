	<brief_summary>The extracardiac Fontan surgery/procedure involves diverting the venous blood from the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary arteries without passing through the morphologic right ventricle. In the extracardiac conduit type of Fontan, one end of a synthetic tube graft is connected to the inferior vena cava and the other end to the pulmonary artery confluence. Xeltis developed a biodegradable prosthesis, the Xeltis Vascular Graft Model COR-VG-001, to be used as an extracardiac conduit between right atrium and the pulmonary arteries. The prosthesis is immediately mechanically functional, while its physiochemical characteristics should enable cell infiltration and tissue formation. The Xeltis Vascular Graft Model COR-VG-OO is specifically designed to enhance the Fontan surgery outcome by reducing synthetic material related complications and improving hemodynamic characteristics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although significant progress has been made in recent years in the field of congenital heart disease treatment, a substantial unmet clinical need remains for implantable materials/devices such as vascular grafts and heart valves with improved long-term performance and reduced device-related complications. To address these limitations new generation of biodegradable polymers using recent advances in supramolecular chemistry have been developed to create highly porous vascular grafts allowing efficient cell infiltration following by gradual replacement of the polymer material with the patient's own native-like vascular tissue resulting in full functional restoration. In addition to the ability of reducing postoperative graft-related complications such types of implants have a potential to grow to adapt to the overall body growth and therefore may represent a completely new modality for the treatment of congenital heart disease. In contrast to today's situation with synthetic non-absorbable vascular grafts considered as a "standard of care", where the pediatric patients have to be re-operated several times to adjust the prosthesis size to the somatic growth of the child associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and requiring prolonged anticoagulation treatment, a biodegradable polymer implant could represent a "one-time solution".</detailed_description>
