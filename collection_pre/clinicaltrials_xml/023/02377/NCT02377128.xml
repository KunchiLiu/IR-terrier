	<brief_summary>The aforementioned study was designed to evaluate short term ovarian reserve as assessed by anti-Mullerian hormone(AMH) levels following bilateral salpingectomy versus tubal ligation, as part of cesarean sections performed in women requesting future sterilization. The investigators aim to recruit 3 groups of 15 women undergoing elective cesarean section at the investigators' institution, 2 of which request sterilization (allocated to tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy) and one undergoing solely cesarean section. The groups will have blood drawn for AMH prior to the procedure and at a post-operation visit 8 weeks following. This is preformed in light of validated data offering better sterilization and possible diminished future risk of ovarian cancer with salpingectomy. Also, is has been proved to be just as safe as tubal ligation. This will be performed as a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
