	<brief_summary>Demonstrate the feasibility of dual energy computed tomography using Krypton as a gaseous contrast media in order to study the in vivo ventilation. Two different clinical situations will be tested : - Prediction of postoperative pulmonary function for oncologic patients - Detection of Bronchiolitis Obliterans in lung transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
