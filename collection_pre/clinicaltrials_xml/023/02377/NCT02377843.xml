	<brief_summary>Coverage of HPV vaccination among US teens is low, far below Healthy People 2020 goals. A central reason for low coverage is infrequent and inadequate healthcare provider recommendation of HPV vaccine. The proposed intervention aims to train clinicians to provide effective recommendations for the vaccine using participatory or efficient communication strategies. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two communication trainings to increase HPV vaccination coverage among adolescent patients. We will compare HPV vaccination for pediatric and family medicine clinics receiving a participatory communication training, efficient communication training, or no training. Ten clinics will be randomly assigned to each study arm for a total of 30 clinics. The primary outcome of this study is to compare the change in clinics' levels of HPV vaccination initiation coverage among 11-12 year old adolescent patients from baseline to 6 month follow-up. Secondarily, we will compare the change in HPV vaccination initiation coverage in 13-17 year old adolescents.</brief_summary>
