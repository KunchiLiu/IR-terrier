	<brief_summary>In the radiotherapeutic treatment of lung cancer, the dose that can be safely applied to the tumour is limited by the risk of radiation induced lung damage. This damage is characterized by parenchymal damage and vascular damage. In rats, we have found that radiation-induced vascular damage results in increased pulmonary artery pressure. Interestingly, the consequent loss of pulmonary function could be fully explained by this increase in pulmonary artery pressure. We hypothesize that also in patients a radiation induced increase in pulmonary artery pressure can be observed after radiotherapy, which may contribute to the development of radiation pneumonitis. The objective is to test the hypothesis that radiotherapy for lung cancer induces an increase in pulmonary artery pressure.</brief_summary>

Stage IIIA or IIIB Patients with extensive mediastinal lymph node involvement (such as N3), or large primary tumour size Adequate pulmonary function estimated by flow volume curves Life expectancy of at least 6 months Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.
