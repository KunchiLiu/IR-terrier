	<brief_summary>Currently there is paucity of information on the prevalence of pre-operative coronal imbalance in patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) and its influence on surgical outcomes. This study aims to investigate in DLS, the prevalence of coronal imbalance, to propose a novel classification system and to investigate whether pre-operative coronal imbalance affects clinical outcomes following osteotomy. A total of 284 DLS patients were recruited.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 284 DLS patients were recruited into this two-stage study, among which 69 patients were treated by posterior-only correction and the remaining 215 patients received conservative treatment. Using pre-operative long-cassette X-ray films, all patients were classified based on coronal balance distance (CBD) defined as the horizontal distance between C7 plumb line and central sacral vertical line: Type A, CBD &lt; 3cm; Type B, CBD &gt; 3cm and C7PL shifts to the concave side of curve; Type C, CBD &gt; 3cm and C7PL shifts to the convex side of curve. The prevalence of pre-operative coronal imbalance was calculated for stage I study. Post-operative CBD in patients who received surgery was measured to evaluate clinical outcomes for stage II study.</detailed_description>
