	<brief_summary>Aims - assessment of renal artery stenosis incidence in consecutive AMI patients included in the Romanian National Programme of Primary Percutaneous Revascularisation; - generating a cardio-renal-metabolic profile in patients with renal atherosclerotic disease; - creating a local registry (based on European CARDS percutaneous interventional registries) which also includes renal, metabolic and vascular data; - reporting long-term follow-up data on major cardiac adverse events (MACE) in the study group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Profile in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (REN-ACS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gathered data: - descriptive general demographic data; - previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting - CABG, known renal disease), cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal perimeter, body mass index, smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia); - routine biological data and specific non-genetic biomarkers; - information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms): coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications, final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow); - echocardiography at admission (LVEF); - metabolic data (obtained from body composition monitoring) - body water, body fat tissue; - renal arteries angiographic details (two independent operators evaluate stenosis based on a predefined scale); - renal dimensions; - measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial); - heart rate variability; - in-hospital and one month follow-up MACE;</detailed_description>
