	<brief_summary>Severe hypercholesterolemia produced by conditions such as heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with multiple complications including premature atherosclerotic disease. There is evidence that microvascular perfusion, particularly flow reserve, in critical organs is limited due to abnormalities in plasma viscosity, abnormal RBC deformability, and an imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. There is little is currently known about acute changes in microvascular blood flow and microvascular rheology that occur in response to plasmapharesis which is used in some patients to lower critically elevated cholesterol levels. Our research group has pioneered CEU methods for assessing myocardial and skeletal muscle perfusion, and has previously demonstrated in pre-clinical models that acute hyperlipidemia produces a reduction in microvascular RBC transit rate. In this study, the investigators will assess acute changes in microvascular perfusion in patients undergoing clinically-indicated plasmapharesis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects who are scheduled to have planned apheresis treatment for severe hypercholesterolemia will be recruited into the study. They will undergo a screening evaluation, including a medical history, physical examination, ECG, and limited echocardiogram to evaluate for exclusion criteria. Before the apheresis procedure, blood samples will be obtained for plasma markers of inflammation, erythrocyte deformability, and plasma viscosity. Contrast enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging will be performed to evaluate blood flow in the myocardium at rest, as well as in the forearm skeletal muscle before and after mild isometric exercise (50% maximal grip, 0.2 Hz). Flow mediated vasodilation will be performed. The subjects will then undergo their planned apheresis procedure. Within 2 hours of completion of apheresis, blood collection and CEU will be repeated. Plasma lipids will be available as part of the standard apharesis protocol.</detailed_description>
