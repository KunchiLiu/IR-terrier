	<brief_summary>Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, affects 6-10% of the general population of women in childbearing age. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of certain polymorphisms of genes Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1),Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) knowns to be involved in angiogenesis, tissue remodeling and proliferation, phenomena necessary for the growth of ectopic foci of endometrial tissue , and genes X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1), X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 3 (XRCC3) and xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) involved in DNA repair systems, needed in case of damage from oxidative stress, another potential factor involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. The study focus on the Sardinian population, known to have unique genetic characteristics due to geographical isolation.</brief_summary>
