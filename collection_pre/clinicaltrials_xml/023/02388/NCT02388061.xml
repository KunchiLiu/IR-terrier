	<brief_summary>Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke, who are are eligible for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours of stroke onset will be assessed for "dual target" major vessel occlusion and mismatch to determine their eligibility for randomization into the trial. If the patient gives informed consent they will be randomised 50:50 using central computerised allocation to intravenous alteplase or tenecteplase before all participants undergo intra-arterial clot retrieval. The trial is prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) design.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke eligible using standard criteria to receive IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset 2. Patient's age is ≥18 years 3. Intraarterial clot retrieval treatment can commence (groin puncture) within 6 hours of stroke onset. Imaging inclusion criteria, Dual target: 5. Arterial occlusion on CTA or MRA of the ICA, M1, M2 or basilar artery 6. Mismatch (only applies to anterior circulation) Using CT or MRI with a Tmax &gt;6 second delay perfusion volume and either CTrCBF or DWI ischemic core volume. 1. Mismatch ratio of greater than 1.2, and 2. Absolute mismatch volume of greater than 10 ml, and. 3. Ischemic core lesion volume of less than 70mL 1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) identified by CT or MRI 2. Rapidly improving symptoms at the discretion of the investigator 3. Prestroke mRS score of ≥ 4 (indicating previous disability) 4. Hypodensity in &gt;1/3 MCA territory or equivalent proportion of basilar artery territory on noncontrast CT 5. Contra indication to imaging with contrast agents 6. Any terminal illness such that patient would not be expected to survive more than 1 year 7. Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator could impose hazards to the patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in the study. 8.
