	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Oral Once-Daily Vonoprazan (TAK-438) in Participants With Erosive Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vonoprazan. Vonoprazan is being tested to treat people who have erosive esophagitis. This study will look at mucosal healing of people who take vonoprazan versus lansoprazole. This study will enroll approximately 480 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Vonoprazan 20 mg - Lansoprazole 30 mg All participants will be asked to take one tablet and one capsule at the same time each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record daytime and nighttime (during sleep) subjective symptoms in a diary on a daily basis. This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 11 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 7-14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Has been confirmed in an endoscopy to have erosive esophagitis, ie, the Los Angeles (LA) classification grades A to D within 7 days of the start of the Day 1 (Visit 2). Note: The recruitment goal is to ensure that those with LA classification grade C/D will account for more than 30% of all participants enrolled (144/480), with no further recruitment of those with grade A/B considered when they account for more than 70% (336/480) of all participants. 4.

Has received any investigational compound within 84 days prior to the start of the Observation phase. 2. Has received TAK438 in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. Is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependant relationship with a study site employee who is involved in conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. Has, in the judgment of the investigator, clinically significant abnormal hematological parameters of hemoglobin, hematocrit, or erythrocytes at Screening. 5. Has a history or clinical manifestations of serious central nerve system (CNS), cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urological, endocrine or hematological disease. 6.

Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to the Observation Phase (Visit 1). 8. Is required to take excluded medications. 9. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during, or within 1 month after participating in this study; or intending to donate ova during such time period. 10. Has participated in another clinical study within the past 30 days from Visit 1. 11. Has comorbidities that could affect the esophagus (eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal varices, scleroderma, viral or fungal infection, esophageal strictures), a history of radiotherapy or cryotherapy for the esophagus; those with corrosive or physiochemical injury (with the possible inclusion in the study of those with Schatzki's ring or Barrett's esophagus). 12. Has a history of surgical procedures that may affect the esophagus (eg, fundoplication and mechanical dilatation for esophageal strictures excluding Schatzki's ring) or a history of gastric or duodenal surgery excluding endoscopic removal of benign polyps. 13. Developed acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric ulcer (a mucosal defect with white coating) or duodenal ulcer (a mucosal defect with white coating), within 30 days before the start of the Observation Phase (Visit 1) (with the possible inclusion of those with gastric or duodenal erosion). 14.

Is scheduled for surgery that requires hospitalization or requires surgical treatment during his/her participation in the study. 16.

Has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or hepatitis, including hepatitis virus carriers: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, or hepatitis C virus (HCV)antibodypositive (the participant may be included in the study if he/she is HCVantigen or HCVribonucleic acid [RNA]negative). 18. Laboratory tests performed at the start of the Early Observation Phase (visit 1) revealed any of the following abnormalities in the participant: 1. Creatinine levels: &gt;2 mg/dL (&gt;177 μmol/L). 2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total bilirubin levels: &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN). 19.
