	<brief_summary>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication in cirrhotic patients, and the changes in the microbiological characteristics reported in the last years are impacting the choice of antibiotic used in the treatment. Cefotaxime has been the most extensively studied antibiotic for this infection. It is considered to be one of the first choice antibiotics because of low toxicity and excellent efficacy. Treatment of SBP by intravenous cefotaxime should be administered for a minimum 5 days. Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms have been increasingly reported especially to cefotaxime and its effect on the clinical outcome in treating SBP.</brief_summary>
