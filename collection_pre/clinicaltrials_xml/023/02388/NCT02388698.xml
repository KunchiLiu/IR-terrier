	<brief_summary>The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to definitive radiation has improved the 5-year survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer to 58%. To determine if plasma HPV DNA predates clinical recurrence and/or improves the accuracy of metabolic response on FDG-PET at 3 months post completion of radical chemo-radiation in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Post therapy FDG-PET can help predict progression free survival and overall survival. In addition plasma HPV can be used to monitor response and detect early recurrence. Prospective study will recruit 20 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer to determine if plasma HPV DNA predates clinical recurrence and/or improves the accuracy response on post-therapy FDG-PET scan at 3 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG-PET and Circulating HPV in Patients With Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to definitive radiation has improved the 5-year survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer to 58%, there is much room for improvement. Post-therapy FDG-PET at 3 months can help predict progression-free and overall survival. Tumors continually shed their DNA into the circulation, where it can be accessed to measure disease burden. Cervical cancer is caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV); plasma HPV DNA could be used to monitor response and detect recurrence early. While plasma HPV DNA has been shown to correlate with prognosis and predict recurrence in other cancers, there is limited data in locally advanced cervical cancer. This prospective multi-institutional study will recruit 20 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer to determine if plasma HPV DNA predates clinical recurrence and/or improves the accuracy response on post-therapy FDG-PET scan at 3 months. Patients will undergo phlebotomy at the following time-points for the measurement of circulating HPV DNA levels: a) baseline; b) end of radiotherapy;c) 3 months post completion of chemoradiation, along with 3-month FDG-PET and d) at recurrence. This study will provide preliminary estimates of the correlation between plasma HPV DNA level, PET finding and clinical outcome, and inform sample size calculation for a larger study. If proven useful in the future, plasma HPV DNA could enable the identification of patients at high risk of recurrence and individualized treatment.</detailed_description>
