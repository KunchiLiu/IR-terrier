	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory EBV-and CD30-positive Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, phase II trial of brentuximab vedotin to evaluate ORR primarily in patients with EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas. The ORR will be evaluated based on the revised Cheson's criteria or modified SWAT criteria in case of cutaneous EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Antibodies, Monoclonal</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients with relapsed or refractory EBV and CD30positive lymphomas 2. Age ≥ 18 years 3. ECOG performance status 02 4. At least one measurable lesion based on revised Cheson's or modified SWAT criteria 5. Provision archival tumor tissues (4 μm thickness x 5 unstained slides) and blood samples 6. Voluntary written informed consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 7. Female patient is either postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit or surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 6 months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 8. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e., status post vasectomy) agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study period and through 6 months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 9. Adequate hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/µL, platelet count ≥ 75,000/µL, and hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL unless there is known hematologic tumor marrow involvement (ANC ≥ 1,000/µL and platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL if there is known bone marrow involvement) 10. Adequate liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal (ULN) unless the elevation is known to be due to Gilbert syndrome and ALT or AST &lt; 3 x ULN (AST and AST &lt; 5 x ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to the presence of hematologic tumor in liver) 11. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute. 12. Expected survival &gt; 3 months 1. Female patient who are both lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test 2. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness 3. Known cerebral or meningeal involvement (EBV and CD30positive lymphoma or any other etiology), including signs or symptoms of PML 4. Symptomatic neurologic disease compromising normal activities or requiring medication 5. Any sensory or motor peripheral neuropathy greater than or equal to Grade 2 6. Known history of myocardial infarction within 1 year, NYHA class III/IV heart failure, or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions including cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Recent evidence (within 6 months before first dose of study drug) of a leftventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%. 7. Any active systemic viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 2 weeks prior to first study drug dose 8. Any prior chemotherapy and/or other investigational agents within at least 5 halflives of last dose 9. Prior stem cell transplantation within 100 days or radioimmunotherapy within 8 weeks 10. Prior exposure to CD30targeted agents 11. Known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins, murine proteins, or to any excipient contained in the drug formulation of brentuximab vedotin 12. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive 13. Known hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection 14. Another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.</criteria>
