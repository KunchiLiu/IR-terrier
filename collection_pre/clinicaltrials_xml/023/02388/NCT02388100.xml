	<brief_summary>This pilot study is planned to validate the comparability of HbA1c results obtained from whole blood collection via venous phlebotomy versus a capillary collection of whole blood. The participant will self-collect capillary blood into HbA1c prep vials containing a buffer; these prep vials will be sent to the CBL at ambient temperature via US Postal System (USPS) mail. The feasibility of self-collection of these capillary samples by GRADE participants will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
