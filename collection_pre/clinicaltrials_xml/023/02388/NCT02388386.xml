	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to develop a novel and wireless method for monitoring medication adherence among heart failure patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Proteus Digital™ has developed an ingestible and bio-absorbable micro-sensor as a strategy to monitor medication compliance. The edible sensor has at its core a silicon-based integrated circuit measuring 1.0 mm x 0.45 mm and is imbedded on a pill. Once ingested, this circuit is activated by gastric acid resulting in an electrochemical redox reaction and an electrical charge that is transmitted to a patch worn over the abdomen and wirelessly to a portable device such as a smart phone. This strategy of medication adherence differs from conventional adherence monitoring including pill counting and patient-recall by precisely tracking medication ingestion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objectives are to assess the efficacy and safety of the Proteus Digital™ micro-sensor in an exploratory investigation among heart failure patients with LVADs. Medication adherence, specifically to anticoagulation is critically important in the post-implant period to maintain LVAD function and to decrease thromboembolic complications; however, commonly results in significant bleeding resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, the anticipated degree of anticoagulation is unpredictable after LVAD implantation due to factors related to changes in hepatic blood flow and endothelial dysfunction. Enrolling 10 patients will provide results into the function of micro-sensor and to provide a preliminary assessment of sensor-based activity, signal strength and signal duration in LVAD recipients. Participants will be enrolled during an in-patient hospitalization to assess the efficacy and safety of the device in a monitored setting.</detailed_description>
