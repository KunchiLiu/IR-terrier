	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety of MEDI7836 in Healthy Adults.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1a, randomised, blinded (the investigator and subject will be blinded to treatment assignment and sponsor will be unblinded to treatment assignment), placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety of single-ascending SC doses of MEDI7836 in healthy adult males subjects and healthy adult female subjects of non-childbearing potential. The study will be conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom (UK). Four dosing cohorts of MEDI7836 or placebo are planned for this study for a total of 32 subjects (24 subjects receiving MEDI7836, 8 subjects receiving placebo).</detailed_description>

Any active medical or psychiatric condition or other reason which, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, may compromise the safety of the subject in the study or interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or reduce the subject's ability to participate in the study 13. Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, ECG, vital signs, haematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis during screening or Day 1, 14. History of any known primary immunodeficiency disorder or use of immunosuppressive medication within 12 months of screening 15. History of a clinically significant infection requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication from 30 days prior to screening, up to and including Day 1 16. Diagnosis of a helminth parasitic infection within 6 months prior to screening that has not been treated with, or has failed to respond to, standard of care therapy 17.
