	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: 1. To evaluate whether 550 mg of naproxen sodium reduces pain scores with IUD insertion on a 0-10cm visual analogue scale compared to placebo (primary outcome). 2. To evaluate whether 550 mg of naproxen sodium reduces pain scores with tenaculum placement, uterine sounding and post-procedurally on a 0-10 cm visual analog scale compared to placebo (secondary outcomes). 3. To establish if prophylactic naproxen sodium is acceptable for routine use prior to IUD insertion. Hypothesis: The administration of naproxen sodium, 550mg orally, 1 hour prior to IUD insertion will lead to a reduction in pain scores associated with IUD insertion compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
