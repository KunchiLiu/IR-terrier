	<brief_title>A New Method for Estimating Dynamic Intrinsic PEEP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dynamic intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi dyn) play an important pathophysiology role in many acute respiratory pathologies. The most accurate method to quantify PEEPi dyn is to measure the rise in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) at end expiration at the point of the contraction of the inspiratory muscles until inspiratory flow starts. Such method, however, is invasive, poor comfortable and require patient active collaboration. The purpose of this study is describe a new non-invasive method for estimate PEEPi dyn and validate this method with gold-standard-one.</detailed_description>
