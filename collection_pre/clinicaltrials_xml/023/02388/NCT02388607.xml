	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric pathology, which concerns around 1% of adult population. It is characterized by clinical symptoms combining positive and negative symptoms and thinking disorganization. Schizophrenia is also characterized by cognitive deficits, likely to play an important part in adaptation of these patients in their every-day life, and to affect their clinical symptomatology. Among them, there are deficits in sustained attention which are associated with a difficulty for these patients to maintain efficiently their cognitive activity on a source of stimulation or task. This basic attentional process is fundamental for the efficiency of the overall of cognitive processes, and so for all behaviors directed on an aim. The question of whether or not patients with schizophrenia have difficulty sustaining attention is of high relevance, in the sense that it could undermine performance on nearly any task and so provide a compelling causal explanation of many other impairments observed in these patients. Yet it has not been conclusively answered in over four decades of research. Consequently, the main objective of the protocol is to evaluate sustained attention abilities in schizophrenic patients and to better understand the specific functioning of cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these abilities (attentional resources and cognitive control mechanisms).</brief_summary>
