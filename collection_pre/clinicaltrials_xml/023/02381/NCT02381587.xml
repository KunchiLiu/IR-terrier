In addition recent studies have shown that patients are at increased risk of the disease up to 2 cardiac events and stroke events Hydroxychloroquine is an RHEUMATIC DISEASE PROCESS SUPPRESSANTS-ANTIMALARIALS used to treat anti-inflammatory rheumatic diseases in many first-line treatment is sjogren syndrome. A recent study of the treatment in Hydroxychloroquine effect on lipid profile sjogren syndrome patients showed a reduction in total cholesterol levels and increase in HDL. Further studies of the impact made Hydroxychloroquine systemic lupus patients erythematosus (SLE) showed in Atherosclerosis and morbidity and mortality reduction in cardiovascular. Studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) demonstrated reduced risk of developing diabetes and improved lipid profile Research Goals valuate The effect of HCQ treatment in cardiovascular patients with primary sjogren syndrome</brief_summary>
