	<brief_summary>PNEUMOSTEM® consists of ex vivo cultured allogeneic, unrelated, human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) and it is intended for use as a cellular therapy product for prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). This study is an open-label, single-center, dose escalation study to evaluate of safety and efficacy of PNEUMOSTEM® in premature infants at high risk for BPD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A male or female infant whose postnatal age is 3 to 14 days, inclusive (for treatment between 5 and 14 days after birth) A subject whose gestational age is between 23 and 28 weeks (23 weeks ≤ gestational age (GA) &lt; 28 weeks) A subject whose birth weight is between 500g and 1000g, inclusive A subject who is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation within 514 days after birth, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.25 or greater at Screening A subject who has had either a deterioration or no change in the setting of mechanical ventilation within the 24 hours before trial enrollment A subject whose parent/guardian can give a written informed consent A subject who has a congenital heart defect, except for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrial septal defect (ASD) or a small, restrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD) A subject who has a serious malformation of the lung such as pulmonary hypoplasia/aplasia congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or other congenital lung anomaly A subject who has a chromosomal abnormality (e.g., Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 21) or a severe congenital malformation (e.g., hydrocephalus and encephalocele, tracheoesophageal fistula, abdominal wall defects, and major renal anomalies) A subject who has had a severe congenital infectious disease (i.e., herpes, toxoplasmosis rubella, syphilis, HIV, etc.) A subject who has evidence of severe sepsis or septic shock due to an active infection at Screening A subject who underwent a surgical procedure within 72 hours before study drug administration or who is anticipated to have a surgical procedure within 72 hours before or following study drug administration A subject who was administered surfactant within 24 hours before study drug administration A subject who has had a bilateral grade 3 or 4 intracranial hemorrhage A subject who has active pulmonary hemorrhage or an active air leak syndrome at Screening A subject who is currently participating in any other interventional clinical trial A subject who is, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, considered inappropriate for the trial due to any reasons other than those listed above</criteria>
