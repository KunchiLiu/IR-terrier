	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. In addition, many patients suffer from valvular and aortic disease. Although various tools are available to identify patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease at risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the identification of these patients remains a clinical challenge. One promising avenue is the use of different serum biomarkers involved in atherothrombosis which could provide an easy and cost-effective step in risk stratification.</brief_summary>
