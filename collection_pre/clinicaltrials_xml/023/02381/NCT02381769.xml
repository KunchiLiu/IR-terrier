	<brief_summary>The study will be an experimental pre-post trial in which patients with ethanol related liver disease (both severe alcoholic hepatitis and decompensated ) admitted in our institute from Jun 2013-Dec 2014 will be enrolled in the study. Those on ryle's tube feeding would receive polymeric blenderized kitchen based liquid diet while those tolerating orally would receive soft/ solid diet as tolerated as per requirement. All the patients would receive same amount of calories i.e., 30-35 kcal/kg ideal body weight/ day and 1-1.2 gm/kg protein. 35-40% of non protein calorie would be provided as fats and rest of the calories will be provided as carbohydrates. All patients will be transfused 250ml of 20% intra lipid per day for 3 consecutive days, over and above the feed provided to them to be taken enterally (orally or through Ryle's Tube). Patients will undergo tests prior to infusion and 72 hours after infusion.</brief_summary>
