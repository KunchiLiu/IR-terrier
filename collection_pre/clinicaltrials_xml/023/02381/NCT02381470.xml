	<brief_summary>Faropenem is an oral penem, closely related to the carbapenem class that is used for the treatment of bacterial infections. It has in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and this trial aims to determine the activity of faropenem with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with pulmonary TB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Bactericidal Activity Study of Faropenem(With Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid)in Patients With Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II randomised, controlled, open-label, early bactericidal activity trial in which 28 patients between the ages of 18 and 70 with newly-diagnosed smear positive pulmonary TB, who have not yet started standard TB therapy will be recruited. Patients will be randomised to one of 3 arms - Arm A: Faropenem 400mg with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (500mg/125mg), each three times daily for 5 days (n=12) Arm B: Pyrazinamide 2g (1.5g if weight &lt;50kg) once daily for 5 days (n=8) Arm C: Isoniazid 300mg once daily for 5 days (n=8) Following the 5 days of study medication the study will end and patients will change to standard combination TB therapy and enter normal clinical follow-up. In addition to the CFU and TTP related primary and secondary outcome measures, other outcomes measures such as the pharmacokinetics of faropenem, change in RPF-dependent colony counts, change of expression of select signature Mtb genes in sputum transcriptome, changes in host transcriptome and change in host immune profile will be determined.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Aged 18 to 70 years 2. Clinical features compatible with pulmonary TB 3. Sputum smear graded at least 1 + 4. Estimated to be producing at least 5ml of sputum per day 5. Willing to comply with study procedures and able to provide written informed consent. 1. Suspected miliary TB or TB meningitis 2. Patients receiving any TB treatment within the previous 6 months 3. Patients too ill to tolerate a 5day delay in standard therapy 4. Concurrent bacterial pneumonia 5. Known hypersensitivity to betalactam drugs (penicillins, carbapanems) or to other study drugs (isoniazid, pyrazinamide) 6.

Participation in other clinical intervention trial or research protocol (participation in other studies that do not involve an intervention may be allowed, but this must be discussed and approved by the Chief Investigator)</criteria>
