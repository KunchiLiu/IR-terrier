	<brief_summary>PRESERVE is a multi-center, prospective, open-label, non-randomized investigation of commercially available IVC filters from 6 manufacturers placed in subjects for the prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE). This study will enroll approximately 1,800 IVC filter subjects at up to 60 sites in the US. All treated subjects will be evaluated at procedure, 3-months, 6-months (phone), 12-months, 18-months (phone), and 24-months post-procedure. The primary objective of this investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the commercially available IVC filters (retrievable and permanent) in subjects with clinical need for mechanical prophylaxis of PE with an IVC filter.</brief_summary>
