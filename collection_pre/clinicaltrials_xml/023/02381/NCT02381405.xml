	<criteria>1. Patients with any combination of therapies including radiation therapy alone, chemotherapy alone, TKI alone, or any combination are eligible. 2. This includes patients with therapies including Xeloda (capecitabine), Camptosar (irinotecan) or 5FU (fluorouracil) with cancer. 3. Patients who have been diagnosed with a CID CTCAE toxicity of grade 3 or higher 4. Patients must be at least 18 years of age. 5. ECOG performance status 02. 6. Patients must have diarrhea symptoms, judged secondary to the systemic therapy, combined systemic therapy, and/or radiation, and must be requiring loperamide or similar (Imodium®) for symptom management. For the purposes of this study, diarrhea will be defined as three or more loose or liquid stools per day or loose watery stool (greater volume of stool) that occur more frequently than usual and lasting for more than three days. 1. ECOG performance status 3 or greater. 2. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women 3. Premenopausal subjects as well as subjects with ovarian radiation or concomitant treatment with an LHRH agonist/antagonist must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use an adequate method of contraception as recommended by their treating physicians 4. Postmenopausal status is defined either by: 1. age ≥55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea, 2. age &lt;55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea with an estradiol assay &lt;20 pg/mL 3. bilateral oophorectomy 4. CID CTCAE grade 1 or 2 (not requiring Loperamide or similar)</criteria>
