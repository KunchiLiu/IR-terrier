	<brief_summary>Vitamin A metabolites (retinoids) have shown to activate brown fat function in preclinical studies, however the role of retinoids in human brown fat physiology and energy metabolism remains elusive. This study aims to identify a possible association between retinoid metabolism, brown fat activity, and energy expenditure in lean and obese subjects by using FDG-PET-CT, PET-MR Scans and indirect calorimetry. Additionally we will analyze the genetic profile of white and brown neck fat biopsies at room temperature and cold conditions in a subset of the study participants. More detailed molecular studies (involving other potential browning markers) will also be performed in adipocytes derived from human SVC. The optimal duration of cold exposure will be determined in a pilot study. Therefore subjects will be repeatedly exposed to cold and circulating retinoid levels and other plasma parameters will be measured at various time points.</brief_summary>
