	<brief_title>Determinants of Early Functional Outcome After Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the positive outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery on symptoms such as pain, perceived function and health-related quality of life (QoL) current research highlights the persistent deleterious effects of retained aberrant neuromuscular alterations on physical function, which may also directly impact falls risk. Importantly, observed increases in neuromuscular deficits that occur prior to surgery track through into the post-operative stage with functional limitations that are sustained and which can persist at least one year after surgery. Clearly, it is crucial to strive to identify modifiable factors that might successfully ameliorate this pathophysiological process prior to surgery, reduce post surgical impairments and which also accelerate recovery. Among other determinants that might contribute towards understanding of optimal functional recovery following reconstructive knee surgery is the influence of genes. The evaluation of specific genotypes and subsequent protein expression might provide further insight into the extent of genetic influence. For example, it is not yet known whether patients with specific genotypes experience an accelerated recovery. Currently, there is a paucity of research on the influence of gene-environment interactions on an individual's response to physical conditioning. The proposed research will be an exploratory study, involving four repeated-measures assessments from 10 weeks prior to surgery to 12 weeks after surgery. This study offers a novel evaluation of the overall patterning of changes and will quantify and describe patient-reported and objective measures of sensorimotor, neuromuscular, psychophysiological performance capabilities, genotypes and levels of habitual physical activity.</detailed_description>
