	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) inhibitor AT13387 when given together with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and cisplatin in treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 works by blocking a protein called HSP90. HSP90 helps protect cells from stress and supports many other proteins that cause cell growth. When HSP90 is blocked, tumor cell growth may be slowed or stopped and may die more easily when treated with chemotherapy and radiation. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. IMRT is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers beams of radiation of different intensities aimed at the tumor from many angles and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 with cisplatin and IMRT may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hsp90 Inhibitor AT13387 in Treating Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck Receiving Radiation Therapy and Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of AT13387 (Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387) in combination with concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). (Dose Escalation Phase) II. To preliminarily evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT13387 in combination with concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with LA-SCCHN. (Dose Expansion Phase) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AT13387 in combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin in combination with AT13387 and radiotherapy. III. To assess for pharmacodynamics biomarkers for proof-of-mechanism. IIV. To assess for potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy. V. To document the toxicities associated with the administration of AT13387 in combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with LA-SCCHN. VI. To explore and characterize predictive biomarkers for individual cancer patients utilizing genomic sequencing technologies. VII. To provide preliminary disease-free survival, locoregional control, distant metastases-free survival, and overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387. Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -7, 3, 10, 24, 31, and 38 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Patients also undergo IMRT once daily (QD), 5 days a week over 7 weeks for a total of 35 fractions. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year. Beyond the first 2 years, patients may be followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years per institutional standards.</detailed_description>
