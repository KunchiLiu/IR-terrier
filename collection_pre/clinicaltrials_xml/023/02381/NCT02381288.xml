	<brief_title>Effects of TAK-448 in Middle-aged and Older Men With Low Testosterone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-448. TAK-448 is being tested to define a dose and dose frequency which results in a clinically relevant improvement in ST in middle-aged and older men with low ST levels. This study will look at ST levels in men who take TAK-448. The study will enroll approximately 66 participants. Two Cohorts are planned for this study. Cohort 1 will include 3 dose groups that will run in parallel and consist of the following SC doses, 0.1 mcg once-daily, 0.3 mcg twice-weekly, and 1.0 mcg once-weekly for a period of 6 weeks. Within each dose group in Cohort 1, 11 participants will be enrolled and assigned so that 8 will receive TAK-448 and 3 will receive placebo. Cohort 2 will be enrolled after the completion of Cohort 1 and may include up to 3 dose groups. The dose and dosing frequency will be decided based on results from Cohort 1. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 16 weeks. Participants will make daily visits to the clinic for 8 weeks, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Participants will be excluded based on: 1. Has a serum creatinine greater than (&gt;) 2.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) at Screening. 2. Is receiving dialysis treatment. 3. Has an American Urological Association (AUA)/ International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score of &gt;19 or serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA) &gt;4 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) at Screening. 4. Has thyrotropin (TSH) levels less than (&lt;) 0.3 or &gt;7.5 milliinternational units per liter (mIU/L) at Screening. 5. Has systolic blood pressure &gt;160 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg (if out of range may be repeated once for eligibility determination) at Screening. 6. Has luteinizing hormone (LH) &gt;9.4 units per liter (U/L) at Screening. 7. Is receiving insulin therapy. 8. Has a hematocrit &lt;30 percent (%) or &gt;48% at Screening. 9. Has a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;8.0 at Screening (Cohort 1). 2. Has type 2 diabetes mellitus defined as fasting blood glucose &gt;125 mg/dL, HbA1c &gt;6.2%, or use of antidiabetic medication (Cohort 2 only). 3. Has clinical evidence of anatomic or pathological hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular disease, such as (but not limited to) Klinefelter's syndrome, Kallmann's syndrome, systemic infiltrative diseases (hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, Wilson's disease), or prior pituitary surgery. 4. Has used gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, antiandrogens, clomiphene, or other reproductive hormonerelated agents within 6 months prior to Screening. 5. Has used anabolic therapies (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], androstendione, any other androgen, or recombinant human growth hormone) within 1 year of Screening.</criteria>
