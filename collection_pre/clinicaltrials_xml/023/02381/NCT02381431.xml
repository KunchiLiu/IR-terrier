	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if thermal images can be used instead of a chest x-ray to diagnose bacterial pneumonia in children with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in Nagpur, India. More specifically, the objectives of the study are: 1) to determine if thermal imaging, using a commercial thermal camera can accurately detect the presence of bacterial pneumonia in children receiving a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia; 2) to evaluate the use of thermal imaging to monitor the course and resolution of pneumonia in children diagnosed with pneumonia; and 3) to determine if thermal imaging can accurately diagnose sites of infection that are suspected to be related to the pneumonia.</brief_summary>
