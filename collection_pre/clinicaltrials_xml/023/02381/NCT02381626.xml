	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at air quality in cabs and see if the air quality inside taxi cabs is connected to increased risks for lung and heart health problems. Another purpose of the study is to see if putting an air filter inside the car may help improve the air quality and lower health risks. This is important because air pollution can be harmful to health. Air pollution is made up of very tiny particles (things) floating in the air around us, called particulate matter. Particulate matter is made up of dust, smoke, dirt, and gas fumes and can get into our bodies as we breathe. It has been linked to risk for lung cancer and heart disease. It is important because taxi drivers spend many hours of their day inside their cars. The investigators hope that this study will help them find out if using air filters inside cabs will help lower the levels of pollution in cabs and reduce its effects on the health of taxi drivers. They will use these results to educate the taxi driver community.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DRIIVE (Data and Research on Interventions to Improve the Vehicular Environment)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DRIIVE (Data and Research on Interventions to Improve the Vehicular Environment) is a community-engaged translational pilot project that will utilize a three parallel arm design to obtain preliminary data on associations between Particulate Matter (PM)/air pollution and physiologic measurements and biomarkers in taxi drivers, and to determine the impact of a HEPA filter (to remove PM and volatile organic compounds) intervention on such physiologic measurements and biomarkers. DRIIVE is funded by the New York State Department of Health Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program (ECRIP), which trains physicians in clinical research in New York. Drivers will be randomized to one of two groups: Intervention or Wait-list Control. The third group will be a Matched Nominated Peer Comparison Group, non-drivers who will participate in the same PM and physiologic and biomarker measurements and will serve as a control for non-driving related PM exposure and physiologic response. In total, three groups of 14 participants will be recruited: 1) Wait List Control group, who will receive a HEPA filter at the end of the 1 month participation period, 2) Intervention group, who will receive a HEPA filter two weeks into their participation period, and 3) PM reference group of peer non-drivers, who will also receive a HEPA filter at the end of the 1 month period of participation. The project will be completed within a 2 year timeframe.</detailed_description>
