	<detailed_description>A cross sectional study design will evaluate the diagnostic value of the Congo Red Dot test to the pregnant women attending the Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Hospital Materno-Infantil Inguarán, tertiary level facilities in Bangladesh and Mexico City. Women attending the hospital with clinically confirmed cases of preeclampsia and clinically healthy women who deliver at term will be eligible for the study. Investigators will enroll about 200 women at each facility. Investigators will target the following women for enrollment: women with clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia (severe, mild or superimposed) (n=100); and clinically healthy women who deliver at term (n=100). The purpose of the research is to determine the clinical utility of congophilia (affinity for the dye Congo Red) in the diagnosis and prediction of preeclampsia. Investigators will determine the diagnostic value of this test by testing the urine sample provided to determine the presence or absence of proteinuria or congophilia.</detailed_description>
