	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a moderate Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor (erythromycin) and a strong CYP3A inhibitor (voriconazole) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK [the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time]) of repeated oral doses of ibrutinib in participants with B-cell malignancy (cancer or other progressively enlarging and spreading tumors).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interaction Study of Ibrutinib and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A Inhibitors in Participants With B-cell Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment participants are receiving), multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of ibrutinib with the moderate and the strong CYP3A inhibitors (erythromycin and voriconazole respectively) in participants with B-cell malignancies (including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia /Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma [CLL/SLL], Follicular Lymphoma [FL], Marginal Zone Lymphoma [MZL], Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia [WM] or Mantle Cell Lymphoma [MCL]). The study will consist of a Screening Phase (28 days), a Treatment Phase (consisting of six 28-days cycles), and an End-of-Treatment (EoT) Visit (within 30 days after the last dose of study drug). The study will consist of 2 Parts. In Part 1, extent of the DDI between ibrutinib at dose level of 140 milligram (mg) and CYP3A inhibitors will be assessed. After completion of Part 1 of the study, an interim analysis of all available PK and safety data will be conducted and Part 2 will only be performed if the observed drug interaction is less than anticipated based on current information. In Part 2, safety and PK of ibrutinib at dose level of 560 mg administered with CYP3A inhibitors will be assessed. Participants who continue to derive clinical benefit from ibrutinib treatment at the end of this study, and who are eligible to continue in the PCI-32765CAN3001 study (NCT01804686) will end their participation in this trial, have an EoT visit completed, and will continue receiving ibrutinib as a part of the PCI-32765CAN3001 protocol. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
