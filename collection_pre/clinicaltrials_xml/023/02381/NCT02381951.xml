	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease affects between 100'000 and 150'000 people in France. Drug therapy (L-Dopa and other drugs) is effective to improve motor symptoms but after an initial 'honeymoon period' lasting a few years, motor symptoms reoccur in most patients, impairing gait and walking. Spinal cord stimulation is currently an important therapeutic option in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Experimental and limited clinical data suggest that this technique might also be used to alleviate motor symptoms and improve walking in Parkinsons patients. This exploratory study aims at measuring the benefits of spinal cord stimulation on the walking capacity of a small number of Parkinsons patients who are not adequately improved by drug therapy alone.</brief_summary>
