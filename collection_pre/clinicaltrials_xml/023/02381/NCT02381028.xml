	<brief_summary>The aim of this small pilot study is to assess the potential effects and risks of applying fresh human milk locally on eczema spots in children with atopic eczema. This is a split body, controlled, randomized and physician blinded pilot study, of children with atopic eczema with two similar contralateral eczema spots having a mother breastfeeding the child or a sibling. Fresh expressed milk and emollient is to be applied on the intervention spot and emollient alone on the control area, three times a day for four weeks. Severity and area of the eczema spots is evaluated weekly, and samples from milk and the spots were analysed weekly with respect to bacterial colonisation.</brief_summary>
