	<brief_title>Repeat Injection of Cingal® for Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cingal 13-02 study is a follow-on study to the recently completed clinical trial Cingal 13-01. Cingal 13-01 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, Phase III study that enrolled 368 subjects at up to 30 sites in Canada and Europe. The Cingal 13-01 study objective was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a single injection of Cingal® for relief of joint pain and symptoms in patients with OA of the knee. The study had three arms: the Cingal® investigational arm, an active comparator arm (Monovisc®) and a control arm (saline). Cingal 13-02 is designed to evaluate the safety of an open-label injection of Cingal® in subjects who received a study injection in the Cingal 13-01 trial.</detailed_description>
