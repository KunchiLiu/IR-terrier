	<brief_summary>Over the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in the development of screening tools to assess the capability of elderly cancer patients to tolerate anti-cancer treatment. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines in Senior Adult Oncology recommend an assessment of co-morbid conditions that are likely to interfere with cancer treatment and tolerability. As presbyacusis is common in an older population, elderly cancer patients are at high risk for social isolation and a reduced quality of life. Therefore, in this project the investigators aim to validatie uHear™ as a quick and reliable screening tool to screen for presbyacusisf in routine clinical oncology practice.</brief_summary>
