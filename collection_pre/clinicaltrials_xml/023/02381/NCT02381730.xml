	<brief_summary>Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a disease of the choroidal vasculature, that is often regarded as a sub-type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, PCV response to anti-vascular agents differs from the response of typical AMD. This study aims at describing the evolution of the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in PCV patients, 28 weeks after they receive one injection of intravitreal aflibercept (2mg).</brief_summary>
