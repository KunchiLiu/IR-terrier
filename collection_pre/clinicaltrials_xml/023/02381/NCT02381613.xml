	<brief_summary>While observational studies often find that diets rich in fish reduce the risk of disease, and that diets including a high intake of red meat are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, the difference in health effects between red meat and fish are rarely researched in intervention studies. The investigators hypothesise that the post-prandial plasma response of lipids and markers of cardiovascular disease risk will be more favourable after intake of herring compared to beef. In addition, while pickling herring in a brine/sugar solution is a common form of preparation, little is known if there is a difference in potential health effects based on the preparation of herring. The investigators will compare baked and pickled herring to understand if preparation is potentially an important factor to be considered when looking at intake of fish and health.</brief_summary>
