	<brief_summary>Registration of Prostate Cancer patients undergoing Prostate Cryotherapy guided by Mutiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) highlighting biopsy confirmed regions. The primary outcome measure is 5 year oncological control. Secondary aim is lack of progression beyond the prostate gland. The aim of intervention is to eradicate prostate cancer disease in the treated area while imposing no or minimal deleterious effects in quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CLINICAL TRIAL OF OBSERVATION NATURE PRIMARY OUTCOME Cancer control of treated areas 5 years after intervention based on prostate biopsy of initial treated area SECONDARY OUTCOMES Lack of cancer presence or progression 5 years after initial intervention by MP-MRI imaging; urinary and sexual function changes in quality of life; anxiety related to cancer and cancer control, number of biopsies required during study period; need of further treatment for prostate cancer; treatment tolerance to local anesthesia DATA COLLECTION - Complete H&amp;P, family history, past medical and surgical history, social history, allergies, and medications - Procedure Specifics Assessing Prostate, Seminal Vesicles and Urethral Contouring by MP-MRI. Dominant lesions and secondary lesions contouring my MP-MRI. Co-Registration quality, date of procedure, cryoprobes used, freeze/thaw cycles timing, temperatures at neurovascular bundles, denonvilliers fascia. Urethral warmer requirements - Follow up information: 30 day perioperative outcomes (incidence of UTI, urinary retention, failure of local anesthetic, pain measures). 6 week, 3,6,9,12 month and then every 6 month measures of PSA, Testosterone levels, Urinary Function and Sexual Function inventories, Overall anxiety and regret related to diagnosis and treatment - Uroflow and PVR measurements by 3 to 6 month of treatment - MP MRI on a yearly basis, for years 2,3,4 after treatment, biopsy driven by new suspicious MRI findings - MP MRI triggered by elevation in PSA velocity or PSA level 10% above diagnosis - Transperineal Fusion Guided Prostate biopsy at 1st year - emphasis on treated areas, suspicious MRI areas - Transperineal Fusion Guided Prostate biopsy at 5th year - emphasis on treated areas, suspicious MRI areas SAFETY MEASURES - Periodic evaluation of registry to ensure consistency in follow up - Patient remainders of tests required</detailed_description>
