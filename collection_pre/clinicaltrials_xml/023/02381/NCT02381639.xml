	<brief_summary>The current etiological pathological model of anorexia nervosa is poly-factorial involving individual genetic and psychological factors, in close interaction with environmental, family and socio-cultural factors. Among these factors, this study focuses on the central coherence process (cognitive ability to integrate complex information into a comprehensive meaning), in the active phase of the disease. Therefore, patients followed in the addiction service of the Nantes University Hospital will perform neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions involved in the process of central coherence. Impairment of central coherence process could act as a maintenance factor of the disease, particularly in connection with body dysmorphic disorder. The therapeutic perspectives acting on the central coherence process like cognitive remediation deserve to deepen knowledge on the cognitive profile of patients with anorexia nervosa.</brief_summary>
