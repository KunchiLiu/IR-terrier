	<brief_summary>Introduction: Health care that addresses the emotional regulation capacity of patients with schizophrenia confronted with daily stress may contribute to a less anxious life. A psycho-physiological training (cardiac coherence training; CCT) focusing on emotion regulation is known to decrease anxiety for non-clinical individuals. Methods: the investigators performed a pilot cross sectional survey to explore the benefits of CCT for clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. Ten patients were enrolled in the program consisting in height to twelve weekly one hour session program during a 2-month follow-up. Standardised questionnaires were used before and after the intervention assessing anxiety, well-being outcomes, and how patients deal with stress and stressors.</brief_summary>
