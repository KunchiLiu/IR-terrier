	<brief_summary>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major sources of nosocomial infection. Along with the widely application of antibiotics around perioperative period, MRSA infection is increasing by years.Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT),infusion of fecal preparation from a healthy donor into the GI tract of a patient is being proposed as a novel therapeutic approach to modulate diseases associated with pathological imbalances within the resident microbiota, termed dysbiosis.It has been used to treat intestinal disease such as inflammatory bowel diseases and Clostridium difficile infection, but no reports are available on its role in treating MRSA enteritis yet. vancomycin is the first choice to treat MRSA but can also lead to an increase in antibiotic resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among the microbial community. So FMT seems a more harmless and reasonable measure to treat similar diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biotherapy for MRSA Enterocolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five cases from July, 2013 to February, 2014 were collected in Jinling hospital.They developed unexplained high fever, bloating, nausea, vomit, a high stoma output or diarrhea in the color of yellow-green with copious amounts of mucus leading to dehydration and tachycardia after short time of operation (2-4d).We got the etiology diagnosis from all the patients' gastric juice cultures which revealed MRSA.Vancocin cp had a dissatisfied effect,so FMT was supplied for treating MRSA.All the patients had a decreased intestinal flora species before FMT and the content of staphylococcus aureus almost reached half of total intestinal flora . Patients' gut bacteria after FMT gradually agree with the donors' reflected the alleviative symptoms.</detailed_description>
