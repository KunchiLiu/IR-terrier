	<brief_summary>This 2-period, open-label, nonrandomized study will be conducted to determine the absolute bioavailability as well as the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of ipatasertib and its metabolite(s). Healthy male participants will receive a single 200-mg oral dose of ipatasertib followed 1 hour later by an 80-mcg/800-nCi intravenous dose of [14C]-ipatasertib. After a 4-day observation period and 10-day washout, participants will receive a single 200-mg/100-mcCi oral dose of [14C]-ipatasertib with subsequent data collection for an additional 7 to 14 days until discharge criteria are met.</brief_summary>
