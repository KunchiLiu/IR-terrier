	<brief_summary>This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the combination of Taselisib with other drugs in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Taselisib is an investigational drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib Dose-escalation Trial of Taselisib (GDC-0032) in Combination With Anti-HER2 Therapies in Participants With Advanced HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is divided in two parts, a combination dose finding escalation part (Part 1) and a dose combination expansion part (Part 2). Participants will enter only one Part (either 1 or 2) and receive study drugs from only one combindation of study drugs, know as arms, as assigned by the main study physician. The study includes four different arms as listed below: - Arm A: Taselisib with Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1) - Arm B: Taselisib with Trastuzumab emtansine and Pertuzumab - Arm C: Taselisib with Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab - Arm D: Taselisib with Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Paclitaxel Part 1: Since we are looking for the highest dose of Taselisib that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have breast cancer, not everyone who participates in Part 1 of this research study will receive the same dose of the Taselisib. The dose participants get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before and how well they have tolerated their doses. Each combination dose will only be given to a group of 3 - 6 participants. The results from each group will be reviewed and depending on the results, a different combination dose or schedule may be investigated in the next group of participants or the same combination dose taken by a participant may be repeated with the next group of participants to investigate these results further (a different schedule means that instead of taking doses once every day, participants may take them only on some days in the week). Part 2: The doses in this part will be based on the best combination doses from Part 1. This part will look at the potential side effects and see how your cancer responds to the drug.</detailed_description>

Patients who have received prior therapy with Taselisib (GDC0032) or BYL719 are excluded. There is no limit on the number of prior lines of therapy. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 Normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal. For patients with Gilbert syndrome, the direct bilirubin should be within the institutional normal range AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Fasting glucose ≤ 120 mg/dL and HbA1c &lt; 7% Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) must have a documented negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to planned initiation of Taselisib. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. For Part 2: patients must have tissue that is amenable to biopsy and must be willing to undergo research biopsy. Patients who undergo an attempted research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this protocol, and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are not required to undergo a repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol. Anticancer therapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from acute adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Palliative radiation to bony metastases ≥2 weeks prior to study entry is allowed. Prior treatment with a PI3 kinase, AKT or mTOR inhibitor in which the patient experienced a Grade ≥3 drug related adverse event or otherwise would be at increased risk for additional PI3K related toxicity Currently receiving any other investigational agents. Treatment with an investigational agent within 2 weeks prior to planned initiation of study therapy is allowed provided that any drug related toxicity has completely resolved Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to planned initiation of study therapy Significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks prior to planned initiation of study therapy Known untreated brain metastases are excluded. History of treated CNS metastases is okay, provided the following criteria are met: Disease outside the CNS is present. No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS directed therapy and the screening radiographic study No history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage Not requiring anticonvulsants for symptomatic control Minimum of 3 weeks between completion of CNS radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1 and recovery from significant (Grade ≥ 3) acute toxicity with no ongoing requirement for corticosteroid History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the Taselisib drug formulation or other agents used in this study.
