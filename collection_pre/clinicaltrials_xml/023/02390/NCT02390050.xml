	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of bexagliflozin in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Bexagliflozin is an orally administered drug for the treatment of T2DM and is classified as a Sodium Glucose co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitor. This study will enroll both treatment naive and those subjects previously treated with one oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA). Approximately 320 subjects eligible for randomization will receive bexagliflozin tablets, 5, 10, 20 mg or placebo, once daily for 12 weeks in an outpatient setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Range Finding Study to Evaluate the Effect of Bexagliflozin Tablets in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>THR-1442-C-449 is a phase 2b multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose range finding study to assess the efficacy and safety of once daily bexagliflozin in either treatment- naïve type 2 diabetic subjects or subjects previously treated with one oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA). The primary efficacy endpoint will be placebo-adjusted reduction in HbA1c, measured after 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment naïve subjects are those who have never received prescription anti-diabetic medications or who have received no more than 14 days of prescription medications for diabetes in the 12 weeks prior to enrollment. The study will enroll men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with HbA1c between 7% and 8.5% (inclusive) at the screening visit (for subjects who are treatment naïve) or with T2DM and with HbA1c between 6.5% and 8.5% (inclusive) at screening visit (for subjects who have received one OHA and who are willing and able to undergo a washout period.) Approximately 400 subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and who consent to participate in the study are eligible to be enrolled to complete a 6 to 10 week washout if needed and a 2 week run-in period prior to being randomized. Subjects who can adhere to the run-in medication dosing schedule (i.e., miss no more than one dosage in 2 weeks) and who have HbA1c between 7 and 8.5% at baseline (visit S5) will be eligible for randomization and receive investigational product. A 20% screen fail rate is expected by the end of run-in, leading to approximately 320 subjects eligible for randomization to receive oral bexagliflozin tablets, 5, 10, 20 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks in an outpatient setting. Subjects who experience hyperglycemia during the study may receive approved anti-diabetic medication. Subjects will visit their study site at weeks 2, 6, and 12 for safety and efficacy evaluation, with a follow up visit at week 14. Measurement of bexagliflozin plasma concentration over time (sparsely sampled) will be conducted at 20 centers and will include approximately 240 subjects who consent to participate the pharmacokinetics (PK) study. Three samples from each subject will be drawn at weeks 2, 6, or 12.</detailed_description>
