	<brief_summary>No standard way exists to measure the quality of medical care or independent living long-term services and supports provided to persons with disabilities. This project will: provide a broader picture of how consumers with disabilities define care and care quality; measure the value of using consumers' expertise in developing, collecting, and assessing quality measures; and use this information to assist One Care providers in improving care delivered to their enrollees</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persons With Disabilities Generating Quality Metrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of the project are as follows: 1. To work with persons with significant physical disabilities and serious and persistent mental illness to develop two new approaches to assess quality of care: Approach #1: We will survey enrollees about their experiences in One Care and their thoughts about the care they receive. This survey will also ask One Care enrollees about how they manage their care and what self-direction means to them. The survey will be called the Persons with Disabilities Quality Survey (PDQ-S), and it will be available in English and Spanish versions. Approach #2: Enrollees in One Care will provide information about their perceptions of care quality to a trained team of persons with disabilities who will report the information to One Care care teams. The goal of the activity is to support quality improvement in One Care through hearing the consumer's voice. This is called YES Health - Your Experience: Speak up for better health care. 2. We want to test how providing consumer informed and consumer directed quality information to One Care providers affects One Care quality. 3. We want to improve the ability of One Care enrollees to manage their own health care and to recognize and report quality problems</detailed_description>
