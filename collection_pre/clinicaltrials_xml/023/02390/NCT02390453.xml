	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of cognitive and exercise training versus control condition on executive cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive and Aerobic Resilience for the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise and cognitive training hold promise for delaying progression of MCI. Exercise improves cognitive ability, brain function, and brain structure in older adults. Cognitive training has been shown to durably improve mental abilities and functional status in older adults. In addition, persons with MCI respond to some forms of cognitive training just as robustly as healthy older adults. This pilot study is a 4 group design with a home-based multi-modal physical exercise intervention, cognitive training, combined cognitive and physical training, and a social contact control enrolling older adults with MCI. This pilot study is designed to be consistent with current recommended approaches to establishing trial feasibility. If the aims are achieved, it will provide a conceptual and practical rationale to support a large, multi-site, randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of combined physical and cognitive training in delaying time to a clinical diagnosis of dementia.</detailed_description>
