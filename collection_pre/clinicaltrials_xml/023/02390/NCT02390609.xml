	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability (the extent to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of ibrutinib in healthy adults following single oral dose administration of suspension and sprinkle formulations under fed and fasted conditions compared with capsules under fasted conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Crossover Study to Evaluate the Bioavailability of Ibrutinib Suspension and Sprinkle Formulations Compared to Capsules in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), 3- or 4-way crossover (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial), and single-center study of ibrutinib. The duration of study will be approximately 67 to 83 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (28 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (consists of 6 treatments, either Ibrutinib capsule or suspension or sprinkle capsule granules under fed or fasted condition), in subsequent 3 periods for Group 1 and 4 periods for Group 2, each separated with washout period of 7 (plus [+] / minus [-] 2) days; and follow up Phase (up to 10 + / - 2 days after last study drug administration). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 (Group 1) or 4 (Group 2) treatment sequences. In fasted conditions, study drug will be administered following a 10-hour overnight fast. In fed conditions, participants will also fast from food for 10 hours, but will consume a high fat breakfast within a 30-minute period. Study drug will be administered 2 hours after the breakfast. Participants will not be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative bioavailability of Ibrutinib will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
