	<brief_summary>This is a single center pilot study testing the use of novel coil arrays with MR liver imaging. In part A of the study, up to 30 healthy volunteers will be scanned, with iterative adjustment of coil array geometry and design to optimize imaging characterstics. In Part B of the study, 40 patients with advanced solid tumors and at least one liver metastasis measuring &gt; 1.5 cm in diameter on standard anatomic scans will undergo MR liver imaging with the newly designed coil array, with the use of gadolinium contrast. Patients with liver tumors will have the option of undergoing a second MR liver scan during the course of subsequent systemic therapy.</brief_summary>
