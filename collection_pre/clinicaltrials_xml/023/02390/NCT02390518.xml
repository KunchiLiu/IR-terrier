	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I dose escalation trial. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation received during stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with brain metastases who have never received radiation to the brain before.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinically confirmed brain metastases by CT or MRI criteria. It is preferable if there is extracranial metastatic disease that the lesion be pathologically confirmed and reviewed at University of Utah or Huntsman Cancer Hospital if the pathology was obtained at an outside hospital. Prior brain surgery is allowed, although SRS (Stereotactic Radiosurgery) treatment to the operative bed would not be a "tumor" enrolled on the dose escalation portion of this trial. SRS would be delivered 46 weeks postsurgery if the patient had had a craniotomy for resection of a lesion. It is up to the PI's discretion to enroll a patient with SRS delivered outside of the 46 postcraniotomy window. 15 brain metastases total Maximum tumor diameter &lt; 40mm by CT or MRI measurement, at the time of consultation/screening, for each metastatic lesion present in the brain All metastatic lesions must have a minimum distance between them of 3 cmm as measured from the peripheral edges of the lesions which are in closest proximity to one another. If there are multiple lesions and they are not all at least 3 centimeters away from each other, that patient will be deemed ineligible. Systemic therapy is allowed, although appropriate washout is required for patients who have been on BRAF ( inhibitors of at least 7 days. For subjects currently on active systemic cancer therapy, the treating medical oncologist should be consulted to ensure proper washout periods prior to SRS. Age &gt; 18 years old KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status) &gt; 60 Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days of study enrollment and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while receiving radiation and for 3 months after radiation. Women of nonchildbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for &gt;1 year. Men who are able to father a child must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while receiving radiation, and for 3 months after radiation. Prior whole/partial brain irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery Brain lesions with a maximal diameter of &gt; 40 mm in size on MRI imaging at the time of consultation/screening for protocol eligibility. Lesion located in anatomic regions that are not amendable to SRS, including the brain stem, optic apparatus, or eloquent cortex Radiographic or cytologic evidence of leptomeningeal disease Primary lesion with radiosensitive histology that includes the following: small cell carcinoma, germ cell tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding Patients with multiple lesions, which by size criteria would be enrolled in a cohort which is full at the time of enrollment and the 12 weeks DLT period has not been reached.</criteria>
