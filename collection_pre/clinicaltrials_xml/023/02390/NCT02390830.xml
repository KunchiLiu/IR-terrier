	<brief_summary>Background. Balance disorders and falls are common in People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) Objective: Our hypothesis was that PwMS treated for balance disorders would reduce balance disorders and frequency of falls. Methods: A bi-centre randomised Rater-blinded controlled trial. Participants in both groups received 20 treatment sessions. Participants in the intervention group received treatment aimed at improving control of the position and movement of the centre of mass and body segments. Participants in the control group received treatments to reduce limitations at activity and body function level. Group allocation was done by an independent clinician by a randomization list made before the beginning of the study. Group allocation was kept concealed throughout the study and participants were not aware of group assignment. Data was analyzed according to a preplanned protocol by using an intention to treat approach.</brief_summary>
