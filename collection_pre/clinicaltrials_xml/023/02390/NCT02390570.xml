	<brief_summary>This study is designed to answer why "patient capacity" (i.e. patient available abilities and resources to enact self-care and access healthcare) is not regularly documented in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) in a way that is useful for clinicians. Through the implementation of communication tools designed for patient capacity assessment and engagement of stakeholders in a process of user-centered design, the study team hypothesizes that the study can help clinicians elicit this information in conversation and regularly document it in the medical record for future healthcare discussions.</brief_summary>
