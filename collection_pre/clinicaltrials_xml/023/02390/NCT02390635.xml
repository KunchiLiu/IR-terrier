	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect extramedullary myeloid leukemia (EML). EML is a type of cancer found outside of the bone marrow and can be hard to detect with routine bone marrow monitoring, such as bone marrow aspirations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If participant chooses to take part in this study, they will have a PET/CT scan and whole body MRI scan before they start their regular treatment. When participant arrives at the clinic for their PET/CT-MRI scans, they will receive a "contrast" solution by vein to make the images more accurate. If participant feels very nervous, the doctor may give them medication to help calm them down. Participant will first have the MRI scan, which will take about an hour. After that, participant will lie on a table so they can be moved into the room next door. Participant will then have the PET scan, which should take about 30 minutes. Participant and their regular doctor will be told if anything unusual is found in their scans, and the information will be put in their medical record. Information will also be collected from participant's medical record for at least 1 year after they complete the scans. This is an investigational study. The PET/CT and MRI scans on this study are performed using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. Using these scans to detect EML is considered investigational.</detailed_description>
