	<brief_summary>The concept of mobilization with movement, also referred to as a Mulligan mobilization, has not been studied in patients with hip osteoarthritis, subsisting questions about the possible effects in this population. The aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the immediate effects of Mulligan mobilization with movement technique of pain, range of motion and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobilization With Movement in Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Hip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mulligan original theory for the efficacy of a Mobilization With Movement (MWM) is based on the concept associated with a "positional joint failure," which occurs due to injury and may lead to a change in the joint alignment and hence its biomechanical resulting in symptoms such as pain, joint stiffness or weakness. To perform the MWM technique it is required to implement many criteria. During execution is applied an maintained accessory glide in order to correct the positional fault, while a physiological movement or action that usually caused the pain is performed actively or passively. A key component for the MWM is that pain should always be reduced and / or eliminated during application. All study participants will be submitted to an initial assessment protocol to determine the intensity of pain, the range of motion (ROM) in flexion and internal rotation of the hip and the collection of physical function parameters. After that, the intervention will be performed for each group, and then the re-evaluation will be carried out (final evaluation), pain intensity, ROM and physical function tests..</detailed_description>
