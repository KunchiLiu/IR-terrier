	<brief_title>Epigenetic Contribution to the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Nephropathy in Qatari Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common vascular complication of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) that is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.In industrialized countries, DN ranges first among other etiologies of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Diabetes in Qatar is a serious health issue for the Qatari population since approximately 1/5 of the population has T2D, which is 2-3 times higher than the world average. As observed in other Gulf cooperation council (GCC) countries, obesity and sedentary lifestyle are cornerstones in the development of T2D. Additionally, consanguineous marriages in Qatar contribute to this high prevalence. As a consequence, DN has an enormous burden in terms of management, treatment and especially in renal replacement therapy (RRT) in ESRD in Qatari Population.DN is a glomerular disease defined by increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE), hypertension and decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), all induced by chronic hyperglycemia. However, there are other contributing factors such as genetic predisposition, systemic and intra-renal hemodynamic disturbances, all leading to glomerulosclerosis. All of the known pathways do not explain the complex pathophysiology behind DN. Even different variants of genes described in major GWAS studies have little impact in terms of risk prevention or prognosis of DN. Over the last decade, epigenetics have initiated a new era in Genetic Medicine capable of giving a different approach to human disease.</detailed_description>
