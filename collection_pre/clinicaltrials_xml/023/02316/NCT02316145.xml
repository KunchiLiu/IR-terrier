	<brief_summary>Purpose: To develop a model for internet-based support and coaching to young adults with neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). To improve the individual's psychosocial functioning and his/her understanding of how he/she is functioning. NPD comprise problems with social interaction, attention, impulse control and hyperactivity. The most common NPD diagnoses are ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism spectrum condition (ASC) and Tourette's disorder (TD). In this study the investigators use Internet-based treatment for young adults with NPD. Method: Support/coaching by using communication over the Internet (chat and e-mail) with individuals with NPD. Twice every week during 8 weeks, young adults with NPD are offered support and coaching over the Internet by psychologist/educational therapist with great experience from NPD. The individuals are assessed before and after treatment pertaining to quality of life, sense of coherence, self-esteem, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and parents' evaluation of the young adult's situation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims: To develop an internet-based support and coaching model for young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to validate the model. Method: A user centred design was applied to develop a model for internet-based support and coaching, where individuals received eight-week support via internet (chat). The model was validated by ten individuals, 15 to 26 years of age, with ASD and/or ADHD. Self-report questionnaires (Sense of Coherence (SOC), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA), Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)) were distributed before and after intervention. A structured interview regarding the quality of the model, the Patient perspective of Care and Rehabilitation process (POCR), was used after the intervention. Results: The validation showed significant improvement of SOC, self-esteem and subjective Quality of Life at follow-up and the majority perceived high fulfilment/importance on the POCR. Conclusions: The model can be an important complement to other interventions for young people with ASD and/or ADHD.</detailed_description>
