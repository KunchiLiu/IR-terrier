	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold(BVS) implantation on functionally insignificant coronary stenosis with vulnerable plaque reduce the incidence of the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or unplanned rehospitalization due to unstable angina compared with optimal medical therapy alone.</brief_summary>
