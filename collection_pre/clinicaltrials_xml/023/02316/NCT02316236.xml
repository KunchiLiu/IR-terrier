	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine to Improve Outcomes During Emergence From Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Agitation during emergence is frequent after retroperitoneal urologic surgery. Dexmedetomidine is alpha-2 receptor agonist which shows sedative and algesic effect. In this study we will compare the effect of dexmedetomidine given by different protocols on emergence agitation.</detailed_description>
