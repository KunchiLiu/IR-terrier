	<brief_summary>Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) is a commonly utilized, evidence-based psychosocial therapy (talk therapy) for alcohol dependence. By identifying the neural mechanisms through which CBCST changes drinking behavior, it may be possible to improve its efficacy. CBCST promotes abstinence by teaching "coping skills" for managing alcohol-related thoughts and emotions. In this pilot study, the investigators examine the neural systems that play a role in the learning of coping skills through CBCST, specifically focusing on the role of emotion regulation systems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Neural Systems for Emotion Regulation in Coping With Alcohol Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study combines 1) a 12-week clinical trial of CBCST in currently drinking alcohol dependent patients (target N=25) who are seeking treatment to reduce their drinking with 2) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that probe neural activity related to the utilization of copings skills taught in CBCST. The fMRI studies will be performed both before and after treatment with CBCST, with the goal of determining 1) the pattern of neural activity that is related to coping skills utilization prior to undergoing CBCST, with particular focus on neural systems known to play a role in emotion regulation; 2) how CBCST changes this pattern of neural activity; and 3) how these changes in neural activity predict changes in alcohol use during CBCST.</detailed_description>
