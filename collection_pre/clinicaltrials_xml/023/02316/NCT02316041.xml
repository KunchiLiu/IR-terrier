	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility and clinical evaluation study of the VisuMax femtosecond laser for refractive correction of hyperopia using the small incision lenticule extraction (ReLEx smile) method. In ReLEx® the VisuMax femtosecond laser creates two interfaces that define a refractive lenticule of stromal tissue. In ReLEx® FLEx, the upper interface is converted into a LASIK flap by the creation of a sidecut. The LASIK flap is lifted and the lenticule can be removed to correct the refractive error by tissue subtraction. In ReLEx® smile, the lenticule is dissected and removed through a small 2-3mm incision without the need to create a whole flap. The aims are i) to optimize the VisuMax settings for lenticule separation ii) to optimize the lenticule geometry iii) to assess the safety, efficacy and stability of the treatment</brief_summary>
