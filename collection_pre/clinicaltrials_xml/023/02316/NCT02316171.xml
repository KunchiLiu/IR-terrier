	<brief_summary>The study will consist of 2 sequential parts. Part A is a study of the safety and tolerability of CAVATAK administered via intravesical instillation in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer scheduled to undergo TUR. Part B will evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAVATAK administered in sequential combination with low dose Mitomycin C in the same patient population.</brief_summary>
