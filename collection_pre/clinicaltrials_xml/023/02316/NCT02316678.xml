	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the hypothesis that that greater efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) therapy results in reduced need for bowel resection surgery, fewer serious infections, and reduced short term mortality risks, and therefore has a more favorable benefit to harm profile than corticosteroids for inflammatory bowel disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Attitudes and Preferences for Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapeutics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness study among Medicare Parts A, B, and D beneficiaries with inflammatory bowel disease. The investigators will compare the incidence of severe infection, bowel resection surgery, and death among new users of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies and corticosteroids. The investigators will compute propensity scores to describe the propensity for treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs compared to corticosteroids, and will match corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor drug treated patients on the propensity score. Cox regression will be employed to assess the hazard ratio for each of the outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients will be required to have at least two diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease within the 6 months prior to initiating antiTNF therapy or corticosteroids. To assure full coverage, patients will be required to have Parts A, B, and D Medicare coverage. 1. Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis in the 6 months period prior to initiation of the therapy. 2. Less than 6 months of followup time within the data source prior to initiation of the therapy. 3. Diagnosis of cancer in the 6 months prior to initiation of the study medication. 4. Initiation of antiTNF therapies within the first 6 months following surgery. 5. Patients who are in managed care plans (Medicare Part C).</criteria>
