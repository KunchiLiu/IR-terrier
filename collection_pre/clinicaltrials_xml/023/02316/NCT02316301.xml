	<detailed_description>The interval between misoprostol administration and office hysteroscopy may have an influence on its effectiveness in pain reduction. There are limited data on the optimal interval from administration of misoprostol and office hysteroscopy. In previous studies, time interval from administration of misoprostol and office hysteroscopy ranged between 2 hours and 24 hours. Till now no studies have yet investigated the optimal timing of misoprostol administration prior to office hysteroscopy or operative hysteroscopy. The aim of this study was to determine whether misoprostol administered 12 hours before office hysteroscopy can relieve pain more effectively compared with misoprostol administered 3 hours before office hysteroscopy</detailed_description>
