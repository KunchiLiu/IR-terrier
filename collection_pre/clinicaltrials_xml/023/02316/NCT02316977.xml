	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to establish the intrarater-reliability, criterion validity and responsiveness of the ADL-Questionnaire applied on an eHealth platform to be used by patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. The study is designed as a repeated test-retest study including 240 patients filling in the ADL-Q, HAQ-DI and PDQ at day 1, 3, 56 and 58. The study provides an eHealth platform (a home-module in the DANBIO database) which makes it possible for the patients to complete their assessments and send information from their own home. Intrarater reliability will be assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Criterion validity will be evaluated based on correlational analysis and responsiveness based on effect sizes, in both cases involving HAQ-DI. PDQ scores will be used to classify participants based on pain phenotype to explore any relationship between pain phenotype and reliability.</brief_summary>
