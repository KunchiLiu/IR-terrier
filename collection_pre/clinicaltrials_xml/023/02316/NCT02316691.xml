	<brief_summary>Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune inflammation of the orbital tissues that develops in up to 50% of patients with Graves' disease. Although about 80% respond to IVGC initially, the relapse rate is high and about 75% require further surgery despite initial response. Although the natural history of TED is associated with spontaneous remissions after about 1 to 3 years, many irreversible serious ophthalmic and orbital complications can arise during this time. Therefore, there is a need for improved intervention strategies in the early active inflammatory phase of TED, to avoid progression to the cicatricial stage where disease manifestations can only be addressed in a rehabilitative fashion. The primary immunopathogenesis of Graves' disease is considered to be activation of B cells that then produce autoantibody against thyrotropin receptors in the thyroid (TRAb). Like in many autoimmune diseases, the inflammatory CD4+ T cell subset known as Th17 cells is also increased in blood of patients with active Graves' disease; the putative Th17 cytokine, IL-17, is also increased in serum and tears of TED patients. There is also an emerging pathogenic role for Th17 cells that co-express the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and drive autoantibody production. The contribution of Th17 cells to TED is not well defined. This study is an observational, longitudinal, prospective study of patients receiving treatment for thyroid eye disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B-cell Depletion Therapy With Rituximab for Thyroid Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All enrolled subjects will receive Intravenous Glucocorticoid (IVGC) therapy, which is currently the standard of care for TED patients. Subjects will receive the IVGC therapy at a facility chosen by them and their physician. If their disease does not respond to IVGC therapy, they will receive rituximab and/or surgical decompression and/or radiation which is also currently standard of care at a facility chosen by them and their physician. Prior to initiation of treatment and during the course of treatment, study patients will get research labs done along with routine labs and fill out questionnaires regarding their disease symptoms. We will obtain 30 mL or 2 tablespoons of blood from subjects at initial evaluation and approximately Wk4, Wk 12, Wk 26, Wk 38, and Wk 52 (this may vary depending on when the patient comes in for their follow up visits, but the schedule approximates what is typical for standard of care in these patients) for mechanistic studies.</detailed_description>

HIV or hepatitis infection or declined consent for HIV or hepatitis testing 8. Use of rituximab in the prior 24 months for any reason other than TED 9. Unwillingness to practice birth control for at least 12 months post treatment 10. Pregnancy (a negative serum pregnancy test should be performed for all women of childbearing potential within 7 days of treatment), or lactating. 11. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures. 12. History of HIV. 13. Presence of active infection. 14. Presence of CNS metastases. 15. New York Heart Association Classification III or IV heart disease (See Appendix D). 16. Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last five years, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 17. History of psychiatric disorder. 18. At the Investigator's discretion, receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization.</criteria>
