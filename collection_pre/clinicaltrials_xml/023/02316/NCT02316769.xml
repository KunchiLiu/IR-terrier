	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators compare the effectiveness of two relatively new video laryngoscopes, McGrath MAC (Covidien, Dublin Ireland) and the King Vision (King Systems, Noblesville, IN), by practitioners experienced in airway management but with limited exposure to these two devices. Our hypothesis was that, the McGrath MAC device would require fewer intubation attempts and shorter intubation times than the King Vision when performed by novice users.</brief_summary>
