	<brief_title>Single Dose Ablative Radiation Treatment for Early-Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of twenty-five patients will be treated with a single dose preoperative ablative radiation treatment. After a vigilant follow-up with MRI, breast conserving surgery will be performed 6 months after the ablative radiation treatment. The total follow-up time is 10 years. This study aims to present an ablative radiotherapy treatment approach that could resolve to some extent the disadvantages of current breast conserving treatment in elderly low-risk breast cancer patients who are currently not treated according to guidelines due to co-morbidity.</detailed_description>
