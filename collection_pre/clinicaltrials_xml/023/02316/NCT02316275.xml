	<brief_summary>To determine the impact of unrestricted postoperative activity on intermediate- and long-term continence outcomes of mid-urethral sling surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence. To assess the natural return to baseline activity level when patients are unrestricted following mid-urethral sling surgery with or without concomitant anterior or posterior pelvic organ prolapse repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Unrestrictive Exercise Following Mid-Urethral Sling Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the last decade, the mid-urethral sling has become the new gold standard in the management of stress urinary incontinence because of its high success rate and minimally invasive nature. However, postoperative management has not kept pace with the modernization of sling surgery. Although formal guidelines regarding the resumption of normal activity levels have not been established, it is general practice to restrict exercise for a minimum of six weeks after surgery. For the study, if immediate resumption of normal activity has no impact on intermediate- and long-term continence outcomes, it may result in improved quality of life and cost savings from a societal perspective.</detailed_description>
