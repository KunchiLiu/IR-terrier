	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate 3 Dose Schedules of Daratumumab in Participants With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label (identity of assigned treatment will be known to participants and study staff), 3-arm (3 treatment groups), multicenter study of daratumumab in participants diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM [ie, early disease without any symptoms]). Participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to one of 3 treatment groups to receive daratumumab. Each treatment group will investigate 1 of 3 dosing schedules of daratumumab. The study will include a 28-Day Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase of 1 to 20 treatment cycles (each cycle is 8 weeks in duration for total period of 8 to 160 weeks), and a Follow up Phase of 4-weeks from the last dose of study drug. The Follow-up Phase will continue until death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first. The end of the study will occur approximately 4 years after the last participant enrolled receives a first dose of study drug. Disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks in the first year and then every 16 weeks until disease progression. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
