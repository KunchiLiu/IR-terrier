	<brief_summary>In the present study the investigators evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of passive tilt test in athletes, as well as their haemodynamic responses and autonomic nervous system activity during head-up tilt. Moreover, the investigators try to apply a novel algorithm for the improvement of diagnostic yield of tilt test in athletes.</brief_summary>
