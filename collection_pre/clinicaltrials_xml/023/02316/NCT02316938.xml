	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled in the core study CRAD001A2433 in Australia will be eligible for recruitment into CRAD001AAU13. These patients will undergo additional tests (including 4 kidney allograft biopsies) as part of the substudy that will be conducted during core study CRAD001A2433 visits. At Day 0 (day of transplant /TX), Month 2, Month 12 and Month 24 additional samples (serum, whole blood and kidney biopsy) will be taken for the purposes of this substudy.</detailed_description>
