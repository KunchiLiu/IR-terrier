	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this project is to investigate, using RSA, acetabular implant migration of the OsseoTi™ G7 acetabular cup in comparison to conventional PPS coated G7 acetabular cup, and compare liner wear of thinnest available E1™ liner, allowing for the largest possible femoral head (36mm-44mm) to E1™ liner holding a 32mm femoral head in the G7 acetabular system with endpoint assessment being performed at the 2 year follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>• Participants with primary hip osteoarthritis set to receive a primary unilateral uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Participants must be 1875 years of age. Participants must be able to speak and understand Danish (or depending on country where patient is enrolled). Participants must be able to give informed consent and be cognitively intact. Participants must be expected to be able to complete all postoperative controls. Participants must not have severe comorbidities, ASAscore ≤ 3. Terminal illness. Rheumatoid arthritis. Previous fracture of the hip. Osteonecrosis of the hip. Previous infection of the hip. Severe bony deformity warranting the use of nonstandard implants. Metastasis in the periarticular bone or proximal femur. Female patients that are pregnant or planning pregnancy during followup period If bone stock or femoral canal type, assessed on preoperative xray, warrants the use of cemented fixation. Documented osteoporosis with patient in active medical treatment. Comorbidity with altered pain perception (e.g. DM with neuropathy). Participants that develop deep infection in the followup period are excluded from the project.</criteria>
