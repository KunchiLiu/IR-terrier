	<brief_summary>The Mutanome Engineered RNA Immuno-Therapy (MERIT) study introduces a novel concept for Individualized Cancer Immunotherapy (IVAC®) to treat each patient with the relevant and immunogenic RNA vaccines for a given patient's tumour. The TNBC-MERIT trial uses two complementary strategies, the IVAC® WAREHOUSE and the IVAC® MUTANOME concept, resulting in two custom-made IVAC® investigational medicinal products (IMPs) (IVAC_W_bre1_uID and IVAC_M_uID) for each individual patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RNA-Immunotherapy of IVAC_W_bre1_uID and IVAC_M_uID</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The IVAC® WAREHOUSE concept is based on RNA drug products shelved in a warehouse and targeting shared tumour-associated antigens (TAAs). The BioNTech Group (henceforward the "company") has identified a set of target antigens commonly expressed in TNBC. The selected breast cancer-associated antigens have been shown by immunogenicity testing to constitute suitable targets for immunotherapy and form the basis for the development of a novel RNA-based immunotherapy approach. - The IVAC® MUTANOME concept is based on the identification of tumour-specific mutations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and on-demand RNA manufacturing for use in single patients to target multiple neo-antigens derived from mutated epitopes. The novel therapeutic concept is supported by a series of research projects and high level publications that have led to a broad acceptance that mutation-specific T cells bear enormous potential to confer anti-tumoural activity in cancer patients1-5. - The TNBC-MERIT study will introduce the novel therapeutic concept for the individualized treatment of breast cancer that is based on (i) treatment with a patient-specific liposome complexed RNA tailored to the antigen-expression profile of any given patient's tumour (IVAC® WAREHOUSE immunotherapy - IVAC_W_bre1_uID) and (ii) on treatment with de novo synthesized RNAs targeting up to 20 individual tumour mutations (IVAC® MUTANOME immunotherapy - IVAC_M_uID) following treatment with IVAC® WAREHOUSE. The scientific rationale for the combination of the two IVAC® approaches is based on the assumption that immunotherapies that (1) acknowledge tumour heterogeneity on a single-patient level and (2) target the whole range of antigens selectively expressed on tumours ("cancer antigenome"), including immunogenic shared and unique antigens, bear the highest potential to constitute an effective treatment of tumours.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pT1cN0M0 anyTanyNM0 confirmed by physical examination or imaging Triple negative breast cancer is defined as: HER2 negative IHC 01+ IHC 2+ and FISH negative (ratio &lt; 2.0 or &lt; 4 gene copies / cell, as per new ASCO guideline) ER and PR negative confirmed&lt; 1% For patients in the adjuvant setting that are at high risk for relapse, treatment will be initiated 36 42 weeks after surgery. The adjuvant chemotherapy should contain anthracyclines and taxanes except for patients with contraindications for treatment with one or both substances Patients with planned radiotherapy (as per local policy) are eligible and will be irradiated in parallel to the vaccination cycles. Adequate organ function Expression of at least two tumourspecific antigens of the IVAC_WAREHOUSE_bre1 confirmed by RTPCR on FFPE tissue Female patients, ≥ 18 years of age Written informed consent ECOG performance status (PS) 01 ANC ≥ 1500/µl Haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ ALT/AST &lt;2 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN Recovered preexisting toxicities &lt; grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE 4.03 Negative pregnancy test (measured by βHCG) for females of childbearing age Not pregnant or nursing Patients with stage pT1a,bN0M0 and anyTanyNM1disease are excluded Patients with early relapse or diagnosis of metastasis that were not known before inclusion of the trial but that occur during the treatment phase may receive vaccination cycles up to the discretion of the treating physician provided that no approved treatment will be omitted Any serious local infection (e. g. cellulitis, abscess) or systemic infection (e. g. pneumonia, septicaemia, viral or fungal infection) which requires systemic treatment with antibiotics or corticoid therapy within two weeks prior to the first dose of study medication Previous splenectomy Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude the patient from complying with the study protocol Positive test for acute Hepatitis A, acute or chronic active Hepatitis B or C infection Clinically relevant autoimmune disease Systemic immune suppression: HIV disease Use of chronic oral or systemic steroid medication (topical or inhalational steroids are permitted) Other clinically relevant systemic immune suppression Symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA 3 or 4) Unstable angina pectoris Myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 14 days before the first treatment Other major surgeries within 28 days before the first treatment Other investigational agents within 28 days or 5 halflives depending on what gives the longer range before the first treatment. Ongoing participation in another clinical study (except of followup observation). Fertile females who are unwilling to use a highly effective method of birth control (less than 1% per year, e.g. condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, birth control pills, injections, patches or intrauterine device) during study treatment and 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. Presence of a serious concurrent illness or another condition (e. g. psychological, family, sociological, or geographical circumstances) that does not permit adequate followup and compliance with the protocol.</criteria>
