	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well postoperative intensity modulated radiotherapy works after surgery in treating patients with urothelial bladder cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells left behind in the pelvis after surgery. It is not yet known whether surgery followed by radiotherapy is more effective than surgery alone in treating patients with urothelial bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With or Without Postoperative Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Urothelial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate the ability of postcystectomy adjuvant radiotherapy to safely reduce pelvic tumor recurrence, defined as pelvic recurrence-free survival. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate increase in disease-free survival. II. Evaluate toxicity of adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients are stratified by neoadjuvant preoperative or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. ARM I: No radiotherapy. ARM II: Patients undergo radiotherapy (IMRT) 1.8 Gy, 5 days a week over 6 weeks for a total of 28 treatments and 50.4 Gy, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. IMRT starts within 14 days of registration if no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, otherwise within 14 days of the completion of the chemotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Initial histological diagnosis of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma within 180 days prior to registration Patients must have undergone a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit for urothelial bladder carcinoma within 49 days prior to registration; final cystectomy pathology must be either pure urothelial carcinoma or dominant urothelial carcinoma with admixture of other histologies excluding small cell variants Neoadjuvant (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy for the bladder cancer is permitted; however, all patients who will receive adjuvant chemotherapy must be registered within 49 days after completing cystectomy regardless of whether adjuvant chemotherapy has started. Patients who will be receiving adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy will be randomized within 21 days of completing chemotherapy Patients with the following TNM stages are eligible: pT3apN0; pN1; pN2 provided less than 10 nodes dissected and/or positive surgical margins pT3bpN0; pN1; pN2 pT4apN0; pN1; pN2 pT4bpN0; pN1; pN2 Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup: History/physical examination =&lt; 45 days prior to registration; Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)CT that includes the chest, abdomen and pelvis should be performed for initial radiological staging. This may be performed pre or postsurgery =&lt; 90 days prior to registration except in patients getting postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, who will require CT, MRI or PETCT including the chest and abdomen and pelvis no more than 30 days prior to registration; imaging performed postoperatively should show no evidence of residual disease Age &gt;=18 Zubrod performance status 02 =&lt; 45 days prior to registration Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 cells/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.0 g/dl (NOTE: the use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin [Hgb] &gt;= 8.0 g/dl is acceptable) The patient must provide studyspecific informed consent prior to study entry Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease; pN3 disease is not allowed Any type of orthotopic neobladder creation (new bladder placed in same location as the old bladder) Prior invasive solid tumor or hematological malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer and incidentally discovered prostate cancer at time of cystoprostatectomy) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years Prior chemotherapy for other malignancy; neoadjuvant precystectomy chemotherapy is permitted Prior radiotherapy to the pelvis Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease Patients who have required any treatment (medical or surgical) for bowel obstruction prior to diagnosis of bladder cancer or who have required surgical treatment for bowel obstruction after the cystectomy Severe, active comorbidity defined as follows: Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Severe hepatic disease, defined as a diagnosis of ChildPugh class B or C hepatic disease Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive with cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count &lt; 200 cells/microliter. Note that patients who are HIV positive are eligible, provided they are under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and have a CD4 count &gt;= 200 cells/microliter within 30 days prior to registration. Note also that HIV testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol Other major medical illness which requires hospitalization or precludes study therapy at the time of registration Women who are breast feeding</criteria>
