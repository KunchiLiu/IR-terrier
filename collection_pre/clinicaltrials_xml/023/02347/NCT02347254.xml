	<brief_summary>The proposed study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS) treatment of patients with L-dopa induced dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease (LID PD). Safety: To evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ExAblate Transcranial 4000 MRgFUS treatment of dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease. Effectiveness: To determine the level of effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment of LID in PD patients. Efficacy will be determined utilizing clinical rating scales for dyskinesia (UPDRS-IV and the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale) from examinations at Baseline, 3-Months and 12-Months post-ExAblate treatment.</brief_summary>

Any presence of psychosis will be excluded. Patients with mood disorders including depression will be excluded if they have exhibited symptoms within 6 months while on medication. Patients who have been treated with transcranial magnetic stimulation or ECT will be excluded. Patients with risk factors for intraoperative or postoperative bleeding (platelet count less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter) or a documented coagulopathy Patients with brain tumors Any illness that in the investigator's opinion preclude participation in this study.
