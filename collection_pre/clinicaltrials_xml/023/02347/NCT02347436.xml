	<brief_summary>The known correlation between benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and hypertension could be explained by 3 theoretical pathway models. Whether hypertension causes BPH, BPH causes hypertension or the two are caused by a common factor is currently unknown. In this study it will be investigated whether hypertension is due to the direct effects of infravesical obstruction to urinary outflow in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The approach will be blood pressure measurement in patients who will have a resection of the prostate.</brief_summary>
