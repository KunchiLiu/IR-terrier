	<brief_summary>For patients relapsing after platinum-based therapy, few data are available. The current use of cetuximab associated with radiotherapy in localized disease and associated with platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line setting stresses the need for new therapeutic options at later stages of SCCHN.Vinca-alkaloids demonstrated activity in SCCHN. Vinflunine demonstrated superior antitumour activity to vinorelbine in preclinical animal models. Recent preliminary phase I results of the vinflunine plus methotrexate combination in SCCHN, based on a clinical review, show encouraging antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile. Therefore the combination of vinflunine and methotrexate appears a promising salvage regimen after platinum failure. The present study has been designed as a multicenter, randomised phase III study which will compare the combination of IV vinflunine with methotrexate to methotrexate alone in SCCHN patients having failed platinum-based therapy.</brief_summary>
