	<brief_summary>As the loss of muscle mass with aging is associated with a dysregulation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) that is generally characterized by an 'anabolic resistance' to nutrients, the primary outcome of the trial is to investigate the effect of a mixed macronutrient beverage on post-prandial myofibrillar MPS. However, the 'anabolic resistance' of aging may be predominantly influenced by the contractile activity of skeletal muscle; for example, the investigators have demonstrated that 2 weeks of reduced habitual activity (i.e. daily step count) induces anabolic resistance in otherwise healthy older adults. In contrast, resistance exercise is well-known to enhance muscle mass and can increase the sensitivity of skeletal muscle to dietary amino acids. Therefore, all participants will undergo a 2-week reduced step count intervention combined with a unilateral leg resistance exercise protocol to induce an 'unhealthy' or 'anabolically resistant' leg and a relatively 'healthy' or 'anabolically sensitive' leg, respectively; this within subject model will be utilized to investigate the effect of the mixed macronutrient beverage in both relatively 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' older muscle. The investigators will also measure changes in muscle mass, muscle function, and cardiovascular health of both legs before and after the 2-week intervention to determine the effect of reduced activity and the protective effect of minimal, low-intensity exercise on these outcomes.</brief_summary>
