	<brief_summary>The overall goals of this project are to determine the impact of an implicit priming intervention, designed to alter food perceptions, on both brain responses to food and on food intake behaviors in overweight/obese individuals. The investigators hypothesized that this bottom-up sensory-level conditioning approach would effectively result in reduced preference for high-calorie foods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuronal and Behavioral Effects of Implicit Priming in Obese Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One factor that may contribute to susceptibility to obesity is a high responsivity to high-calorie foods in terms of cognitive factors such as emotional associations, reward value or reinforcing properties of food. Many of these processes involve learned associations thought to develop via classical conditioning through repeated pairings with external stimuli, which can influence food preferences and intake. As such, improving our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these processes and attempting to modify them may be a useful strategy to promote weight loss and maintenance. Therefore, the proposed study aims to investigate the effects of altering food perception on neuronal responses and food intake behaviors by using implicit priming, in which positively or negatively valenced images are presented immediately prior to food images, but are not consciously perceived. The project goals are to determine the impact of the implicit priming intervention on both brain responses to food cues and on food intake behaviors in overweight/obese individuals. Food image ratings and neuronal responses to visual food cues will be assessed before and after either (a) an active implicit priming intervention or (b) a control intervention. Following fMRI, food intake will be measured.</detailed_description>
