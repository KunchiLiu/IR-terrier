	<brief_summary>This will be a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, two-part, single-dose adaptive study in adults with moderate and mild (if needed) hepatic impairment and matched, healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. In Part 1, healthy control subjects (n=8) matched to subjects with moderate (n=8) hepatic impairment will be enrolled. If the geometric mean total plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC[0-infinity]) of GSK1265744 is increased by &gt;2-fold in moderately impaired subjects relative to matched controls, Part 2 will be conducted to evaluate GSK1265744 PK in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (n=8) and matched, control subjects (n=8). All subjects will receive a single 30 milligram (mg) oral dose of GSK1265744. The primary objective of the study is to compare plasma PK parameters of GSK1265744 in subjects with hepatic impairment to healthy controls matched in gender, age, and body mass index (BMI).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Hepatic Impaired Subjects (Cohort 1 and 3) Between 18 and 70 years of age Part 1 subjects with Moderate Hepatic Impairment Only (Cohort 1): Subject is considered to have moderate hepatic impairment (of any etiology) and has been clinically stable for at least 1 month prior to screening. Having moderate hepatic impairment with a ChildPugh score of 79 and previous confirmation of liver cirrhosis. Part 2 subjects with Mild Hepatic Impairment Only (Cohort 3): Subject is considered to have mild hepatic impairment (of any etiology) and has been clinically stable for at least 1 month prior to screening. Having mild hepatic impairment, with a ChildPugh score of 56 and previous confirmation of chronic liver disease. Supplemental inclusion criteria for all hepatically impaired subjects: Chronic (&gt;6 months), stable (no acute episodes of illness within the previous 1 month prior to screening due to deterioration in hepatic function) hepatic impairment due to any etiology.

Male or female: Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and the protocol. Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Subjects (Cohorts 2 and 4): Healthy control subjects will be matched for age +/10 years to subjects in the respective hepatic impairment cohort but must also remain in the age range between 18 and 70 years inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee. Healthy control subjects will be matched for BMI +/25 percent to subjects in the respective hepatic impairment cohort but must also remain in the range of: Body weight &gt;=50 kg and BMI within the range 19 41 kg/m^2 (inclusive) Male or female: Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in the protocol. Exclusion Criteria for Hepatic Impaired Subjects (Cohort 1 and 3): Presence of Grade 3 or 4 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or bilirubin; corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 milliseconds (msec); The subject's systolic BP is outside the range of 90160 millimeter of mercury (mmHg), or diastolic BP is outside the range of 4595mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of 50100 beats per minute (bpm) for female subjects or 45100 bpm for male subjects Evidence of previous myocardial infarction in the past 12 months or any clinically significant active cardiovascular disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the safety of the subject.
