	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of IV gallium to improve pulmonary function as measured by a 5% or greater relative improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline to Day 28. Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 IV Gallium Study for Patients With Cystic Fibrosis (IGNITE Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adults with CF chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. The study will evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of a five day infusion of IV gallium nitrate (IV gallium). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of IV gallium to improve pulmonary function as measured by a 5% or greater relative improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from baseline to Day 28.</detailed_description>
