	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the drug), and anti-mycobacterial activity of bedaquiline (TMC207) in children and adolescents (0 months to less than [&lt;] 18 years of age) diagnosed with confirmed or probable pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), in combination With a Background Regimen (BR) of MDR-TB Medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate Anti-mycobacterial Activity of TMC207 in Combination With Background Regimen (BR) of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Medications for Treatment of Children/Adolescents Pulmonary MDR-TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) and Phase 2 study. The study will consist of a screening phase, a 24-week open-label treatment phase during which all participants will receive bedaquiline (TMC207) in combination with a BR of MDR-TB medications, and a 96-week follow-up phase. Upon completion of the 24-week treatment with bedaquiline, all participants will continue to receive their BR under the care of the investigator. The total study duration will be 120 weeks for each participant. There will be 4 age based cohorts in this study. Cohort 1: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 12 to less than (&lt;) 18 years of age; Cohort 2: &gt;=5 to &lt;12 years of age; Cohort 3: &gt;=2 to &lt;5 years of age; Cohort 4: 0 months to &lt;2 years of age. Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be enrolled concurrently followed by sequential enrollment of Cohorts 3 and 4. An internal safety monitoring group will review safety and pharmacokinetic data from each cohort to determine subsequent cohort enrollment and dose. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must be a boy or girl, aged from birth (0 months) to less than (&lt;) 18 years at screening. Infants must be greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 37 weeks gestation at baseline Participant must weigh &gt;4 kilogram (kg) at entry and be within the 5th and 95th percentiles (inclusive) for the participant's age, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards; Body Mass Index (BMI) for age Heterosexually active girls may participate if they are of nonchildbearing potential, or if they are using effective birth control methods and are willing to continue practicing birth control methods throughout Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) treatment and for 6 months after stopping TMC207 treatment, or if they are nonheterosexually active or willing to practice sexual abstinence throughout MDRTB treatment Boys who engage in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy of the female partner must use at minimum a male condom throughout MDRTB treatment and for 3 months after stopping TMC207 treatment Participants must be starting the initial MDRTB regimen at baseline or have started an MDRTB regimen within 8 weeks of baseline and are willing to modify it if necessary to an acceptable MDRTB regimen for use with TMC207 Participant must be willing to permanently discontinue RMP from at least 7 days before the baseline visit Participant has a clinically significant active medical condition or the presence of any concomitant severe illness or rapidly deteriorating health condition, including immune deficiency, which in the opinion of the investigator would prevent appropriate participation in the study, or that would make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult, or otherwise make the subject a poor candidate for a clinical study Participant is a girl who is pregnant, or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or within 6 months after stopping TMC207 treatment Participant (or the mother if the potential subject is a child aged &lt;6 months) has a test positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at screening or within 1 month before screening Participant has known or presumed complicated or severe extrapulmonary manifestations of TB, including TB meningitis. Participants with adenopathy or adenitis are allowed to enter the study Participant has a significant cardiac arrhythmia that requires medication or a history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes, example heart failure, hypokalemia, known personal or family history of Long QT Syndrome, and untreated hypothyroidism</criteria>
