	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Two Daily Wear Silicon Hydrogel Contact Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled study will involve at least 50 evaluable subjects divided evenly among 5 study sites in Taiwan. Each study site will enroll 12 subjects at least. The ration of evaluable test subjects to control subjects will be 2 to 1. Subjects who have normal ocular health and conform to a set of standard criteria will wear one of the study lenses on two eyes and follow up for 3 months (90 days). Lenses will be assigned to subject according to a predetermined randomized order. It is necessary to remove contact lenses every day and replace after 30 days. Any unscheduled visit will be allowed when there is a medication necessary. The data for slit lamp findings, symptoms/problems/complaints, keratometry (K) reading, refractive changes (absolute value), visual acuity data, average wear time (AWT), discontinuations, and lens replacement will be collected to claim that the VISCO Soft Contact Lens is as safe and effective as BIOFINITY (comfilcon A) Soft Contact Lens (CooperVision).</detailed_description>
