	<brief_summary>GSK1265744 (744) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently in development for both the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Renal elimination of unchanged 744 is extremely low, with no parent 744 detected in the urine after a single 30 mg radiolabeled dose. Despite the minimal contribution of renal clearance on overall 744 elimination, renal impairment may potentially inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport, and as a result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics. The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies suggests that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment be conducted even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile. The study will be comprised of two cohorts (severe renal impairment and normal renal function) of 8 subjects each. Upon enrolment, each subject will be admitted to the study center and undergo serial PK sampling following a single dose of oral 744 30 milligrams (mg). Subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluations 10-14 days after the 744 30 mg dose.</brief_summary>

Renally impaired subjects must have clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the opinion of the principal investigator. Subjects with laboratory parameters outside the reference range may be included if, in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor, these findings will not interfere with the study or introduce additional safety risk to the subject.

Women of childbearing potential must be willing to practice acceptable methods of birth control. Premenopausal females defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. For Healthy Subjects (Cohort 2) Healthy control subjects will be matched for age +/10 years to subjects in the renal impairment cohort but must also remain in the age range: Between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.
