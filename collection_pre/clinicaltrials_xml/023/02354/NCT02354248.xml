	<brief_summary>TST (Triple stimulation technique) helps to better quantify the proportion of motor units activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation. The abnormal amplitude registered by TST is proportional to the intensity of conduction disorders. The evaluation of these disorders is more precise with this technique than with the slowing of the central conduction time (CCT). The investigators propose to use this technique in CNS pathologies where this disorder is significant and essential, like multiple sclerosis and stroke.</brief_summary>
