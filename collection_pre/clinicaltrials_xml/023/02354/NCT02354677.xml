	<brief_summary>COPD is characterized by exagerated decline FEV1 related to obstructive non reversible airflow. This could be the consequence of structural changes and inflammatory pattern of the bronchial wall. Lesions could lead to normal but also abnormal remodeling specially in COPD including a decrease in Club cells number and function.There is no treatment actually available targeted to a normal repair of the epithelium. The objective of this work is to identify potential targets for reprograming bronchial epithelial cells I order to achieve a good repair.</brief_summary>
