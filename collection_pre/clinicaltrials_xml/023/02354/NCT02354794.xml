	<brief_title>Effect of Arginine Supplementation in the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized crossover study including 32 subjects with risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. In a cross-over design, each subject received oral arginine and placebo, in a randomized order, and were studied the day preceding the first day of administration of arginine (or placebo) and after 4 weeks of arginine (or placebo) supplementation. The two periods of supplementation were separated by a washout period of at least 4 weeks. The subject were studied in the morning (when before supplementation) and in a whole day (when after supplementation). The mornings cessions consisted of fasting blood draw and vascular explorations, including a measurement of endothelium-dependent brachial artery reactivity ("Flow mediated dilation"), directly coupled to a measurement of post-ischemic digital reactivity (with the Endo-PAT method), completed by a measurement of non-endothelium-dependent brachial artery reactivity. An analysis of the pulse wave geometry was also performed. The whole-day cession consisted of the same fasting vascular explorations. Blood tests were performed fasting and repeated 2, 4 and 6 h after ingestion of a high-fat meal (900 kcal). Measurements of Flow mediated dilation was repeated 4h and postischemic digital reactivity were repeated 2, 4 and 6 h after ingestion of the high fat meal.</detailed_description>
