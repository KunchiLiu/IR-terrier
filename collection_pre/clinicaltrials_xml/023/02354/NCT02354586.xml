	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib in ovarian cancer patients who have received three or four previous chemotherapy regimens. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib will be administered once daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG). Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), RECIST tumor assessments and safety laboratory values.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must agree to undergo tumor HRD testing and blood gBRCAmut status testing. Patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy serum test within 72 hours of being dosed Patients must have histologically diagnosed highgrade (Grade 2 or 3) serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with recurrent disease and must have been previously treated with chemotherapy and experienced a response lasting at least 6 months to firstline platinum based therapy. Patients Must have completed 3 or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens. Patients must have completed their last chemotherapy regimen &gt; 4 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST (v.1.1). Patients must have formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tumor samples available from the primary or recurrent cancer or agree to undergo fresh biopsy prior to study treatment initiation. Patients must agree to blood samples during screening and at the end of treatment for cytogenetic analysis. Patients must not have any known, persistent (&gt; 4 weeks), â‰¥Grade 3 hematologic toxicity or fatigue from prior cancer therapy requiring treatment with transfusion or growth factors on more than 1 occasion within 1 year prior to study therapy. Patients must not have received pelvic radiotherapy as treatment for primary or recurrent disease within 1 year of the first dose of study treatment. Patients must not have symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients must not be considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Patients must not have received a transfusion (platelets or red blood cells) within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment. Patients must not have known history or current diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</criteria>
