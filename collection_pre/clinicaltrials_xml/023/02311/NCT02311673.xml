	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a once daily subcutaneous (SC) injectable formulation of RM-493 in obese subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome on tolerability, weight loss and hyperphagia-related behavior. The study drug (RM-493 and placebo) will be administered in a blinded fashion. Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. PWS due to chromosome 15 microdeletion, maternal uniparental disomy, or imprinting defect, confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, chromosomal microarray, and/or methylation studies. Obese male or female volunteers weighing at least 50 kg with BMI ≥27 kg/m² 2. Age 1665 years 3. If a volunteer has diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, following criteria must be met: 1. HbA1c &lt;7.5% not being managed with insulin. Patients taking GLP1 analogues (exenatide or liraglutide) must have been on stable dose for greater than 3 months. 2. Fasting plasma glucose &lt;140 mg/dL 3. No history of ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma 4. Vital signs must be within the following ranges and stable. 1. Systolic blood pressure, 90150 mm Hg 2. Diastolic blood pressure, 5090 mm Hg 3. Pulse rate, 40100 bpm 5. Stable body weight at home for ~2 months (self or guardianreported loss/gain within ± 5%). 6. Blood pressure (≤150/90 mmHg); may include stable dose (≥ 30 days of use) of up to two antihypertensive medications that are intended to remain on a stable dose during the protocol 7. Parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and be able to understand and sign the written informed consent. Due to the significant intellectual disability with PWS, assent is to be provided by the patient who cannot consent for himself or herself. 8. Results of screening clinical laboratory tests (CBC with differential and platelets and chemistry profile) must be within normal range or, if outside of the normal range, must be accepted by the investigator and sponsor as not clinically significant. 9. Females of nonchildbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or postmenopausal for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a screening FSH level in the postmenopausal lab range), do not require contraception during the study. All other females of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception as outlined in the protocol. 10. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to a double barrier method if they become sexually active during the study and for 90 days following the study. Male subjects must not donate sperm for 90 days following their participation in the study. 11. Patients must be on a stable dose of any allowed chronic concomitant medications while participating in the study, as described in protocol. This is defined as no changes in medication for at least 60 days prior to Day 1 and no changes in dose for at least 30 days prior to Day 1; Note that stable concomitant usage (&gt;3 months) of growth hormone, hormone replacement therapy, GLP1 agents, statins, or other medications (excluding insulin, modafinil, antipsychotics), and other medications commonly used in PWS patients are allowed (See Section 6.4.5 on Concomitant medications). 1. Recent use (within 3 month) of weight loss agents including herbal medication. 2. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other DSMIII disorders which the investigator believes will interfere significantly with study compliance. 3. A PHQ9 score of ≥15. 4. Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the CSSRS. 5. Clinically significant illness in the 8 weeks before screening. 6. History of clinically significant bleeding disorders. 7. Current, clinically significant liver, renal, pulmonary, cardiac, oncologic, or GI disease. 8. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus or other active endocrine disorders (e.g., Cushing syndrome, or thyroid dysfunction except if on adequate thyroid or glucocorticoid replacement supplement). 9. Cardiovascular disease event including history of CHF, coronary artery disease, MI, second degree or greater heart block or prolonged QT syndrome. 10. Blood pressure &gt;150/90 mmHG. 11. Liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests, SGOT (AST), alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin (&gt; 1.5 x ULN for any of these tests) or history of hepatic cirrhosis. 12. History or presence of impaired renal function as indicated by clinically significantly abnormal creatinine, BUN, or urinary constituents (e.g., albuminuria) or moderate to severe renal dysfunction as defined by the Cockroft Gault equation (&lt; 50 mL/min). 13. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of melanoma. 14. Oculocutaneous albinism (occurs at ~1% in PWS). 15. Significant dermatologic findings as part of the Screening comprehensive skin evaluation performed by the dermatologist. Any concerning lesions identified during the screening period will be biopsied and results known to be benign prior to randomization. If the pretreatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient will be excluded from the study. 16. Significant history of abuse of drugs or solvents in the year before screening or a positive Drugs of Abuse (DOA) test at screening. 17. History of alcohol abuse in the past year before screening or currently drinks in excess of 21 units per week (3 servings or units/day). 18. Caffeine consumption exceeding 6 cups of caffeinated tea/coffee (or equivalent) per day. 19. Volunteer is, in the opinion of the Investigator, not suitable to participate in the study. 20. Participation in any clinical study with an investigational drug/device within 3 months prior to the first day of dosing. 21. Positive history for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C tests or tuberculosis. 22. Serious adverse reaction or significant hypersensitivity to any drug. 23. Clinically significant blood loss or blood donation &gt; 500 mL within 3 month. 24. Inadequate venous access. 25. History of low blood counts or recurring infections.</criteria>
