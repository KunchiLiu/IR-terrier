	<brief_summary>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs ) are used for the administration of intravenous fluids and for blood sampling. PICCs may remain in place for weeks to months and are safeguarded from migration or accidental dislodgement by securement devices. Different types of these devices are available. StatLock速 (C.R. Bard) is a stabilization device with an adhesive anchor pad. The catheter wings of the PICC must be placed over the posts then the system is closed with "gull-wings" . StatLock速 has to be changed weekly. Healthcare providers have to pay attention to prevent accidental catheter dislodgement during the renewal procedure. SecurAcath速 (Interrad Medical) is a new securement device to the European market. The device uses a small subcutaneous anchor to secure the PICC. One of the advantages compared to adhesive stabilization devices, is a reduction in maintenance time by simplifying dressing changes and subsequently staff time. It is described that nurses report that care is left undone due to low staffing levels. Therefore, investigation of nursing time savings with the support of technology is imperative. SecurAcath速 remains in place for life of the PICC and therefore has the potential to reduce the time for dressing change as there is no need for weekly device change. The objective of this study is to measure nursing time for dressing change and explore inserting and removal issues and patient experiences.</brief_summary>
