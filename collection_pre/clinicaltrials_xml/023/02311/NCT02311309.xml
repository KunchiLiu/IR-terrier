	<brief_summary>Peroperative bleeding has been studied in specific populations exposed to bleeding (i.e. cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery). Epidemiology of peroperative bleeding and transfusion remain poorly studied in the whole cohort of patients scheduled for surgery remain unknown. The investigators conducted a prospective study in order to examine the incidence, and risk factors associated with peroperative bleeding and transfusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology of Severe Peroperative Bleeding During Scheduled Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective observational including all consecutive patients scheduled for surgery during a 3 month period. Exclusion criteria were : emergency, cardiac surgery, and pediatric surgery. Patients received an oral information and informed consent was search for all of them.
