	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed trial in assessment of effects of Kalydeco™ treatment on sinonasal involvement in CF patients with at least one mutation of G551D receiving a new therapy with the CFTR potentiator. The focus will be given on changes in epithelial lining fluid inflammatory markers from CF upper airways sampled by nasal lavage. The program is subdivided into a part A assessing inflammatory markers in NL and sinonasal symptoms longitudinally from pre-treatment to months with the new therapy. Part B will only be performed in a smaller subgroup and assess inflammatory markers in NL every second day in the first month of treatment and then every week until the end of month 3 with Kalydeco™ therapy.</brief_summary>
