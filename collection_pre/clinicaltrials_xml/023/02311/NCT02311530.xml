	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Felodipine ER Tablets 10 mg Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the subjects were subjected to breath test for alcohol and test for drugs of abuse (opioids and cannabinoids) prior to admission in each period. Only subjects with negative results in these tests were preceded for further activities. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a high-fat highcalorie breakfast was served to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of felodipine extended release tablets 10 mg of either test or reference formulation was administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel. During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
