	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the Telehomecare (THC) Program offered to patients with heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease across the Central West, Toronto Central and North East Local Health Integration Networks in Ontario. It will explore the opinions and experiences of patients, providers, technicians and administrators involved with THC Program in order to provide stakeholders with information about the processes and organizational factors impacting the program's adoption, the experiences of its participants, impact on patient outcomes, costs to the health-care system and who is benefiting the most from participating. These factors will be determined using semi-structured interviews, surveys, and observation of practices of everyone involved with THC. The study will also evaluate patient data to determine changes in patients' utilization of healthcare services.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Program Evaluation of Telehomecare: TeLeCare Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The program evaluation will consist of three components that will employ two research methods, qualitative and quantitative. Comparative Practice Study (Qualitative) This study will explore how factors related to the technology, patients, providers and organizational structures and processes influence the adoption and implementation of THC across selected sites (including micro-, meso- and macro-systems) in Ontario. Ethnographic study, in-depth semi-structured interviews and documentation collection and review will be employed to explore, among other factors, the behaviours, communication patterns, workflows and tasks of health care providers and their interaction with patients. Interviewees will be selected using purposive sampling. Descriptive Study (Quantitative) The patterns of THC use will be evaluated by conducting a descriptive study based on the data routinely collected by the Ontario Telemedicine Newtrok that tracks all encounters (i.e. telephone calls, remote patient monitoring data transmission, face to face visits) between patients and THC providers. A randomly selected subset of THC participants/caregivers will also complete validated structured questionnaires at up to four time points during program, baseline, one, two, and three months after enrollment. These are the Quality of Life Profile Measure (SF12), Quality of Life Preference Measure (EQ5D), Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire (TMPQ), Stanford self-efficacy scale and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The providers of THC will also be asked to complete questionnaires; physicians will be asked to complete Penn State Physician Telehomecare Survey, whereas the nurses will be asked to complete a Nurse Satisfaction Survey. ICES Linkage Study (Quantitative) Primary collected research data will be linked to the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) administrative databases. Outcomes (i.e. hospitalizations, primary care visits) of patients receiving or have received Telehomecare, will be assessed for a period of 6 months prior to enrolment, during the program and for up to 6 months after discharge.</detailed_description>
