	<brief_summary>The study aims to establish the safety and toxicity of a combined intravesical mitomycin C with BCG for patients with bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Mitomycin Combined With Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urine Sample Collection and Handling: Voided urine will be collected pre and post BCG procedure. Urinalysis will be performed if participant presents with urinary symptoms. Analysis of urinary cytokines as predictors of response to therapy will be conducted by ELISA kits. Tissue Sample Collection and Handling: Tissue biopsy specimens will be collected pre BCG procedure. Analysis of gene expression will be conducted. TEST PROCEDURES Subjects will be given one of three concentrations of Mitomycin C (MMC) (10 mg in 20 mL, 20 mg in 20 ml or 40 mg in 20 ml) for 30 minutes followed by a 10 minute washout period. Followed by three concentrations of BCG including ¼ strength, ½ strength, and full strength for 2 hours. Dose escalation will take place among subsequent patients and not within each patient. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to reach the target completion enrollment of 10 subjects. Long-term Follow-up A Chart review will be conducted every three months for 2 years after initial 6 month study data collection. Patient charts will be reviewed to assess disease progression and any data supporting findings. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine recurrence rates and long-term safety and efficacy of Mitomycin/BCG treatment therapy as well as BCG therapy in the control group.</detailed_description>
