	<brief_summary>There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of bosutinib and inotuzumab ozogamicin that can be given to patients with Ph+ ALL and CML in the lymphoid blast phase that also expresses CD22. The goal of Part 2 is to learn if the dose found in Part 1 can help to control the disease. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Bosutinib in Combination With Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in CD22-positive Philadelphia-Chromosome (PC) Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study and whether or not you have received earlier treatment for leukemia. Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 44 participants will be enrolled in Part 2. If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of bosutinib you receive will depend on when you join this study and your treatment history. The first group of participants in each treatment history group will receive the lowest dose level of bosutinib. Each new group will receive a higher dose of bosutinib than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of bosutinib is found. If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive bosutinib at the highest dose that was tolerated in Part 1. All participants in Parts 1 and 2 will receive the same dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin. Study Drug Administration: You will take bosutinib tablets by mouth 1 time each day with food. If you miss or vomit a dose of bosutinib, do not take "make up" the dose. Wait and take your next dose as scheduled the next day. You will also receive inotuzumab ozogamicin by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may switch to a different dosing schedule and receive inotuzumab ozogamicin 1 time every 4 weeks. The doctor will discuss this with you. You will be given standard drugs (such as acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamines, and/or steroids) to help decrease the risk of side effects. If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may also receive hydroxyurea to control your white blood cell count while you are on study. You may ask the study staff for information about how these drugs are given and their risks. Study Visits: On Day 1 of all cycles and Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have a physical exam. On Day 8 of Cycle 1, you will not have this exam. You may have these routine blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to your home. The results will be sent to the study doctor for review. On Day 1 of Cycles 2-6, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease and for CD22 testing. If the disease appears to get better, you will have this test every 2 cycles. After Cycle 6, you will have this test every 3 months or at any time the doctor thinks it is needed. Length of Treatment: You may take the inotuzumab ozogamicin for up to 6 cycles. You may continue taking bosutinib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after 1 year of follow-up calls. End-of-Treatment Visit: About 28 days after your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for CD22 testing. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease and for CD22 testing. If you cannot come to MD Anderson for the clinic visit, you will be called by a member of the study staff and asked about any side effects you may have. This call will last about 5 minutes. Follow-Up: After your end-of-treatment visit or call, you will be called 1 time about every 12 weeks (for up to 1 year) and asked about any anti-cancer therapy you may have started. This call will last about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is not FDA-approved or commercially available. Bosutinib is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of CML in patients who have failed previous therapies. It is considered investigational to use this combination of drugs to treat Ph+ AML/CML. Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Relapsed or refractory Bcell ALL or CML in lymphoid blast phase. Philadelphia chromosome must be present at screening (as determined by cytogenetic analysis, FISH, or PCR [i.e., BCRABL positive]). Note: patients with CML who have received treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for their CML, and have progressed to lymphoid blast phase are eligible for frontline treatment. Frontline Ph+ ALL or CMLLBC Cohort: Patients with newlydiagnosed Ph+ ALL or CMLLBC, who have received no or minimal treatment (minimal treatment is defined as treatment with steroids/hydroxyurea of &lt;/= 2 week duration; vincristine &lt;/= 2 doses; tyrosine kinase inhibitor of &lt;/=4 week duration; &lt;/=2 doses of cytarabine) and are &gt;/=60 years or older are eligible. Patients must have bone marrow blasts &gt;5% at the time of screening. 2. Expression of CD22 in &gt; or = 20% blasts 3.
