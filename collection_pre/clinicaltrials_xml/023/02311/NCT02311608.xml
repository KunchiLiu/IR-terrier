	<brief_title>Effects of Terlipressin When Usual Somatostatin or Octreotide Dose Fails</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis information of the patients with acute variceal bleeding will be collected, including hemostasis rate, early rebleeding rate, mortality, complications, severity adverse events, economic burdens and quality of life, when terlipressin or high dose somatostatin/octreotide is used as salvation to patients fail to achieve initial hemostasis.The results may help gastroenterologists to make decisions when administering vasoactive medicines to those suffered from acute variceal bleeding.</detailed_description>
