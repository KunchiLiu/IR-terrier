	<brief_title>Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, multicenter study of the safety, biological activity and clinical outcomes of an active implantable VNS device in patients with active refractory CD. Patients will sign informed consent prior to screening and will undergo all screening and baseline assessment procedures including endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy prior to planned VNS implantation date. Those who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled and will be implanted. After a minimum of 14 days following the implantation, patients will have their first in-clinic visit (Week 0 Visit), during which they will begin self-delivered once-daily stimulation using the VNS device. Patients will return for weekly visits between Weeks 1-4, at which time outcomes and safety assessments will be taken. At each visit between weeks 1 and 4, an attempt will be made to increase the output current to the maximum level tolerated. At the Week 4 Visit, another attempt to increase the output current will be made and the daily stimulation time will in addition be incremented by 60 seconds to 2 minutes total. At the Week 6 Visit safety and outcomes assessments will be taken and another attempt to increase the output current will be made, and the daily stimulation time will in addition be incremented to 5 minutes total. Patients will return at Week 8, at which time safety and outcomes assessments will be taken. If the patient has not achieved a clinical remission by CDAI, the frequency of stimulations will increase from once daily to 4 times daily. At Week 12, the patient will return for safety and outcomes assessments. The final study visit will be at the Week 16 Visit, at which time patients will have final primary endpoint safety and outcomes assessments, including a follow-up endoscopy with endoscopic biopsy. If patients terminate the study prior to week 16, every effort will be made to perform all Week 16 Visit procedures during an Early Termination Visit. Patients who complete the study will have the option to enroll in a long-term extension study. If they do not wish to participate in the extension study they can opt to either have their device permanently inactivated and left in place or have the device surgically explanted.</detailed_description>

Prohibited medications include the following: TNF antagonists and vedolizumab may continue throughout the study, but treatments should have been given at a stable dose for at least 6 months prior to the screening date and should be maintained at this level throughout the study Use of any natalizumab within 8 weeks Use of glucocorticoids at doses greater than 10 mg prednisone orally QD, or an equivalent dose of other oral or parenteral glucocorticoids within 4 weeks Use of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil within 4 weeks Use of intravenous antibiotics for Crohn's disease within 4 weeks Use of tube or enteral feeding, or elemental diet within 2 weeks Rectal Treatment: Use of 5aminosalicylates or corticosteroid enemas or suppositories within 2 weeks Azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine and methotrexate can be continued throughout the trial. These medications must have been used for &gt;12 weeks, at stable dose for at least 3 weeks prior to the Week 4 Visit.
