	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IV, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of somatropin (rDNA origin) (Nutropin AQ v1.1) in pre-pubertal children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) naïve to prior recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. The study is designed to characterize the immunogenicity profile of somatropin (rDNA origin) injection when administered daily subcutaneously for 12 months. The clinical impact of immunogenicity will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
