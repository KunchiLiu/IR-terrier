	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will be examining the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on executive function deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Half of the participants will be chosen by chance to receive active rTMS stimulation while half will be chosen by chance to receive sham rTMS. Sham rTMS will feel the same as active rTMS only there will be no direct brain stimulation. This is necessary to ensure that active rTMS is efficacious in the enhancement of executive function in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Based on results from a recently published pilot study, the investigators propose that active rTMS treatment will result in a significant improvement in working memory performance compared to sham rTMS treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS for Executive Function Deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double blind, sham controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for executive function deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder between 16 and 25 years of age. The study duration is approximately 3 months, with the rTMS sessions lasting for 4 weeks, 5 times a week, for about 1 hour each. Several scales will be used to assess for symptom severity and adaptive functioning. Cognition will be assessed using a validated battery. This study also involves a type of brain imaging known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the beginning and at the end of the 4 weeks of daily rTMS to better understand the effects of rTMS on brain structure and function. Investigators will measure the size and connections of different parts of the brain to assess brain structure and blood flow while participants are completing some basic tasks to asses brain function.</detailed_description>
