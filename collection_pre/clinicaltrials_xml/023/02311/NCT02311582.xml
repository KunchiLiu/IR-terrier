	<brief_summary>The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to drug delivery in the treatment of malignant brain tumors including Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MRI-guided laser ablation (MLA) has been noted to disrupt peritumoral BBB, which could then lead to increased access of new tumor antigens to the lymphovascular system and vice versa of immune effector cells to the tumor for effective activation of the immune system. Therefore the combination of MK-3475 and MLA as proposed in this protocol is hypothesized to create a therapeutic synergy in which MLA increases material access to promote immune activation and then MK-3475 maximizes these tumor-specific immune reactions to impart effective tumor control.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase I: Histologically confirmed grade III or IV malignant glioma. Phase II: Histologically confirmed grade IV malignant glioma (GBM). *Note: GBM variants and secondary GBM are allowed for both phase I and phase II. Unequivocal evidence of tumor progression as documented by biopsy or brain MRI scan per RANO criteria. There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of standard front line therapy to study registration unless there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence per RANO criteria. When the interval is less than 12 weeks but more than 4 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy, the use of perfusion imaging and/or PET scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression. Standard front line therapy is as described below: For grade IV malignant gliomas (GBM): Standard front line therapy for newly diagnosed GBM must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. If the tumor was initially diagnosed as either a grade II or III tumor and now has recurred or progressed as a grade IV GBM, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade IV GBM and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. For grade III malignant gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions: Standard front line therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide). If the patient did not receive any or all components of the standard front line therapy as detailed above for newly diagnosed grade III gliomas and the tumor then recurred or progressed, s/he must first receive at least one prior standard therapy or any appropriate combination of the components of standard therapy as detailed above and must experience further recurrence or progression before s/he is deemed eligible for this study. If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II glioma with 1p 19q codeletions and now has recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma with 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide). For grade III malignant gliomas without 1p 19q codeletions: Standard front line therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II glioma without 1p 19q codeletions and now has recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma without 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. Candidate for MLA based on the size, location, and shape of the recurrent tumor as determined by the performing neurosurgeon. Surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is allowed per standard of care but is not required; if the patient undergoes resection or debulking, it must have occurred at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose of MK3475. For Phase II: if surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is not indicated, a biopsy of the tumor will be done at the same time of MLA to obtain tumor tissue for both diagnostic purposes and immune monitoring. Patients who have undergone a gross total resection for recurrence will be eligible, and MLA will be directed at treating a peritumoral margin of 0.51cm surrounding the resection cavity to disrupt the BBB and potentially increase access of MK3475 to the peritumoral infiltrating glioma cells. At least 18 years of age.

Prior treatment with a monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of MK3475 or has not recovered (i.e. ≤ grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of MK3475 or has not recovered (i.e. ≤ grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: patients with ≤ grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.
