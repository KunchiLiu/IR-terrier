	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at creation and validation of a vitreous haze scoring system using ultrasonography B-scan of the eye. Images will be obtained from patients with uveitis and quantification of inflammation will be done to create the scoring scale.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Grading Scale of Vitreous Haze in Patients With Uveitis Using Ultrasonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with uveitis may present with Vitreous Haze (VH) resulting in obscuration of fundus details. VH is composed of cells and protein exudation and results in decrease visual acuity.The degree of VH is an important indicator of disease activity, severity and response to therapy in patients with uveitis. Color fundus images are commonly used to objectively document VH.</detailed_description>
