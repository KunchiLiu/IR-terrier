	<brief_summary>In patients with confirmed diagnosis of diabetes, an eye examination and a comprehensive survey are conducted after recruitment in secondary diabetes care centers. All patients undergo a comprehensive eye examination including wide-angle fundus photograph and ocular cohaerence tomography. A questionnaire assesses the characteristics (history: diabetes duration, type of treatment), knowledge and personal attitudes of the persons affected. The relevant lab findings were collected from the electronic files. Main focus of the study is the concordance to the national screening recommendations (last eye exam, presence of retinopathy).</brief_summary>
