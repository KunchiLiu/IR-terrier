	<brief_title>Tracking IUD Bleeding Experiences: An Evaluation of Bleeding Profiles in New Intrauterine Device Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New users of the intrauterine device (IUD) are most likely to discontinue use within the first six months after insertion. The most common reason for discontinuation of the copper IUD is symptoms related to bleeding. Research looking at disturbances in bleeding patterns among new IUD users is sparse and dated. Perceived changes in vaginal bleeding may impact method satisfaction, acceptability, and continuation. There is a need for updated research evaluating changes in bleeding patterns in order for providers to better counsel patients on what to expect during the months after initiation of an IUD. A variety of methods to evaluate bleeding profiles are available. The World Health Organization (WHO) published recommendations for methods of collection and analysis of bleeding patterns. The WHO method includes data collection on bleeding days (days when blood loss requires the use of a menstrual pad or tampon) and spotting days (when no protection was needed) using 90-day referent periods. A second tool, the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) has been shown to be an inexpensive and objective method of assessing blood loss. The PBAC takes into consideration how heavy blood flow is as well as the number of sanitary napkins and tampons used. Additionally, new technologies (including mobile period tracking applications) have made retrospective collection of bleeding data more feasible and prospective data collection more accurate. This study aims to incorporate these validated tools as well as new technology to examine changes in bleeding patterns among women who are initiating the copper T380A IUD.</detailed_description>
