	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the study is to develop and test a pilot intervention in central Mozambique to implement the new WHO "Option B+" guidelines that seek to increase the proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women in six antenatal care clinics who start antiretroviral therapy (ART) prior to delivery, and are retained in care after 90- days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early ART Initiation Among HIV-positive Pregnant Women in Central Mozambique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For over 10 years, services to prevent maternal to child HIV-1 transmission (PMTCT) have been scaled-up and integrated into antenatal care (ANC) in the national health system across Mozambique. In 2004, scale-up of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) also began in Mozambique and is now provided at hundreds of health units. In 2010, the World Health Organization developed new treatment guidelines, termed "Option B" that emphasized early initiation of ART in antenatal care for all HIV-positive pregnant women. In 2012, the WHO issued a programmatic update endorsing a third option termed "Option B+" in which HIV positive pregnant women initiate ART during pregnancy regardless of disease progression and continue treatment for life. The new "Option B+" approach has been adopted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mozambique and is in the early phases of implementation. As in many African settings, numerous health system factors present major challenges to successful adoption of the guidelines. In Mozambique, ANC and HIV testing coverage is high but there is substantial loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) at successive stages in the treatment cascade, limited counseling for women and many barriers to actively tracking those women lost to follow-up. Early Ministry of Health data suggests significant challenges remain for long-term adherence for women started on ART via the new Option B+ framework in Manica and Sofala provinces and throughout Mozambique. The successful implementation of new WHO guidelines therefore requires major streamlining of links among ANC, PMTCT, and ART services. The overall objective of this study is to develop and test a pilot intervention in central Mozambique to implement the new WHO guidelines, and increase the proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women in target ANC clinics who start ART prior to delivery, without reducing ART adherence in the first 3 months of therapy. The intervention will emphasize a WHO defined "Option B+" approach; HIV-positive mothers will be referred for ART at the time they receive a positive HIV test result in their first ANC visit. The project utilizes an innovative formative research process, which has already been completed, and a stepped wedge implementation science design to evaluate the intervention. The entire study is being conducted in close collaboration with the Center for Operations Research in Beira (known by its Portuguese acronym as CIOB) that is one of three research centers in Mozambique managed by the MOH National Institute of Health (the research arm of the MoH).</detailed_description>
