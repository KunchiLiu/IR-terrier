	<brief_title>Transdermal Patch CVD 1000: The Effect of Heat on Nicotine Release From Nicotine Patches in Adult Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is intended to determine the effect of heat on FDA-approved nicotine transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more nicotine being absorbed through the skin than without applying heat. This is important given that little is known about how the release of nicotine is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that are also available over the counter. This study will use nicotine patches (brand name and generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any placebos.</detailed_description>

Participation in any ongoing investigational drug trial or clinical drug trial 4. Abnormal Vital signs, defined as: Hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg) at rest on 2 separate days) Heart rate &lt;55 at rest on 2 separate days Respiratory rate &gt;20 5. Temperature &gt; 38.0 ºC (100.4 ºF) or symptoms of an acute selflimited illness such as an upper respiratory infection or gastroenteritis within 7 days of administration of the transdermal patch. 6. Active positive Hepatitis B, C, and HIV serologies 7. Positive urine drug screening test 8. Use of any prescription medication during the period 0 to 30 days or overthe counter medication (vitamin, herbal supplements and birth control medications not included) during the period 0 to 5 days before entry to the study 9. Donation or loss of greater than one pint of blood within 60 days of entry to the study 10. Any prior serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to nicotine or any of the inactive ingredients in the patch (acrylate adhesive, polyester, silicone, ethylene vinyl acetatecopolymer polyisobutylene and polyethylene) 11. Have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other major psychiatric diagnosis. 12. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product or medication) within 1 month before enrollment in this study or expects to receive an experimental agent during the study. 13. Any condition that would, in the opinion of the Medically Accountable Investigator (MAI), place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. 14. Inability to communicate or cooperate with the investigators 15. History of consumption of alcohol within 24 hours prior to dose administration 16. Scarring on upper arms, including tattoos at planned site of patch placement making skin reactions not evaluable 17. Subject who currently has any of the following conditions: 1. Thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders 2. A past history of deep vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders 3. Cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease (current or past history) 4. Valvular heart disease with complications 5. Severe hypertension 6. Diabetes with vascular involvement 7. Headaches with focal neurological symptoms 8. Major surgery with prolonged immobilization 18. Medical history of a serious chronic condition (e.g. allergic conditions such as anaphylaxis, asthma or generalized drug reaction). 19. Medical history of significant dermatologic diseases or conditions, such as atopy, psoriasis, vitiligo or conditions known to alter skin appearance or physiologic response (e.g. diabetes, porphyria). 20. History of significant dermatologic cancers (e.g. melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma), except basal cell carcinomas that were superficial and did not involve the investigative site. 21. Within 10 hours prior to dosing, use of other nicotine products (e.g. nicotine gum or other nicotinecontaining products) that would significantly influence or exaggerate responses to the nicotine patches used in this study. 22. Within 72 hours prior to dosing, use of antihistamines or use of topical drugs at patch site. 23. Subject has an obvious difference in skin color between arms or the presence of a skin condition, open sores, scar tissue, tattoo, or coloration that would interfere with placement of test articles, skin assessment, or reactions to drug.</criteria>
