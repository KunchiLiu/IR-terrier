	<brief_summary>An 8 week clinical study to evaluate the ability of an experimental dentifrice containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate and sodium fluoride to provide relief from dentine hypersensitivity compared to a marketed dentifrice containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate and sodium monofluorophosphate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Two Dentifrices for Dentine Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single centre, multi-site, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment, parallel group, non-inferiority design clinical study conducted in healthy subjects with self-reported and clinically diagnosed dentine hypersensitivity (DH). This study will compare the effectiveness of a test dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium fluoride to a commercially available dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium monofluorophosphate, in providing relief from DH after 4 and 8 weeks twice daily treatment.</detailed_description>
