	<brief_summary>Chronic lateral epicondylitis is usually managed conservatively. The purpose of this single-blinded, randomized, controlled study is to compare the clinical therapeutic effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in comparison with cryoultrasound (Cryo-US) therapy in chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE) during a period of 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ESWT vs Cryo-US Therapy in the Treatment of Chronic Lateral Epicondylitis: One Year Follow up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty participants with chronic LE were randomly assigned to receive 3 ESWT sessions at 48/72-hours intervals -2400 impulses at energy flux density 0.14-0.20 mJ/mm2 at each session- (ESWT Group, n=40) or 12 Cryo-US therapy sessions (4 daily sessions per week) in a continuous modality at 1.8 Watt/cm2 and -2ËšC at each session- (Cryo-US Group, n=40). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and satisfactory results, considered as the sum of the excellent and good scores in the Roles and Maudsley score, were used as outcome measures at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
