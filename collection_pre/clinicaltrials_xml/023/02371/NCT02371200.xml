	<brief_title>Detecting Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures With a Seizure Detection and Warning System in Epilepsy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study "A Pivotal, Phase III Trial of Detecting generalized tonic-clonic seizures with a Seizure Detection and Warning System in Epilepsy Patients " is a phase III, pivotal, prospective study of an electromyography (EMG) based seizure detection and warning system (tentatively named Brain Sentinelâ„¢ Seizure Detection System) for detecting generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. The detection device is worn on the bicep brachii muscles and is intended to alert a remote caregiver of a GTC seizure and provide a record of GTC seizure activity. This is to facilitate a faster intervention to the GTC seizure, and to more accurately document GTC seizure frequency in a home, skilled nursing, or inpatient setting.</detailed_description>

Has not had a GTC seizure within the last year AND is not expected to have a reduction of antiepileptic drugs during their hospital admission. 3. Intracranial EEG electrodes are being used 4. The subject's upper arm circumference not adequate for proper fit of the EMG monitor (less than 14cm). 5. Pregnant female. 6. Subject/Caregiver is unable to provide consent.</criteria>
