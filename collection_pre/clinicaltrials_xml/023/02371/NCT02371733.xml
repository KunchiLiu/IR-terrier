	<brief_summary>Decreased exercise capacity, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life and increased dyspnea and fatigue perception is prevalent in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. It was demonstrated exercise training has beneficial effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, no study investigated the effects of upper extremity aerobic exercise training, therefore effects of upper extremity aerobic exercise training on outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients were diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension according to the Task Force for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension of f the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS). Primary outcome measurement was exercise capacity, secondary outcomes were respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, physical activity, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea and depression.</detailed_description>
