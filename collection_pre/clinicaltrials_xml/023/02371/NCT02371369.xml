	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3 clinical study, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational drug PLX3397 in the treatment of tumour of pigmented villonodular synovitis or giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath in subjects, for whom surgical removal of the tumour would cause more harm than good. The main purpose of this study is to gather information about the investigational drug PLX3397, which may help to treat these tumours. The study consists of two parts. In Part 1, eligible study participants will be assigned to receive either PLX3397 or matching placebo for 24 weeks. A number of assessments will be carried out during the course of the study, including physical examinations, blood tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. MRI scans will be used to evaluate the response of the tumour to the treatment which will be independently assessed by central readers blinded to the treatment assignment. Those subjects, whether assigned to PLX3397 or matching placebo, who have completed Part 1 (i.e, complete 24 weeks of dosing and the Week 25 assessments) will be eligible to advance to Part 2, a long-term treatment phase in which all subjects will receive open-label PLX3397</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years. A diagnosis of PVNS or GCTTS (i) that has been histologically confirmed either by a pathologist at the treating institution or a central pathologist, and (ii) where surgical resection would be associated with potentially worsening functional limitation or severe morbidity (locally advanced disease), with morbidity determined consensually by qualified personnel (eg, two surgeons or a multidisciplinary tumor board). Measurable disease of at least 2 cm and otherwise based on RECIST 1.1, assessed from MRI scans by a central radiologist. Symptomatic disease Stable analgesic regimen during the 2 weeks prior to randomization. During the week prior to randomization, at least 4 days of BPI Worst Pain NRS items and Worst Stiffness NRS items completed correctly. Males and females of childbearing potential are permitted in the study as long as they consent to avoid getting their partner pregnant or becoming pregnant, respectively, by using a highly effective contraception method, as described below, throughout the study and for up to 90 days after completion. Highly effective methods of contraception include: hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device; surgical sterilization (including partner's vasectomy) or sexual abstinence. Women of nonchildbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥1 year. Women who have documentation of at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and have an follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 milliinternational units per milliliter (mIU/mL) will be considered postmenopausal. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function, defined by: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Ratio between the concentrations of the enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in the blood (AST/ALT) ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL • Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN Platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L • Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN Willingness and ability to complete the BPI Worst Pain NRS item, Worst Stiffness NRS item, PROMIS Physical Function Scale, and other selfassessment instruments throughout the study. Willingness and ability to use an electronic diary. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures and to comply with all study requirements. Investigational drug use within 28 days of randomization. Previous use of PLX3397 or any biologic treatment targeting Colony Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1) or the Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R); previous use of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors, eg, imatinib or nilotinib, are allowed. Active cancer (either concurrent or within the last year of starting study treatment) that requires nonsurgical therapy (eg, chemotherapy or radiation therapy), with the exception of PVNS/GCTTS, surgically treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma insitu, or carcinoma insitu of the cervix. Prostate and breast cancer in remission (not receiving active therapy) for &gt; 5 years will be allowed. Known metastatic PVNS/GCTTS. Active or chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus or known active or chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Known active tuberculosis. Significant concomitant arthropathy in the affected joint, serious illness, uncontrolled infection, or a medical or psychiatric history that, in the investigator's opinion, would likely interfere with the person's study participation or the interpretation of his or her results. Women who are breastfeeding. A screening Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) ≥ 450 ms (men) or ≥ 470 ms (women). MRI contraindications.</criteria>
