	<brief_title>Unilateral Meniere Disease: Can Double Dose Gadolinium and Delayed Imaging Make the Diagnosis?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meniere's disease (MD) is a medical condition causing attacks of vertigo, ringing in the ears, hearing loss and often a fullness in the ear. Currently there is no definitive test to diagnose the problem. It is believed to be caused by inner ear abnormalities, specifically of an over-collection of lymphatic fluid.The goal of this trial is to determine if an MRI with double dose of IV gadolinium can be diagnostic.</detailed_description>
