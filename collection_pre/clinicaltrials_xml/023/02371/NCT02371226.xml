Negative pregnancy test (females) Must not have received ERT for at least 6 weeks prior to AGT181 treatment Must have elevated urinary GAGs if no ERT has been received in the prior 3 months Refusal to complete baseline evaluations. Any medical condition or other circumstances that may significantly interfere with study compliance Receipt of an investigational drug within the prior 90 days History of diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia Clinically significant spinal cord compression, evidence of cervical instability. Known hypersensitivity to alphaLiduronidase or any of the components of AGT181. Known to be nonresponsive to standard ERT treatment. Previously successful (engrafted) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that resulted in normalization of urinary GAGs. Contraindication for lumbar puncture</criteria>
