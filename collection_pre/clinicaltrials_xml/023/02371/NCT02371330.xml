	<brief_summary>This is a prospective longitudinal study that evaluates Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100) CT-ADPs (closure time-ADP) and incidence of bleeding using the Neonatal Bleeding Assessment Tool - Neo-BAT in preterm neonates &lt;32 weeks gestational age or with a birth weight &lt;1500 grams and with different degrees of thrombocytopenia. The investigators hypothesized that PFA-100 CT-ADP, a global in vitro test of primary hemostasis, will be a better predictor of clinical bleeding in neonates than platelet count alone. A bleeding risk assessment marker could help physicians more accurately determine the risk/benefit ratio of platelet transfusions, guiding platelet transfusion decisions in neonates with thrombocytopenia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>&lt;32 weeks gestation or with a birth weight &lt;1500 grams; Have confirmed moderatetosevere thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count &lt;100x109/L; Have a parent/guardian willing to comply with the protocol and provide written informed consent. Are not expected to survive by the Attending Neonatologist; Are thought to have a congenital thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, based on family history or clinical presentation (e.g. associated congenital malformations, platelet morphology); Have a major chromosomal anomaly such as Trisomy 13, 18, or 21.</criteria>
