	<brief_title>Social Networking on Mobile Phone to Improve Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Health Education Intervention with Social Networking (HISONET) is a open-label randomized controlled trial. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of social networking media on mobile phone intervention in antenatal care (ANC) group-health education compared with usual ANC health education. The incidence of preterm delivery and major neonatal morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome, stillbirth and perinatal mortality in women delivering from 28 to 36 weeks' gestation are significant outcomes in a randomized prospective design. Preterm delivery occurs in approximately 9.6% as global incidence, and about 11.1% in South-Eastern Asia. Forty-four percent of child under 5 years died in neonatal period. Preterm birth is one of the three leading causes of neonatal death which 15% died from preterm birth complications such as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing entercolitis, and sepsis. Recent studies demonstrate that Short Message Service (SMS) on mobile phone intervention in antenatal care can increase numbers of ANC attendance to WHO recommendation of four or more visits and decrease in perinatal mortality. Social networking on mobile phone has been increasingly used in daily life of both healthcare personnel and women who attend ANC clinic. However, there is lack of evidence that demonstrates the effect of social networking on mobile phone to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. LINE, a mobile application, is a popular one of many social networking applications. So, health education through LINE of antenatal women about serious complications such as labor pain, bleeding, water breaking and fewer fetal movement during pregnancy may encourage them to come to the hospital as early as possible. Early diagnosis of premature labor provides early management and better maternal and neonatal outcomes. So, a randomized controlled trial should be conducted to answer these questions.</detailed_description>
