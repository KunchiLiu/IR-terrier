	<brief_summary>This study is a post-authorization commitment to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The study serves to determine whether the treatment of patients with stable, symptomatic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the investigational drug NVA237 is efficient and safe. The efficacy and safety of the drug will be tested for twice daily dosing against once daily dosing. The primary criterion to assess efficacy will be the trough FEV1 (defined as mean evaluation at 23 h 15 min and 23 h 45 min post dose) measurements of patients who have been treated for 12 weeks with NVA237 b.i.d versus those that have received NVA237 o.d.for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
