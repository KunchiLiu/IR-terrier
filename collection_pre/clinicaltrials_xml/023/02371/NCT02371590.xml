	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab for Previously Untreated CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is phase 1/2 study for patients with CLL or (SLL) who have not been previously treated. The primary endpoint is to determine safety and tolerability of the regimen and determine complete response (CR) to therapy. The secondary endpoints will assess the impact of treatment on progression free and overall survival Eligible patients will receive obinutuzumab for 6 x 28 day cycles. Patients will also receive lenalidomide orally once daily on days 8-28 of each 28 day cycles. The starting dose for all patients is 5 mg PO daily. At the start of each cycle, there is intra-patient dose-escalation to a maximum of 25mg daily, as tolerated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main 1. Clinical and phenotypic verification of B cell CLL or SLL and measurable disease. 2. Prior therapy: no prior CLL therapy. 3. Patients must have progressive disease based on 2008 iwCLL definition with one of the following: Symptomatic or progressive splenomegaly Symptomatic lymph nodes, nodal clusters, or progressive lymphadenopathy Progressive anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL) Progressive thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 100 x 109/L) Weight loss &gt; 10% body weight over the preceding 6 month period Fatigue attributable to CLL Fever or night sweats for &gt; 2 weeks without evidence of infection Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of &gt; 50% over a 2month period or an anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months. Able to take aspirin (81mg or 325mg) daily, warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or equivalent anticoagulation as prophylactic medication. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of REMS. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours prior to starting Revlimid and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control. Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS program. ECOG performance status of 02. Adequate hematologic function Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function Pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. Women for childbearing age must obtain a pregnancy test and pregnant or breast feeding females are excluded. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or lenalidomide (if applicable), including development of erythema nodosum or a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. Deep vein thrombosis or superficial thrombophlebitis of any cause on current anticoagulation therapy at the time of screening. Patients who are currently receiving another investigational agent are excluded. Current infection requiring parenteral antibiotics. Known seropositive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); or known active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) based on detectable viral load. Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine or passive immunization by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are eligible. Active malignancy within the previous 2 years (other than completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ). Known central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy. Untreated autoimmunity such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or immune thrombocytopenia. Insufficient recovery from surgicalrelated trauma or wound healing. Impaired cardiac function</criteria>
