	<brief_summary>Asthma in the elderly is poorly understood, as most studies have not included this patient group. In a previous study of adults with asthma, choline supplementation had a positive effect on asthma symptoms and allowed to decrease asthma pharmacologic treatment. The present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of choline supplementation. The investigators will study the effect of choline 650 mg taken orally twice daily x 6 weeks versus placebo on asthma symptom scores (Asthma Control Test) and spirometric values (FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75%). The investigators will also look at the effect of choline supplementation on peripheral blood eosinophils, serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and homocysteine levels.</brief_summary>
