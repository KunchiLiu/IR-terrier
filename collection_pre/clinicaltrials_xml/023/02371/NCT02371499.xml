	<brief_title>Effect of Lactobacillus Casei DG (Enterolactis Plus®) in Patient With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to collect data for the assessment of the Lactobacillus casei DG (Enterolactis plus®) effect on overall abdominal pain/discomfort, symptoms and gut microbiota composition in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The investigators suppose that, due to the immunomodulatory action of probiotics, overall abdominal pain/discomfort and symptoms will improve, fecal Immunoglobulin A levels will change, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels will decrease and the production of regulatory cytokines as Interleukin 10 will improve following consumption of Lactobacillus casei DG (Enterolactis plus®).</detailed_description>
