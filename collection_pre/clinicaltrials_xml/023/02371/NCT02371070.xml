	<brief_summary>The investigators study aims to test the correlation between the Hemochron Signature point-of-care testing (POCT) device (ITC, USA) and low plasma levels of all three currently approved direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC; rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran) and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POCT to rule out or detect relevant levels of DOAC in real-life stroke patients.</brief_summary>
