	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effect of denosumab on lumbar spine bone mineral density(BMD) Z-score at 12 months, as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), inchildren 2 to 17 years of age with osteogenesis imperfecta.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of OI defined as a clinical history consistent with type IIV OI Clinical severity of OI as defined by 2 or more prevalent vertebral compression fractures; OR1 prevalent vertebral compression fracture and 1 or more nonvertebral fractures within the previous 2 years; OR 3 or more fractures within the previous 2 years. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the requirements for frequent calcium and phosphorus monitoring for 14 days after the first dose of denosumab (only applies to the first 5 subjects age 11 to17 enrolled in the study and the first 5 subjects of any age meeting the criteria for increased bone turnover Currently unhealed fracture or osteotomy as defined by orthopedic opinion Osteotomy within 5 months of screening Evidence of untreated oral cavities or oral infections Recent or planned invasive dental procedure Surgical tooth extraction which has not healed by screening History of an electrophoresis pattern inconsistent with type I to IV OI History of genetic testing results inconsistent with type I to IV OI Abnormalities of the following per central laboratory reference ranges at screening: Serum albumin corrected calcium &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN) Serum vitamin D &lt; 20 ng/mL; rescreening for Vitamin D level &lt; 20 ng/mL will be allowed, after adequate supplementation Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin (TBL) &gt; 1.5 x ULN (subjects with Gilbert syndrome are eligible) Serum phosphorus &lt; LLN Serum alkaline phosphatase &gt; 20% above the ULN or &gt; 20% below the LLN Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated bythe Schwartz equation at screening) Evidence of any of the following: Current hyperthyroidism (unless wellcontrolled on stable antithyroid therapy) Current clinical hypothyroidism (unless wellcontrolled on stable thyroid replacement therapy) History of hyperparathyroidism Current hypoparathyroidism Current, uncontrolled hypercalcemia (albumincorrected serum Ca &gt;10% ULN) History of osteomalacia or rickets (chart review) Other bone diseases that affect bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, hypophosphatasia) History of autoimmune disease History of rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance Positive blood screen for human immunodeficiency virus 1 or 2 antibody Positive blood screen for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody Received other osteoporosis treatment or bone active treatment with the following guidelines: Prior treatment with § denosumab § fluoride or strontium for bone disease § parathyroid hormone (PTH) or PTH derivatives within 12 months prior to screening § zoledronic acid within 6 months prior to screening § oral bisphosphonates or intravenous bisphosphonates other than zoledronic acid if the first dose of denosumab would be before their next scheduled bisphosphonate dose would have been given Administration of systemic glucocorticoids (≥ 5.0 mg prednisone equivalents/day for more than 10 days) within 3 months of screening. Topical and inhaled glucocorticoids will be allowed Administration of any of the following treatment within 3 months of screening: § Growth hormone (subjects on stable dose of growth hormone for at least 3 months prior to screening will be allowed) Currently receiving treatment in another investigational drug study, or less than 30 days since ending treatment on another investigational drugstudy(s), or current or planned participation in a clinical trial that would preclude compliance with study requirements Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
