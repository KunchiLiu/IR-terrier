	<brief_title>Coagulopathy and SIRS During ECC in Intensive Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The complex interplay between the various factors contributing to the ECC-related coagulopathy and inflammation in intensive care settings is only poorly understood so far. Furthermore, it is unclear, how coagulopathy and inflammation shall be monitored and which anticoagulants may be employed to decrease complications associated with specific ECC systems. Therefore, the use of laboratory analyses, anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapy varies between different ECC systems and intensive care units. A better understanding of the mechanisms of the activation and interaction of platelets and leukocytes, plasmatic coagulation, complement, cytokines and endothelium will highlight starting-points to increase the safety and efficacy of ECC in intensive care medicine. The investigation of these phenomena in different ECC systems under clinical conditions is therefore the goal of this study. In order to achieve the study goal, we will investigate cellular and plasmatic activation markers as well as proteins involved in coagulation and inflammation in patients being connected to different ECC systems under intensive care conditions.</detailed_description>
