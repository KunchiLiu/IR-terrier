	<brief_summary>From a rehabilitation point of view, while several approaches exist to retrain runners with PFPS, it is not clear which one is most effective, or why. The goals of this randomised-controlled trial are: 1) to compare the effectiveness of three rehabilitation programs on pain and functional limitations of runners with PFPS and 2) to explain why the programs are effective or not based on laboratory analyses. After baseline evaluation, runners will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, each with a specific 8-week rehabilitation program aimed at addressing the efficiency of a specific type of retraining. These groups are: 1) Control; 2) muscle recruitment; 3) reducing knee loading during running. The investigators hypothesis is that the intervention targeting a reduction in knee loading will be significantly more effective in reducing symptoms and improving function of runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis will be tested using symptoms and functional status questionnaires. In addition, mechanistic analyses will be conducted using a running assessment using an instrumented treadmill and kinematics analyses.</detailed_description>
