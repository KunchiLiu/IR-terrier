	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acid in Reducing Cancer-Related Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect preliminary statistical data (mean changes and standard deviations) on two omega-3 supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to placebo for reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in fatigued breast cancer survivors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the adherence and adverse events for the two omega-3 supplementation regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to placebo. II. To collect preliminary statistical data (mean changes and standard deviations) on two omega-3 supplementation regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to placebo for reducing inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in fatigued breast cancer survivors. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the effects of the two omega-3 supplement regimens on serum fatty acid levels compared to placebo. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. ARM I: Patients receive low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and placebo PO BID for 6 weeks. ARM II: Patients receive high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation PO BID for 6 weeks. ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
