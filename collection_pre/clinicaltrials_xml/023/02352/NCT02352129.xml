	<brief_summary>: Fibrosis, in general, is a scarring process, which is characterized by fibroblast accumulation and excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which leads to distorted organ architecture and function. The contribution of fibrogenesis to impaired cardiac function is increasingly recognized. The fibrotic ECM causes increased stiffness and induces pathological signaling within cardiomyocytes resulting in progressive cardiac failure. Also, the excessive ECM impairs mechano-electric coupling of cardiomyocytes and increases the risk of arrhythmias. But today patient treatment and prognosis is based on ejection fraction quantification, QRS duration, and symptoms. Hypothesis: the increased level of fibrosis quantified using T1 mapping technique, compared with normal value, is of prognostic value in patient with dilated cardiomyopathies under optimal treatment. Methods: 330 patients are planned to be included and followed for 2 years</brief_summary>
