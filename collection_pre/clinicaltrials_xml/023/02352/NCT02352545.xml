	<brief_summary>Cough is a common symptom of respiratory medicine clinic patients, which has complex etiology and wide-ranging. Cough is usually divided into three categories by time: acute cough, subacute cough and chronic cough. Subacute has a 3~8 weeks course of disease. Its main etiology is postinfectious cough, which is mostly secondary to viral infection.Considering its overexpression in postinfectious patient, Cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLTs) plays a role in gathering eosinophils to respiratory. The level of FENO has a significant correlation with inflammatory airway eosinophils. While CysLTs overexpressed in vivo, the level of FENO may increase. Montelukast, as CysLTs-receptor-1 antagonistsï¼Œ plays a role of controlling airway inflammation and decrease airway high activity by suppressing the biological activity of CysLTs. It is effective in theory to therapy sub-acute cough by Montelukast, to short the course and to relieve cough symptoms as soon as possible. The aim is to research whether FENO can be used as a biomarker to optimized treatment regimen of sub-acute cough.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients in electrical treatment arm were given Montelukast Sodium Tablets (p.o., 10mg, q.d.) . Patients in placebo treatment arm were given placebo tablets(main excipient lactose monohydrate,p.o., 10mg, q.d.).All treatment regimens lasted for 10 days and no other antitussive/decongestant or bronchodilators are given to any patients.</detailed_description>
