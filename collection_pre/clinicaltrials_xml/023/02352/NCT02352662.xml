	<brief_summary>This prospective study will aim to globally assess the coagulopathy induced during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in a large pediatric population. The investigators primary objective will be the understanding of CPB-induced coagulopathy based on demographic and surgical characteristics, and coagulation assays. Secondary objective will aim at determining the relationship between coagulation assays, postoperative blood loss, and transfusion requirements. The ultimate goal will be to design an algorithm using point-of-care monitoring that could be used to guide hemostatic therapies in neonates and children undergoing cardiac surgery.To do this, investigators will examine the coagulation in the laboratory based setting.</brief_summary>
