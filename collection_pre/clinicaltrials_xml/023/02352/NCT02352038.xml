	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in patients with periodontitis during orthodontic-periodontal treatment for 12 months on the following aspects: (1) Effects on periodontal status; (2) Effects on alveolar bone remodeling; (3) Effects on cervical dentin sensitivity; (4) Effects on pain and quality of life. To eliminate any bias, the investigators will initially hypothesize that there is no difference in periodontal status, jawbone remodeling, tooth sensitivity, pain and quality of life in patients having teeth with chronic periodontitis and receiving LLLT with orthodontic treatment versus teeth undergoing orthodontic treatment without incorporation of LLLT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of a Novel Laser-aided Orthodontic-periodontal Treatment Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On the basis of the investigators' pilot study results, 35 patients with chronic periodontitis will be recruited and initially treated for inflammation. Using a randomized split-mouth design,the teeth in experimental (laser) group will receive LLLT while the teeth in the control (placebo) group will receive no laser treatment. The effects of LLLT in orthodontic-periodontal treatment on periodontal inflammation control, jawbone remodeling, reduction of tooth sensitivity, pain relief and quality of life will be investigated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Systemically health (with special regard to disease affecting tissue repair); 2. No medications required for periodontal therapy and no use of any antibiotic and/or antiinflammatory medication in the preceding month; 3. Chronic periodontitis with at least two pairs (clinically matched) displaced singlerooted teeth (each pair of teeth is in the same arch but in two contralateral hemiarches respectively belonging to the same tooth typology) having at least one site probing depth of 5 mm or more, interproximal attachment loss of 3 mm or more, and radiographic signs of alveolar bone loss. 4. Periodontal status confirmed by periodontal evaluation remains stable for at least 6 months after complete periodontal treatment. 1. smoking; 2. pregnancy; 3. under orthodontic treatment.</criteria>
