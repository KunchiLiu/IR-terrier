	<brief_title>Airway Inflammation in Children With Allergic Rhinitis and Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type of study : This is a prospective randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study , to clarity whether treating upper airway with intranasal corticosteroids in children with allergic rhinitis may bring favors in reducing elevated lower airway inflammation，improving airway reactivity and airway resistance. Methods : The children with allergic rhinitis accompanied lower airway inflammation such as elevated percentage of eosinophil in induced sputums and/or higher level of fractional exhaled nitric oxide(FeNO) are recruited.By using a random digit table, eligible subjects were randomized into one of two groups,to receive budesonide nasal spray (BUD group) or nasal placebo(placebo group), 1 spray/nostril, 2 times/day, for three consecutive months observation. The following measurements were performed: skin prick test (SPT), peripheral blood cells five-classification test, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE of common inhalant allergens testing, nasal lavage and inflammatory cells classification ，pulmonary function test, bronchial provocation test，airway resistance measured by impulse oscillation technique. Meanwhile,history of all subjects were collected, visual analogue scale，rhinitis symptoms scores and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) scores were evaluated. Symptom scores and laboratory examinations are performed at baseline,4 w,8w and 12 w after treatment.</detailed_description>
