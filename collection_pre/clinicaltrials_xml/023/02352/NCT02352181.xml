	<brief_summary>In current practice, management of coagulation during liver transplantation is performed either through standard coagulation status or with ROTEM速 depending on practitioner choice and availability of materials. In this context, the ROTEM速 is used since over 2 years by anesthesiologists in the digestive surgery department of the Croix Rousse hospital in Lyon, France. Indeed liver transplantation surgery is at high risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy developed by patients who are eligible, due to coagulation factor synthesis deficiencies in the cirrhotic liver. On the other hand the standard coagulation profile is a poor reflection of coagulopathy in such patients because the imbalance between pro- and anti-coagulant factors are not taken into account by PT and aPTT measures. Management of intraoperative hemorrhage may be facilitated by the ROTEM速 which is performed from whole blood and which allows the detection of abnormalities in the balance between pro- and anti-coagulant factors. This technique was already evaluated in liver, cardiac, and obstetric surgery but also in traumatology. Randomized trials in liver transplantation surgery have shown changes in transfusion practices but did not focus on the consequences of such changes.</brief_summary>
