	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase III, randomised, open label, multi-centre study assessing the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 versus Standard of Care in NSCLC patients with PD-L1 positive tumours and the combination of MEDI4736 plus tremelimumab (MEDI4736+treme) versus Standard of Care in NSCLC patients with PD-L1-negative tumours in the treatment of male and female patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB-IV), who have received at least 2 prior systemic treatment regimens including 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC. Patients with known EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase (TK) activating mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements are not eligible for the study (prospective testing is not planned within this study). The Standard of Care options are: an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib [TARCEVA®]), gemcitabine or vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Global Study to Assess the Effects of MEDI4736, Given as Monotherapy or in Combination With Tremelimumab Determined by PD-L1 Expression Versus Standard of Care in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study has an umbrella design with 2 sub-studies in: sub-study A (randomizing patients with PD-L1 positive tumours 1:1 into MEDI4736 vs. Standard of Care) and sub-study B (randomizing patients with PD-L1 negative tumours 2:3:1:2 into MEDI4736 vs. MEDI4736 plus tremelimumab vs. tremelimumab vs. Standard of Care. Two substudies may have different duration of recruitment period due difference in patients population (PD-L1 expression). They may not run concurrently with start and completion of recruitment potentially occuring at different time points.</detailed_description>
