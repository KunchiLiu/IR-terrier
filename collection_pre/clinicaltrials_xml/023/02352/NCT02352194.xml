	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the physical capacity of patients with multiple sclerosis and the effects of rehabilitation, encompassing physical therapy and physical activity as it is carried out in the day hospital of (the Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine department) at Garches Hospital. We will compare the results of assessments carried out before and after a standard rehabilitation program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Capacity and Rehabilitation of Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center, retrospective and prospective study. In order to assess the efficiency of the of usual rehabilitation proposed to patients in the day hospital, assessments are systematically performed before and after the rehabilitation program: 1. Assessment of muscular strength and fatigue: Assessments of voluntary force will be those usually performed in the context of the evaluation of patients. The isokinetic dynamometer CON-TREX ® is a device that provides a quantified result of the torque developed in a predetermined joint area with a constant speed which is also defined in advance. The assessment includes an assessment of the strength in isometric contraction (at 40 and 90 degrees of knee flexion) and concentric contraction (30, 60 and 90 degrees per second). Fatigue is evaluated by two self-administered questionnaires: the Fatigue Severity Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. 2. Effort test: The aerobic capacity of patients will be assessed by a triangular maximal exercise test. The effort test is performed on a cycle ergometer from a triangular incremental exercise. Beforehand, blood pressure and ECG are recorded to establish that the patient can safely achieve a gradual stress test. Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen consumption, the feeling (Borg scale) and ECG are recorded immediately before and immediately after the end of the test and every minute for at least 5-10 minutes during the recovery phase. 3. Clinical assessment: The Timed Up and Go test will be used to assess the patient's capacity of postural transition. This is a timed quantitative assessment of the duration needed to change from sitting in a chair, get up and walk three meters, make a U-turn and come back to sit down. The 10 meters test quantifies the walking speed of patients (meters / second) over 10 meters A test of ascending and descending10 stairs is also performed, as well as the 6 minutes walking test. In addition to these functional assessments, clinical tests are conventionally performed such as the measurement of muscle strength (Medical Research Council scale), range of motion, spasticity (modified Ashworth scale) and an assessment of the balance and posture. The SEP-59 questionnaire will be used to assess the patients quality of life.</detailed_description>
