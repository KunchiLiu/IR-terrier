	<brief_title>Percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation for Unresectable Hepatic Carcinoma in Poor Liver Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and a large proportion of patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic reserve(cirrhosis) which directly lead a poor liver function. Direct ablative treatments include radiofrequency ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible electroporation had been used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients. At the same time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation technology, can induce tissue necross by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical energy. The technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation of vital structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete ablation with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.</detailed_description>
