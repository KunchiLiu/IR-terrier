	<brief_summary>Lysine analogs, like tranexamic acid (TXA) or epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA), are antifibrinolytic agents routinely administered in children undergoing different surgeries associated with a high bleeding risk (e.g. cardiac, craniofacial, and orthopedic surgeries). Although there is a growing literature regarding the pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs in children, the plasmatic concentration required to completely inhibit fibrinolysis remains to be determined. In this in vitro study, the investigators will use an experimental model of fibrinolysis designed for rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) to determine the minimal concentration inhibiting fibrinolysis for both TXA and EACA. In addition, this study will be used to create and validate a new experimental assay to measure fibrinolysis and the effect of antifibrinolytic agents.</brief_summary>
