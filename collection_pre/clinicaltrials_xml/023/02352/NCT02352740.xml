	<brief_title>Characterization of the Metabolic Fate of an Oral Arginine Form</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized crossover study including 16 healthy subjects with risk factors for metabolic syndrome and 16 healthy control subjects. According a double crossover design, each subject received two oral forms of L-arginine (A and B) in random order, and participated in a exploration day on the first day of arginine administration and after one week of supplementation with this arginine form. The two weeks of arginine supplementation were separated by a washout period of 2 weeks at least. Each exploration extended over 24 hours after administration of the first arginine dose. Blood tests were performed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 h after administration of the first dose. During explorations after the supplementation period, we also collected urine (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 h after the first dose).</detailed_description>
