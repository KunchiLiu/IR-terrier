	<brief_summary>The objectives are to test the acute effects of different cereals containing pulse ingredients on: 1) aerobic endurance and substrate oxidation during exercise 2) response of blood glucose, insulin and appetite to an aerobic exercise session, and 3) food intake two hours following the exercise session. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of cereals containing pulse ingredients 60 minutes before exercise will increase aerobic endurance (lower oxygen consumption), decrease carbohydrate oxidation (greater respiratory quotient), and a reduction in lactate production during compared to the same exercise session following the ingestion of a non-pulse food. The investigators also hypothesize that consumption of cereals containing pulse ingredients will lead to lower blood glucose, insulin, appetite and food intake, suggesting lower calorie compensation, following a 60-minute aerobic exercise session compared to the same exercise session following the ingestion of a non-pulse food.</brief_summary>
