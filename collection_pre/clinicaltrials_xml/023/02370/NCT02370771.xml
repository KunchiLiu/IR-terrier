	<brief_summary>Hand osteoarthritis is a common phenotype of osteoarthritis which affects about 70 % of the elderly population. Usually considered as a minor illness, it nevertheless leads to an important functional impairment. The mechanism of this disease is still poorly known. Furthermore there are 2 different subtypes : erosive and non erosive hand osteoarthritis from which mechanisms may differ. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study recruiting patients with hand osteoarthritis addressed in consultation of rheumatology and plastic surgery in Rouen University Hospital. Two groups of patients will be studied: 20 patients with non erosive subtype of hand osteoarthritis and 20 patients with erosive subtype of hand osteoarthritis. A clinical evaluation of hand osteoarthritis will be performed. Blood sample for proteomic analysis will be taken. Hand MRI and Bone Mineral Analyser will be performed.</brief_summary>
