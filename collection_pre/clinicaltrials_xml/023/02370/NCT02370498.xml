	<brief_summary>This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for participants with tumors that show positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.</brief_summary>
