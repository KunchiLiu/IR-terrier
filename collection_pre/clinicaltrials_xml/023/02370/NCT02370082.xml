	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the SAVI SCOUT® Surgical Guidance System (SAVI SCOUT). The SAVI SCOUT is a medical device, used to provide real-time guidance during localized excisional biopsy or lumpectomy procedures, by helping the surgeon locate and remove the desired tissue (i.e., the lesion and surrounding normal tissue). The SAVI SCOUT has been 510K cleared. The SAVI SCOUT is intended to assist surgeons in the location and retrieval of a non-palpable abnormality as localized by radiographic or ultrasound methods. In this study, the ability of the SAVI SCOUT to guide surgeons to find a lesion will be evaluated instead of the standard technique of wire localization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SAVI SCOUT Clinical Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using radiography or ultrasound guidance, the SAVI SCOUT reflector will be placed percutaneously up to 7 days prior to the scheduled excisional procedure. During surgical excision, the SAVI SCOUT system will be used to locate the reflector, which will be removed along with the surrounding breast tissue. Final data analysis will be completed within 1 month after the last patient is treated. Final assessment of the surgical results will be completed by the surgeon during a routine follow-up visit within 1 month following the surgical excision or lumpectomy procedure. Main Objective: to show that the SAVI SCOUT technique can be used to safely and effectively locate a non-palpable breast lesion during a localized excisional biopsy or lumpectomy procedure. Up to 10 sites and 150 patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
