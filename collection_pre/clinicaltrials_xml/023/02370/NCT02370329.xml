	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies P1101 (polyethyleneglycol [PEG]-proline-interferon alpha-2b) in treating patients with myelofibrosis. PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b is a substance that can improve the body's natural response and may slow the growth of myelofibrosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate for clinical response (complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], or clinical improvement [CI]) as defined by International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria in a cohort of intermediate-2/high risk myelofibrosis (MF) patients. Response in a second cohort of early stage MF patients will also be described. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the adverse event profile of P1101 in patients with myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs intermediate-2/high risk). II. To evaluate the tolerability of P1101 in patients with myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs intermediate-2/high risk). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) with P1101 for patients with myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs intermediate-2/high risk). II. To evaluate the impact of P1101 on bone marrow and histological features of myelofibrosis including cytogenetics, blast percentage, fibrosis, and JAK2-V617F allele burden by cohort (early vs intermediate-2/high risk). OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
