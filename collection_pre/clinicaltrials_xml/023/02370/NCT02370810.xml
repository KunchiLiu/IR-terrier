	<brief_title>A CBT-based Internet Intervention for Adults With Tinnitus in the United Kingdom</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Tinnitus is one of the most distressing disabilities and innovative ways of managing the related health care burden is required. A cognitive behavioural therapy (CTB) based internet intervention (iCBT) has been developed in Europe to improve access to tinnitus treatments. This study aims to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of iCBT in reducing the impact associated with tinnitus in the United Kingdom (UK). It furthermore, aims to establish for which subgroups of tinnitus suffers this iCBT intervention would be a suitable intervention. Design A two-armed Randomized Control Trial (RCT), with a one year follow-up design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness iCBT on tinnitus distress Setting: This will be an internet-based study for adults with tinnitus living in the UK Participants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of 3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 70 participants will be recruited for each group and will be randomly assigned using a computer generated randomization schedule by an independent research assistant after being pre-stratified for age and tinnitus severity. Intervention: The intervention offered is a CTB-based internet intervention, providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday life. It is 8 week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and assignments given to practice techniques learnt. Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcome measures are the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory- Screening version and self-reported measures for insomnia, hearing disability, cognitive functioning, hyperacusis, anxiety and depression and quality of life. Hypothesis: If this intervention proves feasible it is and effective, it may have implications for the way tinnitus suffers are managed in the UK. It may be that a subset of tinnitus suffers can be managed though an e-learning treatment program, freeing up services for those with more severe problems that need face to face treatment.</detailed_description>
