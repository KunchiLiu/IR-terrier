	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies a type of ultrasound called robot-assisted laparoscopic high-intensity focused ultrasound for performing thermal ablative therapy, or sound wave therapy, in treating patients with small kidney masses undergoing partial removal of the kidney. The robot-assisted ultrasound probe takes images of the kidney to help doctors locate the mass. The probe then uses high frequency sound waves to target and ablate (or destroy) the kidney mass, which may be a cancerous tumor or benign tissue. Surgery is then performed to remove the part of the kidney with the mass. Robot-assisted laparoscopic high-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal ablative therapy may be safer and help doctors see the tumor better when performing kidney surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of localized primary renal cancer to evaluate histological accuracy in successful ablation of the small renal mass, matched with intraoperative targeting. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of laparoscopic HIFU for patients with primary renal cancer. II. To evaluate the technical success of laparoscopic HIFU ablation. OUTLINE: Patients undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic HIFU thermal ablative therapy during partial nephrectomy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
