	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated-dose administration of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-272, as well as the effect of repeated-dose administration of TAK-272 on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or midazolam in healthy Japanese adult males.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug-Drug Interaction Study Between TAK-272 and Itraconazole, Digoxin or Midazolam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Cohort 1, the effect of repeated-dose administration of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 was evaluated by comparing between participants receiving TAK-272 alone and those receiving TAK-272 in combination with itraconazole. In Cohort 2, the effect of repeated-dose administration of TAK-272 on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or midazolam was evaluated by comparing between participants receiving digoxin or midazolam alone and those receiving either of the drugs in combination with TAK-272.</detailed_description>

Has a disease history, examination findings, or clinical test findings related to safety that reasonably suggest a disease for which TAK 272 or related renin inhibitors in the same class, itraconazole, digoxin, or midazolam is contraindicated or a disease that may affect the study conduct (which includes, for example, peptic ulcer disease, convulsive disorder, and arrhythmia). 19. Who currently has or recently had (within the past 6 months) gastrointestinal disease that may affect drug absorption (malabsorption, esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, frequent [at least once a week] heartburn, surgical intervension [e.g., cholecystectomy]). 20.
