	<brief_summary>Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a functionally disabling focal dystonia. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) therapy is suboptimal in many BEB patients. Repetitious transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy is a promising noninvasive therapy and has shown positive benefits in BEB. rTMS therapy can be easily combined with BoNT injections to enhance the effects of BoNT in BEB.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A two week course of rTMS therapy to achieve sustained benefits will be employed. With standard BoNT treatment, the peak-dose benefits are seen at about 4-6 weeks after the administration of injections. rTMS will be introduced during this peak-dose period (about 6 weeks after BoNT or T1).The effects of combined therapy at about 10 weeks after BoNT injections (T2) and at about 12 weeks after BoNT injections (T3) will be examined along with the physiological effects at these time points.</detailed_description>
