	<brief_summary>This research trial studies molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor (ct) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood and plasma samples from patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and/or has not responded to previous treatment with hormones. Studying samples of blood and plasma collected from patients with prostate cancer before, during, and/or after treatment in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify the development of drug resistance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Characterization of CTCs and ctDNA in Blood and Plasma Samples From Patients With Metastatic and/or Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Perform molecular analysis of plasma samples from 25 patients with metastatic prostate cancer collected before and during treatment of the disease with abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) or enzalutamide (Xtandi). II. Perform molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and plasma collected from 75 patients with progressing advanced metastatic prostate cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the timing of specimen collection. GROUP I: Previously collected plasma samples are analyzed for ctDNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing (NSG). GROUP II: Patients undergo collection of blood samples before and following systemic therapy for analysis of CTC enumeration, ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression, and ctDNA via PCR and NSG.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>GROUP I: Samples for Group I will be selected from existing sample sets obtained from concluded studies (USC IRB #'s 1000006 and 1100450) GROUP I: Excess plasma collected and stored in these trials from patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide will be used for the molecular analysis of the current protocol GROUP II: The second group of samples (Group 2) will involve prospective collection of peripheral blood from patients with advanced, treatmentresistant metastatic prostate cancer GROUP II: Histologic documentation of prostate cancer GROUP II: Metastatic cancer diagnosed by imaging and other clinical criteria GROUP II: Treatmentresistance determined by at least one of the following factors: increase in prostatespecific antigen (PSA) value over a baseline measurement; increase in size or number of metastatic deposits determined on imaging; and/or progression in cancer related symptoms</criteria>
