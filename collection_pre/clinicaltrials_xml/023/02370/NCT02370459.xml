	<brief_summary>The University of North Carolina will test the effectiveness of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's AFIX model for increasing HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents. AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives and eXchange) consists of brief quality improvement consultations that immunization specialists from state health departments deliver to vaccine providers in primary care settings. Using immunization registry data, the specialist evaluates the clinic's vaccination coverage and delivers education on best practices to improve coverage. We will compare changes in HPV vaccination coverage before and after consultations for high-volume pediatric and family medicine clinics across three study conditions: traditional consultations (in-person group), virtual consultations (webinar group), or no consultations (control group). In each participating state, 30 clinics will be randomly assigned to each study arm, for a total of 90 clinics per state, or 270 clinics overall. The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in coverage for HPV vaccine initiation among 11-12 year old patients, from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Secondarily, we will compare the change in coverage for other vaccines and age groups.</brief_summary>
