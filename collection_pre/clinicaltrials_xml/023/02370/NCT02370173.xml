	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance is nearly ubiquitous among individuals suffering from PTSD and is a major problem among service members returning from combat deployments. The proposed study aims to test a novel, inexpensive, and easy to use approach to improving sleep among service members with PTSD. Primary outcome measures will include not only PTSD symptom improvement but also include neuroimaging of brain structure, function, connectivity, and neurochemistry changes. The proposal is firmly grounded in the emerging scientific literature regarding sleep, light exposure, brain function, anxiety, and resilience. Prior evidence suggests that bright light therapy is effective for improving mood and fatigue, and our pilot data further suggest that this treatment may be effective for improving daytime sleepiness and brain functioning in brain injured individuals. Thus, this intervention, in our own research and in the work of others, has been shown to affect critical sleep regulatory systems. Improving sleep may be a vital component of recovery in these service members. Our approach would directly address this issue. Our preliminary data have shown that this approach is extremely well tolerated and is effective for improving sleep, mood, cognitive performance, and brain function among individuals with brain injuries. Finally, the potential impact of this study is high because of the capability of transitioning the research to direct clinical application almost immediately. If the bright light treatment is demonstrated as effective, this approach would be readily available for nearly immediate large-scale implementation, as the devices have been widely used for years in other contexts, are already safety tested, and commercially available from several manufacturers for a very low cost. Thus, the impact of this research on treating PTSD would be high and immediate.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>right handedness as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHS) (necessary to avoid mixed lateralization on brain imaging); For women: regular menstrual cycles (duration between 25 and 35 days with no more than 3 day variation between cycle (necessary to control brain metabolites on MR spectroscopy); SCID diagnoses and combat exposure consistent with PTSD ISI scale score of at least 8 or above Post first year evaluation w/low recruitment rates: recruit nonmilitary participants who have also experienced traumatic incidents as part of their occupation (e.g., law enforcement, firefighters) include a broader range of posttraumatic cases, such as sexual trauma, domestic partner violence, assault, etc. History of head injury with loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia, or major neurological illness; medical or neurologic condition that would confound interpretation of results, including alcohol (as verified via the Standard Drink handout for subjects) or drug abuse/dependence in the past 6 months, neurological disorders; mixed or lefthandedness; abnormal visual acuity that cannot be corrected by contact lenses (necessary to see stimuli in scanner environment); IQ estimate less than 80; metal within the body, pregnancy, or other contraindication for MRI procedures; time since returning from deployment that exceeds 36 months; previous formal treatment with light therapy; history of lightinduced migraine or epilepsy; medical complications that could elevate the risk of discomfort associated with lighttherapy; use of medications that could affect functional neuroimaging results (e.g., fluoxetine, betablockers). Patients currently taking other psychotropic medications (i.e., "treatment as usual") must be stabilized for at least 4weeks prior to participation. Although participants will not be excluded from participation, detailed history and dosages will be documented and examined as appropriate in statistical analyses. ISI score of below 8. Participants will be excluded if they are currently taking or anticipate the need to take sleepinducing medications (e.g., zolpidem) or supplements that have known effects on sleep (e.g., melatonin) during the course of the study.</criteria>
