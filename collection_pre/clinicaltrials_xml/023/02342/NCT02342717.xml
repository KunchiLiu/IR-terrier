Acceptable methods of contraception comprise barrier contraception and a medically accepted contraceptive method for the female partner (intrauterine device with spermicide, hormonal contraceptive for at least two month prior trial participation) Known fructose intolerance, glucosegalactose malabsorption, or saccharoseisomaltase deficiency History of relevant liver diseases such as disturbance of liver function, jaundice, drug induced liver injury, DubinJohnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, or liver tumours Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) above upper limit of normal at the screening examination</criteria>
