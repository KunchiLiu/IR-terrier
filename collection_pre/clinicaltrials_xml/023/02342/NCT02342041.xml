	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of SUVN-G3031 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single and multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SUVN-G3031 administered orally once a day to healthy male subjects. The study will be conducted under double-blind conditions. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SUVN-G3031 following oral administration of single or multiple ascending doses and estimate the maximum tolerated dose of SUVN-G3031, if possible. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the single and repeat dose plasma pharmacokinetics following oral administration of single and multiple ascending doses of SUVN-G3031 in healthy male subjects.</detailed_description>
