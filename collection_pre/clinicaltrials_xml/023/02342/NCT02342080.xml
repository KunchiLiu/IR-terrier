	<criteria>Clinical and radiological diagnosis of incomplete spinal cord injury of traumatic origin Injury time from 1 to 36 months Stability verified in clinical medical evaluation ASIA C or D Absence of severe psychiatric amendment requiring psychiatric evaluations Present functional recovery of the upper limb compatible with stages III and IV of Brunnstrom Patients cannot use a cardiac pacemaker ; have unstable angina or other decompensated heart disease; have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; dysreflexia without having autonomic control; have some fracture of the bones of the lower limbs; tracheostomy; presenting deformity and stiffness of the hip joint, knee (20 Â° or more of flexion ) and ankle ( 10 or more plantar flexion ) and pressure ulcers. Absence of illicit drug use Grant writing the informed consent to participate in the study Lack of resistance Disabling fatigue Worsening of spasticity which prevents the movement Body weight in excess of 150Kg Risk of osteoporosis with pathological fracture Asymmetry in the lower limbs greater than 2 cm Skin lesions and / or pressure ulcers in areas where the orthosis Lokomat pressuring</criteria>
