	<brief_summary>This is a single site, blinded, randomized, controlled study designed to examine phytochemical absorption, metabolism and excretion, as well as vascular health and satiety, after ingestion of 4 different bean varieties (pinto, navy, red kidney, black). Eligible participants will attend 6 in-person clinic visits for comparative testing of the 4 bean varieties versus lentils and rice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single site, blinded, randomized, controlled study designed to examine phytochemical absorption, metabolism and excretion, as well as vascular health and satiety, after ingestion of 4 different bean varieties (pinto, navy, red kidney, black). Recruitment will consist of a total of 8 volunteers. Volunteers will be recruited through advertisement from the local community. The study will be conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute,located at the St. Boniface Hospital. Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the study. Participants who have provided written consent will be asked to attend an in-patient visit to provide a fasting blood sample. Should the participant be eligible to participate, they will be scheduled for six study visits to assess the bioavailability, metabolism and excretion of phytochemicals present in beans compared to lentils and white rice. Uptake, metabolism and excretion of phytochemicals present in different varieties of beans during acute phase testing in healthy individuals will be examined. Possible relationships between phytochemical composition of the beans, arterial function and satiety will be investigated as the secondary objective.</detailed_description>
