	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies whether obese stage I-II endometrial cancer survivors or patients with atypical hyperplasia (abnormal cells in the lining of the uterus) would go see a weight loss specialist if it was recommended by their cancer doctor. Excess body weight or obesity is one of the most common contributors to (causes of) endometrial cancer. Over two-thirds of women who have survived endometrial cancer are obese. Complications of obesity, such as heart disease are often more dangerous than the cancer itself. A weight loss of even 5-10% of excess body weight is associated with improved health. Often, meeting with a doctor or person who is an expert in weight loss (bariatric specialist) is the best way to lose weight and keep it off. Endometrial cancer survivors or patients with atypical hyperplasia who go see a weight loss specialist recommended by their doctor may be able to achieve a healthier body weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weight Loss Referral for Healthier Survivorship in Obese Stage I-II Endometrial Cancer Survivors or Atypical Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of a larger project that would aim to describe the health benefits and risks of a weight loss intervention in women who are endometrial cancer survivors with a low risk for recurrence or who have had complex atypical hyperplasia. OUTLINE: Patients are referred to a weight loss specialist for assistance with weight loss and chart reviews are performed at baseline and every 3 months for 24 months. Patients complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Cancer (C)30 and EORTC-QLQ-Endometrial Cancer (EN)24 at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Patients are also contacted at 90 days to determine whether they have initiated any weight loss interventions.</detailed_description>
