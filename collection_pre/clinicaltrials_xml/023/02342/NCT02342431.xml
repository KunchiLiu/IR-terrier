	<brief_summary>The study is a comparison of a patient warming system using a forced-air, non-compressible under-body mattress (Möck &amp; Möck, Hamburg, Germany) versus a regular forced-air underbody mattress system during pediatric cardiac catheterization in 40 patients. The hypothesis is, that the non-compressible mattress provides better warming with less incidence of perioperative hypothermia (Core temperature &lt; 36 °C) and faster warming slope (°C / time). The study is prospective, randomized, controlled and single-blinded. Inclusion criteria will be pediatric patients &lt; 1 year of age without fever or a treatment of therapeutic hypothermia.</brief_summary>
