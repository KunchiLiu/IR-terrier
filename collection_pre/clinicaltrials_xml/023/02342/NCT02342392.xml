	<brief_title>Intralesional Ranibizumab on Pterygium Vascularity, Size and Recurrence Rate: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Compare the vascularity of primary pterygium before and 1 week after intralesional ranibizumab (0.3 mg/0.03 mL) injection. 2. Compare the size of primary pterygium before and 1 week after intralesional ranibizumab (0.3 mg/0.03 mL) injection. 3. Compare the recurrence rate at 1 year after pterygium excision surgery between the group with and without intralesional ranibizumab injection.</detailed_description>
