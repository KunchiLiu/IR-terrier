	<brief_summary>The LILA study is a pilot randomized parallel-group trial of a group-based yoga therapy program versus physical conditionin control program for treatment of urinary incontinence in ambulatory middle-aged and older women. Women aged 50 years and older who meet the criteria for frequency of incontinence episodes, are not using other clinical treatments for incontinence, and meet minimum physical mobility requirements and other eligibility criteria will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women aged 50 years or older who report urinary incontinence starting at least 3 months prior to screening Selfreport at least required frequency of urinary incontinence episodes on a screening 3day voiding diary Selfreport urgencypredominant (i.e., at least half of incontinence episodes being urgencytype), stresspredominant (i.e., at least half of episodes being stresstype), or mixedtype (i.e., an equal number of stress and urgencytype episodes) incontinence on the screening voiding diary Willing to refrain from initiating medical treatments that may affect their incontinence or voiding pattern during the study intervention period Participation in formal or organized yoga classes or instruction within the past 3 months; or any prior yoga therapy directed specifically at improving urinary incontinence or pelvic floor dysfunction Participation in at least weekly organized physical conditioning classes or instruction in the past 3 months involving muscle stretching and strengthening exercises (not including aerobic classes that do not emphasize stretching or strengthening). Currently pregnant (by selfreport or screening urine pregnancy test), gave birth within the past 6 months, or planning pregnancy during the study period (approximately 2 to 6 months) Current urinary tract infection (screening dipstick urinalysis with leukocyte estrace, nitrites or blood) or a history or 3 or more urinary tract infections in the preceding year Report history of neurologic conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or Parkinson's disease, or a lumbosacral spine condition associated with neurological symptoms Unable to walk up a flight of stairs or at least 2 blocks on level ground without assistance (i.e., functional capacity &lt; 4 METs) Unable to get up from a supine to a standing position in 10 seconds or less and without assistance Morbid obesity defined by a measured body mass index of &gt;40 kg/m2 at the screening evaluation. Report any history of prior antiincontinence or urethral surgery (not including urethral dilation), pelvic cancer, or pelvic irradiation for any reason Report use of bladder botox, electrostimulation, bladder training, or pelvic floor exercise training (with certified practitioners) in the past 3 months Report other surgery to the pelvis (hysterectomy, oophorectomy, vaginal surgery, bladder surgery, colon surgery) within the past 3 months Report use of medications with the potential to affect incontinence (anticholinergic bladder medications, tricyclic antidepressants, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, mirabegron, loop diuretics) within the past month Report starting stopping, or changing the dose of a medication with the potential to affect anxiety or stress symptoms (i.e., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, anxiolytics/sedatives, antipsychotics) within the past 1 month, or plans to start, stop, or change to dose of such a medication during the study period Report use of medical devices (i.e. pessary) for incontinence within the previous month (participants may stop use of device and represent for study) Report history of interstitial cystitis, fistula or hole in bladder or rectum, or birth defect leading to urine leakage Report symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (assessed using a standardized question, ""Have your pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, or rectum) been dropping out of your vagina causing a feeling of bulging, pressure, or protrusion or a sensation like your "insides are coming out"?") Report history of vulvodynia, chronic pelvic pain, or pain when practicing pelvic floor exercises Report conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators, render potential participants unlikely to follow the protocol, including plans to move, substance abuse, significant psychiatric problems, or dementia Participation in another research study that involves investigational drugs or devices that could potentially confound the results of this study Unable to understand study procedures, complete study interviews, or and provide informed consent in English</criteria>
