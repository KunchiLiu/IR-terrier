	<brief_summary>The new MIRUS system as well as the established AnaConDa system uses a reflector to conserve volatile anaesthetics (VA). Both systems act with commercially available ICU ventilators. In contrast to AnaConDa the MIRUS includes an automated control of end-tidal VA concentrations. In this study the investigators compared feasibility, costs and recovery times after anaesthesia with isoflurane (ISO), sevoflurane (SEVO) or desflurane (DES) in ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board. After written informed consent 63 ASA I-III patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery under general anesthesia were included. Patients were randomly organized into 3 groups (20-22 each). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous anaesthetics. After tracheal intubation MIRUS automatically adjusted the end-tidal VA concentration to 1.0 MAC. Patients were ventilated with the Puritan Bennett 840 ICU ventilator. After 1 h of anaesthesia with 1.0 MAC the ventilator mode was switched from SIMV V+ (totally controlled ventilation, "passive patient", with a tidal volume of 8 ml/IBW) to proportional assist ventilation (PAV) with 50% support ("active patient"). At the end of surgery the MIRUS system was stopped (MAC set to 0.0) and recovery times were measured.</detailed_description>
