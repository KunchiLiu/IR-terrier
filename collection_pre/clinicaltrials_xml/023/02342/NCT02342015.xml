	<brief_summary>Background: Circulating osteoprogenitors and RANKL expression in immune cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and vascular calcification. The role played by statin therapy in the bone-vascular axis is unknown. Methods: Twenty naïve post-menopausal osteoporotic hypercholesterolemic women will be treated with Atorvastatin 40 mg/day for three months. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and at the end of the treatment. Gene expression analysis will be performed to assess modification in OPG/RANK/RANKL expression in isolated T-cells and monocytes. A flow cytometry analysis will be used to study changes in the levels of circulating osteoprogenitor cells.</brief_summary>
