	<brief_summary>Background: Drospirenone (DRSP) seems to have a favorable effect on blood pressure (BP); however, when associated with ethinylestradiol (EE), this effect does not seem to occur. This study has the objective to assess possible differences in BP associated with the use of COCs containing DRSP with different doses of ethinylestradiol. Materials and methods: This open-label parallel-group randomized clinical trial involved women randomized to use either 30 mcg of EE+DRSP (n=22) or 20 mcg of EE+DRSP (n=22). Daytime, nighttime and 24-hour BP were evaluated by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at the beginning of the trial and six months after drug therapy.</brief_summary>
