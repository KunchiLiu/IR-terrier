	<brief_title>SARC029: Trametinib and Pazopanib in Patients With GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trametinib and pazopanib are independently approved for other cancers. Both drugs work to inhibit tumor development in different ways. Combining these drugs may lead to improved disease control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of both drugs on advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors.</detailed_description>

Life expectancy of ≥ 3months Exclusion Criteria includes: Prior malignancy. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline, with the exception of those patients who have previouslytreated CNS metastases (surgery +/ radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or gamma knife) and who meet both of the following criteria: are asymptomatic and have no requirement for steroids or enzymeinducing anticonvulsants in at least 3 months prior to screening.

History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack (TIA), pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of investigational product and/or presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer (procedures such as catheter placement are not considered to be major surgery). Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. Recent hemoptysis (≥ 1/2 teaspoon of red blood within 8 weeks before first dose of study drug) Any serious and or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other condition that could interfere with the patient's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications listed in Section 5.2.4 for at least 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study. Treatment with any of the following anticancer therapies: Radiation therapy or tumor embolization within 14 days prior to the first dose of OR Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy or hormonal therapy within 14 days or five halflives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug. Ipilimumab must have been discontinued at least 8 weeks prior to initiation of treatment with trametinib Administration of any nononcologic investigational drug within 30 days or five halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anticancer therapy that is ≥ Grade 1 and/or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia. Inability to swallow and retain oral medication Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to pazopanib, trametinib (GSK1120212), or excipients of the formulations given during the course of this trial. History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis, intracardiac defibrillators, known HIV, active HBV or HCV infections, history of retinal vein occlusion, symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression.</criteria>
