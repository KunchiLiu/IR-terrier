	<brief_title>Mifepristone and Misoprostol Versus Misoprostol Alone for Missed Abortion: A Randomized-controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this trial is to compare the efficacy of mifepristone-misoprostol versus misoprostol alone for treatment of missed abortion. This will be a randomized controlled double-blinded trial of 416 women comparing misoprostol alone to mifepristone plus misoprostol for treatment of missed abortion less than 13 weeks+ 0 days LMP. All women in the trial will undergo routine screening (including ultrasound) and pre-medical induction care per standard practice at the hospital. All eligible women agreeing to participate in the study will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens: 1) STUDY GROUP ONE: 200mg mifepristone followed in 24 hours by 800mcg sublingual misoprostol; 2) STUDY GROUP TWO: placebo followed in 24 hours by 800mcg sublingual misoprostol.</detailed_description>
