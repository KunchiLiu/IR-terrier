	<brief_title>Devel. and Eval. of an Active Surveillance Decision Aid for Men With Low or Intermediate Grade Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this project is to test an interactive, multi-media decision aid in the form of an electronic clinical decision dashboard designed to improve the quality of clinical decision making for initial treatment of patients with newly diagnosed, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer. Specifically, we propose to conduct a clinical trial to compare the effects of a prostate decision dashboard versus usual care on: 1. patient knowledge regarding the treatment options available for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer, 2. measures of the decision making process including decisional conflict and the extent to which decisions were made via a shared decision making process, 3. the treatments selected, and 4. 3-6 and 9-12 month outcome assessments of clinical status, decision regret, cancer-related quality of life including worry, functional status, and treatment side effects.</detailed_description>
