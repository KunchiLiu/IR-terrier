	<brief_summary>Auditory monitoring of employees is currently based on pure-tone audiometry. However, this clinical examination does not prevent from deafness but established it a posteriori. From a preventive standpoint, it is important to detect hearing professional pain before the development of irreversible(s) clinical(s) symptom(s). The investigators' hypothesis is that auditory fatigue results from damages of primary and secondary central auditory pathways involving cognitive processes. The assessment of auditory fatigue includes the evaluation of speech intelligibility, short-term memory, working memory and perceived mental task load. The main objective of this study is to identify, among regulating medical assistants working with headset, a central auditory fatigue.</brief_summary>
