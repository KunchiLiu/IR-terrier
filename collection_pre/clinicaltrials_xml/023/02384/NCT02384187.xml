	<brief_summary>The frequent incidence of postoperative vomiting and severe pain in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy, may delay postoperative oral intake and increase the risk of dehydration. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is of multi-factorial origin in this group of patients, with a reported incidence ranging from 23% to 73%. There is growing evidence that the perioperative administration of gabapentinin in adults is beneficial for preoperative anxiolysis, postoperative analgesia, reduction of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and delirium. Only few studies in literature explored the analgesic effects of preoperative gabapentin as premedication in pediatric population. However, the antiemetic effect of gabapentin in pediatric patients was not systematically investigated before.</brief_summary>
