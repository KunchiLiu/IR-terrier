	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission tomography / computed tomography (18F-NaF PET/CT) imaging as a method for determining treatment response in metastatic bone lesions in patients who are receiving enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation, or signet cell or small cell features; Presence of bone metastatic disease as assessed by at least two lesions on whole body metastable technetiummethylene diphosphonate (99mTcMDP) bone scintigraphy; Throughout the study, ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) analogue or prior bilateral orchiectomy (medical or surgical castration); Testosterone ≤ 1.73 nmol/L (≤ 50 ng/dL) at screening; Progressive disease on androgen deprivation therapy at screening defined as a minimum of two sequentially rising prostatespecific antigen (PSA) values (PSA1 &lt; PSA2 &lt; PSA3); The screening PSA (PSA3) must be ≥ 2 μg/L (≥ 2 ng/mL). Prior enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate, aminoglutethimide, ketoconazole, radium Ra 223 dichloride or other bonetargeting radionuclides, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in the CRPC setting for the treatment of prostate cancer or participation in a clinical trial of an investigational agent that inhibits the androgen receptor or androgen synthesis (unless treatment was placebo); Treatment with hormonal therapy (eg, androgen receptor inhibitors, 5alpha reductase inhibitors) or biologic therapy for prostate cancer (other than LHRH analogue therapy) within 4 weeks before enrollment; Initiation of new treatment with denosumab, bisphosphonates, or systemic corticosteroids for treatment of prostate cancer within 4 weeks before enrollment; Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks before the screening visit; Radiation therapy to bone within 4 weeks before enrollment; Use of opiate analgesics for prostate cancer pain within 4 weeks before enrollment; Screening 99mTcMDP bone scintigraphy showing a superscan; Visceral (eg, lung, liver) metastatic disease. Adenopathy is allowed; Current or previously treated brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease; History of seizure any time in the past for any reason or any condition that may predispose to seizures.</criteria>
