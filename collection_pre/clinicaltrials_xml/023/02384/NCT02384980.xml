	<brief_summary>This study will take the first step to improve public health for millions of Americans with Peripheral Arterial Disease who have extreme difficulty walking due to leg pain. The investigators will assess a proof of concept, home administered, functional electrical stimulation (FES) system to resolve pain, improve walking, and enhance quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saving Life and Limb: FES for the Elderly With PAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate an innovative approach to reduce the debilitating symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and ischemic pain during walking (intermittent claudication) by using a new Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system. The investigators hypothesize that combining the FES and walking one hour/day (FES+Walk) will significantly reduce pain during walking, improve locomotion, and enhance quality of life when compared to walking one hour/day (Walk) alone after 8 weeks of intervention.</detailed_description>
