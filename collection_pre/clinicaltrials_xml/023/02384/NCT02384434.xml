	<brief_summary>This single-arm phase I/II study establishes the safety and efficacy of low level laser therapy (LLLT) in order to mitigate radiation-induced dermatitis in patients underoing radiation therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Additional objectives include assessment of patient-reported quality of life data, pain parameters and dermatologic quality of life responses. The target population is patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx who are candidates for either definitive or adjuvant therapy consisting of a chemotherapy regimen and concurrent radiation therapy. Patients are required to have a favorable performance status (KPS greater than or equal to 70), have had no prior head and neck radiotherapy and be at least 18 years of age and able to provide consent. While receiving radiotherapy and a concurrent systemic regimen, patients will receive LLLT using a 69 diode probe with dual 660 nm and 850 nm wavelengths to at least nine treatment sites in the head and neck region for a duration of 60 seconds to each site. LLLT will be given three times in a week prior to, daily during the first week of, and at least twice weekly thereafter during radiotherapy. Information collected includes toxicity scoring and quality of life surveys. A retrospective matched-pair design will be used to assess the rate of grade III complications compared to patients treated previously without LLLT support, with an anticipated 20% reduction in the risk of grade III dermatitis.</brief_summary>
