	<brief_summary>Although drug-eluting stents have reduced rates of restenosis and late lumen loss compared with bare metal stents, late stent thrombosis (LST), a life-threatening complication of this technology, has emerged as a major concern. Researches indicated incomplete neointimal coverage of stent struts as the most important morphometric predictor of LST. Pathological research showed stenting disruption of adjacent vulnerable plaques can precipitate LST, Meanwhile, thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA) as the most important predictor of Major Adverse Cardiovascular. Therefore, there is a hypothesis that TCFA may impair intimal healing which are prone to LST in vivo. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)is a high-resolution (&lt;10 µm), catheter-based imaging modality capable of investigating detailed coronary plaque morphology in vivo.This study aimed to observe that TCFA will arise what of the effect on intimal healing of stent struts on the lesions which fractional flow reserve (FFR)≤0.75 after EXCEL biodegradable polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stent was implanted at 9 months follow up: evaluated by OCT and FFR</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of TCFA on Neointimal Coverage After PCI at 9 Months Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary end point is to Neointimal coverage after 9 months of the stent implantation. Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any plans for site monitoring and auditing. Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry. Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (e.g., medical records, paper or electronic case report forms, or interactive voice response systems). Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry, including the source of the variable, coding information if used and normal ranges if relevant. Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management. Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary to demonstrate an effect.</detailed_description>
