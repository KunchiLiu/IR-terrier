	<brief_summary>This study aims to estimate the costs of botulinum toxin A utilization in standard practice for the treatment of upper limb spasticity post-stroke in Portugal. It will consider the three most used locally available brands of botulinum toxin A which show similar efficacy and safety profiles thus making it relevant to understand if choosing between one or another brand can depend directly on economic factors. The study will estimate direct and indirect drug-associated costs as determinant variables for the price of each drug and the standard drug dose used in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
