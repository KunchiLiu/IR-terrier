	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the combination treatment of established chemotherapy regimen mFOLFOX6 with Selinexor, an oral Selective Inhibitor Of Nuclear Export, in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer. The purpose is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor in combination with mFOLFOX6.</brief_summary>
