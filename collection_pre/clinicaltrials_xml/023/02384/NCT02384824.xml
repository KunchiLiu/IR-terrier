	<brief_title>Delayed Plaque Morphology in Patients With STEMI After Thrombus Aspiration During Primary PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current guideline for treating acute STEMI is primarily PCI and stent placement in the infarct-related coronary artery. But, the underlying plaque morphology is not routinely identified due to the limited resolution of conventional imagine modalities. However, autopsy studies have shown that there are different atherosclerotic plaque morphologies involving in acute thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries other than atherosclerotic plaque rupture, such as plaque erosion, calcified nodule, etc. Some studies have suggested that PCI and stenting might not always be necessary in about 30 - 40% of ACS patients, and an alternative treatment strategy is needed for these patients based on the characteristics of plaque morphology. 100 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo emergent angiography and followings: If no thrombus was observed, OCT examination will be performed in the target vessel; If thrombosis was confirmed, the subject will undergo manual aspiration thrombectomy and antiplatelet therapy, and TIMI flow will be assessed: If TIMI flow grade &lt; 3, the subject will receive stent implantation as the standard of care followed by OCT examination; If TIMI flow grade of 3, the subject will not receive stent implantation but will be sent to CCU for monitoring and antiplatelet treatment, and have a repeat angiography and OCT examination at Day 7; within the 7days post STEMI, ischemia-driven angiography and/or PCI are allowed, and an OCT examination will be performed in these subject before PCI. Patients without undergoing initial stent implantation will have scheduled 30-day and 12-month follow-ups for clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
