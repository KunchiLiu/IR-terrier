	<brief_title>Guided and Unguided Internet Treatment for Problematic Alcohol Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: An 10 week Internet-based self-help program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was tested among Internet help seekers.The design was a three-armed randomized controlled design, and outcomes were measured in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use, as well as depression, anxiety and quality of life. 80 participants were recruited entirely online from an open access website and randomized into three different groups. All participants had access to the same self-help program. However, one group was given a choice between two forms of therapist guidance (messages or weekly chat sessions), one group received therapist guidance in the form of secure messages, and one group received no therapist guidance.</detailed_description>
