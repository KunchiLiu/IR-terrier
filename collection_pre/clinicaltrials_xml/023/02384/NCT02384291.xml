	<brief_summary>This clinical study is designed to compare the regenerative outcome of using separately two different Xenografts during sinus floor augmentation. Aim of this prospective randomized-controlled clinical trial is to compare the regenerative results of Alpha-Bio's GRAFT Natural Bovine Bone versus commercially available bone graft after two-step sinus floor elevations by clinical and histological analysis. Clinical Parameters are wound healing parameters, radiological volume stability and implant survival rates. Histological parameters are based on a histomorphometrical analysis of trephine cores harvested in progress of implant bed preparation.</brief_summary>
