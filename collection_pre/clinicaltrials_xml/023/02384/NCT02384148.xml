	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to characterize human circadian clockwork in healthy individuals in comparison to obese and type 2 diabetic subjects, employing the noninvasive experimental approach allowing the study of circadian profile in human individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Circadian Clock Properties in Healthy Subjects, Obese and Type 2 Diabetic Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators specifically aim to obtain and analyze the circadian profile of skin fibroblasts from healthy, obese and T2D subjects. Does circadian oscillator profile and its parameters (phase, period and amplitude) will differ between healthy individuals and obese/ T2D patients? Skin biopsy will be performed in order to collect and culture skin fibroblast cells. In vivo bioluminescence recording will be performed in primary human skin fibroblast cells. The profiles obtained from 10 subjects in each group will be compared to their healthy counterparts. Bmal1and Per2 are clock genes. Lentiviral transduction of Bmal1-luciferase or Per2-luciferase in fibroblasts allow observation of circadian oscillations using bioluminescence assay. Phase, period length and amplitude are used to characterize the circadian rhythm.</detailed_description>
