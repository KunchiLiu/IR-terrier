	<brief_summary>Electrical stimulation therapy for pain reduction was performed already 2000 years ago. In recent years many studies had proved the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in pain management, tissue healing and muscle strengthening. Today there are devices with many types of currents. Each current comes with different statements for its effectiveness and its penetration depth yet there is no consensus on the most effective current in the dimension of penetration depth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of of Therapeutic Currents in Clinical Dimension and Penetration Depth Dimension in Lower Back</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study shall be recruited patients who underwent implantation of electrodes in the spine (Spinal Cord Stimulation- SCS). The electrode will serve as a voltage reader deep in the tissue. The voltage is generated from electrodes applied on the skin and delivers therapeutic currents to the patients back. The study will be tested 4 different types of currents and number of electrode placement.</detailed_description>
