	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show safety and tolerability to our mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) product which will be autologous in nature, expanded using a non-xenogeneic, human component expansion media (pooled human platelet lysate) and delivered fresh. Subsequently, the investigators intend to test whether infusion of MSCs immediately after islet autograft can reduce onset of diabetes and improve glycemic control after total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Islet Co-transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I study evaluating safety and tolerability of autologous BM-MSCs in chronic pancreatitis patients who undergo total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT). CCT-BMMSC will be infused at one of the following doses: (Tier 1), 20x10^6 cell per patient, (Tier 2), 50x10^6 cell per patient, and (Tier 3), 100x10^6 cell per patient. Primary objective: To describe and compare the safety and tolerability of infusion of fresh autologous bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal stromal cells after islet transplantation in chronic pancreatitis patients who undergo TP-IAT. The investigators plan to enroll 24 patients for the whole study. The duration of this study is 12 months. The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 2 years of commencement. Secondary objective: Efficacy of infusion of fresh autologous bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal stromal cells together after islet transplantation in chronic pancreatitis patients who undergo TP-IAT as assessed through onset of diabetes, glycemic control, pain relief and quality of life index. Safety variables: Adverse events (AEs), Laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), Vital signs</detailed_description>
