	<brief_summary>This study aims to reduce stress in mothers of children with autism in Saudi Arabia. The researcher has designed a training programme for mothers whose children are young and just in their early stage at the autism organisations they are attending. The programme will include stress reduction tips, behavioural modification strategies for children with autism, and financial resources available to parents (how they can access government funding). The study will have two parts. Part one involves conducting an experiment by dividing the participants into two groups, one group will receive the training and the other group will wait until the end of the study then they will also receive the same training. Both groups will fill questionnaire at the beginning of the study, then after the first group finishes training, and then again 6 weeks later. Part two of the study will involve interviewing mothers of the first group who attended the training session. They will be interviewed by the researcher asking them about their experience with the training programme and their suggestions for future improvements. Mothers will be given a training manual at the beginning of the training. Training involves attending five sessions, one of which is a face to face session at the autism organisation their children are attending and the other four sessions will be through a Smartphone application called whatsapp which is widely used in Saudi Arabia.</brief_summary>
