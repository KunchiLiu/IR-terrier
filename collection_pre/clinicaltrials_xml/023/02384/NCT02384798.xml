	<brief_summary>Due to the symptoms of heart failure (HF), as dyspnea and fatigue, patients have a reduced functional capacity, evidenced during usual daily activities and exercises. The Cardiac Rehabilitation with emphasis on resistance and aerobic exercises performed in the same session (concurrent training), can be added to pharmacological treatment as improvement strategy in functional capacity and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ventilatory Support Associated With Exercise in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized clinical trial, divided into two stages will be held. In step 1 the function will be assessed by the 6-minute walk test, spirometry, and questionnaires to evaluate quality of life. After fulfilled the series of assessments individuals will be randomly divided into two groups, with group 1 (control) will hold only one interval aerobic exercise program on treadmill and group 2 (intervention) will hold a combined exercise program for prior use of ventilatory support noninvasive. For both groups will be held an aerobic exercise program associated with resistance exercise for 12 weeks. The first two weeks will be considered in period. In the 10 weeks following both groups maintain the preset exercise program gradually. In the intervention group will be added before the exercise program the use of noninvasive ventilation for 30 minutes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Will be included 60 patients of both sexes, adults with medical diagnosis divided into two groups: Group A consisted of 30 patients use noninvasive ventilation added to interval training and group B consisted of 30 patients also only use interval training. Will be excluded from the study patients who have chest pain (angina), arrhythmias, spo2 â‰¤ 90%, hypertension or hypotension, neurological or osteoarticular disease preventing the ambulation of these individuals.</criteria>
