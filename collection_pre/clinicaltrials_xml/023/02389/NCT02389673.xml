	<brief_summary>Whether the patients with low grade ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer should accept radiationtherapy is uncertain.Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving radiation during surgery followed by external-beam radiation to the entire breast may kill more tumor cells.The clinical trial is conducting to find out the effectiveness of radiation therapy during surgery in treating women who have undergone breast-conversing surgery for low grade ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer.</brief_summary>
