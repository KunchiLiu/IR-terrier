	<brief_title>Reducing Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation (RaDIANT) Regional Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disparities exist in access to kidney transplantation where poor and minority patients are less likely to access each step of the kidney transplant process. Current national surveillance data does not capture information on transplant referral, and it is unclear to what extent dialysis facility-level factors may influence disparities in access to transplantation. Due to significant variability in the standardized transplant ratios observed at each facility, the investigators hypothesize that there may be facility-related reasons that impact disparities in access to the first step of the kidney transplant process -- referral to the transplant center to undergo an evaluation for the suitability for transplant.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Kidney Failure, Chronic</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Kidney transplant centers in the geographic area of North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC) and Georgia (GA) 2. Low rates of referral for kidney transplantation (6month crude referral risk mean of 0.06 and all facilities with a crude referral risk less than the mean) 3. The presence of a racial disparity (African American vs. Caucasian) in referrals for kidney transplantation (racial disparity calculated based on the crude referral risk difference and the standardized referral risk difference.) The final pool of 140 facilities will be randomized to either the intervention or control group using a one to one ratio. 1. Facilities with less than 13 End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients &lt;70 years of age within a facility 2. Facilities with no racial disparities and high rates of referrals for kidney transplantation</criteria>
