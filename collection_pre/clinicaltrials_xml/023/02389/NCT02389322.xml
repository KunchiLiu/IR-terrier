	<brief_summary>The investigators select 500 subjects who meet the standard and are considered as study population I. Do specific gamma-interferon detection before the skin test， then inject intradermally with two dosage ESAT6-CFP10 and Tuberculin purified protein derivative (TB-PPD) at different arm of the same subject and get 192 participants whose three kinds of detection result are all negative and are considered as study population II.Then,they are immune to the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine or the placebo of the BCG. Do specific gamma-interferon detection before the skin test， then inject intradermally with two dosage ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD at different arm of the same subject 12 weeks after immunity.Negative rate of ESAT6-CFP10 after vaccination BCG as the main index , evaluate the specificity of different doses of ESAT6-CFP10, and conform the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.the correlation of three detection methods for study population I 500 study population I are randomly divided into two different dose group on average, according to ESAT6-CFP10 dose(5μg/ml or 10μg/ml). Do specific gamma-interferon(γ-IFN) detection before the skin test，then inject intradermally with 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 or 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD at different arm of the same subject.Evaluate respectively the positive rate of three detection methods 、the correlation of three detection methods and the security of study population I after application for ESAT6-CFP10 . 2.screen study population II Choose those participants, whose result of three detection (ESAT6-CFP10、TB-PPD andγ-IFN ) all negative, HIV negative and chest X-ray no abnormalities, into study population II. 3.study population II vaccinate BCG or placebo Study population II ,according to the same proportion ,are randomly divided into four group in double blinded state,: 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 after BCG immunization, 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 after BCG immunization, 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 after placebo-controlled immunization , 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 after placebo-controlled immunization.They vaccinate BCG or the placebo of BCG. 4.Inject ESAT6-CFP10 12 weeks after inoculation in study population II The investigators draw blood and operate specific gamma-interferon(γ-IFN) detection before the skin test，then inject intradermally with 5μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 or 10μg/ml ESAT6-CFP10 (in double blinded state) and TB-PPD at different arm of the same subject ,according to the above grouping scheme. Calculate the negative coincidence rate and the correlation of three detection methods, and observe the safety of ESAT6-CFP10 in study population II at the same time.Evaluate the specificity of different doses of ESAT6-CFP10, negative rate of ESAT6-CFP10 after vaccination BCG as the main index. And finally conform the optimal dose of ESAT6-CFP10.</detailed_description>
