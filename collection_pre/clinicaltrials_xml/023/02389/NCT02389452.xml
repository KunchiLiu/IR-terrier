	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single 6 mL intraarticular (IA) injection of Synvisc-One in participants in India with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee(s). Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety and short-term efficacy of a repeat treatment with Synvisc-One.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety and Efficacy of 6 mL Synvisc-One (Hylan G-F 20) in Indian Patients With Symptomatic Osteoarthritis of Knee(s) After Initial and Repeat Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A period of approximately 19 months was anticipated from the time the first participants was enrolled in the study to the completion of the study (last participant out). Individual participant participation lasted from 7 to 13 months depending on the timing of repeat treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female participant aged 30 years or older, with active lifestyle. The participant must be able to read, understand, and sign an informed consent form, understand requirements for followup visits, and must be willing to provide information at the scheduled evaluations. The participant had a diagnosis of OA of the target knee confirmed by recent Xray (mild to moderate joint space narrowing and/or osteophytes (ie, Kellgren Lawrence [KL] Grade IIII), predominant in the tibiofemoral compartment. WOMAC A1 baseline 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) score from 4080 mm (moderate or severe walking pain) in the target knee. Participants with bilateral disease may be included in the study with the below strict conditions: Only one knee included in the efficacy assessment and considered the target knee (the worst knee by the WOMAC A1 pain scale should be selected). The selected knee must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The nontarget knee may also be treated with SynviscOne and does not need to meet the KL grade knee specific inclusion criteria described above. The other criteria do apply. If female, must had a negative urine pregnancy test and continue to use a medically acceptable form of contraception for the duration of the study. Otherwise, females must had been surgically sterile or postmenopausal (as documented in the medical history) for at least 1 year. Significant (requiring surgical correction) valgus or varus deformity of the knee, ligamentous laxity, or meniscal instability. Concomitant inflammatory or any other disease/condition which may affect joints (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic bone disease, psoriasis, gout, pseudogout, or chondrocalcinosis). History of sepsis in any joint or any clinical concern for a subacute infectious process in the target joint. History of surgery in the target knee. Planned surgery on any lower extremity joint. Clinically significant venous or lymphatic stasis present in the leg(s). Clinically apparent tense effusion or inflammation at the target knee. Skin disease or infection in the area of the injection site. Any musculoskeletal condition that would impede measurement of efficacy at the target knee. Pregnant or lactating women. Hypersensitivities to avian proteins and/or any components of hyaluronanbased injection. Treatment with any hyaluronic acid (HA) or derivatives in the previous 6 months. Treatment with IA steroids in the previous 3 months. Any contraindication to IA injection, eg, anticoagulant therapy or clinical concern for potential coagulopathy (eg, liver disease). Any significant medical condition (eg, significant psychiatric or neurological disorders or active alcohol/drug abuse), any medical condition that is unstable/poorly controlled or other factors (eg, planned relocation) that the Investigator felt would interfere with study evaluations and study participation. The above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
