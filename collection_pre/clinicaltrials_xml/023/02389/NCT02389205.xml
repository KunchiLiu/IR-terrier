	<brief_summary>Background Hemophilia is a sex-linked genetic disorders. When the joint or the muscles is bleeding, it may cause haemarthrosis, synovium, cartilage tissue thickening, joint activity (Range of Motion) decreasing and other musculoskeletal and related disorder. Patients will produce pain in the action, compensatory action occurs, thus causing recurrent of bleeding, and joint damage. There is high rate of ankle joint bleeding in hemophilia. The ankle articular joint disease will affect lower limbs activities, and the functional activities will impaired. Review studies, in addition to physical therapy, Kinesio taping is a common intervention to improve other subjects' static balance, proprioception, functional ankle stability, correct poor posture. The main intervention of this study is physical therapy and Kinesio taping, expect to improve the stability and muscular strength of lower extremities, and balance, correcting gait and lower extremity functional activities of subjects with hemophilia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Functional Activities and Balance Ability With Taping in Subjects of Hemophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups, the control group received physical therapy once a week for a period of three months; experimental group received the same physical therapy in addition to treatment, but each will be accepted Kinesio taping. Experiments group carried out before and after the relevant tests, including: muscle strength, balance, lower extremity functional activities. The participants will be followed for the duration of physical therapy , an expected average of 3 months.</detailed_description>
