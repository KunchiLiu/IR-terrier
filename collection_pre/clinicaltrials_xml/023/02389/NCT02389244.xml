	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of Regorafenib in Patients With Metastatic Bone Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY: Randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentric, phase II study -This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, with 4 cohort: cohort A: Osteosarcoma cohort B: Ewing sarcoma cohort C: Chondrosarcoma cohort D : chondroma. Cohort A, B and C will involve a total of 36 patients (24 Regorafenib + 12 placebo). And cohort D a total of 24 evaluable patients (16 Regorafenib + 8 placebo) 132 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the following treatment groups : The Arm A: Regorafenib (160 mg/d) once daily for the 3 weeks on / 1 week off plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) until progression (according to RECIST 1.1), intolerance or withdrawal of consent . Patients receiving regorafenib who experience disease progression and for whom in the investigator opinion, treatment with regorafenib is providing clinical benefit, may continue the treatment following consultation with the study coordinator and the sponsor. The Arm B: Placebo plus BSC until progression (according to RECIST V1.1) intolerance or withdrawal of consent. Patients who have received placebo will receive open-label regorafenib after objective tumor progression. Patients will be stratified at randomization according to histology .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of bone sarcoma (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma of bone, chondrosarcoma or chordoma) ; 2. Patients with confirmed disease progression at study entry. 3. Metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection or radiation with curative intent; 4. Patients must have measurable disease ; 5. Prior treatment : at least one, but no more than two prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease for osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma; neoadjuvant /maintenance therapy are not counted towards this requirement. Chordoma not pretreated or with 1 or 2 prior (combination) chemotherapy regimen or with one or two prior molecularly targeted therapy, but no more than 2 prior lines of treatment (whatever the indication) can be included. At least 4 weeks since last chemotherapy (6 weeks in case of nitrosoureas and mitomycin C), immunotherapy or any other pharmacological treatment and/or radiotherapy; 6. Age ≥ 18 years; 7. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months; 8. ECOG (Developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%); 9. Patients must have adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function, as evidenced by the following within 7 days of study treatment initiation : normal organ function as defined below : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 Giga/L Platelets ≥ 100 Giga/L Hemoglobin≥ 9 g/dL Serum creatinin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥30 ml/min/1.73m2 according to the modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) ≤2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN in patient with liver involvement of their cancer). If Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 ULN, hepatic isoenzymes 5nucleotidase or GGT tests must be performed; hepatic isoenzymes 5nucleotidase must be within the normal range and/or GGT &lt; 1.5 x ULN lipase ≤1.5 x ULN. Spot urine must not show 1+ or more protein in urine or the patient will require a repeat urine analysis. If repeat urinalysis shows 1+ protein or more, a 24hour urine collection will be required and must show total protein excretion &lt;1000 mg/24 hours 10. International Normalized Ratio(INR)/ Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) ≤1.5 x ULN; 1. Prior treatment with any VEGFR inhibitor; 2. Soft tissue sarcoma; 3. Other cancer (different histology) within 5 years prior to randomization; 4. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, significant trauma, within the last 28 days before randomization; 5. Cardiovascular dysfunction: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]) ≥ 2 Myocardial infarction &lt;6 months before study Cardiac arrhythmias requiring therapy Uncontrolled hypertension Unstable angina or newonset angina 6. Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within the last 6 months before randomization; 7. Severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh C); 8. Ongoing infection &gt; Grade 2 according to NCICTCAE v4.0; 9. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 10. Active hepatitis B or C or chronic hepatitis B or C requiring treatment with antiviral therapy ; 11. Difficulties with swallowing study tablets; 12. Interstitial lung disease with ongoing signs and symptoms at the time of informed consent; 13. Nonhealing wound, nonhealing ulcer, or nonhealing bone fracture; 14. Patients with evidence or history of any bleeding diathesis, irrespective of severity; 15. Any hemorrhage or bleeding event ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior to the start of study medication.</criteria>
