	<brief_summary>The mechanism of β cell destruction in Type 1 diabetes is not exactly known, Our hyphotesis is that interferon gamma, interleukin-2 and tumor necrotizan factor alpha have impotant roles in β cell destruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Roles of T Helper 1 Cytokines in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T helper (h)1 cells are known to have important roles in the destruction or/and dedifferentiation of β-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Significant increase in IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells in the pancreas and in the serum levels were determined in type 1 diabetic patients at diabetes oneset. This data indicated that this proinflammatory mediator serve as a biomarker of advanced autoimmunity. We aimed to investigate the relationship between Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and T1D and the effect of those cytokines on β-cell function.</detailed_description>
