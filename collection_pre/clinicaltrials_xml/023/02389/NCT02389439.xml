	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, single arm, open-labelled clinical trial. The total number subjects will be 145 patients to receive Pyronaridine-artesunate once daily for 3 days. Dosing will be according to the body weight. All patients will have a blood smear examined daily during the first week by microscopy until parasite clearance (2 consecutive negative slides on two consecutive days; both asexual and sexual stages). A negative blood slide will be defined as parasite count negative per 1000 WBC in two consecutive days. The sample on day 3 will be taken as close as possible to 72h after the initial blood smear. Participant will follow up for 42 days to assess the drug efficacy and safety (Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42).</brief_summary>
