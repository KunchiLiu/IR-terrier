	<brief_summary>Part A: This is a phase Ib trial combining the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib with the PI3K inhibitors taselisib, or pictilisib. There are two treatment arms during the dose escalation phase where patients will receive either taselisib OR pictilisib in combination with palbociclib. Palbociclib, taselisib and pictilisib can all be given orally once daily with food, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off schedule. Once the MTD is reached, the combination with the optimum safety and PK/PD profile will be taken forward to the dose expansion phase (Part B). Part B1: At the MTD dose expansion, fulvestrant will be administered in addition to palbociclib and taselisib or pictilisib orally once daily, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off schedule in the ER+ve HER2-ve PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cohort. Fulvestrant will be given intramuscularly on Day 1, Day 15 in cycle one followed by Day 1 for all subsequent cycles. Part B2: At the MTD dose expansion, patients with PIK3CA mutant advanced solid tumours will be treated with palbociclib and taselisib or pictilisib orally once daily, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off schedule.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a phase Ib trial of palbociclib in combination with either taselisib or pictilisib. The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part A), and an MTD dose expansion phase (Part B). Part A: will investigate escalating doses of palbociclib with either pictilisib or taselisib administered orally, continuously for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in patients with advanced solid tumours recruited simultaneously into two parallel arms (up to 24 patients in each arm with a maximum of 48 patients in Part A). Once the MTD is determined the combination with the optimum safety and PK/PD profile as determined by the SRC will be taken forward to the dose expansion phase (Part B). Part B: The MTD dose expansion phase will be conducted using the optimal combination from Part A in two parallel arms as follows: B1: Patients (n=25) with PIK3CA mutant ER + HER2-ve advanced breast cancers will be treated with a triplet combination of palbociclib and either taselisib or pictilisib along with fulvestrant. Part B1 will require at least two of the first 15 patients to respond to progress to recruit the full 25 patients. B2: Patients (n=20) with PIK3CA mutant advanced solid tumours including at least 8 patients with PIK3CA mutant ER negative and/or HER2 positive breast cancers will be treated with the doublet combination of palbociclib and either taselisib or pictilisib. Other cancers with relevant genetic aberrations (e.g. KRAS mutations) may be considered, depending on emerging preclinical and clinical data on these novel antitumour agents. In total, it is expected that a minimum of 70 and up to a maximum of 93 patients will be enrolled into the trial, the final number will depend on the number of dose escalations required to reach DLT. If &lt; 48 patients are enrolled in Part A, investigators will be permitted to enrol &gt; 45 patients in Part B, providing the maximum number of patients remains ≤93 patients across the study. The anticipated accrual rate during the dose escalation phase is estimated at 2 patients per month. Accrual in the expansion phase is estimated at 4 patients per month across 2 centres. It is expected that the trial will have a duration of recruitment of 12 to 24 months.</detailed_description>

PIK3CA mutation may be assessed in archival tumour samples, fresh tumour samples, or in circulating free DNA extracted from plasma or serum. A mutation will be considered pathogenic if described to be recurrent somatic mutation in COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/). Other cancers with relevant genetic aberrations (e.g. KRAS mutations) may be considered, depending on emerging preclinical and clinical data on these novel antitumour agents 2.

Palliative radiotherapy is acceptable if given for bony metastases as long as these are not indicative of disease progression. Study drug must be stopped 3 days before radiotherapy and restarted within 28 days, as long as bone marrow function has returned to normal. 2. Patients with prior exposure to both a CDK4/6 inhibitor and a PI3K/ATK/mTOR inhibitor are excluded from the study. Patients with prior exposure to either a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor OR a CDK4/6 inhibitor (but not both) are allowed entry into the trial provided that adverse effects have recovered to grade 1 or less. Prior exposure to fulvestrant is permitted. 3. Clinically significant abnormalities of glucose metabolism as defined by any of the following: Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus types I or II (irrespective of management). Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥7.0% at screening Fasting Plasma Glucose ≥ 8.3mmol/L at screening. Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours. 4. DLCO ≤ 50% of predicted value corrected for hematocrit prior to initiation of study treatment. 5. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments ≥ grade 1. Exceptions to this are alopecia or certain other toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator should not exclude the patient. 6. History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption. For example active intestine inflammation (e.g., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) requiring immunosuppressive therapy. 7. History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) 8. Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills, or (for patients receiving fulvestrant) receive IM injections. 9.

Clinically significant history of liver disease, including cirrhosis, current alcohol abuse, or current known active infection with hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. Active infection is defined as requiring treatment with antiviral therapy or presence of positive test results for Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or total Hb core antibody [antiHBc]) or Hepatitis C (Hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody). Unless required by local regulations, patients are not required to have HIV, HCB, or HCV assessments at screening if these assessments have not been previously performed. Patients who are positive for antiHBc are eligible only if testing is also positive for Hepatitis B surface antibody [HbsAb] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HBV DNA. Patients who are positive for HCV serology are eligible only if testing for HCV RNA is negative. 15.
