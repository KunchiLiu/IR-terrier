	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical performance of resin-based composite Class I and II restorations in association with Biosilicate. Methods: Eighty patients with carious lesions will be receive restorations in premolars and molars, which will be randomly allocated in four experimental groups: G1 (Biosilicate, Adper Single Bond 2 and IPS Empress Direct composite), G2 (Adper Single Bond 2 and IPS Empress Direct composite), G3 (Biosilicate, AdheSe and IPS Empress Direct composite) e G4 (AdheSE and IPS Empress Direct composite) — (n= 20 per group). Two trainer and calibrated evaluators fully blinded to the restorative technique used will be evaluate the restorations at 1 week (baseline), at 6, 12 and 18 months after placement using World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria. Data will be statistically analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Biosilicate Under Resin Composite Restorations in Caries Affected Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Dental caries has decreased in recent years, but is still the main oral health problem in developed and undeveloped industrialized countries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical performance of resin-based composite Class I and II restorations in association with Biosilicate. Methods: Eighty patients with carious lesions will be receive restorations in premolars and molars, which will be randomly allocated in four experimental groups: G1 (Biosilicate, AdperSingle Bond 2 and IPS Empress Direct composite), G2 (Adper Single Bond 2 and IPS Empress Direct composite), G3 (Biosilicate, AdheSe and IPS Empress Direct composite) e G4 (AdheSE and IPS Empress Direct composite) — (n= 20 per group). To participate in the clinical trial, qualified subjects must meet for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixty-four (64) selected volunteers will be fully informed on the nature of the study and after had signed a Term of Acceptance defined by the Ethics Committee (FORP - USP), they will be invited to participate. Carious teeth will be cleaned with a pumice-water slurry and rubber cup to remove salivary pellicle and any bacterial plaque. As much as possible, local anesthesia will be. After caries removal (high and low-speed handpieces under abundant water irrigation), patients will be allocated randomly in the four experimental groups cited above. Final contouring and polishing of the restorations will be performed at the same appointment, using a fine-grit diamond bur (KG Sorensen), silicon carbide polisher (Viking Kit, KG Sorensen), silicone rubber tips (Viking Kit, KG Sorensen) flexible discs (Sof-Lex, 3M ESPE), and polishing pastes (Diamond Excel, FGM). Two trained and calibrated evaluators, fully blinded to the restorative techniques used, will be evaluating the restorations at baseline (one week after placement of restorations), after 06, 12 and 18 months using FDI criteria. All restorations will be photographed at every evaluation point. Esthetic, Functional and Biological proprieties will be used as key parameters determining the overall clinical success. Data will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
