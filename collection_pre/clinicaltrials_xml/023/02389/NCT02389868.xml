	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects induced by the cholesterol-reducing drug Lovastatin on the platelet proteome of healthy volunteers. Our results may allow to recognize the cell signalling modifications induced by Lovastatin. Furthermore, the current study aims to characterize the biological and inter-individual variation of platelet's proteome as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Lastly, the exploration of changes induced by Lovastatin on the platelet's proteome may allow the discovery of modifications relative to the effects of statins on hemostasis and the lipid profile.</brief_summary>

In regard of the lipid profile at the first visit, patients that are not comprised between the 5th and the 95th percentile for LDL, HDL or Total cholesterol will be excluded.
