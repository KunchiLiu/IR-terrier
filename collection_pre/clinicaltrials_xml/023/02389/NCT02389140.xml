	<brief_title>Blood Flow Within Active Myofascial Trigger Points Following Massage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physiological response at the myofascial trigger point (MTrP) to massage is not known, yet would provide important objective evidence for a treatment effect and clarify the resolution process of a MTrP. The long-term goal is to understand how therapeutic intervention affects the physiology of the MTrP. The objective of the proposed research is to assess, in a placebo controlled trial, the effectiveness of trigger point release massage (also known as ischemic compression) on blood flow at an active MTrP. The central hypothesis is that the contraction nodule of an active MTrP is characterized by an ischemic state comprised of reduced blood flow and subsequent dysregulation in carbohydrate metabolism. The investigators hypothesize that trigger point release (TPR) can positively impact blood flow leading to a change in high energy carbohydrate tension. The present study has been formulated, in part, from a preliminary study conducted by the investigators, which supports reduced blood flow and physiological disruption at active MTrPs. The proposed research will provide a physiological basis for massage to corroborate subjective reports of reduced pain sensitivity, impart credibility to treatment techniques, and provide insight into a mechanism of action for healing the MTrP.</detailed_description>
