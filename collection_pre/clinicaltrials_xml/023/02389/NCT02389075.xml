	<brief_summary>This study plans to learn more about the relationship between systemic autoimmune disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondyloarthritis, bacteria in the colon, and the changes in colon tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Colonic Microbiome and Mucosal Immunity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes in human gut bacteria has been shown in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The gut flora in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an arthritis that can occur with IBD, has not been well studied. The immune cells in the colon directly interface with bacteria and may be influenced by them. The interactions between the colon immune system, bacteria and autoimmunity hasn't been studied. The study goal is to specifically study the link between bacteria, the colonic immune system, and the autoimmune diseases of AS and IBD. This will be done by collecting clinical data by questionnaires, blood samples, colonic tissue during endoscopy, and microbiome data in subjects with IBD, AS, and controls.</detailed_description>
