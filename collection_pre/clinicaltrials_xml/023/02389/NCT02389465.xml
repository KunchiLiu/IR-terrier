	<brief_summary>Over 18% of Americans aged 65 years and older have depression. Recent evidence suggests that there is a link between depression and inflammatory disease. This study investigates the relationship between inflammation in the brain and depression. Comparing biological and psychological differences in depressed and non-depressed people allows researchers to find better ways to treat and prevent depression. All participants will have: neuropsych tests, an EKG, a spinal tap, a blood draw, and, if depressed, given either an antidepressant or placebo for eight weeks. The investigators are trying to correlate brain function with depression levels and biomarkers from the blood and spinal fluid.</brief_summary>
