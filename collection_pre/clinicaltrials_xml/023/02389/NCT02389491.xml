	<brief_title>Effect of a High Density Formula on Growth and Safety in Congenital Heart Disease Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of infants born with CHD increases every year and most CHD infants are suffered with malnutrition.Recent studies have shown that increasing energy intake in CHD infants can improve their nutrition status.But there are no high qualified evidences supporting that high density formula can promote infants' nutrition status and ensure its safety. The hypothesis of the current study is that high density formula intake can increase infants'weight and it's safe. The current study adopts randomized,controlled intervention trial, gives high density formula(Infatrini,100kcal/100ml)to CHD infants in intervention group and normal density formula（Neocate,67kcal/100ml）in control group. Intervention begins when infants start enteral nutrition after operation and continues for 7days.</detailed_description>
