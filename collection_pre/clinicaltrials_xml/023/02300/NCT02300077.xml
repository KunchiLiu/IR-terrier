	<brief_summary>The Î¼-opioid receptor agonist methadone is frequently used in adult anesthesia and adult pain therapy. Methadone has an extremely long half-life, which confers therapeutic advantage by providing more stable plasma concentrations and long-lasting pain relief. Methadone perioperative pharmacokinetics and effectiveness in perioperative pain relief in inpatients is well characterized. There is, however, no information on methadone use in an ambulatory surgery setting and outpatient procedures. This pilot investigation will determine effectiveness of intraoperative methadone in reducing postoperative opioid consumption and providing improved pain relief in patients undergoing moderately painful, ambulatory surgical procedures.</brief_summary>
