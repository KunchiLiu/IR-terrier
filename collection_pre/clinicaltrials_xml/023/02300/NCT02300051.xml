	<brief_title>Intervention Study for Individuals With Compulsive Sexual Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will compare three groups of patients under the three interventions, namely, (1) Short-Term Psychodynamic Group Psychotherapy (STPGP) followed by Relapse Prevention Group Therapy (RPGT) (n = 48) vs. (2) Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 42) vs. (3) both previous interventions combined (n = 45). The STPGP is a 16 weekly session's group psychotherapy. Each session lasts 90 minutes. Each group will consist of around 10 participants. All the groups of STPGP will be conducted by the same psychotherapist. The RPGT is an eight weekly therapy group. The sessions are structured and will last 90 minutes. The medication used by those who are under TAU will be introduced through psychiatric care. Initially three visits will occur at intervals of 30 days and the followings will occur with an interval of 60 days. The medication protocol includes serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) or mood stabilizers (topiramate, divalproex sodium, oxcarbazepine) or both type of medications combined. All patients will be assessed on the outcomes and independent variables in the baseline (time 0); in the 25th week (time 1); and 34th week (time 2) of treatment.</detailed_description>
