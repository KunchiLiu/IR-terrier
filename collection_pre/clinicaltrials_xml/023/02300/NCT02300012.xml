	<brief_summary>Incident rates of ACL rupture are greatest in 16-39 year olds at almost 1 in 1,000. Performance Based Investigations (PBIs) can be used to evaluate and select correct approaches to patient treatment, and biochemical, biomechanical and physiological biomarkers in other conditions are sensitive in distinguishing between disease state severities, type of injuries and responsiveness to treatment. Despite the measurement sensitivity of PBIs, these are not widely used possibly owing to their focus postoperatively where benefits are less worthwhile. This study aims to investigate novel biomarkers as performance based investigations (PBIs) to improve surgical and treatment strategies in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) patients. The objectives are to identify whether biomarkers, collected before and after operations, can: 1) Assist the surgeon in decision making; 2) Lead to improved prognosis; 3) Be used to predict the outcomes of prognosis, and; 4) Correlate with disease signs/ smoking to help further understand ACL injuries.</brief_summary>
