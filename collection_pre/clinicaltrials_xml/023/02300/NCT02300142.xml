	<brief_summary>This is a voluntary study to allow subjects who received placebo while on GEN-003-002 to be randomized, in a blinded manner, to 1 of 6 active combinations of GEN-003 and Matrix-M2. Objectives: - To compare the impact on clinical Herpes Simplex Virus type-2 (HSV-2) disease among 6 different combinations of GEN-003 antigens and Matrix-M2 adjuvant measured by: - Time to first clinical and/or virologic recurrence after Dose 3 (Day 43) - Proportion of subjects who are recurrence free at 6 and 12 months after the last dose of vaccine - Lesion rate (percent of days with genital lesions present) during the post-vaccination follow-up period - Antiviral use. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GEN-003 in combination with Matrix-M2.</brief_summary>

On suppressive antiviral medication within 7 days prior to the first dose of Study Drug. 2. Collection of less than 45 anogenital swabs during Days 43 to 71 of the GEN003002 study. 3.

Immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids (more than 20 mg of prednisone given daily or on alternative days for 2 weeks or more within 6 months prior to the first dose of Study Drug, any dose of corticosteroids within 30 days of the first dose of Study Drug, or high dose inhaled corticosteroids [&gt; 960 μg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent]) or other immunosuppressive agents. 5. Presence or history of autoimmune disease, regardless of current treatment. 6. Positive serologic test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV1) or hepatitis C infection (in the absence of a negative PCR result); positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within 6 months prior to the first dose of Study Drug. 7. Clinically significant laboratory abnormality or a value ≥ Grade 2 within 56 days prior to the first dose of Study Drug. 8. Receipt of blood products within 90 days prior to the first dose of Study Drug. 9. Receipt of a live vaccine within 28 days prior to or a subunit vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of Study Drug or planned vaccination within 30 days following the last dose of Study Drug. 10. Pregnant or nursing women. 11. History of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of the study. 12. Other active, uncontrolled comorbidities that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study requirements. NOTE: Subjects who are taking a medication to control an underlying comorbidity may be enrolled if there have been no changes to their medication within 60 days prior to the first dose of Study Drug.</criteria>
