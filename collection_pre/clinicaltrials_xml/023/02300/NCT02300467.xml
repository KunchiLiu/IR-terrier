	<brief_summary>The purpose of this open-label, dose-escalation phase I trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles and to assess the efficacy of NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet), a novel vascular disrupting agent, in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet) for Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular disrupting agents are expected to kill cancer cells located in core of tumor tissues by disrupting microvascular structure of tumor. To assess the safety and tolerability of NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet), patients with advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled in this study. Initial dose of NOV120401 (CKD-516 Tablet) is 5 mg/day, which will be escalated until at least 2 of 6 subjects show dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Pharmacokinetic profiles and efficacy by tumor response and vascular disrupting activities will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
