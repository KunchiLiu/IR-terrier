	<brief_title>Diet for Colonoscopy Preparation in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive diabetic patients undergoing an ambulatory colonoscopy at the participating sites will be randomized to follow one of two different sets of dietary recommendations. The experimental group will be asked to start a low-residue diet 4 days before the procedure, during which the therapy for diabetes will be adjusted. The control group will be asked to follow a low-residue diet for 3 days followed by a liquid diet during the day before the procedure, and no adjustments will be made to their usual treatment. Colon cleansing will be undertaken with polyethylene glycol (4 liters in the usual split administration scheme) in both groups. Analogic visual scales and standardized questionnaires on various aspects that may influence the degree of satisfaction about the preparation will be answered by the participants and collected before the colonoscopy. The endoscopist, blinded to the preparation method, will grade the adequacy of the preparation. Adverse events will be recorded up to 1 month after the procedure</detailed_description>
