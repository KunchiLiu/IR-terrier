	<brief_title>Distance Savvy: Testing Tele-Savvy, a Distance Dementia Family Caregiver Education Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot project proposed will allow the investigators to use telehealth methods to deliver the Savvy Caregiver, an evidence-based dementia caregiver psychoeducation program, to family caregivers of community-dwelling persons with dementing illnesses (PWD) for whom attending in-person meetings poses difficulties. The program - named Tele-Savvy - uses iPad and PC technology and on-line conferencing capacity to deliver the program through daily asynchronous self-learning modules and weekly, hour-long synchronous group meetings with program facilitators. Tele-Savvy addresses all of the learning objectives of the current in-person Savvy program (Savvy entails in-person participation in six weekly two-hour group sessions).</detailed_description>
