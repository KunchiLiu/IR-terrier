Acute low back pain due to vertebral collapse or neoplastic, inflammatory (ankylosing spondylitis), traumatic, or infective origins. 5. Abnormal findings in at least one of the following assessments: Achilles tendon reflex, patella reflex, heel walking, toe walking, cutaneous sensitivity of the legs (including gluteal region), paresis tests in supine position upon dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, hip flexion, knee extension. 6. Neurogenic Bladder and/or rectum dysfunction. 7. Any condition, disease or concomitant treatment that in the judgement of the investigator will affect the patient's ability to participate in the clinical trial or which will influence the trial methodology used. 8. Negative experience in the past with heat treatment for muscle complaints (e. g. hot water bottle, heat pads, hyperemisationinducing topical creams, ointments or patches). 9. Patients with history of treatment of back pain with centrally acting drugs (e.g. opioids) and muscle relaxants within 6 months prior to enrolment. 10. Surgery due to back pain or rehabilitation due to back pain in the last 12 months. 11. Spinal injection back pain treatment within 6 months prior to enrolment. 12. Intake of antidepressant/antipsychotic medication within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. 13. Treatment of the recent low back pain period with oral analgesics for more than 4 consecutive days. 14. Locally applied medication to the back within 24 hours prior to enrolment (topical treatments, injections). 15.

Administration of other analgesics within 12 h prior to enrolment (exception: acetylsalicylic acid [ASS] up to 100 mg/daily for antiplateletaggregation therapy). 17. Nonpharmacological low back pain treatment (physiotherapy, heat treatment [e.g. hot water bottle, heat patch], or massages) within 12 hours prior to enrolment. 18. Participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. 19. History of treatment of back pain with centrally acting drugs (e.g. opioids) and muscle relaxants. 20. Treatment of the recent low back pain period with oral analgesics for more than 4 consecutive days. 21. Surgery due to back pain or rehabilitation due to back pain in the last 12 months. 22. Spinal injection back pain treatment within 6 months prior to enrolment. 23. Intake of antidepressant/antipsychotic medication within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. 24.

History of abuse of alcohol/drugs within six months prior to enrolment. 29. Acute and relapsed chronic kidney diseases. 30. Severe hepatocellular insufficiency. 31. Pregnant or nursing women, including female patients with positive ßHCG test at Visit 1. 32. Female patients of childbearing potential not using highly effective method of birth control. 33. Patients who are currently participating in another trial or who have been participating in another trial within one month prior to Visit 1, and patients who have previously been randomised in this trial.</criteria>
