	<brief_summary>Use of SeQuent® Please drug coated balloon (DCB) is effective to treat patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). However, whether the type of pre-dilatation balloon prior to DCB dilatation impacts on clinical and angiographic outcomes or not is unknown. Lacrosse® Non-slip element balloon (NSE) is a balloon catheter with 3 longitudinal plastic elements which are attached to proximal and distal balloon edges. NSE is developed to incise neointimal tissue and avoid balloon slippage without vitiating balloon derivability and crossability. We investigated angiographic and clinical outcomes following normal non-compliant balloon or NSE dilatation prior to DCB dilatation in ISR lesions.This study is a single blinded, multicenter, randomized trial. Total 200 patients with ISR are randomly assigned to treat with non-compliant balloon or NSE before DCB dilatation. Optical coherence tomographic (OCT) analysis are performed before pre-dilatation and after DCB dilatation Follow-up angiography analysis are planned at 8 months in all patients. Clinical follow-up is planned at 8 and 24 months.Primary endpoint is angiographic in-segment late loss at 8 months.</brief_summary>
