	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of eleclazine on shortening of the corrected QT interval (QTc), safety, and tolerability in adults with type 3 long QT syndrome (LQT3). During the single-blind treatment period (24 weeks), participants will receive eleclazine and/or eleclazine placebo. Following the single-blind treatment period, participants who have not permanently discontinued study drug will be eligible, at the discretion of the investigator, to continue receiving eleclazine during an open-label extension phase.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Individuals with an established diagnosis of LQT3 (by genotype testing) Mean (of triplicate) QTc interval ≥ 480 msec (or ≥ 460 msec, for individuals who are currently taking ranolazine or Class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as mexiletine) at 3 or more time points, determined by standard 12lead ECG, at screening Key Known mutations associated with type 1 long QT syndrome (LQT1) or type 2 long QT syndrome (LQT2) Known or suspected history of seizures or epilepsy History of heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV and/or known left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 45% Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m^2 at screening Severe renal impairment at screening (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m^2, using the 4 Variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, as determined by the study center) Abnormal liver function tests at screening, defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN An aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) implantation, syncopal episode, or appropriate ICD therapy within 3 months prior to screening Any other condition or circumstance that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude compliance with the study protocol Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
