	<brief_title>Early Mobilization for Critical Patients on Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single blind randomized controlled trial (the MoVe ICU study) will be conducted to evaluate the effects on critical patients on invasive mechanical ventilation of early mobilization with a cycle ergometer. Patients (age &gt; 18 years) will be recruited for this study from among those admitted to the intensive care department at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. Eligible patients will have been on invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 to 48 hours, will have spent maximum of 1 week in hospital and will not exhibit any characteristics restricting lower extremity mobility. These subjects will be randomized to receive either conventional physiotherapy or conventional physiotherapy with an additional cycle ergometer intervention. The intervention will be administered passively for 20 minutes, at 20 revolutions per minute, once per day, throughout the time the patients remain on invasive mechanical ventilation.</detailed_description>
