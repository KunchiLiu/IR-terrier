	<brief_summary>Optimization the cuff pressure of the laryngeal tube (LT) in relation of the mechanical ventilation, and the reduction of potential leakage mucosal trauma. Comparison of the tightness of LT between the filling volume specified by the manufacturer (connectors are color coded syringe and blocker), 60cmH₂O, 50cmH₂O, 40cmH₂Ound 30cmH₂O. The measurement of the leakage occurs in ml / kg body weight.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ventilation of both cuffs of the laryngeal tube by using the color coding of syringe and connector is a simple, fast and easy way to stabilize the tube and secure seal against the surrounding tissue. The user of this method has only knowledge of the volume (ml), with which the cuff is vented, but not over the cuff pressure (cmH₂O) itself. Permanently high pressures can cause to a lesions to necrosis in the adjacent tissue, on the other hand, the material of the bulging cuff fits less well the anatomy of the patient, leading to leaks in the breathing circuit. Studies of pediatric anesthesia show that on 40cmH₂O reduces the volume of the leak in the laryngeal mask airway by reducing the cuff pressure and the ventilation is improved in sequence. In the proposed study, the volume of leakage at the fill volume specified by the manufacturer (color coding), 60cmH₂O, 50cmH₂O, 40cmH₂O and 30cmH₂O to be captured.</detailed_description>
