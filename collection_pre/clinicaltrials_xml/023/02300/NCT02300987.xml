	<mesh_term>Teratoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Diagnosis of teratoma for which no additional standard surgical or medical therapy exists Patients must have completed at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy for germ cell tumor (except patients who present with primary pure teratoma who need not have received any previous chemotherapy) Radiographic progression, defined by RECIST v.1.1, after the last cancer treatment and within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, compared with scans within 1 year of enrollment. Availability of an archival or newly obtained tumor sample (collected at diagnosis or progression) with accompanying pathology report Meaurable or evaluable extracranial disease as defined by RECIST v 1.1 Malignant germ cell tumors with mixed histology such as embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor or seminoma. Note this refers to the histology at the time of enrollment, not the histolgy at the time of initial presentation. Pathologic evidence of malignant transformation CNS disease unless radiation therapy and/or surgery has been completed and serial evaluation demonstrates stable disease Prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy Systemic antineoplastic therapy or any experimental therapy within 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug (6 weeks for prior nitrosoureas, bevacizumab, or mitomycin C) Major surgery ≤ 2 weeks or radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to planned start of study drug or patient has not recovered from major side effects. Requirement for treatment with any of the prohibited medications including strong CYP3A inhibitors, strong CYP3A inducers, CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and medications with strong risk of QT prolongation Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
