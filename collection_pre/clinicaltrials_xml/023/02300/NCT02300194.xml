	<brief_summary>Introduction: Opioids, such as morphine, act at receptors in the central nervous system, but many studies have suggested direct action peripherally on opioid receptors in sensory neurons terminals, melanocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts. These receptors are stimulated when occurs inflammatory processes. Hypothesis: Treatment with topical morphine 0.1% applied 30 minutes before an invasive procedure, decreases pain in children. Method: A randomised double-blind parallel study to evaluate the effect of topical application of a 0.1% morphine gel in patients undergo a procedure. 22 patients in each group will be included. Randomly assigned to either the morphine gel or a placebo hydrogel, it will be applied 30 minutes before the procedure and the first day every 4 hours. General basic sedation and systemic analgesia will give for all the patients. Efficacy of treatment will be measured with "Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale" (FLACC scale).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use of an opioid such as morphine topical gel 30 minutes before a procedure would be effective in reducing pain in children. It has proven effective analgesic with minimal adverse effects, especially in children older than 6 months, and even its use is authorized in young children.</detailed_description>
