	<brief_summary>The first purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of itraconazole (and possibly diltiazem) on the amount of LY2623091 in the blood stream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. The second purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of LY2623091 on the amount of simvastatin (and possibly tadalafil) in the blood stream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. The safety and tolerability of LY2623091 when given with itraconazole, simvastatin and diltiazem or tadalafil will be evaluated. There will be three groups of participants in this study. Results from Groups 1 and 2 will be analyzed during the study to determine whether to enroll participants in Group 3 or 4. The study is expected to last up to 40 days from the first dose to follow-up (inclusive). Screening may occur up to 28 days prior to enrollment.</brief_summary>
