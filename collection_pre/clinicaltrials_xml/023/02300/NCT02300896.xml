	<brief_summary>The current model of care for the hospitalized elderly patients has been conditioned by many factors unrelated to the disease process that caused the hospitalization and usually worsen the outcome of hospitalization circumstances. Many times hospitalized elderly patients spend most of the time in bed (even higher than 83% of bed rest versus 4% of those who stand or are walking). These patients have their functional and physiological reserve reduced which makes them more vulnerable to the effects of being bedridden. The consequences are at multiple levels emphasizing the functional loss or cognitive impairment, longer stays, mortality and institutionalization, delirium, deconditioning, pressure ulcers and decreased caloric intake, social isolation, poor quality of life and increased use of resources related to health. Exercise training can prevent functional and cognitive decline and modify even the posterior trajectory.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional and Cognitive Impairment Prevention for Elderly Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in a Department of Geriatrics of a tertiary public hospital with 35 beds allocated. Hospitalized patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Patient recruitment will begin in the first 48 hours of admission to the ward, which will be identified through the list of patients admitted to the hospital and assigned to the Department of Geriatrics. The doctor who decides the inclusion in the intervention or control group will not be the attending physician. Patients or their families (if the patient has cognitive impairment) will be informed of the random inclusion in one group, but will not be informed as to which they belong. Randomization will be performed by applying http://www.randomizer.org/. The information in both the intervention group and the control group will obtained in four different stages: the initial visit and at months 3, 6 and 12 after hospital discharge.</detailed_description>
