	<detailed_description>Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to any study procedure. There are four stages to this study: 1. a telephone interview, 2. an in-person interview and completion of questionnaires, 3. an in-home single night sleep recording, and 4. two weeks of computerized cognitive testing, subjective sleep and pain recordings, and wearing a Actiwatch. During the telephone interview, participants will be asked question about their age, sleep, pain, and medical/mental health history. At a second visit, participants will complete a more in-depth interview of their physical health, mental health, sleep, and pain history. They will complete a brief test of their cognitive functioning. They will also complete 4 questionnaires about their time of day preference and mood. At the third visit, participants will visit the University of Florida to be connected to a machine which will monitor their sleep. Participants will return home to sleep while still connected to the machine and will return the machine to the University of Florida the next day. Participants will complete brief computerized daily questionnaires of sleep and pain and cognitive testing in the morning and evening, and and wear an actigraph (wristwatch-like device) that measures arm movements and ambient light for two weeks.</detailed_description>
