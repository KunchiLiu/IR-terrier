	<brief_title>Randomized, Multi-center Clinical Trial Comparing Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Boost to Conventionally Fractionated Combined With Androgen Deprivation Therapy in a High Risk Group of Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Additional objectives of the study for high-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer patients are as follows: 1. Analysis of number of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood as a prognostic/predictive factors for survival. 2. Analysis of miRNA expression levels (100, 141 and 143) in peripheral blood as a prognostic and predictive factors. 3. Evaluation of the usefulness expression of selected proteins (PTEN, SMAD4, Cyclin D1, SPP1) as prognostic and predictive factors. 4. Evaluation of the usefulness of the expression level of antigen-specific T cells, B-and NK cells as a prognostic factors. 5. Evaluation of usefulness of the fiducial markers for localizing the prostate gland position during irradiation for the selected control imaging methods (2DkV, CBCT, MVCT).</detailed_description>
