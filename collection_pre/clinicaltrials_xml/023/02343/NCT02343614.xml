	<brief_summary>The treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is problematic given the variable natural history of the disease. Although contemporary treatment options are limited, new targets and new approaches are under investigation for preventing bladder cancer recurrence and progression. Among those, COX-2 is a promising target since plays an important role in urothelial carcinogenesis and iCOX-2 selective inhibitors, like celecoxib, effectively inhibit tumor development and growth and enhances survival, in bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, the investigators conducted a pilot study of celecoxib to prevent recurrence in patients with intermediate risk NMIBC.</brief_summary>
