	<brief_summary>The present study proposes to utilize a novel, wearable device, QI Device, which has multiple sensors embedded in a "wrist-watch" in order to explore its monitoring capabilities in individuals with congestive heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of the QI Device for Monitoring of Patients With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The QI Device is a self-contained, reusable, rechargeable, battery-powered, wrist-watch that simultaneously tracks and records a number of physiological health related parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and motion/position. One advantage of this device over current home diagnostic systems is the capability for longitudinal monitoring.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults over age 18 Own, and comfortable using, a home computer with internet access (Phase 2 only) Acute hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) diagnosed on the basis of all of the following: 1. Symptoms: Onset or worsening of dyspnea within the past 2 weeks 2. Physical exam (at least 1 present): Rales/ Crackles on auscultation Elevated JVP &gt; 10 cmH2O Weight gain LE edema 3. Diagnostic imaging/ labs (at least 1 present): Evidence of pulmonary congestion or edema on chest Xray/ chest CT Elevated BNP or NTproBNP (ageadjusted) Psychological or social situation that would make the study difficult for the patient Inability to consent Chronic atrial fibrillation or other dysrhythmia with a high (&gt;10%) burden of ectopic beats. Pregnant women Pneumonia currently, or within the past 30 days Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (e.g. ARDS) Interstitial lung disease Endstage renal disease and on Hemodialysis</criteria>
