	<brief_title>Is the Efficacy of Epidural Steroid Injections Related to the Different Volume Injections?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: This study was aimed to investigate the impact of using different epidural volumes. Methods: Seventy five patients with acute discogenic pain were included in the study.The patients were randomly assigned to three groups. All patients received a single epidural dose of triamcinolone [80 mg] and 12.5 mg bupivacaine combination. The patients in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 received a volume of 10 mL, 15 mL, and 20 mL by epidural injections, respectively. The efficacy of treatment was assessed with VAS (visual analog scale) [O= no pain, 10 = unbearable pain], SLET(straight leg elevation test) [0° = worst, 85° = best], and Oswestry Disability Index; ODI [0% to 20%:minimal disability , 80% to 100%:bed bound patients] before and 2 weeks after the EPSI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>acute discogenic pain with less than three months duration not responding to other modalities of conservative management [NSAIDs, physiotherapy, bracing, etc.], radiological disc bulging accompanying unilateral root impingement symptoms, an Oswestry daily activity score more than 20 percent, and resistance to treatment. Patients with bilateral root impingement symptoms, neurological deficits, and/or history of previous lumbar disc surgery, severe cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal diseases, glaucoma, urinary retention, and/or known allergy to the drugs used in the study were excluded from the study.</criteria>
