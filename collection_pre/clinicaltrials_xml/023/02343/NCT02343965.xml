	<brief_summary>Each year, 17000 cases of severe hematological diseases are diagnosed in France, with more than 6,000 of these requiring hospitalization in a protective, sterile environment. New methods, such as touch massage, have emerged in response to anxiety symptoms observed in patients in such sterile and isolated surroundings. We hypothesize that during the period of isolation, touch massage becomes a nursing care which can help the patient.</brief_summary>
