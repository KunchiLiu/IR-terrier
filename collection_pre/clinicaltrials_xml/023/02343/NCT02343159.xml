	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine whether a MEMS® cap with a LCD reader (a "smart" cap) along with additional patient counseling intervention (Arm 3) can improve adherence to dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment in MS patients as compared to a MEMS (Medication Event Monitoring System) cap without a LCD reader (a "standard" cap) and no patient counseling intervention (standard of care, Arm 1) at Month 12. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are: To determine if data display on a smart MEMS cap with a LCD reader (Arm 2) can improve adherence as compared to a standard MEMS cap without a LCD reader (Arm 1) at Month 12; To determine whether the addition of patient counseling intervention based on MEMS data (Arm 3), or data display from a MEMS cap with LCD reader (Arm 2) can improve adherence compared to standard MEMS cap without a LCD reader (Arm 1) at Month 6; To assess persistence and compliance at Months 6 and 12 for all arms; To assess the association between adherence and patient reported outcomes (PROs) for all arms including Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI): MS v2.0.</brief_summary>
