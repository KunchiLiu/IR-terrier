	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy of gemigliptin and vildagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin in terms of change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction. Secondary Objectives: To compare the safety and tolerability of gemigliptin and vildagliptin: - Number of patients who experience at least one episode of hypoglycemia. - Number of patients experiencing adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE). - Assessment of patients compliance defined as number tablets returned by patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Gemigliptin and Vildagliptin as Add-on Therapy to Metformin in People With Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled With Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of 2 weeks screening and 24 weeks of treatment (a total of 26 weeks). The protocol includes a screening period of two weeks, after which they will be randomized to receive gemigliptin or vildagliptin. Patients will be evaluated through 4 mandatory visits during the study. Visit 1: Week -2 (screening) Visit 2: Week 0 (randomization) Visit 3: Week 12 (efficacy and safety evaluation) Visit 4: Week 24 (efficacy and safety evaluation)</detailed_description>
