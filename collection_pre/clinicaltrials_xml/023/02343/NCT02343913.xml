	<brief_summary>This study is an additional component of protocol 6005, titled Simplifying Menstrual Regulation (MR): Exploring the role of at-home semi-quantitative pregnancy tests for follow-up to menstrual regulation service provision in Pakistan. The study seeks to pilot a self-assessment checklist that will help women, who receive medical services for incomplete abortion, correctly identify warning signs and symptoms and determine whether to return to the clinic. The checklist can serve as a useful resource to help with the timely identification of women who need additional care and can help streamline service delivery. In addition, this study will provide important data on the role of misoprostol at varying levels of health services offering an array of treatments for incomplete abortion.</brief_summary>
