	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in children and severely affects quality of life (QoL) of patients and their parents. The application of topical medications and emollient is the mainstay of the treatment, but complexity of the treatment and lack of self-care knowledge cause poor adherence, leading to therapeutic failure. Adequate education about the chronic disease and its treatment was known to improve the treatment adherence. There are a variety forms like generalized information leaflets and video clips for imparting information to patients and individualized tailoring education was considered more effective way to improve patients' adherence. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of tailored education in dermatology area, especially the emollient usage in patients with atopic dermatitis.</brief_summary>
