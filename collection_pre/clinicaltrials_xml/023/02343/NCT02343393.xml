	<brief_title>Nitrates In Combination With Hydralazine in cardiorEnal Syndrome (NICHE) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), where renal failure and heart failure (HF) co-exist in a vicious cycle, is a very common problem of great morbidity and mortality. The management of CRS is challenging as therapeutic options are mutually contradictory and largely empirical. Endothelial dysfunction from oxidative injury has recently emerged as a common link between the failing heart and kidneys in CRS. The endothelium plays an obligatory role in cardiovascular homeostasis, and impaired endothelium-mediated nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction. There is a high prevalence of endothelial dysfunction in our Asian HF patients, with a greater degree of dysfunction seen in those with CRS. We hypothesise that targeting endothelial dysfunction may improve clinical status among Asian patients with CRS. Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) increases NO bioavailability. Concomitant hydralazine (H) therapy prevents nitrate tolerance and protects NO from oxidative stress-induced degradation. The synergistic combination of H-ISDN is thought to exert beneficial effects on the endothelium. We aim to perform a prospective randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of H-ISDN therapy for 6 months on exercise capacity, endothelial function, renal function, clinical outcomes and quality of life (QOL) in Asian patients with CRS. Specifically, we hypothesise that H-ISDN therapy will lead to improvement in exercise capacity (6 minute walk test (6MWT)), endothelial dysfunction (assessed by non-invasive peripheral arterial tonometry(PAT)), renal function, cardiac structure and function, clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, HF hospitalisations) and QOL in Asian patients with CRS.</detailed_description>
