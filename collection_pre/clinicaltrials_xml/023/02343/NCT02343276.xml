	<brief_summary>Single-center study, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, with patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic catheterization via the transradial approach. Patients will be randomized into two groups: one group will receive the vasodilator nitroglycerin during the procedure (intervention group), and a second group will receive saline 0.9% in the same volume and time during the procedure (control group). Will be evaluated: incidence of spasms of the radial artery, ability to perform the procedure without the need to change the access site, pain presented by the patient, time and total radiation of the procedure.</brief_summary>
