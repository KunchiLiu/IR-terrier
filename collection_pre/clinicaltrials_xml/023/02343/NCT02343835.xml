	<brief_summary>This protocol will study the impact of Irreversible electroporation (IRE) on immune response in patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancers smaller than 5.0 cm. It will profile the immune response to IRE of unresectable pancreatic cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE will be determined and compared to pre-ablated pancreatic cancer specimens and historical control specimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-Tumor Immunity Induced by IRE of Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (≤5.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples will be used. After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS). The investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response.</detailed_description>

Blood pressure must be ≤160/95 mmHg at the time of screening on a stable antihypertensive regimen; Compromised liver function (e.g. signs of portal hypertension, INR &gt; 1,5 without use of anticoagulants, ascites); Uncontrolled infections (&gt; grade 2 NCICTC version 3.0); Pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start of treatment; Immunotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure; Chemotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure; Radiotherapy ≤ 6 weeks prior to the procedure; Concomitant use of anticonvulsive and antiarrhythmic drugs (other than beta blockers used for antihypertensive); Allergy to contrast media; Any implanted stimulation device; Any implanted metal stent/device within the area of ablation that cannot be removed; Any condition that is unstable or that could jeopardize the safety of the subject and their compliance in the study; Of note, patients with contraindications for MRI will not be excluded from participation: in this case radiologic followup will consist of CTscanning according to protocol.</criteria>
