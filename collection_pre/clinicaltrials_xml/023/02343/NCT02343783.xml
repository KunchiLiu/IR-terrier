	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the cell (the basic building block of all living things) populations and inflammatory (pain and swelling) mediator responses in suction skin blister fluid after allergic skin reaction (ASR) [rash] induction with D. Pteronyssinus [house dust mite (HDM)], Alternaria alternata, or Aspergillus fumigatus allergens in participants with atopic dermatitis (AD) [Skin rash, Eczema] or allergic asthma (AA) [breathing disorder in which there is a wheezing and difficulty breathing].</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Use of Induced Skin Blisters in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis, Allergic Asthma and Atopic Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an interventional (a treatment given during the course of a research study) and multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study. The study will consist of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (Up to 4 weeks), Data Collection Phase (9 days) and, Follow-up Phase (7 days). The maximum study duration for each participant will not exceed 43 days. Primarily, the cell populations and inflammatory mediator responses in suction skin blister fluid after allergic skin reaction (ASR) will be assessed. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
