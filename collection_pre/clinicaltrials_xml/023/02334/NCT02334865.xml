	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the safety of SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant together with sargramostim in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Vaccines made from survivin peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells that express survivin. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant may help stimulate the body's immune response to a vaccine treatment. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of blood cells. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and sargramostim before or after the start of lenalidomide maintenance therapy may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity profile of the SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide (SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine) in Montanide ISA 51 (incomplete Freund's adjuvant) plus GM-CSF (sargramostim) (vaccine), given before or after the start of lenalidomide maintenance in patients with multiple myeloma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure the immune responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 plus GM-CSF, either alone or with lenalidomide maintenance added either before or after the vaccine. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect preliminary data on therapeutic efficacy of this combination against multiple myeloma, including response rate, time to progression and disease progression slope. II. To test if human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types and survivin positivity affect the immune responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 plus GM-CSF. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP A: Patients receive SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously (SC) and sargramostim SC every 2 weeks at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 for up to 4 doses and then receive a booster in week 12. Beginning in week 4, patients receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP B: Patients receive SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant SC and sargramostim SC every 2 weeks at weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10 for up to 4 doses and then receive a booster in week 16. Beginning in week 0, patients receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 16, 20, and 24 weeks and then every 3 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
