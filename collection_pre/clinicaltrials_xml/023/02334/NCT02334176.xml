	<brief_title>US Guided Axillary Block With Only One Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have been challenged by the question of whether all a single injection may be enough to successfully perform a axillary plexus block. Three hundred and twenty patients undergoing elective hand surgery under axillary brachial plexus block will be enrolled into this prospective, randomized, observer-blinded non inferiority trial. Using a computer-generated sequence of random numbers and sealed envelope technique, the patients included will randomly be allocated to receive either single or double injection ultrasound-guided axillary block. The block will be performed with the in-plane technique using a 22 gauge, 50 mm needle and a high frequency linear probe. In the 2 injection group, the needle will initially be advanced toward musculocutaneous nerve and 7 ml of LA (lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5µg/ml) will be deposited around the nerve. The needle will be then advanced until the tip will be positioned just dorsal to the artery and 28 ml of (lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5µg/ml) will be deposited in this location. In the single injection group using the same LA, and 35 ml will be deposited dorsal the artery.</detailed_description>
