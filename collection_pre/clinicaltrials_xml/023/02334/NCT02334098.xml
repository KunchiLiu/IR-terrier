	<brief_summary>The objectives of this project are as follows: 1. To assess whether omega-3 dietary supplementation for six months can reduce externalizing behavior problems (antisocial and aggressive behavior) in schoolchildren aged 8 to 18, both at the end of treatment and six months post-treatment 2. To assess whether omega-3 supplementation can enhance cognitive and brain functioning as measured both by neurocognitive and psychophysiological measures 3. To assess whether any improvements in cognitive and brain functioning can help account for any improvements in behavior.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Supplementation and Behavior Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Externalizing behavior problems (aggressive and antisocial behaviors) are widely recognized as predisposing to significant mental health problems and violence among adolescents in secondary schools. These in turn result in enormous economic and social costs to schools as well as to society. These costs include mental illness, crime, and violence. Similarly, violence is widely recognized as a major public health problem which has also largely defied successful intervention and prevention. Because an increasing body of research is documenting health and neurobiological risk factors for aggression and violence, part of this prevention failure may be due to intervention efforts ignoring biological contributory factors which include impaired neurocognitive and psychophysiological functioning. One benign biological intervention that may help attenuate behavior problems in children consists of omega-3 supplementation of the diet, a long-chain fatty acid critical for brain structure and function. The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether omega-3 supplementation can reduce the base level of externalizing behavior problems in children and adolescents. Secondary but important aims are to assess whether any behavioral improvement is due to enhanced neurocognitive and psychophysiological functioning produced by omega-3 supplementation, and also whether there are changes in internalizing behavior problems.. The specific aims are as follows: 1. To assess the effectiveness of omega-3 dietary supplementation in reducing externalizing behaviors in adolescents. 2. To assess whether omega-3 supplementation can enhance childhood neurocognitive and psychophysiological functioning. 3. To assess whether any such enhanced neurocognitive functioning mediates the relationship between omega-3 enhancement and reductions in externalizing behavior. Hypotheses will be tested in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial involving 8 to18 year-old adolescents drawn from primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. Omega-3 supplementation will be in the form of a Norwegian fruit juice drink. 300 adolescents will be randomly assigned into: (1) omega-3 supplemented drink, (2) placebo drink, (3) treatment-as-usual controls. Behavioral, neurocognitive, and psychophysiological measures will be assessed at baseline (0 months), end of treatment (6 months), and 6 months post-treatment (12 months).</detailed_description>
