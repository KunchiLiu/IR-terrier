	<brief_summary>The overarching purpose of this project is to provide diabetes education to the diverse patient population at the Lions Eye Clinic, a resident-run ophthalmology practice at California Pacific Medical Center. Because of high clinic volume in a teaching environment, our patients often experience long wait times. The goal of this program is to utilize this wait time for diabetes education, a much-needed corollary to the eye care that patients receive at our clinic. This pilot project will investigate the impact of a program like this in our patient population. Specifically, the investigators are investigating whether diabetes education delivered in an ophthalmology setting enhances patient understanding of diabetes (via knowledge surveys) and/or leads to improved blood glucose control (via hemoglobin A1c). This is a 6-month study that runs through April 2015, and looks at the impact of an interactive diabetes education iPad app +/- in-person sessions with a diabetes educator. A subset of patients who meet with a diabetes educator will also be shown their own retinal images (compared to a normal retina).</brief_summary>
