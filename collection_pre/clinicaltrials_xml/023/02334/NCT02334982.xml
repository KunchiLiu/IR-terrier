	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating Single Doses of TAK-137 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-137. TAK-137 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose. This study looked at safety (lab results and side effects) and pharmacokinetic properties (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) in people who took TAK-137. This study was designed as a single ascending 6 Cohort dose study with planned doses of 2, 5, 15, 50, and 100 mg and Cohort 6 dose to be determined if the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. Anticipated enrollment was 48. This study enrolled 47 participants and consisted of 6 Cohorts. Participants in Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-137 or placebo after a 10-hour fast. Participants in Cohort 4 were randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-137 or placebo under fasted conditions, followed by a single dose of TAK-137 or placebo under fed conditions 14 days later. Participants in cohort 4 will receive the same dose in both fasted and fed conditions. The starting dose was 2 mg followed by administrations of 5, 10, 0.5 and 20 mg. This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. For Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 the overall time to participate in this study was up to 42 days. Participants made 4 visits to the clinic including one 5-day period of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. For Cohort 4 the overall time to participate in this study was up to 56 days. Participants made 7 visits to the clinic including two 5-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK137. 2. Has a medical condition such as mental retardation that can cause cognitive impairment. 3. Has a risk of suicide according to the Investigator's clinical judgment (eg, per ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale [CSSRS] or has made a suicide attempt in the previous 6 months). 4. Has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic disease, renal dysfunction, metabolic or endocrine dysfunction, serious allergy, asthma hypoxemia, hypertension, seizures, or allergic skin rash. 5. There is any finding in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests (including safety electroencephalogram [EEG]) giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking TAK137, or a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias. 6. Has taken any excluded medication, supplements, or food products listed in the Excluded Medications and Dietary Products table.</criteria>
