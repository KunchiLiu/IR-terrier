	<brief_summary>Even though the effects of anesthetic agents both inhalation and intravenous have been well described, the effect of laryngeal mask airways haven't. The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of different types of laryngeal mask airways on middle ear pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Different Airway Devices on Middle Ear Pressure in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the patients in each group of laryngeal mask airway will contain 20 patients. In all groups middle ear pressures will be measured, in both right and left ear, preoperatively, after induction of anesthesia, insertion of laryngeal mask and in 1st., 5th., 10th. minutes and every 5 minutes perioperatively and recorded. Also the heart rates,arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), airway pressures and end-tidal carbon dioxide values will be recorded before and following induction of anesthesia and in 1st., 5th., 10th. minutes and every five minutes perioperatively. Patients will be followed during the hospital stay for any complications.In all groups premedication will be done with midazolam. Anesthesia will be inducted with propofol and fentanyl; and maintained with sevoflurane-air combination.</detailed_description>
