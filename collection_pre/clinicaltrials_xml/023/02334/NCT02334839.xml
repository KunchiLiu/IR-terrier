	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia toxemia (PET) is a pregnancy related complication that is usually expressed as new onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. scarce data exists regarding the effectiveness of PAT plethysmography use in women with PET and whether adverse results are found compared to healthy gravidas. Thus, we aimed to assess endothelial function using PAT plethysmography in women with PET and compare their results to both healthy gravidas and those with only gestational hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Association Between Severity of Hypertensive Disorder During Pregnancy and Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia toxemia (PET) is a pregnancy related complication that is usually expressed as new onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Although the exact pathophysiology is unclear, it's related to abnormal placentation and subsequent vascular pathology. Endothelial dysfunction was found to play a significant role in the risk of cardiovascular event in general. Moreover, few studies found a relation between endothelial dysfunction and PET. There are several methods for the assessment of endothelial function, with Peripheral Artery Tone (PAT) plethysmography being an emerging non-invasive promising technique. However, scarce data exists regarding the effectiveness of PAT plethysmography use in women with PET and whether adverse results are found compared to healthy gravidas. Thus, we aimed to assess endothelial function using PAT plethysmography in women with PET and compare their results to both healthy gravidas and those with only gestational hypertension.</detailed_description>
