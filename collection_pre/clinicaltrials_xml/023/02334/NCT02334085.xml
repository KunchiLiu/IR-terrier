	<brief_summary>The HOW Study is a first-of-its-kind international online study for women and men with and without a history of breast cancer. The investigators will collect information about your health, your job, your diet, and your family history, among other topics that can help us get a better understanding of breast cancer and its potential causes. Periodically, the investigators will send you questionnaires about anything and everything. All you have to do is fill them out online. It's that simple. This is a partnership and the investigators need you for the long haul. The more questionnaires you fill out, the more information the investigators will have that can help us have a better understanding of why women get breast cancer.</brief_summary>
