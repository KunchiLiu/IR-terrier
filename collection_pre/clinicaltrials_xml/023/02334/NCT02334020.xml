	<brief_title>Investigating the Impact of the Mental Health First-Aid Training Course in Danish Employees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Studies show a high and growing prevalence of mental disorders in the population worldwide. 25 % of the general population in Europe will during their lifetime experience symptoms related to a mental disorder. The Mental Health First Aid concept (MHFA) was founded in 2000 in Australia by Kitchener and Jorm, in order to provide the population with mental health first aid skills. Objective: The aim of the concept is, through an educational intervention (course), to increase confidence in how to help people suffering from mental health problems. Further, secondary aims are to increase the mental health literacy of the public by increasing knowledge, reduce stigma and initiate more supportive actions leading towards professional help. An investigation of the effect of MHFA offered a Danish population is needed. Design and Methods: The design is a randomized controlled superiority trial, in which 500 participants will be allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The control group will attend the course six months later, hence waiting list design. From fall 2013 to spring 2014 participants will be educated in Mental Health First-aid following a manualized, two days MHFA course. All the participants will answer a questionnaire at base-line and at 6 months follow-up. The questionnaire is a back-translation of the questionnaire used in Australian trials. The trial will be complemented by a qualitative study, in which focus groups will be carried out. Outcome: The primary outcome measure is increased confidence in help-giving behavior among the participants. Secondary outcome will be increased knowledge of and improved positive attitudes towards people suffering from a mental health problem.</detailed_description>
