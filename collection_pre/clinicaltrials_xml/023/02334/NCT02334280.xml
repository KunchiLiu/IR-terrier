	<brief_summary>The goal of this project, which has not changed, is to evaluate the statewide implementation of a two-component intervention (health promotion plus academic detailing) with respect to consumer outcomes and changes in provider prescribing. The intervention, called In SHAPE, is delivered to people with serious mental illness (SMI) by two community mental health clinics (CMHCs). These CMHCs are compared to two CMHCs delivering usual-care to individuals with SMI. The specific aims of this study are: 1. Evaluate person-level and provider-level outcomes including: (a) consumer health behaviors, health indicators, mental health indicators, and acute health service utilization, (b) provider prescribing practices and program fidelity, and (c) program costs. 2. Evaluate system-level outcomes including: (a) consumer health behaviors and health indicators, (b) provider prescribing and program fidelity, and (c) acute services use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of A Statewide Program to Prevent Early Mortality and to Promote Fitness in Persons With SMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with SMI die 10-25 years earlier than the general population and have disproportionately greater rates of medical comorbidity and disability associated with high rates of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and poor dietary habits. Despite greater costs and adverse outcomes associated with the combination of mental illness and poor physical health, little attention has been paid to the development of health promotion interventions designed to address the needs of the high-risk group of people with SMI. This natural experiment presents an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the public health impact of a statewide health-promotion program for persons with SMI, a potential model for reducing early mortality among persons with SMI served by state mental-health systems nationwide.</detailed_description>
