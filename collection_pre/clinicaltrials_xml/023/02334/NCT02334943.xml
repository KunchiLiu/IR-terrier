	<brief_summary>Immune Activation persists in HIV-1 infected patients despite efficient antiretroviral treatment. This immune activation is responsible for immune deficiency as well as for non-AIDS related comorbidities, such as non-alcoholic Fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome or osteoporosis. The goal of this observational transversal multicentric study is to establish the etiologic factors of persistent immune activation in treated HIV-1 infected patients (persistent de novo infection of T CD4+ cells, microbial translocation, active coinfections, immunosenescence, T CD4+ cells lymphopenia, Treg deficiency), its different forms ( activation of T CD4+ cells, T CD8+ cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, granulocytes, platelets, endothelial cells or general inflammation) and the potential correlation between causes, forms of immune activation and emergent comorbidities (kidney, bone or liver dysfunction, metabolic syndrome).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immune Activation persists in HIV-1 infected patients despite efficient antiretroviral treatment. This immune activation is responsible for immune deficiency as well as for non-AIDS related comorbidities, such as non-alcoholic Fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome or osteoporosis.

These correlations could highlight physiopathologic mechanisms relating a specific cause of immune activation, activation of a specific subpopulation of immune cells and a comorbidity. Physiopathologic mechanisms could then be tested in vitro and lead into new therapeutic tracks of immune activation secondary to HIV-1 or to the natural ageing process.</detailed_description>
