	<detailed_description>Purpose The main objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in combination with modified coronally advanced flap (MCAF) in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions. Furthermore the second aim of the present study was to compare plastic periodontal surgical procedure, with PRF membrane and connective tissue graft, by a randomized splitmouth controlled study. Clinical effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in combination with modified coronally advanced flap (MCAF) as measured by Clinical measurements. Material and Methods Twenty patients with multiple gingival recession defects (Miller I, II) participated in this split-mouth trial. Sixty defects received either MCAF+PRF (test) or MCAF with subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) (control). Gingival recession depth (RD), gingival recession width (RW), keratinized tissue width (KTW), recession area (RA), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and gingival thickness (GT) were evaluated at baseline and 6 months. Additionally post-surgery patient satisfaction and pain status were measured by comparing visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Clinical measurements were taken at starting point and 6 months postoperatively. The measurements comprised an assessment of probing depth (PD),clinical attachment level (CAL) and gingival recession parameters including recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), keratinized tissue width (KTW) and gingival thickness (GT) were assessed by a calibrated examiner (E. Ö.). PD, CAL, RD, RW and KTW values were recorded by a Williams probe graduated in 1-mm increments and rounded up to the nearest millimeter (Hu Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). To standardize the clinical measurements acrylic stents were prepared on patients' casts. The following measurements were recorded at the mid-buccal point of the teeth at baseline and6 months after surgery. GT was evaluated using endodontic reamer attached to a rubber stopper inserted perpendicularly into the gingival tissue 3 mm below the gingival margin under local anesthesia, and then the thickness was measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using a caliper.RD was measured from the CEJ to the gingival margin, RW was measured tangentially at the mid-facial CEJ and RA was calculated as the area within the contour of denuded root. KTW recorded as the distance from the mucogingival junction to the gingival margin. Duplicate measurements were made for RD, RW, RA and KTW with an interval of 24 hours and the average value of two measurements was used for the assessment. The postoperative pain was evaluated with a visual analog score (VAS).</detailed_description>
