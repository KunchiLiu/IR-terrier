	<brief_summary>Smith &amp; Nephew's first edition of the Journey posterior stabilizing total knee arthroplasty was analyzed by the Center for Musculoskeletal Research in a past research study, and it was determined that subjects experienced more normal-like kinematic patterns. They also achieved excessive axial rotation and a decrease in weight-bearing knee flexion. Since Smith &amp; Nephew has made modifications to the Journey bi-cruciate stabilizing (BCS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) design, researchers will again evaluate the kinematics of subjects implanted with the revised design to determine if subjects experience normal-like kinematic patterns and if greater weight-bearing knee flexion is achieved. The objective for this study is to analyze the in vivo kinematics for subjects implanted with a 2nd generation Journey BCS TKA and compare those patterns to subjects having a normal knee and those having the 1st generation Journey posterior stabilizing (PS) TKA that were analyzed in the previous study.</brief_summary>
