	<brief_summary>This is a study using pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDAÂ®) for first-line treatment of participants with advanced/unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. The primary study objective is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in all participants, in participants whose tumors rely on programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein (PD-L1-positive tumors), and in participants with strongly PD-L1-positive tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants receiving pembrolizumab who attain a complete response (CR) may consider stopping trial treatment if they meet criteria for holding therapy. Participants who stop trial treatment after receiving 24 months of trial treatment for reasons other than progressive disease (PD) or intolerability, or participants who attain a CR and stop trial treatment may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment upon experiencing PD.</detailed_description>
