	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to show the non-inferiority of the incidental irradiation, as compared to intentional irradiation of the axillary nodes, in terms of 5-years disease-free survival (DFS) of early stage breast cancer patients with limited affectation of sentinel node assessed by OSNA (250 to 15,000 copies/uL), treated with breast-conservative surgery without axillary lymphadenectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Infiltrating, ductal carcinoma of the breast. 2. Treated with conservative surgery (tumorectomy or quadrantectomy) without lymphadenectomy. 3. Sentinel lymph node assessed by OSNA, with TTL in the range 250 15,000 copies/μL. 4. Age ≥ 18 yrs old. 5. Karnofsky Index ≥ 70 %. 6. Signed Informed Consent. 1. Other types of breast cancer different from infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 2. Bilateral breast cancer. 3. Males. 4. Mastectomy or axillary homolateral lymph node dissection. 5. Previous thoracic irradiation therapy. 6. Systemic neoadjuvant therapy previous to surgery. 7. Contraindications of radiotherapy (pregnancy, severe collagen diseases). 8. Other neoplasms. 9. Severe associated comorbidities that, according to the investigator criteria, may interfere with the study evaluations.</criteria>
