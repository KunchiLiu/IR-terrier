	<brief_summary>The proposed research aims to address the question: Compared to the current standard of care for home-based HIV tests, in which persons conduct and interpret HIV tests without counseling, does the addition of video conferencing with a remote counselor increase health-enhancing, protective behaviors among male-male couples and facilitate linkage to care for those who test positive?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project Nexus: Providing Online Counseling for Home-Based HIV Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to address four specific aims through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to take place over a four-year period. The investigators plan to enroll and maintain a cohort of 350 men who have sex with men (MSM) couples: 175 self-reported concordant HIV-negative and 175 self-reported HIV-discordant couples. Within this sample, the proposed study will examine the impact of home-testing with video-based Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC) (intervention) versus home-testing alone (control) on changes in: sexual risk-taking (e.g., UAI), formation and adherence to explicit agreements about sex, relationship functioning for the management of HIV risk, and linkage to care for newly diagnosed HIV positives among MSM couples who live throughout the US. To assess these specific changes, couples will complete online surveys at 3 time points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male sex at birth Male gender 18 or older In a relationship with a male sexual partner of duration six months or longer Negative or unknown HIV status and not having tested in the last 6 months, with a partner meeting the same criteria OR in a serodiscordant with the negative/unknown partner reporting not having tested in the past 6 months No recent (past year) severe intimate partner violence (IPV) reported within the couple. IPV will be determined by responses to the below questions, in addition to parallel questions addressing perpetration of the specified acts: 1. Excluding consensual acts such as mutually agreed upon BDSM, in the past year, how many times has [your partner] punched, hit, or slapped you? 2. Excluding consensual acts such as mutually agreed upon BDSM, in the past year, how many times has [your partner] kicked you? 3. Excluding consensual acts such as mutually agreed upon BDSM, in the past year, how many times has [your partner] used force or threats of force to make you do something sexual that you didn't want to do? 4. Excluding consensual acts such as mutually agreed upon BDSM, in the past year, how many times has [your partner] raped you?
