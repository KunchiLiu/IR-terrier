	<brief_summary>Conventional laparoscopic varicocelectomy using 3 ports has been used for treatment of varicocele in our department since the nineties. However, the relatively several trocar wounds represent a big challenge against its acceptance by many of our patients who prefer the open approach with one or at least two wounds. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), since its introduction in 2007, has been proven to be feasible and effective, with high patient satisfaction rates regarding improved cosmotic outcomes, reduced postoperative pain, and rapid return to normal activities. (10, 11) SILS for varicocelectomy has been reported to be safe and effective alternative to conventional laparoscopic varicocelectomy in a few studies.</brief_summary>
