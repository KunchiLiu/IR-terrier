	<brief_summary>This randomized trial has been designed to study if it is possible to enhance work capacity during submaximal efforts in heart failure patients supported with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVAD). The hypothesis is that exercise tolerability during low to moderate workloads in CF-LVAD patients can be increased when pump speed is increased soon after the onset of exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Increased CF-LVAD Pump Speed During Sustained Submaximal Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test the hypothesis described above the investigators will study submaximal exercise tests below anaerobic threshold in patients supported with CF-LVADs.Each patient will perform two tests- one with baseline CF-LVAD pump speed and the other with incrementally increased pump speed.</detailed_description>
