	<brief_title>Association Between Metabolic Syndrome and Serum Nerve Growth Factor Levels in Women With Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder is a clinical syndrome characterized urgency, frequency and nocturia. Infection or other obvious causes must be excluded. The overactive bladder is loss of inhibition of the detrusor muscle during the filling or emptying of the bladder. Specific receptors and neurotransmitters have role in development of overactive bladder. These includes adrenergic, cholinergic, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic receptors and interstitial cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF-R) receptors are between the detrusor muscle fibers and can cause afferent signals. Metabolic syndrome and obesity have been advocated to be risk factors for the development of overactive bladder. The investigators believe that our findings will shed light on treatment.</detailed_description>
