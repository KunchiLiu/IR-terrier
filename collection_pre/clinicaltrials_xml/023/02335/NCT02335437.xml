	<brief_summary>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by unexplained, disabling and long lasting fatigue, as well as pain, impaired memory, sleep difficulties and other symptoms. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection might precipitate CFS. In this study, 200 adolescents undergoing acute EBV infection will be followed prospectively, and also compared with a group of healthy controls. The aim is twofold: - To identify factors that predispose to chronic fatigue among adolescents with acute EBV infection - To compare pathophysiological features of patients with acute EBV infection with a group of healthy controls. Possible risk factors for chronic fatigue 6 months after EBV-infection includes: - Severity of the initial infection - Immune responses characteristics - Characteristics of the neuroendocrine stress response - Cognitive functioning - Emotional disturbances - Genetics/ epigenetics of candidate genes - Certain personality traits - Critical life events</brief_summary>
