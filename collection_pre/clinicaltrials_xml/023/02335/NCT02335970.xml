	<brief_title>Effects of a Training Intervention After Thoracoabdominal Oesophagus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well known that thoracoabdominal oesophageal resection for cancer is a procedure with high risks for complications. Earlier trials have shown that respiratory restrictions persist after the operation as well as lower physical function, range of motion in the rib-cage and limitations in activities in daily living. There are, however, only two clinical studies that evaluate postoperative breathing exercises and none evaluating any other rehabilitation interventions. In other types of extensive surgery that may affect mobility with trauma to muscles and bone structures in the thorax and thoracic spinal column, there is strong evidence that speaks for an active rehabilitation approach in favour of a less active one. The intervention evaluated was a rehabilitation program including exercises to restore lung function, range of motion in the thoracic spine and shoulders and strength exercises for the back extensors, shoulders and legs.</detailed_description>
