	<brief_summary>Background/Aims: The investigators explored the therapeutic effects of probiotics in patients with AH. Methods: Between December 2012 and January 2015, the investigators conducted a 7-day, double-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of probiotics in improving liver enzymes, LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, stool culture, and stool Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. AH was defined as an aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 and elevated AST (ALT) level with an alcohol consumption history within 48 hours. Patients were randomized to receive 7 days of cultured Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011/acidophilus R0052 (120 mg/day) or placebo. The levels of liver enzymes, modified Discriminant Function (mDF), LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, stool culture, and stool Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were checked at baseline and again after therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Probiotics on Gut-Liver Axis of Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Aims: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the leading causes of liver diseases. Gut-derived microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been known as a central role in the pathogenesis of AH. Some animal studies suggested an emerging role of probiotics in restoration of the bowel flora and improving liver enzymes. We explored the therapeutic effects of probiotics in patients with AH. Methods: Between December 2012 and January 2015, the investigators conducted a 7-day, double-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of probiotics in improving liver enzymes, LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, stool culture, and stool Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. AH was defined as an aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 and elevated AST (ALT) level with an alcohol consumption history within 48 hours. Patients were randomized to receive 7 days of cultured Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011/acidophilus R0052 (120 mg/day) or placebo. The levels of liver enzymes, modified Discriminant Function (mDF), LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, stool culture, and stool Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were checked at baseline and again after therapy.</detailed_description>
