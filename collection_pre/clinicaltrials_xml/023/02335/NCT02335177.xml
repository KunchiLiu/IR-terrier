	<brief_summary>After hospitalization, elderly people are still at risk for falling at home. The objective of the study is to evaluate at home after hospitalization the impact of an intervention for 3 months combining technologies for autonomy and tailored physical activity program. The study is performed among patients aged 75 years and over leaving Charles Foix Geriatrics hospital and with a loss of autonomy requiring physiotherapy and home support workers. It is a prospective, randomized, single-center, in cluster study which compares a Patient group (interventional group) with the intervention program (technologies + physical activities) with a control group benefiting from usual care home. Our hypothesis is that in the interventional group fewer falls were observed and improved different scores (Timed Up and Go Test,Barthel index, Quality of Life questionnaire of Duke) were reported compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
