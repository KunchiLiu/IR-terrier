	<brief_summary>Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial necrosis that results from an imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Although type 2 MI is highly prevalent in patients with critical illness and strongly associated with mortality, the pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Inflammation is central to the development of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, and other subtypes of MI, but the role of inflammation in type 2 MI and myocardial necrosis has not been defined. The investigators aim to to delineate the mechanistic role of inflammation in myocardial necrosis and type 2 MI complicating critical medical illness.</brief_summary>
