	<brief_summary>Asbestos defines a group of naturally occurring mineral silicate fibers which are easily inhaled, resulting in a variety of diseases of the respiratory system including lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact on overall survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part because patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. This study aims to develop and implement a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening approach for lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening of Alberta Asbestos Exposed Workers for Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Canada, lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer mortality above the next three culprits combined (breast, colon and prostate cancer). Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor in the development of lung cancer. Another population of particular interest in Alberta involves workers with occupational exposure to asbestos as asbestos and tobacco exposure results in a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the lining of the lung with poor prognosis of which 80% of cases are believed to be related to asbestos exposure. Unfortunately, despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact on overall survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part because patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. Additional strategies are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. The objectives of this study are to develop and implement a LDCT screening approach for lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta; to determine participants' motivation and expectations associated with a screening program, their satisfaction with the program, and the psychosocial consequences of the screening program; to determine the accuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model modified to include asbestos exposure; and to determine the 3-year clinical incidence of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals interested in lung cancer screening but who do not meet minimal risk threshold. The investigators will offer a combined lung cancer and mesothelioma screening program for 200 Alberta asbestos-exposed workers based on low-dose CT scanning.</detailed_description>
