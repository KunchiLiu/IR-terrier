	<brief_summary>Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for the need for allogeneic transfusion during surgery and increased postoperative morbidity. Treatment of preoperative anemia is recommended. However the type of preoperative anemias in elective hip- and knee surgery has only been sparsely studied. This observational study aims to investigate the incidence and type of anemias prior to elective hip- and knee arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence and Reasons for Preoperative Anemia in Elective Lower Joint Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for the need for allogeneic transfusion during surgery and increased postoperative morbidity. In elective orthopedic surgery, international guidelines recommends treatment of preoperative anemia including the use of Iron supplements for anemias associated with iron deficiency. In addition, low iron stores in both anemic and non-anemic patients may delay postoperative hemoglobin recovery. However, the reasons for preoperative anemia and the prevalence of patients with low iron stores have only been sparsely studied in elective hip- and knee arthroplasty. This observational study aims to investigate the incidence and type of anemias prior to elective hip- and knee arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
