	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Effect on Depression and C-Reactive Protein Levels After 8 Weeks of Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effectiveness of MBCT as a primary treatment for MDD. Twelve unmedicated subjects with MDD were enrolled in the study. All subjects with MDD underwent depression severity assessment at baseline and after the 8-week intervention was complete to measure change. In addition, the subjects underwent blood sampling at the same time points to measure C-Reactive Protein change over the 8 weeks. The primary goal of this pilot study is to determine the efficacy of MBCT as a primary treatment for adults with MDD. We will also measure change in the inflammatory biomarker C-Reactive Protein for an examination of the effects of depression treatment on this measure.</detailed_description>
