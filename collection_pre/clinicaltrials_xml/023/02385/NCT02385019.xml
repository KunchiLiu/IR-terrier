	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Trial of Donor Regulatory T-cells for Steroid-Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating safety (Phase 1) and preliminary efficacy (Phase 2) of donor regulatory T cells for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients must have persistent signs and symptoms despite the use of prednisone or equivalent at ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day), for at least 4 weeks without complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Occasional patients requiring lower doses of prednisone will be eligible if associated with other immunosuppressive drugs. Phase 1 clinical trial will include groups of 5 patients sequentially treated with: 0.5 x 10ˆ6, 1.0 x 10ˆ6, 2-3 x 10ˆ6 donor Treg/kg. Phase 2 clinical trial will include another 5 to 10 patients treated with MTD. Donor Treg will be selected by the following sequential steps: 1. - negative depletion of CD8 and CD19 cells 2. - positive selection of CD25 cells</detailed_description>
