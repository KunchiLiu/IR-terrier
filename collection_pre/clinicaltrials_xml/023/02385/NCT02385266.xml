	<brief_title>Treating Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blinded, randomized control trial (RCT) over a 21 week period that aims to evaluate the treatment efficacy of placebo and D-cycloserine(DCS) in men suffering from UCPPS. The brain functional and anatomical properties associated with treatment response will also be examined. This study will emphasize on comparing, both clinically and by brain imaging, the analgesic response to placebo in both placebo responders and non-responders in addition to a novel treatment (DCS) that targets the brain's pain mechanism for UCPPS. Subjects will be randomized to 2 arms, in a 1:1 ratio, to a DCS medication group (n=20) and a placebo medication group (n=20). Questionnaire outcomes and brain scans will occur prior to initiating treatment and at the end of the treatment period. The actual visits required are minimized, 9 visits spread out over 21 weeks, as pain, quality of life and pill ingestion timings are collected using a secure study website accessible electronically.</detailed_description>
