	<brief_summary>The purpose of this registry is to evaluate long-term clinical events in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Although numerous articles have been published by using nationwide Korean myocardial infarction registries, such as the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR), limitation of previous registries is that these have little data beyond the first year of MI. Therefore, current registry was designed to assess long-term clinical events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Because most of myocardial infarction patients were treated by revascularization in real world of Korea, this registry limits the inclusion criteria to patients who were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention to reduce the bias.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular center with high-volume percutaneous coronary intervention of following hospitals were participated. - Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, South Korea - Yeoido St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, South Korea - Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea - St. Paul Hospital, Seoul, South Korea - Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea - Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon, South Korea - St. Vincent Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea - Deajon St. Mary's Hospital, Daejeon, South Korea - Cheonnam University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea 8 hospitals of the Catholic University of Korea already have web-based coronary intervention registry (NCT01239914). And Cheonnam University Hospital is one of leading hospitals to design and manage the web-based previous Korean nationwide myocardial infarction registry, such as such as the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR) (http://www.kamir.or.kr/). All consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients had been enrolled in each registries prospectively. Using these previous data, current registry update new clinical and angiographic variables and assess long-term clinical follow-up data retrospectively.</detailed_description>
