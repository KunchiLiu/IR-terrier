	<brief_summary>This study investigates the health benefits of whole grain wheat on cardiovascular/ cardio-metabolic health, including glucose metabolism, by means of applying a mixed meal challenge. This study also investigates the health benefits of whole grain wheat (WGW) on liver- and adipose tissue health and evaluates the potential of do-it-yourself (DIY) devices in quantifying health effects in a nutritional intervention study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Resilience With Whole Grain Wheat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized controlled, double blind, parallel trial. A 4-week run-in period with refined wheat (RW) products will be included prior to the intervention for all subjects. Thereafter, two different treatments will be evaluated e.g. a 12-week intervention with whole grain wheat (WGW) products (98g of WGW per day) and a 12-week control intervention with RW products. Two experimental visits will be planned before and two experimental visits will be planned after the 12-week intervention period. In the first experimental visit the investigators will determine liver fat and abdominal fat distribution by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the second experimental visit the investigators will comprehensively phenotype the participants which will include the response to a mixed meal challenge test.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The inclusion of subjects with mildly impaired cardiometabolic risk profiles enables detection of improvements in health after WGW consumption. The investigators therefore aim to include 50 middle aged and overweight males or postmenopausal females (4570yrs and BMI between 2535 kg/m2) that have mildly elevated levels of cholesterol (cholesterol levels &gt; 5 mmol/L). In case the inclusion of subjects with mildly elevated levels of total cholesterol is too difficult, normal levels of total cholesterol (&lt; 5 mmol/L) can be accepted, but with a minimum total cholesterol level of 4.5 mmol/L. Males or postmenopausal females (target 50: 50 for both genders) For females: menstrual cycle absent for more than 1 year Age 4570yrs BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m2 Signed informed consent Normal food habit of bread and cereal consumption Not having a general practitioner Having a history of medical or surgical events that may significantly affect the study outcome Smoker Use of cholesterol lowering medication Mental status that is incompatible with the proper conduct of the study Aversion, intolerance to gluten, whole wheat or other items in the intervention products Alcohol consumption of &gt; 21 glasses a week Abuse of drugs Recent use of antibiotics (&lt;1 month prior to day 01 of the study) Reported weight loss or weight gain of &gt; 5 kg in the month prior to prestudy screening Reported slimming or medically prescribed diet Reported vegan or macrobiotic lifestyle Not willing to give up blood donation during the study Personnel of Wageningen University, department of Human Nutrition, their partner and their first and second degree relatives Current participation in other research (with the exception of NQplus) Contraindication for MRI Having blood vessels that are too difficult for inserting a cannula</criteria>
