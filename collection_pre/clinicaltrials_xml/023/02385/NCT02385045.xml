	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess whether iScan, an intra-endoscopic imaging technique is an accurate and reliable tool in detecting and characterising Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and comparing this to standard endoscopic imaging with white light endoscopy (WLE), narrow band imaging (NBI) and histology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>i-Scan for the Detection of Helicobacter Pylori</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal of endoscopy will be the 'optical biopsy' i.e. forgoing the need to take histological samples to make a diagnosis in order to reduce complication rates, cost and time. There are a number of imaging techniques which promise to improve our diagnostic rates for pathology, but there have been few comparative studies. This is randomized controlled parallel trial in a 1:1 ratio with examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract with WLE followed by either NBI or iscan. Patients attending the department for routine examinations for dyspepsia and abdominal pain will be randomised into 2 study arms (1WLE and NBI, and the other - WLE and iscan). The investigator carrying out the procedure will be blinded to the indication for the procedure until a full examination with both white light endoscopy and either NBI or iscan has been used as this could lead to bias. They will determine if H pylori is present, and if so the severity of infection with WLE and again with either NBI or iscan depending on their study arm. Histopathological confirmation of H pylori and an assessment to the degree of infection will be assessed with samples taken using the updated Sydney system (5 gastric samples from different parts of the stomach). The endoscopists reviewing the images will be blinded to all patient information and indications throughout the study period. Questionnaires will then be given to the endoscopists to determine what endoscopic features led them to their diagnosis.</detailed_description>
