	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of Dynamic Stabilization Versus Lumbar Fusion in Treatment of Multilevel Lumbar Disc Degeneration Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study aims are: 1. To evaluate superiority of Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization compared to Surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in lumbar range of motion; 2. To compare Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization compared to Surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in functional outcomes as measured by change in Oswestry Disability Index; 3. To compare radiological, clinical, patient-reported and, safety outcomes between the two surgical approaches.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent 2. Age between 30 and 75 years inclusive 3. Radiographic evidence of multilevel lumbar disc degeneration disease 4. Scheduled for 2 or 3level lumbar discectomy at levels from L1 to S1 with or without dynamic stabilization or fusion 5. Preoperative ODI ≥ 30% 6. Clinical symptoms consistent with diagnosis of lumbar DDD: Radicular back or lower extremity pain and/or Decreased muscular strength and/or Abnormal sensation 7. Failed to gain adequate symptom relief from at least one month of adequate nonoperative treatment 1. Cauda equina syndrome 2. Patients with other lumbar conditions that will, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with clinical outcomes (e.g. spinal structural deformities, spinal fractures, ankylosing spondylitis, spinal tuberculosis, spinal infection, spinal tumors, symptomatic cervical spinal disease) 3. Osteoporosis defined as Tscore ≤ 3.5. BMD will be measured by DEXA performed on lumbar spine 4. Systemic infection such as AIDS and active hepatitis 5. Recent history (less than 3 years) of chemical substance dependency or significant psychosocial disturbance, which may impact the outcome or study participation 6. Participation in a clinical trial of investigational drug or device within the past 30 days</criteria>
