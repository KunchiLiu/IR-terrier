	<brief_summary>The objectives are to test the acute effects of different bagels containing pulse ingredients on: 1) post-prandial blood glucose, insulin and appetite for two hours, and 2) food intake two hours following consumption of pulse products. The investigators hypothesize that bagels containing pulse ingredients will lead to lower blood glucose, insulin, appetite and food intake responses compared to non-pulse bagels.</brief_summary>
