	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of a Double Treatment Plan Using a Combination of Mebendazole and Quinfamide for Treating Intestinal Helminthiasis and Amebiasis in the Mexican Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), prospective (study following patients forward in time) study. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 48 days. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (5 days) and double-blind treatment Phase (from Day 1 to 21, consists of Phase-1 and Phase-2) and follow-up Phase (from Day 21 to 43). Participants will receive mebendazole (600 milligram [mg]) and quinfamide (200 mg) tablets orally once starting on Day 1 and mebendazole 600 mg and quinfamide (200 mg) or placebo tablets orally once starting on Day 21. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of participants with eradication of helminthic and/or protozoa. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
