	<brief_summary>This Study evaluate the non-inferiority of Test product (Chloroprocaine 2%) versus Reference product (Ropivacaine 0.75%) in terms of proportion of subjects with a successful block for distal upper limb surgeries, without any supplementation in the first 45 min (see definitions below), calculated from the time of readiness for surgery (complete sensory block). Successful block: anaesthesia adequate for the surgery (complete sensory block), without any supplementation in the first 45 min (even if surgery lasts for &gt; 45 min), calculated from the time of readiness for surgery (complete sensory block). Supplementation: i.v. premedication or general anaesthesia or pre- or intra-operative systemic analgesia or additional local anaesthetic infiltration</brief_summary>
