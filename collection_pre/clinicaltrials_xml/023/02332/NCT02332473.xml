	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of combination of peginterferon alfa-2b (40kD, Y-shape) and GM-CSF in interferon-naïve chronic hepatitis B patients with HBeAg positive. Patients were randomized to one of the 2 groups to receive different antiviral treatment.</brief_summary>
