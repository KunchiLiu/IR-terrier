	<brief_summary>A single center case-control study with 100 COPD patients will be organized to compare patients with and without bronchiectasis with regard to the presence of Aspergillus in sputum samples, Aspergillus sensitization and vitamin D. Induced sputum samples will be optimized for culture, Aspergillus galatomannan analysis and RT-PCR. This study is part of a larger project in which we assume that chronic respiratory infection by Aspergillus fumigatus and the accompanying immune response play an important role in the development of bronchiectasis in COPD. We suspect that this mechanism is controlled by vitamin D and it fails by suppression of the vitamin D receptor by Aspergillus fumigatus. The present study is designed by the Laboratory of pneumology and will be conducted in collaboration with the Laboratory of clinical bacteriology and mycology of the Catholic University of Leuven.</brief_summary>
