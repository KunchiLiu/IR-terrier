	<brief_summary>This trial is evaluating the use of oral Everolimus to determine if there is a reduction in the size of the disfiguring cutaneous lesions in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 over a 6 month period. The evaluation will be done by 3D photography measuring volume with the LIFEVIZ Micro system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus for Treatment of Disfiguring Cutaneous Lesions in Neurofibromatosis1 CRAD001CUS232T</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Qualifying subjects will have a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis 1 and have disfiguring cutaneous lesions that can be measured by photography. The subjects will have photographs of the target lesions,biopsies of the lesions,and safety blood laboratory tests at 3 time points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months which is end of treatment). Everolimus will be taken orally for 6 months. Subjects will visit the clinic monthly for an exam and adverse event evaluation. Laboratory testing will be done at these visits if determined necessary by the PI.</detailed_description>
