	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that infants receiving an infant formula in which 40 or 50% of the palmitic acid is in the sn-2 position have, during the first 4 months of life, stools that are softer than those of infants receiving a control formula.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human milk is considered as the golden standard for infant formula. In human milk and infant formula lipids provide about 55% of energy for the infant and represent as such a major nutrient for the baby. The vast majority of the lipids in human milk is composed of triacylglycerols (98% of total lipids) and the remainder percent are phospholipids. Triglycerides are composed of the glycerol backbone to which three fatty acids are bound. In human milk, palmitate (16:0) is the major long chain saturated fatty acid representing 22% to 26% of total fatty acids, esterified to approximately 70% in sn-2 position on the glycerol backbone. Unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2n-6) are preferentially esterified at the 1 and 3 position. In infant formulas the major source of palmitic acid is palm oil or palm olein where palmitate is, however, preferentially in the external 1,3 positions, and mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids are usually esterified at the 2-position of the triacylgycerol. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of infant formula containing 40% and 50%, respectively, of palmitic acid in sn-2 position.</detailed_description>
