	<brief_title>CD0104 VEST II Post Marketing Surveillance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to test the early-mid term patency rate of VEST supported Right Coronary Artery (RCA) bypass grafts. The research participants will undergo CABG preparations and CABG procedure routinely as is the standard of care. During the procedure the VEST will be implanted on the vein graft to the Right Coronary Artery according to the IFU. Perioperative care is according to standard of care. Upon discharge patient will be prescribed statins and aspirin for 6 months. Patient will attend a routine clinic visit 4-6 weeks post operatively. The last study visit will occur 3-6 months post operatively. Patients will undergo a noninvasive coronary CT angiography.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patient scheduled for onpump CABG on clinical grounds 2. At least one vein graft bypass indicated for right coronary artery and LIMA indicated for the LAD on clinical grounds 3. Appropriately sized and accessible target coronary arteries, with a minimum diameter of 1.5 mm and adequate vascular bed, as assessed from the preoperative cardiac angiography. 1. Concomitant nonCABG cardiac procedure 2. Prior cardiac surgery 3. Emergency CABG surgery (cardiogenic shock, inotropic pressure support, IABP) 4. Contraindication for onpump CABG with cardioplegic arrest (e.g. severely calcified aorta) 5. Calcification at the intended anastomotic sites, as assessed upon opening of the chest and before VEST implantation. 6. Prior debilitating stroke less than 1 year before surgery 7. Severe renal dysfunction (Cr&gt;2.0 mg/dL) 8. Concomitant lifethreatening disease likely to limit life expectancy to less than 2 years.</criteria>
