	<brief_title>Assessment in Work Productivity and the Relationship With Cognitive Symptoms in Patients With MDD Taking Vortioxetine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an interventional, Canadian, multi-site, open-label, single cohort, flexible-dose study. The study will emulate a naturalistic real-life setting. Investigators will include Primary Care Physicians and Psychiatrists working in outpatient clinics. The study will include adult patients diagnosed with MDD according to the DSM-5™. Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. There will be approximately 100 patients who receive vortioxetine as a first treatment for the current MDE and 100 patients switched to vortioxetine due to inadequate response to their current antidepressant medication treatment. All patients will be treated with vortioxetine as per the product monograph, and at the doses determined appropriate by the investigator. The total study duration from Baseline to the end of follow-up will be approximately 56 weeks.</detailed_description>

The patient is an outpatient consulting a Primary Care Physician or a Psychiatrist. Patients must have a diagnosis of MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM5™) classification code 296.3x. The current MDE is confirmed by the investigator. The reported duration of the current MDE is at least 3 months. The patient has a Baseline score ≥15 on the QIDSSR. The patient reports at least a minimal level of cognitive symptoms as defined by Baseline score of ≥30 on the PDQD20. The patient is capable of communicating with the site personnel and is able to conduct the digitsymbol substitution test (DSST). The patient score is &gt;69 on the DSST at Screening/Baseline. The patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, not able to complete all the study assessments including, but not limited to, patientreported assessments and the DSST. The patient has a current diagnosis or history of manic or hypomanic episode, schizophrenia or any other psychotic disorder, including major depression with psychotic features. The current depressive symptoms are considered by the investigator to have been resistant to 2 adequate antidepressant treatments of at least 6 weeks duration each at the maximum recommended dose (according to Canadian labeling). Other protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria do apply.</criteria>
