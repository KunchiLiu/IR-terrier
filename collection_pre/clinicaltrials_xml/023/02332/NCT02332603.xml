	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the pathophysiological effects of a single dose of Methylprednisolone administered prior to total hip- and knee-arthroplasty surgery. The investigators examine the effect on blood glucose homeostasis. Half of participants will receive intravenous Solu-Medrol 125 mg, while the other half will receive placebo. The investigators hypothesize that the glucose homeostasis remains equally stable in the group receiving Methylprednisolone as in the group receiving placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are well known. The beneficial effects on postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented. Glucocorticoid might change the glucose metabolism as it induces insulin-resistance. Glucocorticoids are known to reduce the insulin-mediated glucose uptake by reducing the muscle glycogen synthase activity. The effect of a single high dose of glucocorticoid is poorly described in the literature, and therefore calls for further investigation. This study is embedded in a primary study registrated as: NCT02319343 For further details please view the EudraCT registration: EudraCT nr.: 2014-003395-23</detailed_description>
