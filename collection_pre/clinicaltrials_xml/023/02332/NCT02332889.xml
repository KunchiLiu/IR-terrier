	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using the combination of decitabine and a cancer vaccine plus Hiltonol. The vaccine will be made from the subject's blood cells and is designed to interact in the subject's body with cells that are programmed to fight specific tumor proteins called NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3. The decitabine will be given to increase the amount and activity of these cancer proteins on the surface of tumor cells to increase the possibility that the vaccine will stimulate cells to act against the tumor cells. Subjects will be assessed to determine how these tumors respond to the treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One of the challenges of the practical application of immunotherapy for brain tumors is the lack of expression of tumor antigens as well as the down-regulation of MHC Class I and II molecules, which are needed for antigen presentation. Considering the ability of DAC to facilitate the expression of CT antigens and MHC molecules and the fact that it has good blood brain barrier penetration, it is reasonable to test this approach in a vaccine study for patients who have experienced disease recurrence. The use of a combined approach to tumor immunotherapy - antigen upregulation followed by vaccination - has not been studied in this patient population, and there is a strong biologic rationale for this strategy. Patients with pediatric brain tumors (medulloblastoma, CNS PNET, high grade glioma) who have experienced disease relapse or progressive refractory disease will be eligible. Each cycle will consist of DAC at low dose administered over a 5 day period, followed by two weekly vaccinations consisting of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with pooled, overlapping peptide mixes derived from full-length MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1. This dose of DAC is lower than all previously reported doses that have been safely administered in adult patients with MDS and AML, and was used in a previous protocol for relapsed and refractory pediatric neuroblastoma and sarcomas. A novel way of stimulating CD4 and CD8 antigen specific T cells is to use a DC vaccine approach in which the cells are pulsed with overlapping peptides derived from these antigens, so that patients from several different HLA backgrounds can be enrolled. Overlapping peptide mixes derived from full-length NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, or MAGE-A3 have been acquired from JPT Peptide Technologies, consisting of 15-mers, with 11 amino acid overlap. The number of DC given in our study (8-10 x 106 peptide pulsed DC) is within the range of doses given in previous studies. Vaccinations are spaced at weekly intervals, based on multiple previous studies in which this approach is taken, and the fact that in vitro re-stimulation of CTL generally occurs on a weekly basis. GM-CSF is given days 1 through 5 during vaccine weeks, to minimize leukopenia from DAC and to help facilitate antigen presenting cell function. The adjuvant poly-ICLC (Hiltonol) will be injected immediately after and adjacent to DC vaccine site to enhance DC maturation. We will accrue 10 patients with relapsed, refractory, or progressive pediatric brain tumors over a 3 year period. Cycles will repeat every five weeks, for two cycles. Patients who do not have disease progression after two cycles may receive an additional two cycles of therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria for enrollment: Relapsed medulloblastoma, CNS PNET, or high grade glioma. Confirmatory biopsy is required at time of initial diagnosis. Because of rapid clinical progression and decline at time of relapse in patients with grade IV gliomas and DIPGs, and the 46 weeks required to develop vaccine, patients with these tumors will be eligible to enroll and have DCs harvested and stored at the time of diagnosis, but will not be treated with vaccine until time of relapse. Age: Patients must be 2 to 25 years of age. Criteria for treatment: The patient must have experienced relapsed, progressive, or refractory disease. The patient may have gross tumor that has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation prior to study treatment. The patient must have received standard therapy for their tumor. The patient must be at least 90 days from primary radiotherapy. Hematologic Function: ANC: 1000/uL; Platelet count: 75,000/uL. Renal Function: Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR 70ml/min/1.73 m2 . Cardiac Function: Patient must have normal cardiac function documented by: Ejection fraction (&gt;55%) documented by echocardiogram or radionuclide MUGA evaluation OR Fractional shortening (â‰¥28%) documented by echocardiogram Liver Function: Total bilirubin 1.5x normal for age, and SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) 3x normal for age. Room air pulse oximetry &gt;94%. Male and female sexually active patients of reproductive age who wish to participate must agree to use acceptable contraception. Lansky/Karnofsky performance scale &gt; 50, ECOG &lt; or = 2 (Appendix I). Patient is pregnant. Patients with a positive result for any of the following diagnostic tests: Hep B Ag, Hep B Core Ab, Hep C Ab, HIV1 Ab, HIV2 Ab, HTLV1 Ab, HTLV2 Ab, RPR. Patient has a history of autoimmune disease, specifically inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Patient is receiving high doses of systemic corticosteroids or concurrent chemotherapy at the time of beginning study treatment. (Maximum dose of dexamethasone allowed is 0.1mg/kg/day not to exceed 4mg/day.) Patient has a known systemic hypersensitivity to DAC, Hiltonol, or any vaccine component.</criteria>
