	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of single and multiple doses of rufinamide. The effects of food and sex on the PK properties of rufinamide in these Chinese volunteers were also evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Tolerability of Rufinamide in Healthy Chinese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single- and multiple-dose, randomized, open-label study was conducted in healthy Chinese subjects. In the single-dose study, volunteers were randomly assigned to 4 dose groups and received a single dose of 200, 400, 800, 1200 mg rufinamide tablets under fasted condition. An additional food effect study was performed in the 200-mg dose group by assessing changes in PK parameters after high-fat diet. In the multiple-dose study, 10 subjects were administered 200-mg rufinamide formulation twice daily for 6 consecutive days. LC-MS/MS method was applied to determine plasma concentration of rufinamide. Tolerability was assessed based on investigator inquiries, spontaneous reports, and clinical evaluations such as standard laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations and 12-lead electrocardiography.</detailed_description>
