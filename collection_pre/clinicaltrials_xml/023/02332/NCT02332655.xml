	<brief_title>Cannabidiol Expanded Access Study in Medically Refractory Sturge-Weber Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hope to gain an understanding of the utility of pure CBD used for the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy in SWS in this open-label, safety dose-finding, study. Recent evidence suggests that CBD has multiple, beneficial, effects in patients (such as those with SWS that undergo neurological deterioration) suffering from medically refractory seizures. We hypothesize that CBD will reduce seizure frequency in children and young adults with SWS and will therefore help stabilize and improve their neurologic status.This trial is part of an expanded access program, available through a partnership with GW Pharmaceutical, which has been sanctioned by the FDA to study the safety and efficacy of Epidiolex (cannabidiol/CBD) in participants with SWS and medically refractory seizures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants with SturgeWeber syndrome brain involvement as defined on neuroimaging (n=10 subjects, male and female, ages 1 month to 45 years of age) and the following: Documentation of a diagnosis of drug resistant epilepsy as evidenced by failure to control seizures despite appropriate trial of two or more AEDs at therapeutic doses. Drug resistant epilepsy for this study is defined as: At least 1 reported quantifiable (no cluster or innumerable) defined seizure with motor signs per month for at least 3 months prior to initial visit and during the period between Visit 1 (Screening Visit) and Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), as per data captured in daily seizure diaries. These can be focal seizures, focal seizures with impaired consciousness, myoclonic seizures, generalized, and secondarily generalized seizures. Between 15 baseline antiepileptic drugs at stable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet do not count toward this limit. VNS must be on stable settings for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment. If on ketogenic or Atkins diet, must be on stable ratio for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment. Previous subjects who failed at any point to meet continuation criteria and withdrew early may be considered for reenrollment under a new subject ID as long as the above inclusion criteria are met. The determination of whether to reenroll will be made by the PI and sponsor on a casebycase basis. Reenrollment can occur no earlier than 4 weeks after the final, postweaning followup visit under the old subject ID. Written informed consent obtained from the patient or the patient's legal representative must be obtained prior to beginning treatment. Patients with seizures secondary to metabolic, toxic, infectious or psychogenic disorder or drug abuse or current seizures related to an acute medical illness. Presence of only nonmotor partial seizures (without limb or facial movements, eye deviation or head turning) Patients who require rescue medication during the Baseline phase for more than 6 days. Patients with any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions at randomization such as: 1. liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and chronic hepatitis [i.e. quantifiable hepatitis B virus (HBV)DNA and/or positive HbsAg, quantifiable hepatitis C virus (HCV)RNA] 2. Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt; 1.5 3. Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections. 4. Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis. Patients who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of study entry. Patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia), or patients that may require major surgery during the course of the study. Patients who change the dose of the AEDs during 4 weeks before screening or during the baseline period. Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks prior to study entry. Patients with a history of noncompliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study. Those in foster care, unable to keep followup appointments, maintain close contact with Principal Investigator, or complete all necessary studies to maintain safety. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test.</criteria>
