	<brief_summary>This is a 2-part study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in pediatric participants who have either advanced melanoma or a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumor or other lymphoma. Part 1 will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD), confirm the dose, and find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for pembrolizumab therapy. Part 2 will further evaluate the safety and efficacy at the pediatric RP2D.</brief_summary>
