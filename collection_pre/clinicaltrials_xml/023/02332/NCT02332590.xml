	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate that sarilumab monotherapy is superior to adalimumab monotherapy with respect to signs and symptoms as assessed by disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued treatment with methotrexate (MTX), or after at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment with MTX, are determined to be inadequate responders. Secondary Objectives: To demonstrate that sarilumab monotherapy is superior to adalimumab monotherapy in patients with active RA who are either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued treatment with methotrexate (MTX), or after at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment with MTX, are determined to be inadequate responders, with respect to: - Reduction of signs and symptoms of RA. - Improvement in quality of life assessed by patient reported outcome questionnaires. Assessment of the safety and tolerability of sarilumab monotherapy (including immunogenicity) throughout the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ≥3 months duration. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Class IIII functional status. Active RA was defined as: At least 6 of 66 swollen joints and 8 of 68 tender joints, High sensitivity Creactive protein (hsCRP) ≥8 mg/L or ESR ≥28 mm/H, and DAS28ESR &gt;5.1. Patients who per Investigator judgment were either intolerant of, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued treatment with methotrexate (MTX), or after at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment with MTX, or inadequate responders treated with an adequate MTX dose for at least 12 weeks. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt;18 years or the legal age of consent in the country of the study site, whichever is higher. Current treatment with diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARDs)/immunosuppressive agents including MTX, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, gold, penicillamine, sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine within 2 weeks prior to the baseline (Randomization Visit) or azathioprine, cyclophosphamide within 12 weeks prior to baseline (Randomization Visit) or leflunomide within 8 weeks prior to the Randomization Visit, or 4 weeks after cholestyramine washout. Treatment with any prior biologic agent, including antiinterleukin 6 (IL6), IL6 receptor (IL6R) antagonists, and prior treatment with a Janus kinase inhibitor. Use of parenteral corticosteroids or intraarticular corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
