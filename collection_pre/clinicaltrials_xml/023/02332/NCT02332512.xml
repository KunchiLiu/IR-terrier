	<brief_summary>Apatinib is a new kind of selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The investigators have finished the preclinical,phase I and phase II clinical studies and found its promising anti-tumor activity and tolerable toxicities. A disease-control rate of 61.1% and a mPFS of 4.7 months were showed in apatinib phase II study in patients with NSCLC. The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of apatinib to placebo in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients.</brief_summary>
