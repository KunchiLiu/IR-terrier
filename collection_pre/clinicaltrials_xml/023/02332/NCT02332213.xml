	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to determine the potential of volatile marker testing for identification of gastrointestinal cancers (in particular - colorectal and gastric cancers), the related precancerous lesions in the stomach and colon. The study will be addressing the role of confounding factors, including lifestyle factors, diet, smoking as well as addressing the potential role of microbiota in the composition of exhaled volatile markers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with established disease (cancer, precancerous lesions) as well as patients investigated for the lesions and having been documented lack of the lesions will be enrolled to the study at clinical sites in Europe (Latvia, Lithuania). In addition, group of persons from general population at average risk for developing the target disease will be also enrolled. Testing of volatile markers will be conducted by one of two methods: 1) gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GS-MS) and 2) nanosensor technology. Volunteers (including patients with established disease) will be enrolled prior the removal of the target lesion (e.g. surgery for cancer or polypectomy in the case of a polyp). The study will be conducted by utilizing the experience of institutions in the European Union and Israel.</detailed_description>
