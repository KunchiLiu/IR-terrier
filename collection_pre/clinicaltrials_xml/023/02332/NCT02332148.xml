	<detailed_description>3VM1001 is a topical cream that may be useful for the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis of the knee. This proof of concept study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to compare treatment with 3VM1001 cream to an inactive cream placebo. Subjects will self-treat for 30 days with investigational drug or placebo. Rescue medication with acetaminophen, up to 2g daily, is permitted. This study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3VM1001 topical cream, a copper-containing cream. Subjects will self treat with drug or placebo three times daily for 30 days. All subjects will have a total of three visits to the clinic and will complete a daily diary each day for the 30 days of treatment.</detailed_description>
