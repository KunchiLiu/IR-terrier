	<brief_summary>Many cancer survivor experience treatment-related impairments in mental abilities such as memory, attention, and concentration (known as cognition). Research indicates that physical activity can improve cognition in healthy adults; however, little is known about whether physical activity can improve cognition among cancer survivors. This study will test whether a physical activity intervention results in improvements in cognition among breast cancer survivors, which may lead to interventions to improve cognition.</brief_summary>
