	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, three-part, parallel-group, open-label trial of grazoprevir (MK-5172) (100 mg) and MK-3682 (300 mg or 450 mg) with either elbasvir (MK-8742) (50 mg) or ruzasvir (MK-8408) (60 mg), and with and without ribavirin (RBV), in treatment-naive (TN) or treatment-experienced (TE) cirrhotic (C) or non-cirrhotic (NC) participants infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 3, GT4, GT5, or GT6. Part A will consist of 4 arms to evaluate the safety of dose combinations. In Part B, participants will take 2 MK-3682B fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets once daily (q.d.) by mouth, with or without twice-daily (b.i.d.) RBV (200 mg capsules; weight-based dosing). Participants who relapse following completion of therapy in Part A will be offered the option of retreatment with 16 weeks of MK-3682B with RBV in Part C (data obtained from Part C will not be used in the analysis of outcome measures).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Part A, study therapy will be administered as separate products, each taken q.d. by mouth. In Part B and Part C, participants will take 2 MK-3682B FDC tablets q.d. by mouth; each MK-3682B FDC tablet contains grazoprevir 50 mg + MK-3682 225 mg + ruzasvir 30 mg.</detailed_description>

Has any of the following conditions: Organ transplants (including hematopoietic stem cell transplants) other than cornea and hair. Poor venous access that precludes routine peripheral blood sampling required for this trial.
