	<brief_title>ODM 5 in the Treatment of Corneal Edematous Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy-induced corneal edema and an ODM 5 therapy recommendation prior to their inclusion will be observed in normal practice setting in this post-market clinical follow-up study. In this indication, the use of ODM 5 should extract the fluid excess in the cornea away by an osmotic effect, enabling the cornea to temporarily regain a normal state of hydration. As a consequence, the patient's visual acuity, contrast perception, corneal thickness and ocular complaints/symptoms should improve. The hyaluronan in ODM 5 helps to protect and heal the cornea in case of irritation and thus, enables the cornea to regain a normal state of hydration and participates in improving the quality of vision.</detailed_description>
