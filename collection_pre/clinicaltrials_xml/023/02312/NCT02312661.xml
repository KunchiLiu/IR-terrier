	<brief_summary>Molecularly targeted agents which inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and/or circumvent p53 in the induction of apoptosis are exciting potential targets in ovarian cancer. Metformin is a biguanide, widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, that has shown anti-cancer activity in preclinical studies. The main mechanism of metformin's effect is mTOR pathway inhibition and, in addition, it has been shown to circumvent p53-induced apoptosis making it an exciting, potentially effective drug in ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Metformin With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase Ib, single-centre, dose-escalation trial with a traditional escalation rule with fixed dose levels ("3 + 3" rule). The recommended phase II dose will be defined as the maximum predefined dose level at which 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects experience a drug-related dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1 and 2 of treatment. An estimated 10-20 patients will be required for this study.</detailed_description>

Serum pregnancy test to be assessed within 7 days prior to study treatment start, or within 14 days with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study treatment start. Women of childbearing potential (defined as &lt;2 years after last menstruation and not surgically sterile) not using effective, nonhormonal means of contraception (intrauterine contraceptive device, barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly) during the study and for 6 months after the last study medication. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or excipients. Serious active infection requiring i.v. antibiotics at enrolment. Unstable medical conditions. Evidence of any other medical conditions, physical examination or laboratory findings that may interfere with the planned treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk from treatment related complications.</criteria>
