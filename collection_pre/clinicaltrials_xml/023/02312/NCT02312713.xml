	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of standard physical therapy and an internet-based exercise program for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Both of these programs will be compared to a "waiting list" control group. The investigators hypothesize that both treatments will result in greater improvement than the control condition and that the treatments will be similarly effective. The investigators also expect that some patients may do better with one treatment type or another and will explore this.</brief_summary>
