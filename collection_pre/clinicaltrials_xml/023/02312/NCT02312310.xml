	<brief_title>Dietary Flavanols and Dentate Gyrus Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this double blinded trial, the participants, age 50-75 years, will be randomized to receive 0, 225, 400, or 650 mg daily for 12 weeks and will be tested before and after the intervention. Cognitive testing will be conducted prior to randomization, and at weeks 4, 12, and 20 of the study. In an optional substudy, fMRI with gadolinium contrast will be conducted to measure dentate gyrus function before randomization and then after completion of the trial.</detailed_description>
