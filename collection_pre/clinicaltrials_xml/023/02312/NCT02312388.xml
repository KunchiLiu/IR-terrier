	<detailed_description>Catheterization was performed using ultrasound with an "out-of-plane" approach by inserting the introducer needle (thin-wall needle technique) or Angiocath Plus™ catheter (catheter-over-the-needle technique) in 45 - 60° to the patient's skin while viewing the vein in a cross section.</detailed_description>
