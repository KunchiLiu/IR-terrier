	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and IOP lowering efficacy of OTX-TP, a sustained release travoprost drug product, placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid compared to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.5% in the treatment of subjects with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The study is designed to assess clinically meaningful response to treatment and is not powered to measure any efficacy endpoints with statistical significance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have a documented diagnosis of ocular hypertension, open angle glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component). Subject has a mean baseline IOP following washout in at least 1 eye (the same eye) of ≥ 24mmHg at Hour 0 (T0) at Baseline Visit 1 and Baseline Visit 2 (Day 1) Subject has a mean baseline IOP following washout in at least 1 eye (the same eye) of: ≥ 22mmHg at (T0 + 4h) and (T0 + 8h) at Baseline Visit 1 (note: the same eye must meet the IOP eligibility criteria at all 4 baseline assessments) Washout IOP must be ≤ 34mmHg in each eye at all time points at the Baseline Visit 1 and Baseline Visit 2 (Day 1) Subject with any form of glaucoma other than open angle glaucoma (with or without a pigment dispersion or pseudoexfoliation component). Subject with mean baseline IOP &gt;34 mmHg in either eye at any time point during the Baseline Visits 1 or 2 (Day 1). Subject with a BCVA worse than 0.6 logMAR (20/80 Snellen) in either eye as measured using an ETDRS chart. Subject with a known or suspected allergy and/or hypersensitivity to travoprost, timolol, fluorescein or to any component of the study products.</criteria>
