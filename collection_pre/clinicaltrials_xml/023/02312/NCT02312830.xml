	<brief_summary>With the increasing successful use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to cure advanced hematological disease, it becomes essential to evaluate the long-term effects of such a drastic treatment. This study investigates the prevalence of several demographic, psychosocial and behavioral aspects of survivorship after an allogeneic transplantation. Income, return to work, social isolation, pain, medication adherence, influenza vaccination status, alcohol use, smoking habits, drug use, healthy diet, prevention of UV exposure, physical activity, functional status/Quality of life (QoL), couple life/sexual function, depression, anxiety, spirituality and resilience will be studied.</brief_summary>
