	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ixazomib maintenance therapy on progression free survival (PFS) compared with placebo, in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major response (complete response [CR], very good partial response [VGPR], or partial response [PR]) to initial therapy and who have not undergone stem-cell transplantation (SCT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Oral Ixazomib Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Not Treated With Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib citrate. Ixazomib citrate is being tested to slow disease progression and improve overall survival in people who have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major positive response to initial therapy and have not undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). This study will look at the effect of ixazomib citrate has on the length of time that participants are free of disease progression and their overall survival. The study will enroll approximately 761 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Ixazomib citrate 3 mg - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle, for up to 26 cycles. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 24 months. Participants will make 28 visits to the clinic during the treatment period and will continue to make follow-up visits every 4 weeks until the next line of therapy begins. Participants will also be contacted by telephone every 12 weeks after last treatment visit for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult male or female participants 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) according to standard criteria. 2. Completed 6 to 12 months (± 2 weeks) of initial therapy, during which the participant was treated to best response, defined as the best response maintained for 2 cycles after the Mprotein nadir is reached. 3. Documented major response [partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR)] according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria, version 2011, after this initial therapy. 4. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study Treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) 5. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 6. Complete documentation of the details of the initial therapy before randomization including cytogenetics and International Staging System (ISS) is available. 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 to 2. 8. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling and consent for the specific amounts that will be taken. 9. Is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements including blood sampling and bone marrow aspiration. 10. Must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria at study entry: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm^3 without growth factor support and platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^3. Platelet transfusions to help participants meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before randomization. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN). Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 3 x ULN. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (using the CockcroftGault equation). 1. Multiple myeloma that has relapsed after, or was not responsive to, initial therapy. 2. Prior stemcell transplantation (SCT). 3. Radiotherapy within 14 days before randomization. 4. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 5 years before randomization or previous diagnosis with another malignancy. Participants with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection. 5. Female participants who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the Screening period. 6. Major surgery within 14 days before randomization. 7. Central nervous system involvement. 8. Infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14 days before randomization. 9. Diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome, plasma cell leukemia, primary amyloidosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative syndrome. 10. Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. 11. Systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin), strong inhibitors of CYP3A (clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole), or strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort within 14 days before randomization. 12. Ongoing or active infection, known human immunodeficiency virus positive, active hepatitis B or C infection. 13. Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens (eg, peripheral neuropathy (PN) that is Grade 1 with pain or Grade 2 or higher of any cause). 14. Psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements. 15. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations of any agent. 16. Inability to swallow oral medication, inability or unwillingness to comply with the drug administration requirements, or gastrointestinal (GI) procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of treatment. 17. Treatment with any investigational products within 30 days before randomization.</criteria>
