	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety of the PulseRider in patients undergoing treatment for bifurcation basilar or carotid terminus aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Neurovascular Support for Wide-neck Aneurysm Embolization and Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoints: - Safety: Death or stroke in downstream territory to 180-days post-procedure - Technical Success: Device placement success and ability to retain coils at the time of the index procedure - Rate of aneurysm occlusion at Day zero (0) and 180 days Additional Evaluations to 180-days and at 365-day follow up: - Rate of aneurysm occlusion at 365 days - Device movement or migration - Stenosis - Rate of incidence of new neurological deficits - Complication rate (neurological and non-neurological)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient who presents with an angiographically confirmed, wide neck intracranial aneurysms located at a bifurcation of the basilar artery or carotid terminus artery The target aneurysm is in a vessel with a diameter of 2.7 mm to 4.5 mm. The patient is 18 years or older at the time of consent The patient has signed the IRB/EC approved informed consent form In the opinion of the physician, placement of the PulseRider is technically feasible and clinically indicated Subject has mental capacity and is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements and followup Unstable neurological deficit (condition worsening within the last 90 days) Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) within the last 60 days Irreversible bleeding disorder mRS score â‰¥3 Patient has another aneurysm which, in the Investigator's opinion, will require treatment within the follow up period (365 days) Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3 Inability to tolerate, adverse reaction or contraindication to taking aspirin or clopidogrel A history of contrast allergy that cannot be medically controlled Known allergy to nickel Relative contraindication to angiography (e.g., serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) Woman with childbearing potential who cannot provide a negative pregnancy test Evidence of active infection Other conditions of the heart, blood, brain or intracranial vessels that carry a high risk of neurologic events Evidence of disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to complete followup assessments during the 365day followup period Extracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the parent artery requiring access to the lesion Intracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the treated vessel Extreme vessel tortuosity that prohibits appropriate control of the microguide wire and/or the PulseRider delivery wire</criteria>
