	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of ECLIPSE PRP™ Wound Biomatrix in Chronic Non-Healing Pressure Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multi-center study for subjects undergoing PU treatment. Qualified subjects will be randomized (1:1); test group (Eclipse PRP™ Wound Biomatrix) and control group (usual and customary practice). The study will consist of 3 periods: a screening period, an active treatment period, and a follow-up period (if healed). Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be ≥18 years of age with a PU (greater than 4 weeks duration). Each subject will be enrolled in the active treatment period for up to 12 weeks, or to closure of wound with a confirmatory visit 2 weeks after wound closure, whether such closure occurs at 12 weeks or earlier.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Medicare/Medicaid eligible Ulcer of pressure/shear etiology The index ulcer is greater than 4 weeks duration. Three or fewer ulcers that are separated by &gt; 3.0 cm distance The largest nonhealing wound, if multiple wounds are present, or the single wound to be treated (Index Ulcer) that is located on the heel, ischium, sacrum, and trochanter Postdebridement, the ulcer size must be between 2 cm2 and 200 cm2 Demonstrated adequate offloading regimen Able and willing to attend scheduled followup visits and study related exams Able and willing to provide a voluntary written informed consent Stage I pressure ulcers Ulcers that are unstageable or of deep tissue morphology that have yet to become an open wound Ulcer not of PU pathophysiology (e.g., pure diabetic, vasculitic, radiation, rheumatoid, collagen vascular disease, venous, or arterial etiology) Greater than 30% reduction in wound size during the first two weeks of observation and treatment by the investigator Gross clinical infection at the study ulcer site including cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Known allergy tor sensitivity to Eclipse PRP kit components (calcium chloride, calcium gluconate or acid citrate dextrose solution A (ACDA)) Serum albumin of less than 2.5 g/dL, Plasma Platelet count of less than 100 x 109/L, Hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL Known renal failure as determined by a Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl Malignancy at or near the ulcer site Rheumatoid arthritis (and other collagen vascular disease), vasculitis, sickle cell disease, HIV Severe liver disease. Presence of additional abnormal lab values obtained within 7 days prior to the Day 0 visit determined to be clinically significant by the investigator including: WBC &gt;13,000/cm3 or &lt; 5, 000 cm3, or electrolytes that are outside the host institution's range of normal Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy or chronic steroid use within 30 days of enrollment Received another investigational device or drug within 30 days of enrollment Received allograft, autograft or xenograft within 30 days of enrollment Subject has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for Eclipse RPR administrations Subject requires or is anticipated to require interventions directed at improvement of arterial perfusion to affected area Ulcer expected to be treated with any advanced therapeutics (e.g., HBOT) Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with treatment of index wound Subjects who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy Life expectancy of &lt; 6 months.</criteria>
