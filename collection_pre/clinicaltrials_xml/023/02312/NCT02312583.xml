	<brief_title>Efficacy of an Online Program for the Treatment of Mild and Moderate Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression (MD) is a disease with a great impact on peopleÂ´s functioning and is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. It is a condition with a high prevalence, about 10% of men and 20% of women in the population will be diagnosed MD throughout their lives, and has an effect on high economic costs to health services. While there are many effective therapeutic options for the treatment of depression, many people with depressive episodes do not receive an appropriate treatment or, in fact, do not receive any treatment at all. The social stigma, difficulties to access mental health services, to integrate therapy sessions into working life, or problems to pay for treatment are some of the main barriers to receive adequate treatment. On-line interventions are easily accessible and low cost, and different studies suggest that these interventions have significant and lasting improvements in different mental disorders. These studies indicate that this type of treatment would be indicated for disorders that, as the case of MD, have a high prevalence and relatively low help-seeking for treatment. iFighDepression is an online self-help programme for mild to moderate depression that has been developed in the context of the European project Preventing Depression and Improving Awareness through Networking in the European Union (PREDI-NU) which is managed by the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). It involves the most complete integration of the cognitive-behavioral online programs available to date, which is a format of intervention that has been proven effective in reducing depressive symptoms in several randomized controlled trials. IFightDepression is currently in pilot phase in 7 European Union countries, including Spain. The purpose of this project is to study the therapeutic effect of the iFightDepression online programme in patients with mild to moderate depression</detailed_description>
