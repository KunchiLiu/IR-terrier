	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well Avatar-directed chemotherapy works in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that does not respond to platinum anti-cancer drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, gemcitabine hydrochloride, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Using an Avatar, a living tumor sample with similar genetic characteristics to the original tumor, may help determine which chemotherapy is most effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avatar-Directed Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the response rate of Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers receiving Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy. II. To determine the overall survival of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers receiving Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy. III. To determine the adverse events for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers receiving Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy. IV. To determine the correlation between patient response and response in their Avatar. V. To enrich the Avatar response signature in response to Avatar-directed therapy using patient outcomes. VI. To compare the response rates between patients who did or did not receive bevacizumab treatment. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment arms as directed by Avatar results. ARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-96 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ARM B: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM C: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM D: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 every 21 days or days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 every 21 days or days 1 and 15 every 28 days. Courses repeat every 21 or 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
