	<brief_title>Effect of Clonazepam on REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in Patients With Parkinsonism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RBD is one of the representative non-motor symptoms of PD and other synucleinopathies. Patients with RBD show dream-enacting behaviors such as punching, kicking, singing, screaming, or somnambulism. These can interfere in sleep quality and increase the risk of falling down from the bed and physical injuries of both the patient and sleep partner. Therefore, qualities of life of the patient and sleep partner are negatively influenced by presence of RBD. Clonazepam has been used for treatment of choice of RBD. It decreased RBD symptoms completely in 55-79% and partially in 11-32% of patients. However, these results are based on open-label or descriptive studies. There has been no randomized placebo controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of clonazepam for treating RBD.</detailed_description>
