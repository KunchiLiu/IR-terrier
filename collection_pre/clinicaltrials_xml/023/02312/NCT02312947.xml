	<brief_title>Coblation Versus Cold Adenoidectomy -Safety and Efficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea(osa) in children is a very bother and frequent problem with clinical and behavioral impacts. The hypertrophied adenoid tissue obstructs the air way in the nasopharynx that initiates the common symptoms. The treatment from that concerning problems is in the operation rooms by diversity surgical methods, the very older one is the cold dissection adenoidectomy. Recently many surgeons use the coblation system as a preferred method for adenoidectomy. This method was proof as a safe and efficient especially referring to the bleeding and the dehydration risk . Many children that operated by the cold dissection forced to perform another one or two operations presumably due to the adenoid tissue that did not removed completely from the first operation . our hypothesis is that the coblation systemis a safe and eficient method for adenoidectomy. The aims of this project is to verify if our theory is corect by blinded comparision between two methods.</detailed_description>
