	<brief_summary>The study investigates the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, elimination) of molidustat after intake of a single 75 mg tablet in subjects with renal impairment requiring hemo- or peritoneal dialysis compared to age-and gender-matched healthy subjects. In addition, the effect of molidustat on the hormone erythropoietin will be evaluated as well as the safety and tolerability of molidustat.</brief_summary>
