	<brief_summary>IMPORTANCE Skin rejuvenation can be achieved effectively and safely by injection of a stabilized hyaluronic acid (HA)-based gel of nonanimal origin (NASHA) injection using a stamp-type electronic multineedle injector. OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of NASHA using a stamp-type electronic multineedle injector, and if changes in skin physiology occur earlier than in previous trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-five patients were recruited to this single-center, evaluator-blinded, prospective, balanced (1:1), split-face randomized clinical trial.One dermatologist who was blinded as to the treatment side evaluated the skin hydration, melanin content, erythema, and elasticity of both cheeks using a corneometer, a mexameter, and a reviscometer, respectively, at each follow-up visit (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postinjection). The subjects and two independent investigators assessed the clinical improvement using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at the every visit. Twenty-four participants completed the study, and no participants withdrew due to adverse effects. INTERVENTIONS Each participant submitted to a single treatment with a NASHA injection to one side of the lower cheek. The cheek side to which the treatment was applied was chosen randomly.</brief_summary>
