	<brief_title>Early Mobilization of Operatively Stabilized Distal Radius Fractures - a Randomized Controlled Trail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients with a distal radius fracture treated by surgery (palmar angle stable plate) will be included in this study and randomised into two groups according the CONSORT Guidelines of Prospective Randomised Trails. One group ("early mobilisation") receive a removable plastic cast for one week and are allowed to move the wrist directly postoperative. The other group ("control group") received a non removable cast for 5 weeks. Both groups underwent physiotherapy two times a week. The control group was only allowed to move the closed-by joints. In the 6., 9., 12. postoperative week, a half and one year after the operation the patients underwent range of motion (ROM), grip strength measurement and pain according to the visual analogue scale (VAS). Hand function will be analysed according the PRWE (Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation) Score, DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Score and Mayo Wrist Score. - Inclusion criteria: - Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years - A2 - C3 distal radius fracture - no acute or older injury that influences hand function - operative stabilized by palmar angle stable plate - Exclusion criteria: - Age ≥ 76 years - Age &lt; 18 years - C3.3 radius fracture - acute or preexisting injures that influences hand function - pregnancy - neurologic disorders - incapacitated people</detailed_description>
