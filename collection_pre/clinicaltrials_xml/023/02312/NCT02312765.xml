	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea, characterized by abnormal breathing at night, is often untreated in patients with heart failure. Helping patients to effectively use the most common form of treatment for sleep apnea, positive airway pressure therapy, can improve their heart function. This can reduce the likelihood that the patient will be re-admitted to the hospital. AirCareLabs has developed an innovative solution that allows patients to communicate with health care providers 24 hours a day, thus allowing them to get the help they need to effectively use positive airway pressure and thereby reduce the risk of being re-admitted to the hospital.</brief_summary>
