	<detailed_description>This long-term follow up study will enroll subjects who will be transferred from selected interventional, company sponsored trials with radium-223 dichloride (feeder trials). The primary objectives are to define the long term safety profile of radium-223 dichloride (for up to 7 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride); to assess the incidence of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary malignancy; and, in subjects who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy, to assess the incidence of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy treatment and for up to 6 months thereafter at a frequency based on local clinical practice.</detailed_description>
