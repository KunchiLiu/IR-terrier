	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or breast cancer that has spread to the brain and does not respond to treatment. Pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Etirinotecan Pegol in Refractory Brain Metastases &amp; Advanced Lung Cancer / Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: For cohort A and Cohort C, to determine the CNS disease control rate (number of patients with stable disease or partial response or complete response / total number of treated patients) at 12 weeks following treatment with etirinotecan pegol in patients with advanced NSCLC or with MBC with refractory brain metastases Secondary Objectives: Cohorts A and C: - To measure the overall disease control rate and response rate for patients receiving study therapy - To measure the systemic (non CNS) disease control rate and response rate for patients receiving study therapy - To observe the progression free survival of the study population - To observe the overall survival of the study population Cohort B: - To observe CNS and systemic disease control in SCLC Cohorts A, B and C: - To determine the safety profile of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR 102)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least 18 years of age. Life expectancy of 3 months or longer. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Advanced or refractory cancer, consisting of Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) for which singleagent cytotoxic chemotherapy is indicated. OR Histologicallyproven metastatic lung cancer: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as Stage IV disease or recurrent metastatic disease (per lung cancer TNM classification system, 7th ed) (Cohort A) OR Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as extensive stage or recurrent metastatic disease (cohort B), including tumors with mixed small cell and nonsmall cell elements. Prior chemotherapy (at least one of the following): At least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy At least one line of prior targeted treatment for metastatic disease Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy within prior 6 months Prior treatment for mBC must have included taxanebased regimen Prior chemotherapy, including other investigational therapy, has been completed prior to initiation of study treatment, according to the following: ≥ 2 weeks if immediately preceding treatment was chemotherapy/targeted therapy administered on a daily or weekly schedule ≥ 3 weeks if immediately preceding treatment was chemotherapy/targeted therapy administered every 2 weeks ≥ 4 weeks if immediately preceding treatment was chemotherapy/targeted therapy administered every 3 weeks Previously received at least one CNS directed treatment (such as surgery or radiation) OR not be eligible for CNS stereotactic radiosurgery Measurable CNS disease, either previously untreated (not counting systemic therapy), or progressed following previous radiation treatment. Lesions that have progressed after prior radiosurgery should not be selected as measurable disease if they are suspected of being radionecrosis. The following measurement criteria are required, as visualized by contrastenhanced MRI with slice thickness of ≤ 1.5 mm, unless absence of contrast or thicker slices is specifically authorized by Protocol Director. Measurements do not include tumor edema. At least one CNS tumor measuring ≥ 10 mm in longest diameter, OR At least one CNS tumor measuring 59 mm in longest diameter, plus one or two additional CNS tumors measuring ≥ 3 mm in longest diameter, for which the sum of the longest diameters is ≥ 10 mm. Additional tumors are not exclusionary. Adequate organ function as evidenced by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10e9/L without GCSF (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or equivalent) support within 7 days Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL (90 g/L) without blood transfusion within 7 days Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10e9/L without platelet transfusion within 7 days Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), except for patients with documented history of Gilbert's disease who may have DIRECT bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN, except ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X ULN, except ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN; or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (using CockcroftGault formula), or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. Previous treatment with a camptothecin derivative (eg., irinotecan, topotecan, and investigational agents including but not limited to exatecan, rubitecan, gimatecan, karenitecan, SN38 investigational agents, EZN 2208, SN 2310, and AR 67) is not allowed Patients may not have a known history of leptomeningeal disease, as diagnosed by positive CSF cytology, unless prospective permission for enrollment is granted from the sponsor and the PI Patients may not have had major surgery or radiotherapy (therapeutic and/or palliative) within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, including CNSdirected radiation therapy. Minor procedures, such as tumor biopsy, thoracentesis, or intravenous catheter placement are allowed with no waiting period Patients may not have the following co morbid disease or concurrent illness: Chronic or acute gastrointestinal (GI) disorders resulting in diarrhea of any severity grade; patients may not use chronic antidiarrheal supportive care (more than 3 days/week) to control diarrhea in the 28 days prior to first dose of investigational drug. (exception: antidiarrheal medications used to control symptoms from a medication that will be discontinued prior to study are allowed with a 7 day washout before study therapy, for example loperamide for erlotinibassociated diarrhea) Known cirrhosis, defined as Child Pugh class A or higher liver disease Other active malignancy, except for non melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ (of the cervix or bladder) Any other severe/uncontrolled inter current illness or significant co morbid conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would impair study participation or cooperation Patients may not have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational therapy, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) or topoisomerase inhibitors Patients may not be receiving the following medications at the time of first dose of investigational drug: Pharmacotherapy for known hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Any of the following enzyme inducing anti epileptic medications (EIAEDs): phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital Other chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational agents, or biologic agents for the treatment of cancer except for bisphosphonates or denosumab Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study</criteria>
