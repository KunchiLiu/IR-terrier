	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of ECLIPSE PRP™ Wound Biomatrix in Chronic Non-Healing Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multi-center study for subjects undergoing VLU treatment. Qualified subjects will be randomized (1:1); test group (Eclipse PRP™ Wound Biomatrix) and control group (usual and customary practice). The study will consist of 3 periods: a screening period, an active treatment period, and a follow-up period (if healed). Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be ≥18 years of age with a VLU (greater than 4 weeks duration). Each subject will be enrolled in the active treatment period for up to 12 weeks, or to closure of wound with a confirmatory visit 2 weeks after wound closure, whether such closure occurs at 12 weeks or earlier.</detailed_description>
