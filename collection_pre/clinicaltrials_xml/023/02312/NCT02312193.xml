	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to enhance the knowledge of myogenic tone alterations in hypertensive patients and to better understand the mechanisms controlling the myogenic tone. Evaluations will be performed through ex vivo studies of peripheral arterioles in human adipose tissue from lumbar muscle, isolated from biopsies. This will allow investigators to evaluate the myogenic function in response to progressive blood pressure increases, in order to correlate myogenic function to arterial hypertension and to the molecular mechanisms already identified in the preclinical models.</brief_summary>
