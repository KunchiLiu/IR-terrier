	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of a program of early mobilization in the functional capacity in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in short and long- term.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Mobilization on Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypotheses this study is that patients if conduct the program of early mobilization during hospitalization achieve better performance in the walk test (distance) at hospital discharge and 60 days after the surgical procedure compared to patients who only carry out the program of respiratory exercises. Intervention and control groups will receive breathing exercises up to 24 hours postoperatively, and the intervention group will also receive early mobilization exercises.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Consecutive patients admitted to elective and conventional coronary artery bypass, Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20 and 30 Kg/m2, mechanical ventilation time under than 24 hours, hemodynamic stability with or without use of positive inotropes, absence of arrhythmias and angina, mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60&lt;PAM&lt;100 mmHg, heart frequency (HR) 60&lt;FC&lt;100 bpm without signs of respiratory distress such as flaring nose, use of accessory muscles, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, respiratory frequency (f) â‰¤ 20 bpm without signs of infection were included in this study. : presence of previous pulmonary disease, ejection fraction under 35% or longer than 54%, reoperation, intraoperative death or any contraindications to perform the proposed measurements and/or treatment.</criteria>
