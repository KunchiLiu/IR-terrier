	<brief_summary>Recently, there has been interest in applying tranexamic acid topically before the closure of surgical wounds in total hip replacement. It has the advantages of ease of application, maximum concentration at the site of bleeding, minimising its systematic absorption and, potentially , decline the risks for systematic side-effects 。</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Topical and Intravenous Tranexamic Acid in Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives:To assess the efficacy and safety between the two different applying routes. Patients in this project are randomly divided into three groups , one group is a blank group and the rest two groups receive either the topical or the intravenous form of tranexamic acid during unilateral THA(total hip arthroplasty).The total blood loss(TBL) will be calculated as the primary outcome for efficacy while the events of Deep Vein Thrombosis、Pulmonary Embolism、Acute Myocardial Infarction 、 Acute Kidney Infarction and Cerebral Infarction will be recorded to assess the safety of the tranexamic acid during a six-week follow-up for each patient. All surgery are under general anesthesia, through direct lateral approach with cementless prosthesis. For all patients, the drain tube is clamped and closed completely for 2 hours; then the clamp is fully opened.</detailed_description>
