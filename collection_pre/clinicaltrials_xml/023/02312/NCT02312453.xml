	<brief_summary>Abstract Introduction: The brachial plexus at the infraclavicular level runs deeper compared to its course proximally, giving rise to impaired needle visualisation due to the steep angle of needle insertion with the current ultrasound-guided approach. A new posterior parasagittal in-plane ultrasound-guided infraclavicular approach was introduced to improve needle visibility. However no further follow up study was done. Methods: We performed a case series and a cadaveric dissection to assess its feasibility in a single centre, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from November 2012 to October 2013. After obtaining approval from the Medical Ethics Committee, University Malaya Medical Centre, 18 patients undergoing upper limb surgery were prospectively recruited. A cadaveric dissection was also performed. The endpoints of this study were the success rate, performance time, total anaesthesia related time, quality of anaesthesia and any incidence of complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posterior Parasagittal In-Plane Ultrasound-Guided Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Our study focus on the ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block, which is a cord-level block of the brachial plexus for surgical procedures below mid-humerus. The brachial plexus at this level runs deeper compared to its course proximally, giving rise to impaired needle visualisation due to the steep angle of needle insertion with the current ultrasound-guided approach (lateral para-sagittal in-plane technique).1 A new ultrasound-guided posterior approach parasagittal in-plane infraclavicular block was introduced to improve needle visibility.2 However no further follow up study was done. Therefore, we performed a case series of 18 patients with a cadaveric dissection, to assess the feasibility of this approach. Methods After obtaining ethics committee approval from the Medical Ethics Committee, University Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Chairperson Professor Dr. Looi Lai Meng; IRB reference no. 949.14 dated 17 October 2012, amendment no.1038.76 dated 19 December 2013) and written informed consent, 18 patients undergoing surgery of the elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand were prospectively recruited based on the criteria below.</detailed_description>
