	<brief_title>Adoptive Transfer of pp65-specific T Cells for the Treatment of Refractory Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCT recipients who are receiving immunosuppressive agents to control graft versus host diseases (GVHD) are at high risk for serious CMV infection due to CMV reactivation or reinfection during their post-transplant period. Antiviral agents used to treat CMV infection have well-known side effects such as bone marrow suppression causing cytopenia and renal toxicities. Therefore, patients in a serious condition would have a higher probability of antiviral treatment-related toxicities and also increased possibility for prolonged antiviral treatment, thus development of antiviral resistance and risk of treatment failure. Allogeneic HCT recipients are typically lack of these CMV-specific T cells during the post-transplant period and their immune function can be further repressed especially when they are on additional immunosuppressive agents to prevent GVHD. Therefore, these patients may benefit from CMV-specific T cell adoptive transfer.</detailed_description>
