	<brief_summary>Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2) is a Phase III, placebo-controlled, masked, 6 month, 10-center randomized clinical trial sponsored by National Institutes of Aging involving 200 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). ADMET 2 is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant apathy in AD participants. ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real world settings such as outpatient, nursing home, and assisted living facilities and will examine the effects of methylphenidate on apathy and cognition. ADMET 2 will also conduct careful safety monitoring.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADMET 2 will examine in a masked, randomized trial the efficacy of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's dementia. Efficacy will be assessed as the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (NPI apathy) from baseline to 6 months and score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 6 months. ADMET 2 will also examine the safety of methylphenidate for the treatment of clinically significant apathy in participants with Alzheimer's disease by measuring vital signs, electrolyte panels, adverse event reports, and electrocardiograms. Safety will also be measured by examining neuropsychiatric symptoms other than apathy using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Changes from baseline to 6 months in other neuropsychological assessments as measured using the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR) scale will also be assessed. Cost-effectiveness will be measured by assessing quality of life and economic assessment and cognitive changes using a cognitive battery that includes the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and other scales.</detailed_description>

Other benzodiazepines are prohibited in the past 30 days or within 5 halflives, whichever period of time is longer. Failure of treatment with methylphenidate in the past for apathy after convincing evidence of an adequate trial as judged by study physician Currently taking any amphetamine product, an antipsychotic, bupropion, or any medication that would prohibit the safe concurrent use of methylphenidate, including but not limited to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants within the 30 days preceding randomization or a period of time equal to 5 halflives of drug, whichever period of time is longer Need for acute psychiatric hospitalization or is suicidal in the opinion of the study physician Significant communicative impairments that would affect participation in clinical trial Central nervous system abnormalities (e.g., cerebral aneurysm), seizures (convulsions, epilepsy), Tourette's syndrome or presence of motor tics, or abnormal electroencephalograms Lack of appetite that results in significant unintentional weight loss as determined by the study physician in the last three months Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism Any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular abnormality deemed to be clinically significant by the study physician, tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100 beats per minute), or uncontrolled hypertension (defined as medication noncompliance or past 3 months with a diastolic reading &gt; 105 mm Hg), at the time of screening Closed angle glaucoma or pheochromocytoma Women with childbearing potential Current participation in a clinical trial or study that may add significant burden or affect study outcomes Any condition that, in the opinion of the study physician, makes it medically inappropriate or risky for the potential participant to enroll in the trial, including, but not limited to, contraindication to treatment with methylphenidate.</criteria>
