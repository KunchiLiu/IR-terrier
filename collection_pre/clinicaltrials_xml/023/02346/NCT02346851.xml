	<brief_summary>Post stroke hemiplegia patient have shoulder subluxation in affected side. The investigators use functional electrical stimulation in posterior deltoid and supraspinatus for prevention and treatment. But the investigators hypothesis self triggered myoelectric stimulation system has more effective for shoulder subluxation. The purpose of this study is to compare post-stroke shoulder subluxation treatment FES and triggered FES.</brief_summary>
