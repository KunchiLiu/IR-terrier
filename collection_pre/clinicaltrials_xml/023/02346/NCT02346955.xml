	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of humanized IgG4 (kappa) isotype monoclonal antibody against CEACAM1 (CM-24 [MK-6018]), administered intravenously as monotherapy and in combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), in participants with selected advanced or recurrent malignancies. Escalating multiple doses will be evaluated to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2 clinical studies.</brief_summary>
