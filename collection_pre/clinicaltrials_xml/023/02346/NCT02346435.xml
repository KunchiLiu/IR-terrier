	<brief_summary>Retrospective studies indicate that active surveillance for clinically localized, small renal masses (cT1a, &lt;=4cm) is safe. It is our hypothesis that active surveillance is safe and efficacious when compared prospectively to patients undergoing immediate intervention for their small renal mass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Delayed Intervention and Surveillance for Small Renal Masses (DISSRM) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients are offered active surveillance or immediate intervention, as applicable, prior to being offered consent for the DISSRM Registry. All patients are enrolled and followed prospectively. Surveillance patients are followed per protocol with serial imaging, blood work and quality of life questionnaires. Intervention patients are followed at the discretion of the attending surgeon with serial QOL appointments/questionnaires.</detailed_description>
