	<brief_title>Thigh Reduction Surgery of Above Knee Amputee Residual Limbs to Improve Prosthesis Fit and Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will quantify the anatomical distribution of subcutaneous fat, muscle and bone in the residual limb of the transfemoral amputees with an MRI. We will measure the displacement of the socket wall relative to the femur under mechanical loading with x-ray. The functional mobility level of the subject with be quantified via standard clinical and bio mechanical tests. Perform a standard medial thighplasty with our without thigh liposuction. Characterize the post-surgical anatomy, compliance of the residual limb and function of the amputee subjects. After six months, repeat the MRI and xray and compare results. Subject will also complete a questionnaire regarding their views on the outcome of the surgery.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Obese transfemoral amputees with a BMI of at least 30.
