	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide or alternative AA therapy in CRPC participants who were previously treated with a combined androgen blockade therapy which included bicalutamide (Bic-CAB). Efficacy and safety of enzalutamide and alternative AA therapy will be evaluated, and effective therapy against CRPC after treatment with Bic-CAB will be investigated.</brief_summary>
