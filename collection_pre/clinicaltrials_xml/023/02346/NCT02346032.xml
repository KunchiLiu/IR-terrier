	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Refametinib, a MEK Inhibitor, as Second-line Treatment in Advanced Biliary Tract Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Refametinib will be administered orally at the starting dose of 50 mg twice daily on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Self-administration of refametinib tablets will take place on an outpatient basis. Patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicity attributed to study medication should have at least 1-week treatment breaks inserted into the continuous daily dosing period as needed and/or may be interrupted or reduced depending on individual tolerability.</detailed_description>
