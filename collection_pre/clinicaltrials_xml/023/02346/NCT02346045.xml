	<brief_summary>A. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor and numerous treatment strategies have been developed to treat hypertension properly and reduce cardiovascular risk. B. However, there is a subgroup of hypertension which are resistant to treatment. 1. Resistant hypertension is associated to sympathetic hyperactivity 2. Renal sympathetic nerve is known to be associated with systemic sympathetic activity 3. According to research of recent years, catheter based renal sympathetic denervation is a safe and effective treatment modality to treat resistant hypertension C. Resistant hypertension is observed in end stage renal disease (ESRD) frequently. D. Sympathetic hyperactivity is observed in ESRD patients E. Catheter based renal sympathetic denervation is expected to improve resistant hypertension in ESRD patients F. The aim the present study is to evaluate the effects and safety of catheter based renal sympathetic denervation on resistant hypertension in ESRD</brief_summary>
