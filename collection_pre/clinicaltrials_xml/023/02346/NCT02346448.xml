	<brief_summary>One of the major elements of successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP) is the timely and uncomplicated cannulation of the common bile duct (CBD) . Various factors may adversely affect the cannulation procedure of the CBD leading to complications (acute pancreatitis after ERCP, perforation of the duodenum , bleeding ). Endoscopic sphincterotomy is frequently required for interventional procedures (eg stone extraction). During sphincterotomy, incision of the orifice of the papilla will be performed by using a sphincterotome. Complications due to sphincterotomy are known: Bleeding, increased rates of acute pancreatitis, small bowel perforation and scarring with consecutive stenosis of the papilla. As an alternative to sphincterotomy, balloon dilatation using balloon catheters can be performed. As a result, bleeding complications and scarring as late effects might be prevented. Current data is limited in terms of the risk of acute pancreatitis after ERCP when using a balloon catheter. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of acute pancreatitis and other complications after ERCP. Balloon dilatation of the papilla will be prospectively compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy in a randomized multicenter setting.</brief_summary>
