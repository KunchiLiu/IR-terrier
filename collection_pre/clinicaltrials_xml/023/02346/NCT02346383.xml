	<brief_title>Optimal Stimulation Programming for Spinal Peripheral Neuromodulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective double-blinded trial of patients already implanted with SCS to determine which programming model best controls their back and or leg pain. Baseline visit is 2 weeks after implant. Baseline study data is collected, program #1 is started. The visit @ week 4 collects NRS and stimulator data, changes to program #2. The visit @ week 6 collect NRS and stimulator data, and starts program #3. The visit @ week 8 collects NRS and stimulator data. Subject chooses their preferred program from the previous 3 and uses that for the next 12 weeks. The visit @ week 20 collects NRS and stimulator data and final study visit information.</detailed_description>
