	<brief_summary>Study to investigate safety and tolerability of single, inhaled doses (2.5 μg, 5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg and 40 μg) of BI 1744 CL in free dose combination with tiotropium bromide 5 μg (for doses up to and including 20 μg BI 1744 CL) and 10 μg (for doses of 20 μg and 40 μg BI 1744 CL), both administered by Respimat® in healthy male volunteers. Also, to investigate the pharmacokinetics of BI 1744 BS and tiotropium bromide in such combinations, to explore their dose proportionality, and to explore the pharmacodynamic effects of the treatments on selected metabolic and respiratory parameters</brief_summary>

Absence of any clinically relevant abnormality. Absence of any clinically relevant concomitant disease 2. Age ≥21 and ≤50 years 3. BMI ≥18.5 and &lt;30 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) 4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the local legislation 1.

Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 4. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders 5. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts 6. Chronic or relevant acute infections 7. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the drug or its excipients) as judged clinically relevant by the investigator 8. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to randomization 9. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to enrolment in the study or during the study 10. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to randomization 11. Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day) 12. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days as judged by the investigator 13. Alcohol abuse (regularly more than 40 g alcohol per day for men) 14. Drug abuse 15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL blood within 4 weeks prior to randomisation or during the trial) 16. Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomization or during the trial 17. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 18. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre Additionally, following exclusion criteria that are of particular relevance with regard to the known properties of BI 1744 CL as a ßadrenoceptor agonist must be adhered to: 19. Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity 20. Hyperthyrosis 21. Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment 22. Clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia 23.
