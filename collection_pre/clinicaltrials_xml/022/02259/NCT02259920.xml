	<criteria>1. Healthy males, according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests No clinically significant findings No evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease 2. Age ≥18 and ≤65 years 3. BMI ≥18.5 and ≤29.9 kg/m2 4. Subjects must be able to demonstrate the ability to swallow an empty size 000 gelatin capsule 5. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation 1. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 2. History of gastrointestinal surgery, with the exception of Appendicectomy unless it was performed within the previous 12 months 3. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders 4. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts 5. Chronic or relevant acute infections 6. History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) to any drug including the study drug (KUC7483 CL) and similar drugs which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator 7. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins and natural herbal remedies e.g. St Johns Wort) from 14 days prior to the start of the study until the end of the final study period. Occasional use of paracetamol (up to 4g per day) is permitted throughout the study 8. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within four months prior to administration or during the trial 9. Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day). A breath carbon monoxide reading of greater than 20ppm 10. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days 11. Regular alcohol consumption &gt;21 units per week units per week (1 Unit = ½ pint beer, a 25ml shot of 40% spirit or a 125ml glass of wine) 12. Subjects who have ever sought advice from a physician or counselor for abuse or misuse of alcohol, nonmedicinal drugs or other substances of abuse e.g. solvents 13. Any current or previous use of Class A drugs such as opiates, cocaine, ecstasy, lysergic acid diethylamide, and amphetamines (Class B). Volunteers who admit to occasional past use of cannabis will not be excluded as long as they have a negative drugs of abuse test and have been abstinent for at least 12 months 14. Positive drugs of abuse result 15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within three months prior to administration or during the trial) 16. Excessive physical activities outside a subjects normal routine (within one week prior to administration or during the trial until after the poststudy medical) 17. Unable to eat all elements of a standard meal 18. Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance as determined by the Investigator 19. Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from the present study and from diagnostic Xrays but excluding background radiation, exceeding 5mSv in the last twelve months or 10mSv in the last five years. No subject whose occupational exposure is monitored will participate in the study 20. Acute diarrhea, or constipation in the 14 days before the predicted first study day. If screening occurs &gt;14 days before first study day, this criterion is to be determined on first study day. Diarrhea will be defined as the passage of liquid faeces and/or a stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will be defined as a failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day 21. Presence of nonremovable metal objects such as metal plates, screws etc. in abdominal region of the body 22. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are considered by the investigator to be at risk of transmitting through blood and other body fluids the agents responsible for AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) or other sexually transmitted disease or hepatitis. This will be achieved by the use of a card (similar to that used by the National Blood Transfusion Service) which asks a potential subject if they have reason to believe that they may fall into any category included on the card.
