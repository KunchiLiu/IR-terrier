	<brief_summary>Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CART) holds great promise for treatment of tumors. In this trial, CD30 positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will be treated by CD30-specific CART cells (CART30).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD30-directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CART30) Therapy in Relapsed and Refractory CD30 Positive Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When patients enroll on this trial, autologous CART-33 cells were generated from the mononuclear cells of 50 to 90 ml of the patient's peripheral blood (PB). During the term of cell preparation of CART30, patients will receive a conditioning regimen including cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. One day after completing conditioning regimen, the patient will be given infusions of CART30 cells into the vein in escalating doses over a period of 3 to 5 consecutive days. Extra blood will be drawn to measure the persistence of CART30 in vivo.</detailed_description>
