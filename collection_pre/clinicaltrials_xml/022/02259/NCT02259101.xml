	<brief_title>RCT of CBT for Insomnia With PLWHA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test whether a group cognitive-behavioral treatment program for insomnia (CBT-I) will help adults diagnosed with HIV to improve the quantity (number of hours) and the quality of their sleep. The PI will compare adults who participated in the CBT-I program to adults who participated in a Sleep Hygiene group, a common treatment for insomnia. The PI will look at the overall quality of life, and number of hours and quality of sleep of adults who participated in the CBT-I program versus adults in the Sleep Hygiene group. Also, the PI will draw blood to compare how the body responds to medical illnesses between adults in the CBT-I program to adults in the Sleep Hygiene group.</detailed_description>
