	<brief_summary>A randomized, double-blind, 3-arm (1:1:1) study in subjects with first-line Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. The purpose is to test the efficacy and safety of demcizumab, when given in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed compared to placebo. The administration of carboplatin and pemetrexed is a standard treatment for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Carboplatin, Pemetrexed Plus Placebo vs Carboplatin, Pemetrexed Plus 1 or 2 Truncated Courses of Demcizumab in Subjects With Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled at centers in North America, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Up to 28 days (4 weeks) prior to treatment. If enrolled in the study, you will receive intravenous (in the vein) infusions of demcizumab (or placebo), carboplatin, and pemetrexed administered on the same day, every 21 days for 4 cycles, or until it has been shown that your cancer has gotten worse. If your physician decides to delay treatment with one of the agents due to side effects, the other agents may still be administered as scheduled. After 4 cycles, if you have stable or improved disease, you will continue to receive pemetrexed once every 21 days as maintenance therapy. After 8 cycles, if you have stable or improved disease, you may receive demcizumab (or placebo), every 21 days for 4 more cycles. You will undergo assessments every 6 weeks to determine the status of your disease.</detailed_description>
