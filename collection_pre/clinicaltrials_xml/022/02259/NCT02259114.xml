	<brief_summary>Open-label, phase I, non-randomized, multicentric study of single-agent OTX105/MK-8628 administered according to two distinct regimens to participants with selected advanced tumors. The study will be performed in two parts. Dose Escalation Part: This step is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in each of the two regimens, which will be evaluated in parallel. Participants will receive oral OTX105/MK-8628 according to: Continuous Dosing Regimen: continuous, once daily for 21 consecutive days (21-day cycles). OR Days 1-7 Dosing Regimen: once daily on Days 1 to 7, repeated every 3 weeks (21-day cycles; 1 week ON/2 weeks OFF). Participants will be sequentially assigned to Continuous Dosing Regimen or Days 1-7 Dosing Regimen according to the next available place and receive OTX105/MK-8628 at escalating doses levels (DL). Cohorts of 3 participants will be treated, and an additional 3 participants will be treated at the first indication of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). MTD assessment will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 21 days of treatment. Expansion Part: The efficacy of OTX105/MK-8628 in each of the five indications (i.e., Bromodomain-Nuclear Protein in Testis [BRD-NUT] midline carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer [TNBC], non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] harboring a rearrangement Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase [ALK] gene/fusion protein or Kirsten Ras [KRAS] mutation, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and pancreatic ductal carcinoma) will be assessed in terms of response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 [RECIST v1.1] or Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 [PCWG2]) using a selected regimen.</brief_summary>
