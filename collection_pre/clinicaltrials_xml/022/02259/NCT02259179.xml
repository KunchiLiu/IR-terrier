	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects to assess the bioequivalence of naltrexone SR/bupropion SR combination trilayer tablets prepared at two different manufacturing sites. The pharmacokinetics of the two drug products will be evaluated separately in the fed and fasted state.</brief_summary>
