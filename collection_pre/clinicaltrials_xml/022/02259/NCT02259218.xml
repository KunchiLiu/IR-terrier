	<brief_summary>This research trial studies metabolomic and other molecular profiling to identify predictive biomarkers for radiation toxicity and survival in patients with lung or brain cancers receiving radiation therapy. Studying samples of blood, urine, and tissue from patients with lung or brain cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer and predict which patients are at higher risk for developing radiation side effects and how well patients will respond to radiation treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Metabolomic and Epigenetic Profiling of Bodyfluids From Patients With Lung and Brain Cancer Receiving Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer associated with the development of radiation pneumonitis. II. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation therapy for brain cancer associated with the development of radiation necrosis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine, blood, and tissue profiles of patients undergoing radiation therapy for lung and brain cancer associated with survival. OUTLINE: Collected blood, urine, and tissue samples are analyzed for biomarkers via metabolomic and epigenetic profiling using massspectrometry, array, and sequencing-based technology.</detailed_description>
