	<brief_summary>The timing for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation and its effect on target organs in patients with chronic renal failure will be investigated by multicenter prospective cohort. Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) patients (eGFR&lt;10ml/min 1.73m2 for patients without diabetic kidney disease, and eGFR&lt;15ml/min 1.73m2 for diabetic kidney disease) and higher eGFR patients (eGFR 10-15ml/min 1.73m2 for patients without diabetic kidney disease, and eGFR 15-20ml/min 1.73m2 for diabetic kidney disease) will be proposed to undertake AVF creation. Maturation rate and time of AVF will be followed up in 3 months; primary and secondary patency rate of AVF, AVF construction on cardiac structure, function, encephalopathy, cerebral vascular lesions and cognitive function will be followed up in the next 2 years. This multicenter will provide evidence to develop guideline of timing for AVF creation</brief_summary>
