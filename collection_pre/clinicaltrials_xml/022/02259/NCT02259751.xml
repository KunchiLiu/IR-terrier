	<criteria>1. Male patients with acquired suprasacral spinal cord injury practicing intermittent catheterization under stable condition as determined by the investigator 2. Recovery from spinal shock in posttraumatic patients 3. Aged 18 70 years 4. BMI range ≥ 18.5 and &lt; 29.9 kg/m2 5. Documented neurogenic detrusor overactivity as shown by urodynamics within the last 12 months prior to study start and confirmation by the baseline urodynamics (day 2). Detrusor overactivity is defined as a nonvolitional increase in detrusor pressure of &gt; 6 cm H2O. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia may be facultative 6. Written informed consent consistent with International committee on harmonization (ICH)/ Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation given prior to any study procedures 7. Ability and willingness to comply with study treatment regimen and to attend study 1. A total daily volume of urine &gt; 3000 ml as verified in the micturition diary before randomization 2. Treatment with drugs with known anticholinergic effect on the detrusor and/or alphablockers, 7 days prior to inclusion visit 2 3. Treatment with botulinus toxin, capsaicin or resiniferatoxin in the last 6 months prior to the study 4. Unstable dosage of any drug or the expectation of initiation of such a treatment during the trial 5. Use of agonists or antagonists at betaadrenoceptors (The following drugs may nevertheless be used since they do not act upon beta3 adrenoceptors in therapeutic doses: atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol, salbutamol and salmeterol) 6. Neurological diseases other than suprasacral spinal cord injury, affecting urinary bladder function 7. Significant stress incontinence as determined by the investigator 8. Nonfunctional bladder outlet obstruction as determined by the investigator 9. Dilatation of the upper urinary tract 10. Low compliance bladder (Compliance &lt; 20 mL/cm H2O) 11. Detrusor hyporeflexia/areflexia and bradykinesia/tremor of the external urethral sphincter 12. Prostatic or bladder carcinoma 13. Acute urinary tract infection during the runin period or during study period 14. History of interstitial cystitis 15. Surgery of the prostate, the urinary bladder, the urethra, and thermotherapy, ultrasound or laser therapy of the prostate for 12 months prior to enrolment to the study 16. Pelvic radiation therapy 17. Use of indwelling catheter 18. Any electro stimulation therapy within the 14 days prior to inclusion visit 2 19. Significant hepatic or renal disease defined as twice the upper limit of the reference range, regarding serum concentrations of Aspartate transaminase ((SGOT) (AST)), Alanine transaminase ((SGPT) ALT)), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and/or creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dl 20. Diseases or any condition, in which treatment with ß3adrenoceptors agonists is contraindicated 21. Participation in another clinical trail 8 weeks preceding to enrolment in this study or during study period 22. Patients with any severe medical or any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion 23. Allergic to KUC7483 or its excipients 24. Patients with Diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 treated with oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin (any formulation)</criteria>
