	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies regorafenib in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors that have spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body. Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regorafenib in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced/metastatic in patients with carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess overall survival and response rate in advanced/metastatic poor prognosis in patients with carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors. II. To assess the toxicity of patients treated with regorafenib. III. To explore markers of angiogenesis as they relate to outcome in carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors. OUTLINE: Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Advanced metastatic, progressing carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell cancers No prior targeted treatment (tx) or antiangiogenic therapy; patients may have received one line of prior therapy with octreotide, locoregional therapy; continuation of concurrent octreotide is allowed; patients will be maintained on octreotide (sandostatin) for the duration of their treatment Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months) Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed consent form (ICF); a signed ICF must be appropriately obtained prior to the conduct of any trialspecific procedure All acute toxic effects of any prior treatment have resolved to National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) version (v)4.0 grade 1 or less at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF); exceptions to this include alopecia Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x the upper limits of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN (=&lt; 5 x ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer) Alkaline phosphastase limit =&lt; 2.5 x ULN (=&lt; 5 x ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer) Lipase =&lt; 1.5 x the ULN Amylase =&lt; 1.5 x the ULN Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x the ULN International normalized ratio (INR)/ partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 x ULN; (subjects who are treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in coagulation parameters exists; close monitoring [day 5 of cycle 1 and day 1 of each cycle] is mandatory) will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based on a measurement that is predose as defined by the local standard of care) Platelet count &gt;= 100,000 /mm^3 Hemoglobin (Hb) &gt;= 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mm^3;

postmenopausal women (defined as no menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to undergo a pregnancy test; the definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgement of the investigator Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the ICF until at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug; the definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status 01 Patients must have measurable disease Previous assignment to treatment during this study;
