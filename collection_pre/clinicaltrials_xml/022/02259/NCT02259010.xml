	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Itraconazole on the Pharmacokinetics of Alisertib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested in adult patients with advanced solid tumors or relapsed refactory lymphoma. The study will look at the effect of the pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) of alisertib in the presence and absence of itraconazole. This is an open label study. Participants will receive: - Alisertib tablets 30 mg in Part A and 50 mg in Part B - Itraconazole oral solution 200 mg in Part A Participation in Part A is 14 days. The maximum duration of treatment with alisertib will be 12 months (approximately 16 cycles) unless it is determined by the investigator, with agreement by the sponsor, that a patient would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months. This multi-centre study will take place in the United States.</detailed_description>

Known gastrointestinal (GI) abnormality (including recurrent nausea or vomiting) or GI procedure that could interfere with or modify the oral absorption or tolerance of alisertib. 3. Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to itraconazole or similar class agents.</criteria>
