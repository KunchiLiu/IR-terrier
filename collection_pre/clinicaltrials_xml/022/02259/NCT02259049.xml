	<brief_title>The Effects of L-Tyrosine on 24 Hour Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will be monitoring 24 hour ambulatory BP and HR in subjects with PD on 3 separate visits. The first visit will be without an intervention to establish a baseline of 24 hour BP fluctuations. One week later the subject will be given either L-tyrosine (2,000 mg) with B6 (10 mg) or a sugar pill. We will monitor 24 hour BP and HR after supplementation. One week later the subject will repeat the same procedures with either supplement or placebo. This is a total of 3 visits with 24 hour ambulatory BP and HR monitoring.</detailed_description>
