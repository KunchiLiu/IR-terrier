	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to assess whether there is an increased risk of sepsis with the use of telmisartan compared with other ARBs and with the other major antihypertensive classes, including ACEIs, beta-blockers, CCBs and thiazide diuretics. A secondary objective was to assess whether the use of ARBs and ACEIs, compared with the other three major antihypertensive classes and with untreated hypertension, is associated with an increased risk of sepsis. A third objective was to evaluate whether the use of telmisartan compared with other ARBs, ACEIs and other major antihypertensive classes is associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes due to sepsis, in particular acute kidney injury and death</brief_summary>
