	<brief_summary>In patients with acute clots (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) the investigators will collect real world data on their short and long term outcomes. The investigators hypothesise that in patients treated from the outset with rivaroxaban that: 1. treatment will be non-inferior to treatment with conventional anticoagulants (heparins and warfarin); 2. there will be less bleeding than when patients are on conventional anticoagulants; 3. there will be a lower long-term incidence of morbidity from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic limb syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up in Rivaroxaban Patients in Setting of Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>United Kingdom-only prospective, non-interventional, investigator-led, multi-centre, single cohort, registry. The observation period for each patient covers the treatment period with rivaroxaban and follow up until study end. For each patient, the treating health care professional records patient demographics, medical history, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and safety parameters at an initial visit and subsequent follow-up visit(s). Data monitoring will be undertaken by the Sponsor.</detailed_description>
