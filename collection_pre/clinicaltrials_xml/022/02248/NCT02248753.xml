	<brief_summary>A symptomatic episode of the heart rhythm disorder 'atrial fibrillation' (AF) is a frequent reason for visits to the emergency department. Currently, in the majority of cases, immediate (electrical or pharmacological) cardioversion is chosen, while atrial fibrillation terminates spontaneously in 70% of the cases within 24 hours. A wait-and-see approach with rate-control medication only, and when needed cardioversion within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, could be effective, safe and more cost-effective than current standard of care and could lead to a higher quality of life.</brief_summary>
