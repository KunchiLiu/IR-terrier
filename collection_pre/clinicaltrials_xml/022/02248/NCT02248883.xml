	<criteria>1. Healthy female and male volunteers as determined by the results of screening according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (BP, HR), 12lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests 2. Age ≥ 18 and Age ≤ 55 years 3. BMI ≥ 18.5 and BMI ≤ 29.9 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) 4.

Relevant acute, chronic or active chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis, HIV). 6. History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergies) that are deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator 7. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial 8. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 9. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial 10. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes/day or 3 cigars/day or 3 pipes/day) 11. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days 12. Alcohol abuse (more than 60 g/day) 13. Drug abuse 14. Veins unsuited for i.v. puncture on either arm (e.g. veins which are difficult to locate, access or puncture, veins with a tendency to rupture during or after puncture) 15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during the trial) 16. History of any bleeding disorder or acute blood coagulation defect 17. Hypersensitivity to ritonavir, moxifloxacin and/or related drugs of these classes 18. History of Glucose6phosphatedeficiency 19. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to trial or during the trial) 20. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 21. A history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) 22. Heart rate at screening of &gt; 80 bpm or &lt; 45 bpm 23. Any screening ECG value outside of the reference range of clinical relevance including, but not limited to PR interval &gt; 240 ms, QRS interval &gt; 120 ms, QTcB or QTcF &gt; 450 ms, or QT (uncorrected) &gt; 470 ms 24.
