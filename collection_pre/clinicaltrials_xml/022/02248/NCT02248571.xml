	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial with a crossover design to determine patients' preference for capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab or everolimus in combination with exemestane for advanced breast cancer patients and to evaluate, if any combination is associated with a better quality of life. To identify patients' preference for either therapy in this trial, patients without disease progression or other reasons for early discontinuation will be asked for their treatment preference and their treatment satisfaction. To correlate patients' preference with other patient reported outcomes (PROs), quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline and throughout the study, using dedicated questionnaires. With similarly active treatment options, it is of utmost importance to identify the treatment that has the least negative impact on the patients' quality of life.</brief_summary>

Postmenopausal status is defined either by: Age ≥ 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea and postmenopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH) per local institutional standards Prior hysterectomy and has postmenopausal levels of FSH and LH per local institutional standards Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy For women with therapyinduced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH and / or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status. Note: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression. 3.

No indication for other chemotherapeutic treatment including Taxanes or Anthracyclines 6. Measurable or nonmeasurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function (according to current SmPCs of both treatment regimens) 8. ECOG performance status 02 9. Fluent German (spoken and written) language 1. Prior palliative cytotoxic chemotherapies 2. Prior exposure to mTORInhibitors (prior treatment with exemestane is allowed) 3. Concomitant antihormonal therapies, other than study medication 4. Symptomatic visceral metastases (as deemed by the investigator) 5. Uncontrolled CNS metastases 6. Unstable skeletal metastases 7. Medically uncontrolled cardiovascular diseases (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension) 8. Medically uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 9. Severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh C) 10. Inadequate organ function as specified below: Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,5 x109/L Platelets &lt;100 x109/L Creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min [Cockcroft and Gault] 11. Known HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C or history of hepatitis B or C 12. Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency 13. Any other contraindications to the study drugs used or their excipients according to current SmPCs 14. Concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids 15. Use of any other concomitant medication known to interfere with the study drugs 16. Use of concomitant medication known to interfere with the study results (e.g. hormonal therapy) during the whole study duration 17. Premenopausal patients 18. Pregnant or breast feeding patients 19. Participation in additional parallel interventional drug or device studies within four weeks before start of study.</criteria>
