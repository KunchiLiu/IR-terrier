	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma remains incurable disease in most patients . Cellular immunotherapy using dendritic cells is emerging as a useful immunotherapeutic modality to treat multiple myeloma. Vax-DC/MM is an potent immunotherapeutic agent generated by dendritic cells loaded with the ultraviolet B-irradiated autologous human myeloma cells. The main purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Vax-DC/MM in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Dendritic Cell Therapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To create the Vax-DC/MM, myeloma cells will be obtained from the bone marrow of the participants, and leukapheresis will be performed to obtain dendritic cells - Not everyone who participants in this study will be receiving the same dose of study vaccine. A small group of patients will be enrolled into the study and given a certain dose. If they tolerate it, the next group of patients enrolled will received a higher dose. - Before the first injection of Vax-DC, low dose cyclophosphamide will be administered to stimulate immune response. - Participants will be received a certain dose of Vax-DC weekly four times.</detailed_description>
