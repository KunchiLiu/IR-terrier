	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to develop a patient-centered decision aid for decision-making about end-stage heart failure treatment. This study seeks to create a decision aid that presents outcomes, risks, projected experiences, and uncertainties about Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) placement to help patients make values-based decisions about placement. The investigators propose a mixed methods design involving a literature search of clinical evidence, semi-structured patient interviews, and quantitative data from a multi-site trial of patients receiving the decision aid compared to patients not receiving the aid.</brief_summary>
