	<brief_title>Promoting the Universal Medication Schedule Via Mobile and EHR Technologies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown the UMS (1) improves patients' understanding of how much to take of a medicine and when, and (2) reduces the number of times per day patients would take a multi-drug regimen. In this study, UMS tools will be exported into a second electronic health record platform to demonstrate ease of dissemination. Also, as patients may require assistance outside of clinic visits to adapt their prescription regimen to the UMS, this study will test the potential benefit of daily short message service (SMS) text reminders via cell phone. We will conduct a three-arm, provider-randomized controlled trial among English and Spanish-speaking adults taking three or more prescription drugs to evaluate the effectiveness of the UMS strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding, consolidation, and adherence compared to usual care.We will conduct a three-arm, provider-randomized trial at two community health centers in Chicago, IL to evaluate the UMS and UMS+SMS text reminder strategies compared to usual care. English and Spanish-speaking patients who are prescribed three or more medications will be recruited and assessed by phone at baseline, three months, and six months.</detailed_description>
