	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 open label multicentre study of AZD9496 administered orally in patients with advanced ER+ HER2 negative breast cancer. The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of patients. The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose. In addition, expansion cohort(s) at potential therapeutic dose(s) in patients with or without ESR1 mutations will be enrolled to further determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological activity of AZD9496</brief_summary>
