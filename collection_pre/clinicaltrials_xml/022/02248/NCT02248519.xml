	<brief_summary>This is the first randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic and open gastrectomy for resectable gastric cancer in a Western population. The hypothesis is that laparoscopic gastrectomy will result in a lower post-operative burden by means of shorter post-operative hospital stay. Secondarily that laparoscopic gastrectomy is hypothesized to be associated with lower post-operative morbidity and readmissions, higher cost-effectiveness, and better post-operative quality of life, with similar mortality and oncologic outcomes, compared to open gastrectomy. The study starts on 1 December 2014. Inclusion and follow-up will take three and five years respectively. Short-term results will be analyzed and published after discharge of the last randomized patient.</brief_summary>
