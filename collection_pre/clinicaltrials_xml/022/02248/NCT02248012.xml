	<brief_summary>To study the efficacy of everolimus combined with temozolomide as first-line treatment in advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma with a Ki67 of 20-55%, measured as disease control rate (non-progressive disease) at 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus and Temozolomide in Advanced Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (G3)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guidelines for treating advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NECs) advocate the use of combination chemotherapy with a platinum-based chemotherapy combined with etoposide. No other regimen has consistently shown a benefit over this combination. NECs do not respond to treatments usually applied in other neuroendocrine tumours such as somatostatin analogues and interferon. In contrast to metastatic neuroendocrine tumours with a low Ki67, debulking surgery and surgery for liver metastasis is generally not recommended. Cisplatin /carboplatin and etoposide is established as standard treatment of advanced disease based on two small retrospective studies showing a response rate between 41- 67% and median survival of 15-19 months. In the current trial we propose an alternative treatment for a subgroup of patients with GEP-NEC based on new data, with the intention to improve response rates and clinical benefit rate without increasing toxicity</detailed_description>
