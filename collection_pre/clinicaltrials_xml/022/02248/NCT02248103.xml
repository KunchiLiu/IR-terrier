	<brief_title>Comparison of Autogenous Periosteal Pedicle Graft and Collagen Membrane in Management of Periodontal Intrabony Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients suffering from advanced chronic periodontitis were included in this randomized controlled clinical trial. Each subject contributed matched pairs of two- or three-walled intrabony defects. Each pair of periodontal defects were randomly assigned into the experimental group; periosteal pedicle graft guided tissue membrane or the positive control group; bioresorbable collagen guided tissue regeneration membrane. Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6 months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
