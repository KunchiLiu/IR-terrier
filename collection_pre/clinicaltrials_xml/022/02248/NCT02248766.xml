	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of Habitual Wearers of Avaira Toric When Refitted With Clariti Toric Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 30-subject, prospective dispensing study comparing the clinical performance of the subjects' habitual Avaira toric lenses following a refit with Clariti toric lenses. Subject's habitual Avaira toric lenses will be evaluated at the first visit and then re-fitted with a pair of Clariti toric lenses for 1 month of daily wear. After the dispensing visit, subjects will return for evaluations at 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

Can achieve best corrected spectacle distance visual acuity of 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) or better in each eye. Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMAR) or better in each eye with the study contact lenses. Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease Has read, understood and signed the information consent letter.
