	<brief_title>Low Volume Colon Preparation for IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low-volume preparations are gaining attention for higher acceptability. This study compares efficacy, safety and tolerability of a 2L PEG solution plus bisacodil with a 4L PEG solution in patients with inflammatory bowel disease-related colitis. This will be a multicenter, randomized, single-blind study. Adult outpatients with IBD colitis undergoing colonoscopy will receive either 2L PEG plus biscodil or 4L PEG. Bowel cleansing will be assessed using the Ottawa Scale and rated as adequate if &lt;6. Patient acceptance, satisfaction, and related symptoms will be also recorded. The study will also focus on the factors affecting quality of preparation in inflammatory bowel disease patients such as disease characteristics and administration regimen</detailed_description>
