	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD007 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGD007 administered on either weekly or every three week schedules of administration among patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of MGD007 will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of MGD007 in Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-arm open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 dose-escalation study to define a MTD, describe preliminarily safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of MGD007 administered on either weekly or every three week schedules in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation, once weekly and once every three weeks administration of single agent MGD007. Following the establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in two separate dose expansion cohorts at that treatment dose and schedule. In all segments of the study, patients who benefit from MGD007 treatment and continue to meet eligibility may continue treatment in Cycles 2 and beyond.</detailed_description>
