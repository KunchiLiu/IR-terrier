	<detailed_description>Women patients coming for natural miscarriage will be compared according to whether a non-stick gel will be applicated or not after scraping surgery. 6-8 weeks after this surgery uterine synechiae rate will be established at a diagnostical hysteroscopy. Proofreading of this exam will be made by 2 experts at the end of the study without knowing the randomization arm. Long-term follow-up of the patients will be performed to evaluate the effect of the non-stick gel application on post-surgical fertility at 6, 12, and 24 months after scraping surgery using questionnaire asked by post, mail or phone.</detailed_description>
