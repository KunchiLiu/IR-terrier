	<brief_summary>This study investigated any potential associations between two isocaloric diets with different meal frequency (3 meals versus 6 meals) and glycemic control in people at high diabetes risk (lean and overweight/obese women with PCOS and individuals with hyperinsulinemia) and diagnosed with diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Meal Frequency on Glycemic Control of People at High Risk or Diagnosed With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of meal frequency on diabetes risk markers (e.g. glucose and insulin metabolism) has been studied in several studies so far, both in healthy individuals and in individuals being at risk for diabetes mellitus, with or without concurrent weight loss. In addition, few studies have investigated the effect of different meal frequency on glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus under conditions of weight maintenance. However, the results regarding the ideal number of meals remain controversial. To our best knowledge, there is no study available that has investigated the effect of meal frequency on glucose and insulin metabolism in lean and overweight/obese women with PCOS, in lean and overweight/obese individuals with hyperinsulinemia and impaired fasting glucose/glucose tolerance, and in lean and overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, independently of weight loss.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The presence of type 2 diabetes was defined according to the current diagnostic criteria: (a) HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, (b) fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l). (c) 2h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water, or (d) a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. PCOS was defined according to the Rotterdam criteria (Rotterdam 2004) which include the presence of two or more of the following features: chronic oligoovulation or anovulation (fewer than six menstrual periods in the previous year), androgen excess (serum total testosterone &gt;70 mg/dl) and polycystic ovaries. Insulin sensitizers, i.e. metformin, contraceptives, steroids or any medications known to affect glucose, insulin or reproductive hormones for at least the last 6 months. Serious health problems like cardiovascular, liver or kidney diseases. Volunteers who were on diet, using medications affecting body mass or who had experienced a change in body weight ≥ 4.5 kg or a change in physical activity within the 6 months preceding the study onset were excluded.</criteria>
