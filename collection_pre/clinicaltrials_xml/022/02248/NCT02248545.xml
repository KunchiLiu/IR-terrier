	<brief_summary>Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed patients and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. Patients with CD show circulating autoantibodies (anti-transglutaminase, anti-tTG) and suffer from the destruction of a specific tissue cell type (the enterocytes) by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, other autoimmune diseases have been reported in association to CD in 20-30% of the cases. In the last few year, a new clinical entity emerged, which seems include patients who consider themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named "Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity" (6), but, in a recent paper, the investigators suggested the term "Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity" (NCWS), since, to date, it is not known what component of wheat really causes the symptoms. The doubt areas about the NCWS regard also its pathogenesis as, despite some papers evidenced an intestinal immunologic activation, others excluded it. To explore the presence of autoimmunity in NCWS, the investigators evaluated: a) the frequency of autoimmune diseases and b) the frequency of serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity in newly diagnosed NCWS, compared to CD patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed patients and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. Although CD is not surely placed among the autoimmune diseases, patients with CD show circulating autoantibodies (anti-transglutaminase, anti-tTG) and suffer from the destruction of a specific tissue cell type (the enterocytes) by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, other autoimmune diseases have been reported in association to CD in 20-30% of the cases. In the last few year, a new clinical entity emerged, which seems include patients who consider themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named "Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity" (6), but, in a recent paper, the investigators suggested the term "Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity" (NCWS), since, to date, it is not known what component of wheat really causes the symptoms. The doubt areas about the NCWS regard also its pathogenesis as, despite some papers evidenced an intestinal immunologic activation, others linked NCWS to the dietary FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-di and Mono-saccharides, And Polyols) load, thus excluding an immunologic involvement in the NCWS. To explore the presence of autoimmunity in NCWS, in the present study the investigators evaluated: a) the frequency of autoimmune diseases and b) the frequency of serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity in newly diagnosed NCWS and CD patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To diagnose NCWS the recently proposed criteria were adopted. All the patients met the following criteria negative serum antitransglutaminase (antitTG) and antiendomysium (EmA) IgA and IgG antibodies absence of intestinal villous atrophy negative IgEmediated immuneallergy tests to wheat (skin prick tests and/or serum specific IgE detection) resolution of the IBS symptoms on standard elimination diet, excluding wheat, cow's milk, egg, tomato, chocolate, and other selfreported food(s) causing symptoms symptom reappearance on doubleblind placebocontrolled (DBPC) wheat challenge. As we previously described in other studies, DBPC cow's milk protein challenge and other "open" food challenges were performed too. Additional inclusion criteria were: age &gt;18 years followup duration longer than six months after the initial diagnosis at least two outpatient visits during the followup period. positive EmA in the culture medium of the duodenal biopsies, also in the case of normal villi/crypts ratio in the duodenal mucosa selfexclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it, before entering the study other "organic" gastrointestinal disorders nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder physical impairment limiting physical activity menopause steroid and sex steroid therapy, hormone replacement therapy or ovariectomy.</criteria>
