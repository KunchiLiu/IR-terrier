	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies donor stem cell transplant followed by cyclophosphamide in treating patients with hematological diseases. Giving chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells (called graft-versus-host disease). Giving cyclophosphamide after the transplant may stop this from happening.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if haploidentical stem cell transplant using post-transplant cyclophosphamide results in 60% or better disease free survival (DFS) at 12 months at our institution. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the rate of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), non-relapse mortality, and relapse. OUTLINE: PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) on days -6 to -2. Patients receiving myeloablative conditioning receive busulfan IV every 6 hours for 16 doses on days -7 to -4 and patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning receive busulfan IV every 6 hours for 8 doses on days -5 to -4. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV QD on days -3 and -2 TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo stem cell transplant on day 0. GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide QD on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus on days 5-180, and mycophenolate mofetil on days 5-35. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>
