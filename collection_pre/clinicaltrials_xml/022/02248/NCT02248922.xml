	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate lung clearance index (LCI) by a standardized procedure in a well characterized study setting and to assess feasibility of LCI as a more sensitive method than forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) to measure effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in patients with CF aged 6 years and older with mild to moderate lung disease.</brief_summary>
