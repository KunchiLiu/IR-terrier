	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Glucerna SR in Chinese Drug-naïve Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucerna SR (Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, USA) is a nutritional product with lower glycemic response. About 24% of the total energy provided by Glucerna SR is due to monounsaturated fatty acids, which can help keep good metabolic state in accordance with the recommendations of the American Heart Association. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of Glucerna SR treating newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients (NDM) on glycemic stability, with the application of CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) and to further realize the safety and effect of Glucerna SR consumed as a meal replacement at breakfast meal on daily and day-to-day amplitude of blood glucose fluctuation.</detailed_description>
