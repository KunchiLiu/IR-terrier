	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity and tolerability of PF-03084014 when administered as a single agent in the treatment of patients with advanced triple receptor-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) harboring genomic alterations in Notch receptors (NA+), and in a smaller subset of mTNBC patients whose tumor tests negative for genomic alterations in Notch receptors (NA-)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with evidence of a) metastatic or b) locally recurrent advanced disease that is not amenable to resection or radiotherapy with curative intent. Availability of an original diagnostic tumor tissue or the most recent metastatic tumor biopsies (archival biopsy or de novo biopsy) and a peripheral blood sample for Notch receptors genomic profiling Known brain metastases. Prior treatment with gamma secretase inhibitor or other Notch signaling inhibitor.</criteria>
