	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-centre study evaluating 15 milligram (mg) twice daily/ Bi-daily (BID) of losmapimod versus placebo, in addition to standard of care (SoC). The primary objective of this study is to explore the therapeutic potential of losmapimod as a treatment to reduce the rate of exacerbations in the subset of participants with moderate-to-severe COPD who are at high risk of exacerbation, having experienced two or more moderate/severe exacerbations in the preceding 12 months, and who have &lt;=2% of blood eosinophils at screening. As secondary objectives safety, effects on lung function, quality of life, pharmacokinetic (PK), biomarkers of both disease and inflammation shall be evaluated. The duration of the treatment period is variable but will be at least 26 weeks and up to a maximum of 52 weeks, with the end of study date being established once the final participant has been randomized. The purpose of the variable dosing regimen is to enable participants to remain in the study for a longer duration, as it is anticipated that this will increase the likelihood of observing exacerbation events without increasing the overall study duration. It will also enable safety data on dosing periods beyond 6 months to be generated. Approximately 200 participants in a 1:1 ratio between losmapimod and placebo will be randomized to the study. Sample size re-estimation will be performed during the course of the study to potentially increase the sample size up to a maximum of 600 participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>COPD diagnosis and severity: Participants with a clinical history of COPD (established by a physician) in accordance with the following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, for at least 6 months prior to enrolment. Participants must have evidence of airflow obstruction, defined as postbronchodilator FEV1 equal to or less than 80% of predicted normal value calculated using "Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey" (NHANES III) reference equation at Visit 1 and a FEV1 / FVC ratio &lt;=70% at Screening (Visit 1). Note: Postbronchodilator spirometry will be performed approximately 1015 minutes after the participants has selfadministered 4 inhalations (i.e., total 400/360 [microgram] mcg) of salbutamol/albuterol via a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (use of spacer will be optional). The studyprovided central spirometry equipment will calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 percent predicted values. Exacerbation History: A documented history (e.g., medical record verification) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 of &gt;=2 COPD exacerbations resulting in prescription for antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation or extended observation in a hospital emergency room or outpatient centre. Note: Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as a moderate exacerbation unless the use was specifically for the treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD. Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Participants must be receiving daily maintenance treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Notes: Participants receiving only "pro re nata" or as needed (PRN) COPD medications are not eligible for inclusion in the study. All participants will continue on their current Standard of Care (SoC) COPD medications throughout the entire duration of the study. Tobacco use: Participants with a current or prior history of &gt;=10 packyears of cigarette smoking at Screening (Visit 1). Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. One pack year =20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year or the equivalent. Number of pack years=(number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked. Sex: Male or female participants aged &gt;=40 years at Screening (Visit 1). A female participant is eligible to participate if she is of nonchild bearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milliinternational unit/milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram/milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;140 [Picomoles per liter] pmol/L) is confirmatory] or if of childbearing potential is using a highly effective method for avoidance of pregnancy from 30 days before the first dose, for the duration of dosing and until 2 weeks post lastdose. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Corrected ECG QT interval (QTc)&lt;450 milliseconds(msec) or QTc&lt;480 msec for participants with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread. For eligibility and withdrawal, ideally the same QT correction formula will be used for all participants. However, because this is not always possible, the same QT correction formula will be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and withdrawal from the study. The QTc will be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period. Eosinophils: &gt;2.0% blood eosinophils at Screening (Visit 1) Concomitant medication: COPD Medication: Participants currently on chronic treatment with macrolides or Roflumilast; Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) or nocturnal oxygen therapy required for greater than 12 hours a day. Oxygen PRN use (i.e. &lt;=12 hours per day) is not exclusionary. Multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporter 1 (MATE1) inhibitors: cimetidine, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim (short course treatment with trimethoprim is allowed). Other medications: Chronic maintenance therapy with antiTumor Necrosis Factor (antiTNF), antiInterleukin1 (antiIL1), phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, or any other immunosuppressive therapy (not including steroids) within 60 days prior to dosing. Any other investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever is longer prior to Screening Visit. Other respiratory disorders: Participants with asthma (as primary diagnosis) lung cancer, bronchiectasis, active sarcoidosis, active lung fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, active interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases. Participants with alpha1antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD. Participants with clinically significant sleep apnea who require use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.

Lung resection: Participants who have undergone previous lung reduction surgery (e.g. lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or lung volume reduction). COPD stability: Less than 30 days prior to Visit 1 have elapsed from completion of a course of antibiotics or oral corticosteroids for a recent COPD exacerbation. Evidence of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD on chest Xray (posteroanterior with lateral) or computerised tomography (CT) scan (historic data up to 1 year may be used). Pulmonary rehabilitation program: Participation in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Participants who are in the maintenance phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program are not excluded. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2x Upper limits of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).
