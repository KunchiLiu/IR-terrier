	<brief_summary>Successfully perfused STEMI patients will receive routine transthoracic echocardiography qid for 4 days or placebo. Myocardial function and infarct size will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Beams as an Adjunct to Reperfusion Therapy in STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who had acute STEMI and successfully reperfused by either thrombolytic therapy or primary angioplasty and stenting will be included this study. A basal routine echocardiography will be obtained in all patients after reperfusion therapy. Thereafter, patients will be divided into two groups: 1.Treatment group will receive transthoracic echocardiography using Philips HD11 XE ® for 30 minutes qid for 4 days. 2. Placebo group will have the same Philips HD11 XE ® echo transducer applied for the same time and duration on their chest but with the ultrasound turned-off. Detailed left and right ventricle function as well as performance index and stress-strain imaging will be obtained and analyzed at 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
