	<brief_title>Comparative Study to Evaluate the Cosmetic Appearance of Two Brands (Coopervision (CVI) vs. Competitor) of Color Soft Contact Lenses.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each lens pair comparison will require two visits over two days, as follows: Visits: V1 (lens dispensing), V2 (20 minutes post lens settling). Each subject will be randomized to wear the test and control lenses in a series of four short fitting comparisons.</detailed_description>
