	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to analyse test-retest-reliability of functional quantification of endothelial dysfunction through puls-amplitude-tonometry in patients with heart failure with preserved/reduced ejection fraction, pulmonary hypertension, arterial hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. In the same group, test-retest-reliability of circulating endothelial cells as well as test-retest reliability of non invasive cardiac output Monitoring will be observed and analysed.</brief_summary>
