	<brief_title>Gastric Outlet Obstructions Tailored Covered Stents for GOO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the shape of the GOOs, stomach opacifications were performed using contrast media before stenting. In the GOO tailored group (33 cases), the distal stents were semi-spherical with a length of 20 mm and a diameter of 28 mm. The middle stent segments had diameters of 20 mm. The proximal ends of large cup-shaped stents had 53.3 ± 5.5 mm diameters and were 15 or 20 mm long, whereas the large funnel-shaped stents had 33.6 ± 3.6 mm diameters and were 25 or 30 mm long. The control group (32 cases) received standard uncovered stents (semi-spherical, with diameters of 28 mm and 20 mm long).Our hypothesis was that unresectable GOO tailored covered stents are superior to the standard uncovered ones in terms of stent re-obstruction and stent migration. In the current study the efficacy and safety of GOO tailored covered stents for the treatment of non-resectable GOOs caused by distal gastric cancer was compared with standard uncovered stents.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>GOO defined by symptoms resulting in decreased oral intake (nausea, vomiting and inability to eat),the obstruction was caused by primary distal stomach cancer and the site of stenosis was between the gastric body and duodenum bulb the presence of only mild symptoms in patients who could tolerate a liquid diet, clinical evidence of perforation or peritonitis, evidence of multiple smallbowel obstructions because of peritoneal seeding as well as diabetes or other diseases that affect gastric motility and use of promotility agents.</criteria>
