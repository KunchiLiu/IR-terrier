	<brief_summary>Open label multicentric phase II randomized trial, using high throughput genome analysis as a therapeutic decision tool, which aims at comparing a targeted treatment administered according to the identified molecular anomalies of the tumor with maintenance chemotherapy (targeted substudy 1) as well as immunotherapy with maintenance chemotherapy in patients without actionable genomic alterations or non eligible to substudy 1 (immune substudy 2).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening phase: New frozen biopsy or an archived frozen sample will be sent to the genomic plateforms for DNA extraction and genomic analysis (DNA microarrays and Next generation sequencing). Patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the targeted substudy 1 randomisation phase when both following mandatory conditions have been met: stable or responding disease has been observed (investigator judgment) after 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy (or at least after 4 cycles of chemotherapy if stopped for toxicity) and targetable alteration has been identified by the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB). If not eligible for the substudy 1 randomisation phase, patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the immune substudy 2 randomization phase when both following mandatory conditions are met: stable or responding disease (investigator judgment) is observed after 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy (or at least after 4 cycles if treatment was stopped due to toxicity) AND not eligible to randomization in the substudy 1 (because patient had no targetable alteration identified by the Molecular Tumor Board, or failed to have a genomic profile for the tumor [low tumor cells percentage, technical issue during genomic analysis, etc.], or a non inclusion criteria that precluded entry into the substudy 1) Randomization phase: The mandatory post-chemotherapy wash-out period, of 28 days for 21 or 28 day-cycle chemotherapies or of 15 days for weekly (except monoclonal antibodies) or daily chemotherapies,will provide time to achieve all the required tests and examinations. The randomization program will allocate the following treatments with a 2:1 ratio in favor of Arm A of the considered substudy: Substudy 1 : targeted therapies versus standard maintenance chemotherapy - Arm A1 / targeted arm: targeted maintenance from a list of 8 targeted drugs (see Appendix 5 - List of medications and targets) guided by the genomic analysis, or - Arm B1 / chemotherapy arm : maintenance chemotherapy (or no antineoplastic treatment in case of toxicity at the time of randomization) Substudy 2 : immunotherapy versus standard maintenance chemotherapy - Arm A2 / immunotherapy maintenance arm: MEDI4736 or - Arm B2 / chemotherapy arm: chemotherapy continued as a maintenance chemotherapy (or no antineoplastic treatment in case of toxicity)</detailed_description>
