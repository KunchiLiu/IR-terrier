	<brief_title>3T MR Angiography of the Hepatic Vasculature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will use two Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) techniques that will look at participants liver veins and arteries without giving a coloring matter (contrast) before taking the images. Investigators propose to evaluate the usefulness of these two new techniques, which do not involve exposing participants to radiation or contrast.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects that fulfill the criteria for living liver donation and are evaluated for the procedure with CT and MR. Unable to give informed consent Unable to comply with breathing or other imaging related instructions resulting in inability to obtain diagnostic quality MRI studies Not suitable to undergo MRI with a gadoliniumbased contrast agent because of: Claustrophobia, unless patient agrees to sedation measures per institutional standard practice during MR imaging Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body per institutional safety standards Weight greater than that allowable by the MR table Renal failure, as determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) model based on a serum creatinine level obtained within 28 days prior to enrollment Known allergylike reaction to contrast media (gadolinium) or moderate or severe allergic reactions to one or more allergens as defined by the American College of Radiology (ACR), and unwillingness to undergo pretreatment as defined by the institution`s policy and/or ACR guidance Pregnancy (if a female is of childbearing potential defined as a premenopausal female capable of becoming pregnant a pregnancy test should be done)</criteria>
