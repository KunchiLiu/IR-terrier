	<brief_summary>Sixty patients aged between 1-10 years, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical status I-II scheduled for MRI were allocated in this randomized double-blinded study. Group 1 received 3 mcg/kg, Group 2 received 4 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine before imaging. From the beginning on every 10 minutes heart rate (HR), saturation (SpO2) and Ramsey Sedation Score (RSS) were recorded. Induction time was time interval to receive RSS 5. MRI began and separation-score was noted. If intranasal sedation failed, an intravenous canula was placed and propofol was applied. Imaging quality was evaluated. Recovery time was time interval to receive Aldrete-score 9. Parents' satisfaction was questioned before patient was discharged.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES OF STUDY Anesthetic agents used for MRI in paediatrics should have few adverse effects, allow fast induction and recovery. The administration route is also important and should be minimally invasive. In this study the investigators aimed to compare two different doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine applied to children for MRI sedation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty patients aged between 1-10 years, ASA I-II scheduled for MRI were allocated in this randomized double-blinded study. Group 1 received 3 mcg/kg, Group 2 received 4 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine before imaging. From the beginning on every 10 minutes HR, SpO2 and RSS were recorded. Induction time was time interval to receive RSS 5. MRI began and separation-score was noted. If intranasal sedation failed, an intravenous canula was placed and propofol was applied. Imaging quality was evaluated. Recovery time was time interval to receive Aldrete-score 9. Parents' satisfaction was questioned before patient was discharged.</detailed_description>
