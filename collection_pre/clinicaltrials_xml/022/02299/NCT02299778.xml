	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether folate produced by bacteria that live in our colon can be absorbed in human colon using a stable isotope method. This study would lead a better understanding of the bioavailability of colonic bacterially-synthesized folate and its quantitative contribution to whole body folate homeostasis.</brief_summary>
