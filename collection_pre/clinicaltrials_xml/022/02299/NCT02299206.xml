	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, non-inferiority controlled trial to demonstrate non-inferiority of CeraVe Baby Diaper Rash Cream compared to Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste when administered to children with diaper dermatitis who are between 3 months to 18 months of age. Parents/caregivers of subjects in both groups will administer the product with each diaper change throughout the course of the study period. Product can be applied liberally as needed. Diapers and skin cleansing interventions will stay constant throughout the treatment period. Subjects will be assessed by the study doctor, parent/caregiver will be asked about any adverse effects. Parent/caregivers will also be asked to complete a daily diary that asks about changes in their baby's diaper dermatitis, a Visual Analogue Scale severity assessment of their baby's diaper dermatitis, and observations related to product use and the baby's comfort level. Parents/caregivers will also be given a questionnaire rating the use of the study products.</brief_summary>

The study doctor will assess diaper dermatitis for inclusion and exclusion criteria and to verify mild to moderate severity. Once study eligibility has been confirmed, parental/guardian consent will be obtained. No washout period is necessary for this study. Location of clinically apparent involved area will be shaded by hand onto diagram by the research personnel. Study products will be dispensed to parent/caregiver, along with instructions for administration. Parent/caregivers will also be asked to complete a daily diary that asks about changes in their baby's diaper dermatitis, a Visual Analogue Scale severity assessment of their baby's diaper dermatitis, and observations related to product use and the baby's comfort level. Parents/caregivers will be asked to complete the daily diary for each day of the study. Visit 2 (Day 7) Subjects will again be assessed by the study doctor.
