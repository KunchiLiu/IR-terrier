The early antidepressant efficacy of ketamine in depressed, uni- or bipolar patients F. The somatic and psychological tolerance of ketamine G. An overall improvement in the clinical condition of the patient by the practitioner H. Creation of a biological collection for future ancillary studies dedicated to genetic analysis (microRNA and mRNA). I. The efficacy of ketamine versus a placebo for the short-term (at 72h, i.e. 24h after the last perfusion) relief of suicidal ideation, measured using the BSS self-report questionnaire, in patients hospitalized for suicide risk.</detailed_description>
