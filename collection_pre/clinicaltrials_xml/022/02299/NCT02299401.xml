	<brief_summary>This randomized trial will compare the rates of ongoing pregnancy, safety/side effects and acceptability of two medical abortion regimens that are commonly used in Latin America. The first regimen will involve three 800 mcg doses of misoprostol taken buccally in three hour intervals; the second will involve three 800 mcg doses of misoprostol taken sublingually in three hour intervals. This study will also aim to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a semi-quantitative pregnancy test (SQPT) for at-home follow-up in both settings.</brief_summary>
