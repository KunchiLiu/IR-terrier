	<brief_summary>Over one million hospitalizations for acute heart failure (AHF) occur over every year in the United States, resulting in high mortality, re-hospitalizations, and incurred financial costs; yet nearly every attempt over the last 10 years to improve outcomes with novel therapies have all failed. In this proposal, we will study whether a generic drug known as a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (more commonly known as an aldosterone blocker), proven to reduce morbidity and mortality for chronic heart failure patients, is safe and feasible to give to AHF patients in the emergency department and during hospitalization for a total of 3 days. The results of this study will provide necessary and sufficient data to design an efficacy study in a larger population to test whether early use of a high-dose of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists will reduce post-discharge morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Aldosterone Blockade in Acute Heart Failure: An Exploratory Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial pilot study - Early Aldosterone Blockade in Acute Heart Failure: An Exploratory Safety Study - will explore the safety of early mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with high-dose spironolactone (100mg/daily), an oral mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, versus placebo (both in addition to standard therapy), in patients admitted with acute heart failure (AHF) for 3 days. Aim 1 will answer the critical question that early mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism in AHF patients is sufficiently safe to move forward with a definitive trial. Aim 2 will demonstrate feasibility of patient enrollment and compliance with treatment throughout the study to inform future study design and enrollment projections. This study will provide the necessary and sufficient data in order to plan a larger, simple, definitive trial to test the hypothesis that early aldosterone blockade in AHF patients will reduce mortality and 30-day readmissions. The primary endpoint for the pilot study will be the difference in incidence of mean change of serum potassium of a specific amount from baseline to 120 hours from initial dose between placebo vs. spironolactone treated subjects.</detailed_description>
