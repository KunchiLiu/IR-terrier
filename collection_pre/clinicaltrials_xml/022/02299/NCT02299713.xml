	<brief_title>Electro-Acupuncture Treatment in Patients With Osteoarthritis Of The Knee (EATOAK)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous randomised trials and meta-analyses have shown certain efficacy of acupuncture in some chronic painful conditions, in spite of methodological weaknesses. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the endogenous opioid (EO) system are the mechanisms appear to explain how acupuncture works in part. These systems have been shown to be important mediators of stress, pain and other stimuli. The Osteoarthritis Research International suggest that osteoarthritis (OA) treatment should be multidisciplinary and recommended acupuncture as one of 12 possible non-pharmacological modalities for treating OA. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, parallel design. 128 out-patients over 50 years with OA of the knee will be recruited from Mallorca, Spain. Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: placebo/sham acupuncture, non insertion technique, and EA. Acupuncture treatments will be used the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) style. The patients will be evaluated after a period of one month (2 sessions weekly), three months (1session monthly), six months (1 session every 45 days) and again one year later (1 session every 2 months), at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
