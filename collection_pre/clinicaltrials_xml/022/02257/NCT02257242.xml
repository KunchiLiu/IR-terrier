	<brief_title>Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (Marqibo®), Bendamustine and Rituximab—Phase I Trial in Indolent B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bendamustine-rituximab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for treatment of many indolent B-cell lymphomas, but most patients experience a recurrence of the lymphoma. Vincristine sulfate has been a traditional component of chemotherapy regimens in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it is possible that adding it to the bendamustine-rituximab regimen might provide a better quality of remissions or longer duration of remissions with acceptable toxicity. This is a phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-arm trial in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma otherwise appropriate for bendamustine-rituximab as initial or subsequent line of therapy. Patients will receive the of rituximab and bendamustine in combination with escalating doses of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®). The objective of this study is to assess safety of this combination by establishing the maximum tolerated dose of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (Marqibo®) in the combination.</detailed_description>
