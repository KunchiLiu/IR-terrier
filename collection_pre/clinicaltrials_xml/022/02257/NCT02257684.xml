	<brief_title>A Dose Confirmation and Pharmacokinetic Study of Pegcrisantaspase Administered as Intravenous (IV) Infusion in Children and Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) /Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LBL). Following Hypersensitivity to Pegaspargase (Oncaspar)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study was to assess the response rate in children and young adults with ALL/LBL and hypersensitivity to pegaspargase defined as the proportion of subjects having a serum asparaginase activity (SAA) level of ≥ 0.1 IU/mL 14 days following the first IV pegcrisantaspase dose in Course 1. Also, to assess the safety of IV pegcrisantaspase therapy in children and young adults with ALL/LBL with hypersensitivity to pegaspargase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have a diagnosis of ALL/LBL 2. Be &gt; 1 to ≤ 21 years of age at study enrollment 3. Have had a ≥ Grade 2 allergic reaction (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.03) to pegaspargase 4. Have ≥ 1 dose(s) of pegaspargase remaining in his/her treatment plan 5. Have a documented SAA level that is below the limit of quantitation per the analytical method. 6. Subjects must have, in the opinion of the investigator, fully recovered from prior allergic reaction to pegaspargase. Subjects must have completed antihistamine, epinephrine, and/or corticosteroid treatment for the allergic reaction ≥ 24 hours prior to pegcrisantaspase administration. 7. Subjects must have a performance status corresponding to: Karnofsky ≥ 50 (for subjects &gt; 16 years of age) Lansky ≥ 50 (for subjects ≤ 16 years of age) 8. Adequate Renal Function Defined as: Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 or A serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: Age Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female 1 to &lt; 2 years 0.6 0.6 2 to &lt; 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to &lt; 10 years 1 1 10 to &lt; 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to &lt; 16 years 1.5 1.4 ≥ 16 years 1.7 1.4 The threshold creatinine values in this table were derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating GFR (Schwartz &amp; Gauthier 1985) utilizing child length and stature data published by the CDC. 9. Adequate Liver Function defined as: Bilirubin levels ≤ 2.5x ULN for age, and Direct (conjugated) Bilirubin &lt; 0.5 mg/dLSGPT (ALT) ≤ 225 U/L. For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L. 10. Subjects who are sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study period and for 4 weeks after the study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or the partner include abstinence, birth control pills or patches, diaphragm and spermicide, condom and vaginal spermicide, surgical sterilization, postmenopausal, vasectomy (&gt;6 months prior to baseline), and progestin implant or injection. 11. Able to understand and to sign a written informed consent. All subjects and/or their parent or a legally authorized representative must sign a written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines. 1. Have previously received Erwinia asparaginase 2. Are receiving another investigational agent or will receive an investigational agent in subsequent phases of protocol therapy that include asparaginase 3. Have a history of ≥ Grade 3 pancreatitis (CTCAE v4.03) 4. Prior history of a CNS thrombotic event or ≥ Grade 3 (CTCAE v4.03) thrombotic event, excluding catheterassociated clots 5. Prior history of asparaginaseassociated ≥ Grade 3 (CTCAE v4.03) hemorrhagic event or asparaginaseassociated thrombus requiring anticoagulation therapy 6. Blood triglyceride levels &gt; 500 mg/dL or &gt; 5.6 mmol/L 7. Hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy 8. QTc prolongation ≥ 550 msec 9. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study 10. Subjects who have any serious active disease or comorbid medical condition (according to investigator's decision), or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form, assent form or informed consent form by parents, pending institutional requirements, or per investigator's opinion, would prevent the subject from completing one course of pegcrisantaspase. Pregnant or lactating females or females of childbearing potential not willing to use an adequate method of birth control for the duration of the study. Female subjects who are lactating who do not agree to stop breastfeeding.</criteria>
