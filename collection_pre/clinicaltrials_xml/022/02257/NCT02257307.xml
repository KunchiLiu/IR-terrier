	<brief_summary>Evaluating retinopathy of prematurity (eROP) ancillary study Implementation Project is a multi-center observational study will focus on feasibility, and relative cost-effectiveness of an retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) telemedicine evaluation system to detect eyes of at-risk babies and provide timely feedback to the examining ophthalmologist at the Clinical Center.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design: Observational Cohort Study Setting/Participants: Premature babies who are at high risk for ROP during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). - The number of sites - 5 centers in the US - The number and description of participants: 500 babies with birth weights of &lt;1251g Study Interventions and Measures: Data from RetCam digital images obtained as part of clinical care during the routine diagnostic eye exam for ROP will be uploaded and transmitted via secure server to a central reading center. These de-identified images will be graded by Certified Image Readers. Results of image gradings will be sent back via secure web-based platform to the Clinical Center. The primary outcome measure is the turnaround time from uploading the images to feedback to the Clinical Center. The secondary outcome measure is the time required to obtain retinal images for babies scheduled for ROP examination in the NICU (relative cost-effectiveness).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Babies with birth weights of &lt;1251g 2. Babies having clinical examinations to screen for ROP Referral from an outside hospital for treatment of serious ROP that is performed before imaging can be obtained. Congenital Nonocular Anomalies: Babies will be excluded from this study if they have a severe congenital nonocular anomaly. Such exclusions include anencephaly, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, or severe cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities. The neonatologist caring for the baby will determine whether a particular congenital abnormality would exclude the baby from participation in this study. Ocular Abnormalities: Babies will be excluded from this study if they have major congenital abnormalities in one or both eyes including microphthalmos, anophthalmos, anterior segment dysgenesis, dense corneal opacity, cataract, glaucoma, chorioretinitis, optic nerve hypoplasia, and chorioretinal coloboma. Eyelid abnormalities, such as severe blepharoptosis or severe hemangioma, that would likely affect vision, would also exclude a baby from participation. Minor abnormalities that would not be expected to affect vision may not be exclusion criteria including Mittendorf dot, mild blepharoptosis, limbal dermoid, and iris coloboma.</criteria>
