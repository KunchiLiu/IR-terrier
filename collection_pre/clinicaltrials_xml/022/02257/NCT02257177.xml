	<brief_summary>This study will be divided into 2 parts. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, single centre, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) phase I study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD (Pharmacodynamic) of TD139 in up to 36 healthy male subjects. Part 2 will be a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, multiple dose expansion cohort, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TD139 in up to 24 male subjects and female subjects of non child-bearing potential with IPF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT (Randomized Control Trial) of TD139 vs Placebo in HV's (Human Volunteers) and IPF Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 6 cohorts of 6 subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive either a single dose of TD139 or matching placebo via DPI (dry powder inhaler) in an ascending dose fashion. A single cohort of up to 24 patients will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive a single dose of TD139 or placebo via DPI once daily for 14 days in a 2:1 TD139 to placebo ratio. The dose of TD139 selected will be based on data from Part 1 and on pre-clinical efficacy and safety data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male subject or female subject of non childbearing potential with IPF. Subjects aged between 45 and 85 years of age. Subjects with an FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) ≥ 45% predicted and an FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Flow) /FVC ratio ≥ 0.7. Subjects with oxygen saturation &gt;90% by pulse oximetry while breathing ambient air at rest. Subjects with a diffusing capacity (DLCO transfer fact of the lung for carbon monoxide) &gt;25%. Subjects with a diagnosis consistent with IPF prior to screening based on ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT (American, European, Japanese and Latin American Respiratory Societies) consensus criteria. Subjects who are able to undergo bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Subjects able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. Subjects with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results. Subjects with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) determined within 28 days of the first dose. Subjects with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 28 days of the first dose. Any condition that makes the patient at unacceptable risk for bronchoscopy. Active cigarette smoking. Presence of a significant comorbidity felt to limit life expectancy to less than 12 months. HRCT (high resolution CT scan) pattern showing emphysema more than the extent of fibrosis of the lung area conducted within 12 months of Day 1. Evidence of renal, hepatic, central nervous system, or metabolic dysfunction. Evidence of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (defined as a HbA1c of &gt; 59 mmol/mol [7.5%]). Use of systemic immunosuppressants within 30 days of dosing. Subjects currently receiving oral corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs (e.g. chlorambucil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), antifibrotic drugs (e.g. pirfenidone), vasodilator therapies for pulmonary hypertension (e.g bosentan), unapproved (e.g. Interferonγ, penicillamine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate) and/or investigational therapies for IPF or administration of such therapies within 4 weeks of initial screening. History of malignancy, including carcinoma during the preceding five years. History of, or current asthma. Participation in a clinical study of an unlicensed drug in the previous 4 months, or a marketed drug study within the previous 3 months.</criteria>
