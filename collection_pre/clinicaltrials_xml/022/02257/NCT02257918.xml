	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center Phase 2 randomized, open-label study in approximately 180 adult male and female subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. The study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of an antimicrobial investigational product, AZD0914 manufactured by AstraZeneca, administered to adults to treat uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea compared to treatment with ceftriaxone. Subjects will be randomly assigned 70:70:40 to receive a single, oral dose of 2000 mg of AZD0914, 3000 mg of AZD0914, or intramuscular dose of 500 mg of ceftriaxone. The drug name is also known as ETX0914.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized, Open-label Phase 2 Study of Oral AZD0914 in the Treatment of Gonorrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uncomplicated gonorrhea is currently the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide and, accordingly, is a serious public health problem. This is a multi-center Phase 2 randomized, open-label study in approximately 180 adult male and female subjects, between the ages of 18 and 55, with uncomplicated cervical or urethral gonorrhea. The study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of an antimicrobial investigational product, AZD0914 manufactured by AstraZeneca, administered to adults to treat uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea compared to treatment with intramuscular ceftriaxone. Subjects will be randomly assigned 70:70:40 to receive a single, oral dose of 2000 mg of AZD0914, 3000 mg of AZD0914, or intramuscular dose of 500 mg of ceftriaxone. The study duration is 11 months and subject participation of 30 days. Subjects with 1) untreated urethral or cervical gonorrhea identified via laboratory testing at a prior visit, or 2) untreated subjects acknowledging anal, oral, or vaginal sexual contact in the past 14 days with someone diagnosed with gonorrhea, or 3) signs and symptoms of urethral or cervical gonorrhea will be offered enrollment in the study and consented. The primary objective assess the efficacy by microbiological cure rate of 2000 mg or 3000 mg AZD0914 compared to 500 mg ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. The second primary objective assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of 200 mg or 3000 mg AZD0914 compared to 500 mg ceftriaxone in adult subjects with uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. The drug name is also known as ETX0914.</detailed_description>
