	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IIIb multicentre, randomised, blinded, triple dummy, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 microgram [mcg] Once daily [QD]) when administered via ELLIPTA® Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) compared to indacaterol plus tiotropium (150 mcg/18 mcg respectively QD) administered via individual inhalers over a treatment period of 12 weeks in participants with moderate to very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that UMEC/VI (delivered via ELLIPTA DPI), when used in symptomatic moderate to very severe COPD participants, is non-inferior to the combination of indacaterol (delivered via BREEZHALER® inhaler) plus tiotropium (delivered via HANDIHALER® inhaler) on measures of trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after 12 weeks of treatment. Participants who met the eligibility criteria at screening (Visit 1) will complete a 5 to 7 day run in period prior to randomisation at Visit 2. Clinic visits will follow at day 2, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 12 of treatment, plus week 12 + 1 day (Visits 3 to 8). The total duration of study participation will be approximately 14 weeks.

	<criteria>Type of subject: Outpatient Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation. Participants 40 years of age or older at Visit 1. Gender: Male or female participants. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Postmenopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy.OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to followup contact): Abstinence, Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Implants of levonorgestrel, Estrogenic vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches, Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria as stated in the product label, Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. For this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject' s medical records. Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 packyears. Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Severity of Disease: A pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second/ Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/ FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 and a pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of &lt;=70% predicted normal value at Visit 1, calculated using Quanjer reference equations. Dyspnoea: A score of &gt;= 2 on the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC) at Visit 1. QT interval corrected (QTc) Criteria: QTc &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch block The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread. For subject eligibility and withdrawal, QTcF will be used. For purposes of data analysis, QTcF will be used as primary. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate Electrocardiogram (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period. French participants: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the study. Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma. Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease. Allergy rhinitis is not exclusionary. Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Participants with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2agonist, lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrowangle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic or beta 2 agonist. Hospitalisation: Hospitalisation for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Lung Resection: Participants with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). 12Lead ECG: An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12lead ECG conducted at Visit 1. Specific ECG findings that preclude subject eligibility will be listed in protocol The study investigator will determine the medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed. Screening labs: Significantly abnormal finding from clinical chemistry or haematology tests at Visit 1 as determined by the study investigator. Medication Prior to Spirometry: Unable to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for the 4 hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit.
