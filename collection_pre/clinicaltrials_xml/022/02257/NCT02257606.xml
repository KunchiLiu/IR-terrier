	<brief_summary>With this randomised intervention study, the investigators want to investigate the training effect of an 8 week training regime, using a robot-assisted training system in persons with MS. Besides conventional therapy, study participants in the experimental group will train 3 times per week during 30 minutes, using the haptic master. Research questions focus on the effects of additional robot assisted training on range of motion, movement quality and clinical tests for the upper limb in persons with MS. Evaluation by means of questionnaires and clinical outcome measures occured at baseline, after 4 weeks, after 8 weeks and at 16 weeks of follow-</brief_summary>
