	<brief_summary>There is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) versus the Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) in terms of toxicity and disease control. Data from retrospective studies show that IMRT reduces the risk of severe late complications. More recently, the results from the RTOG 0126 study have also confirmed the benefit from IMRT in reducing acute toxicity for prostate cancer treated with conventional dose escalation. Therefore, to investigate the real clinical benefit of the IMRT over 3DCRT using a hypofractionated schedule in prostate cancer, the investigators developed a RCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Versus Conformal Radiotherapy to Treat Prostate Cancer With Hypofractionated Schedule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer With age between 1875 years classified in low Intermediate and highrisk group according to their Gleason score T stage and initial PSA (iPSA). Low risk group included patients with Gleason score &lt;7 / stage T1T2a, and iPSA &lt;10 ng/mL. Intermediate risk included Gleason score &lt; 7, or Stage T1T2b, or iPSA level of 1020 ng/mL Highrisk patients with Gleason score &gt;7, or Stage &gt; T2b, or iPSA &gt;20 ng/mL. All patients classified as high risk was submitted to the bone scans. Patients with metastases Prior history of prostatectomy Pelvic radiotherapy treatment Chemotherapy treatment were excluded of this trial.</criteria>
