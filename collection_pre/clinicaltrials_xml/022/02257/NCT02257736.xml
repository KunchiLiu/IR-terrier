	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate (AA) plus prednisone or prednisolone (AAP) and AAP in participants with chemotherapy-naive (participants who did not receive any chemotherapy [treatment of cancer using drugs]) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (cancer of prostate gland [gland that makes fluid that aids movement of sperm]).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Apalutamide (JNJ-56021927) in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone Versus Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Participants With Chemotherapy-naive Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know the treatment) placebo-controlled and multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to determine if participants with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC will benefit from the addition of apalutamide to AAP compared with AAP alone. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase; Treatment phase, and Follow-up phase. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adenocarcinoma of the prostate Metastatic disease as documented by technetium99m (99mTc) bone scan or metastatic lesions by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (visceral or lymph node disease). If lymph node metastasis is the only evidence of metastasis, it must be greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 centimeter (cm) in the longest diameter Castrationresistant prostate cancer demonstrated during continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), defined as 3 rises of PSA, at least 1 week apart with the last androgen deprivation therapy (PSA) &gt;= 2 nanogram per milliliters (ng/mL) Participants who received a first generation antiandrogen (eg, bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide) must have at least a 6week washout prior to randomization and must show continuing disease (PSA) progression (an increase in PSA) after the washout period Prostate cancer progression documented by prostatespecific antigen (PSA) according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) or radiographic progression of soft tissue according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST) modified based on PCWG2, or radiographic progression of bone according to PCWG2 Small cell or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate Known brain metastases Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, except if administered in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting Previously treated with ketoconazole for prostate cancer for greater than 7 days Therapies that must be discontinued or substituted at least 4 weeks prior to randomization include the following: a) Medications known to lower the seizure threshold, b) Herbal and nonherbal products that may decrease PSA levels (example [eg], saw palmetto, pomegranate) or c) Any investigational agent At Screening need for parenteral or oral opioid analgesics (eg, codeine, dextropropoxyphene)</criteria>
