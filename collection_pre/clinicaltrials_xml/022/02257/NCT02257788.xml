	<detailed_description>Protocol PRO 140 2103 is a multicenter, randomized parallel group study, conducted in approximately 40 male and female adult subjects (n=10/treatment group) infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Subjects will be randomized into one of four treatment groups. Blood samples for drug concentrations, PD variables, and efficacy variables will be obtained over a 59-day period following initiation of dosing. Safety will be monitored throughout the course of the study.</detailed_description>
