	<brief_title>Post-authorization Safety Study of Euforvac-Hib Vaccine for Active Primary Immunization in Infants From 6 Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Euforvac-Hib vaccine manufactured by LG Life science in Korea, but it's not marketed in Korea. It is distributed to UN agencies in diverse countries. Thus, WHO recommended LG Life Science to conduct the safety study for assessing the vaccine safety if Euforvac-Hib is prequalified. The objectives of this safety study are to identify any problems and questionable issues likely to emerge from the actual use of Euforvac-Hib vaccine after launching in the market.</detailed_description>
