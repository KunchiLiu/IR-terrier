	<brief_summary>Surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee is frequently a young patient surgery. The post-operative pain of this surgery is managed according to recommendation. In the majority of case, femoral nerve block is performed. The femoral nerve block can cause "paralysis" of the quadriceps more or less complete that no allowing a good quadriceps locking. This locking is indispensable to avoid post-operative flexima and to ensure stabilization of the knee during walking. In France, the surgery requires a duration of hospitalization from 2 to 4 days in the most cases. It is sometimes performed in ambulatory especially in the USA. But, at the home, pain requires powerful analgesics with their adverse events. Today, no anesthesic technics for surgery of anterior cruciate ligament of the knee ensure in the same time optimal analgesia and optimal quadriceps locking. The main objective of the investigators study is to compare two analgesia techniques : femoral nerve block vs intra articular injection and obturator nerve block in surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee</brief_summary>
