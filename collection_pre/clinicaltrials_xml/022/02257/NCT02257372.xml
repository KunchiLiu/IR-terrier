	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of UMEC (62.5 microgram[mcg]) when administered once-daily via dry powder inhaler (DPI) to Inhaled corticosteroid/ Long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS/LABA) twice-daily compared with placebo via DPI added to the ICS/LABA therapy over a treatment period of 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. This study is designed to investigate the addition of UMEC to ICS/LABA combinations at approved doses and frequencies for the treatment of COPD including SERETIDE™ 500/50 mcg twice daily, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Combination (FSC) 500/50 twice daily generic products such as AIRFLUSAL FORSPIRO inhaler 500/50 mcg twice daily or ROLENIUM ELPENHALER inhaler 500/50 mcg twice daily and SYMBICORT TURBUHALER inhaler at doses of 200/6 mcg twice daily and 400/12 mcg twice daily, over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. Albuterol/salbutamol metered-dose-inhaler (MDI) or nebules will be issued throughout the study for use as-needed (prn). Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the following blinded study treatment regimens in equal proportion (1:1): UMEC 62.5 mcg once-daily and Placebo once-daily. Approximately 230 subjects (115 subjects per treatment) will be randomized in order to complete at least 206 evaluable subjects. The total duration of the study will be approximately 14 weeks for each subject. UMEC is a Long-acting Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) currently under development as a monotherapy, as a combination product with a LABA, vilanterol (VI), for the treatment of COPD, and as a combination product with an ICS, fluticasone furoate (FF), for the treatment of asthma. The UMEC/VI combination 62.5/25 .mcg once-daily has been approved in the United States (U.S.) and Canada for COPD under the trade name ANORO™ ELLIPTA™ and is under regulatory review in other countries. SERETIDE, ANORO, and ELLIPTA are trade marks of the GlaxoSmithKline Group of Companies. Other company or product names mentioned herein may be the property of their respective owners.</brief_summary>

A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Postmenopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy. OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to followup contact): Abstinence; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Injectable progestogen; Implants of levonorgestrel; Estrogenic vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria as stated in the product label; Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. For this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; Double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 packyears [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack year history. Severity of Disease: A pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second /Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of &lt;=70% of predicted normal values at Visit 1 (Screening) calculated using reference values provided by Quanjer. Current clinically prescribed medication: The subject must be on the dose and frequency of one of the following ICS/LABA combinations approved for COPD at least 30 days prior screening : FSC at a dose of 500/50 mcg twicedaily (i.e. SERETIDE DISKUS™ inhaler or approved generic product such as AIRFLUSAL FORSPIRO inhaler 500/50 mcg twice daily or ROLENIUM ELPENHALER inhaler 500/50 mcg twice daily) ; The combination of budesonide/formoterol (i.e., SYMBICORT TURBUHALER inhaler) at doses of 200/6 mcg twicedaily or 400/12 mcg twicedaily .
