	<brief_title>Study of INCB039110 in Combination With Docetaxel in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This population will consist of subjects with stage IIIB, IV or recurrent NSCLC who have been previously treated. The study consists of two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 is an open label, safety run-in, which is designed to confirm the safety and tolerability of INCB039110 in combination with docetaxel and to select a dose to be evaluated in Part 2. During Part 1 subjects will receive open label INCB039110 and docetaxel. In Part 2 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive either INCB039110 or placebo and docetaxel. The dose and frequency of INCB039110 and docetaxel administered will be determined from Part 1 of the study. INCB039110/placebo will be self-administered each day during the entire cycle. This part of the study will be conducted in a double-blind, randomized manner.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that is Stage IIIb, IV, or recurrent. 2. Received only 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen for Stage IIIb, IV, or recurrent disease not including neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy. (NOTE: Exceptions may be allowed based on prior treatment regimens and tumor types in agreement with protocol requirements.) 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. 4. Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks. 1. Received prior treatment with docetaxel. 2. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with CNS metastases who have completed a course of therapy would be eligible for the study provided they are clinically stable for at least 1 month prior to study entry, defined as: 1. No evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastasis or new neurological symptoms attributable to CNS metastases. 2. Subjects who are receiving concomitant corticosteroids must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment and off all anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry. 3. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 3. 4. Current or previous other malignancy within 2 years of study entry, except cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other noninvasive malignancy. 5. Significant, concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition including but not limited to, renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, cerebral, or psychiatric disease. 6.
