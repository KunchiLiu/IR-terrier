	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab works in treating patients with cervical cancer that has grown, come back, or spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the antitumor activity (proportion of objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria) of nivolumab with objective tumor response in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of nivolumab as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To systematically evaluate programmed cell death (PD)-1 and B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) (i.e., PD-1 ligand) expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cervical cancer cells and explore their correlations with objective response, PFS, and OS in nivolumab-treated patients with PD-1 and B7-H1 scoring results. II. To explore the composition of immune infiltrates in tumor specimens/biopsies from primary and/or metastatic/recurrent sites with selected markers including (but not limited) to cluster of differentiation (CD)4+, CD8+, forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), CD25, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), and inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) and their correlations to objective response, PFS and OS in nivolumab-treated patients. III. To evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) status and to explore the changes of pre- and post-immune therapy responses to HPV16/18/31/35/45 E7 antigens in patients peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and serum using proliferative and interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) (cellular immunity) and serological (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) assays. IV. To explore the levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pre-treatment and at 8 and 12 weeks and their association with patient outcome. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes every 2 weeks for a maximum of 46 doses over 92 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patients must have at least one "target" lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Appropriate for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup: History/physical examination within 28 days prior to registration Imaging of target lesion(s) within 28 days prior to registration Further protocolspecific assessments: Recovery from adverse effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor including chemotherapy, biologic/targeted agents and immunologic agents must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Investigation agents must be discontinued for at least 30 days prior to registration Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any major surgery prior to registration Patients must have had one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management of persistent, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (e.g.; paclitaxel/cisplatin, paclitaxel/cisplatin/bevacizumab); chemotherapy administered concurrent with primary radiation (e.g.; weekly cisplatin) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen; adjuvant chemotherapy given following the completion of radiation therapy (or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen (e.g.; paclitaxel and carboplatin for up to 4 cycles); NOTE: patients who have received more than one prior regimen are NOT eligible Performance status of 0 or 1 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/ul Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul Creatinine =&lt;
