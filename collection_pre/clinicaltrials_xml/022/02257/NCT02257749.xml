	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized control trial study is to determine if an active rehabilitation (low intensity exercise program) in combination with a comprehensive education intervention (standard care) is more effective than the comprehensive education intervention alone in reducing post-concussion symptoms and improving participation in daily activities in youth who have persistent post-concussion symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Study of an Exercise Program for Youth With Persistent Symptoms After Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a portion of youth who continue to experience persistent post-concussion symptoms beyond the first few weeks of injury. There is limited evidence with respect to the best ways to treat persistent post-concussion symptoms in youth following concussion. There is a small amount of literature that suggests active rehabilitation as a positive intervention for promotion of recovery of persistent post-concussion symptoms. However, this approach to rehabilitation has yet to be explored using a randomized control trial protocol. Therefore, this study aims to answer the following question: Is a 6 week active rehabilitation program in combination with a comprehensive education intervention (standard care) effective in reducing post-concussive symptoms and improving functional recovery compared to receiving comprehensive education intervention alone among youth experiencing persistent post-concussion symptoms? We hypothesize: 1. youth ages 10 to 18 years who present with persistent self-reported post-concussion symptoms 4 weeks after the initial injury and receive the active rehabilitation intervention, will present with decreased post-concussion symptoms at the completion of the intervention. 2. youth ages 10 to 18 years who receive the active rehabilitation intervention, will present with more complete functional recovery and increased participation in unrestricted physical activity at the completion of the active rehabilitation intervention compared to children receiving the comprehensive education intervention only</detailed_description>
