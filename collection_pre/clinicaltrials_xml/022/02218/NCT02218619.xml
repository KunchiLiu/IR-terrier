	<brief_summary>Clinically, the ability to slow or prevent beta cell demise can prevent or improve the course of type 1 diabetes. The immune-mediated destruction of beta cells that is an apparent major pathological basis for the disease, has led to efforts to prevent or suppress this immune assault. Here we propose to buttress the beta cell's capacity to withstand this assault by improving the function of the endoplasmic reticulum stress resolving mechanisms within these cells. The ability to do so could have a major impact on preventive and therapeutic strategies for type 1 diabetes (and possibly other types of diabetes). The type of endoplasmic reticulum stress relieving agent (TUDCA) proposed here could ultimately be applied on an anticipatory basis to individuals at high risk for type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress will promote beta cell survival in new-onset type 1 diabetes. The primary aim is to test the clinical efficacy of an already approved agent, TUDCA, re-purposed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve beta cell survival in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes. The primary endpoint of this proposed double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled pilot study is c-peptide measured after mixed meal stimulation test at randomization and then at 6 and 12 months of treatment with TUDCA compared to treatment with placebo and at 6 months following treatment. TUDCA is an oral medication with an excellent safety profile that is approved for use in Europe for gall stones and liver disease. The drug and similar compounds has been used in children, as young as newborns, and in adults. TUDCA's ability to lower endoplasmic reticulum stress has only recently been recognized and will be applied to new-onset type 1 diabetes in this proposal. If this pilot trial is successful, future studies could include broadening the recipients to antibody-positive pre-type 1 diabetes patients and/or combining TUDCA with other agents shown to have a beneficial effect on insulin secretion in new-onset type 1 diabetes.</detailed_description>
