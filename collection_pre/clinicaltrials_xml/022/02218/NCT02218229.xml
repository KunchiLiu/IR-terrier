	<brief_title>The Effect of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, many studies show the potential effect of shock wave for the reinnervation for peripheral neuropathy in the animal mode. Only one study reveal the potential benefit of shock wave in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Althouh its expressive finding, the number of cases is relatively too small to make a conclusive remark. Large and well-designed study would expand the new field.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Outpatient subjects who had typical symptoms and signs of CTS, such as positive Tinel's sign or Phalen's test and numbness/tingling in at least two of the first, second, and third digits and were all confirmed by electrophysiological study, were considered and enrolled. The patients who had conditions mimicking CTS, such as cervical radiculopathy, polyneuropathy, brachial plexopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome or who had previous wrist surgery or steroid injection for CTS, were all excluded.</criteria>
