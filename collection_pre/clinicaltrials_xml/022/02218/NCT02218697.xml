	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety when GSK Biologicals' influenza vaccine Influsplit™ Tetra (Fluarix™ Tetra) is co-administered with Merck &amp; Co. Inc.'s pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax™23/Pneumovax) in adults 50 years of age and older at risk for complications from influenza and pneumococcal infections.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits). A male or female aged 50 years or above at the time of the first vaccination at risk for complications from influenza and/or pneumococcal infections, meeting their respective countries' recommendations for vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease. At risk subjects include adults with chronic respiratory, heart, kidney, liver or neurological disease; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) Tcell counts greater than 350 cells/mm3; sickle cell disease or coeliac syndrome that may lead to splenic dysfunction (all other asplenics are excluded). The decision to enrol should be based on the investigators clinical judgement. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Inhaled, topical and lowdose intraarticular steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before the first dose and 30 days after the last dose of vaccine. Administration of such a vaccine has to be documented in the "Concomitant vaccination" of the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs/treatment within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during the study period. These immunosuppressant drugs/treatment/Biologics include: Methotrexate Leflunomide Azathioprine and 6mercaptopurine Cyclosporin A Cyclophosphamide Tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus Mycophenolate mofetil Antilymfocytaire immunoglobulins Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors: Adalimumab (Humira®), certolizumab (Cimzia®), etanercept (Enbrel®), golimumab (Simponi®) and infliximab(Remicade®) Monoclonal antibodies and other biologicals: Rituximab (Mabthera®), Abatacept (Orencia®), tocilizumab (RoActemra®), basiliximab (Simulect®), Natalizumab (Tysabri®) cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), … Antitumor agents: alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics, topoisomerase inhibitors, microtubule inhibitors and other antitumor agents Lenalidomide Revlimid® Tasonermin: Beromun® Proleukin® (aldesleukin; Novartis, …) Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Glivec®)Omalizumab Xolair® Eculizumab Soliris® The above list is compiled from: [Federal Public Service Belgium: Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment]. Any immunosuppressive treatment which in the opinion of the investigator will not allow an adequate immune response. Inhaled, topical and lowdose intraarticular steroids are allowed. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Previous vaccination with a pneumococcal vaccine within the last five years. Previous vaccination with an influenza vaccine within the last six months. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. HIV infected subjects on cART with CD4 Tcell counts above 350 cells/mm3 can be enrolled. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F). The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever [≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)] may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study or would make intramuscular (IM) injection unsafe. Asplenia or dysfunction of the spleen. This excludes homozygous sickle cell disease or coeliac syndrome that may lead to splenic dysfunction. Acute clinically significant (i.e. a medically significant change from baseline condition in the past 30 days) pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. History of GuillainBarré syndrome. A history of anaphylaxis following ANY vaccination.</criteria>
