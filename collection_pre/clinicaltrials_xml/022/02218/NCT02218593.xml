	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate how the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX) is working for children who are using the WREX, or have used it in the past. The survey consists of a set of questions a) performed online and b) performed over the phone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WREX Outcome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The WREX (Wilmington Robotic EXoskeleton) is being used by many children with neuromuscular conditions such as arthrogryposis and muscular dystrophy. Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children alone has provided a WREX for about 80 children in the last 3 years. This is being done through the orthopedic and muscle clinics in the hospital. We would like to perform a retrospective study to see how well the children are doing with the WREX. We propose getting this feedback through a survey administered to families using the WREX. The survey will be performed in two parts. 1) A phone survey will use the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). 2) an online survey with additional questions. The parents are asked to submit answers on behalf of the children if they are unable to.</detailed_description>
