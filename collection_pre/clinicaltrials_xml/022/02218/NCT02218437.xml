	<brief_summary>Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) is a non Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) in adult bone marrow and takes part in the bone marrow microenvironment. The response rate of early treatment on Children's SAA application combined with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (40-50 days after ATG treatment) is associated with long-term effect. The injection of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells combined with ATG improves the efficacy of children with SAA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Protocol of Child SAA With the Injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cells（Umbilical Cord Derived）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Mesenchymal Stem Cells were prepared by in vitro separation, screening, and culture from healthy human umbilical cord tissue; The " injection of mesenchymal stem cells (umbilical) manufacturing and verification regulation " was also formulated. 2. The starting dose of Umbilical Cord Derived MSC was 0.5-1.0 * 106 cells /kg, based on the previous human studies; And the maximum tolerated dose was 1 * 107 cells /kg 3. The response and complete remission rate, relapse rate of the injection of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (or combined with ATG ) for Child with SAA were determined.</detailed_description>
