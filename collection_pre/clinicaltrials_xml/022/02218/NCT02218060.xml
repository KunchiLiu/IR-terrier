	<brief_summary>Coronary CT angiography is used to examine the coronary arteries in a non-invasive way when a patient is suspected of having coronary artery disease. The test, however, requires relatively high levels of radiation, which have been linked to DNA damage and cancer, and the use of contrast material, which can affect kidney function. The SOMATOM Force, a new third-generation CT scanner manufactured by Siemens, was recently installed at MUSC and holds the potential to obtain quality images while also reducing radiation dose and contrast material. This study aims to test the diagnostic ability of the SOMATOM Force in detecting coronary artery disease and also see if radiation dose and contrast material are reduced compared to the previous 2nd generation scanners. It is suspected that the Force will provide clinical quality images while decreasing radiation dose and contrast material required.</brief_summary>
