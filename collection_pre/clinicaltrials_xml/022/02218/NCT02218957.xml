	<brief_summary>Morbid obesity is an increasing medical problem in the western countries. It's related to comorbidities as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, OSAS, arthrosis and hypercholesterolemia. The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is an effective surgical therapy for morbidly obese patients. A part of these patients will have disappointing results, and have weight regain on the long term. Some studies show more weight reduction by increasing the biliopancreatic limb in patients with morbid obesity. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a restrictive/extended pouch on weight reduction in morbidly obese patients undergoing RYGB-surgery. We hypothesize that the restrictive/extended pouch results in more weight reduction. The study design is a prospective, randomized control trial. The patients will be randomized in 2 groups: a standard RYGB (normal pouch) and restrictive/extended pouch RYGB.</brief_summary>
