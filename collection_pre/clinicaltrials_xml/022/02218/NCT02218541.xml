	<brief_summary>The study will involve placing a dental implant through a guided surgery protocol developed using 3D CT technology. Because the implant position is planned digitally using the CT data from the patient, this allows investigation of an abutment that supports the implant crown and soft tissues to be fabricated prior to implant placement. In doing so, this makes the protocol for patient care simpler and faster. In fabricating the the abutment prior to surgery, the investigators will design the abutments at different heights below the gumline to see an optimal margin height for fabrication of the abutment prior to surgery. The study hypothesis is that more often the abutment margin placed just slightly below (.5mm) the gumline will be visible about half of the time while the abutment margin placed further under the gumline (1.5mm) will be visible only about 10% of the time. The optimal outcome is that at delivery and follow-up, the abutment margin will not show intraorally.</brief_summary>
