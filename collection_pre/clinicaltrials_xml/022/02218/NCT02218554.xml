	<brief_summary>To evaluate the performance of the Micromedic BRONJ Risk Assessment in vitro assay (the "BRONJ Assay") in identifying Multiple Myeloma (MM) and/or other cancer subjects at risk for developing Bisphosphonate-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (BRONJ) following intravenous (IV) administration of Bisphosphonates (BP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation of the Micromedic BRONJ Risk Assessment in Vitro Diagnostic Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Micromedic BRONJ Assay is intended for the qualitative analysis of genetic changes which may be indicative of increased risk to develop BRONJ osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) following IV administration of drugs of the Bisphosphonate family.</detailed_description>
