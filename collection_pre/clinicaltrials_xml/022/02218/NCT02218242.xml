	<brief_summary>All patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) resection of lung cancer will receive standard therapy including lobectomy or sub-lobar resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. After completion of the standard of care, intraoperative ultrasound will be used to evaluate lymph node stations for the presence of any missed lymph nodes with particular focus on lymph nodes which may appear pathologic on ultrasound evaluation. Data will be reviewed for rates of pathologic upstaging, and sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound as an additional diagnostic tool in the operating room will be evaluated. It is hypothesized that Intra-operative thoracoscopic ultrasound following standard video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) dissection will increase the rate of pathologically staged in N2 nodes in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing definitive surgical resection.</brief_summary>
