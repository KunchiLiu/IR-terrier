	<brief_title>Aerosolized Amikacin and Fosfomycin in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Gram-negative and / or Gram-positive Bacterial Colonization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the amikacin fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS). AFIS consists of amikacin solution (AMS) and fosfomycin solution (FFS), delivered by aerosol to the lungs via the Investigational eFlow AFIS Inline System (AFIS Inline System) with tamper evident reservoir. Patients will be randomized to receive 5 days of treatment with either AFIS or placebo, followed by all patients receiving open label AFIS for five days. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in tracheal aspirate Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive bacterial density at the end of the 5-day randomized course of study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females, ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80 years of age Intubated and mechanicallyventilated Presence of Gramnegative and/or Grampositive organism(s) by culture of respiratory secretions from a sample obtained within the previous 7 days History of hypersensitivity to amikacin or fosfomycin. Diagnosis of pneumonia, defined as presence of a new or progressive infiltrate(s) on chest radiograph (within 7 days prior to screening), as determined by the treating physician Use of systemic antibiotics with efficacy against likely respiratory tract pathogens at the time of randomization Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (defined as PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg and diffuse infiltrates on Chest Xray) Refractory septic shock (severe sepsis plus unstable hypotension, in spite of adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressors) Evidence of significant renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 4.0 mg/dL within 24 hours prior to screening) . If serum creatinine is &gt; 2.0 mg/dL, site must be capable of performing continuous renal replacement therapy, if clinically indicated. Patients with serum creatinine &gt; 4.0 mg/dL and being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (continuous venousvenous hemofiltration or continuous venousvenous hemodialysis) or chronic hemodialysis are eligible Evidence of ototoxicity (history of hearing aid use prior to current hospitalization) Evidence of hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt; 3X the upper limit of normal value within 24 hours prior to screening) Any of the following conditions that interfere with the assessment or interpretation of the diagnosis or response to therapy: chest trauma with loss of stability of the thoracic cage following a fracture of the sternum, ribs, or both; increased amounts of fluid in the lung cavities requiring chest tube drainage; lung cancer within the last 2 years; lung abscess(s); anatomical bronchial obstruction; suspected atypical pneumonia; chemical pneumonitis (e.g., inhalation injury); cystic fibrosis; congestive heart failure (leading to a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 100 mmHg and diffuse infiltrates on Chest Xray) Immunocompromised patients, including those with neutropenia NOT due to the current infection (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm³), leukemia, lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3, or splenectomy; those who are early posttransplantation, are on cytotoxic chemotherapy, or are on highdose steroids (e.g., &gt; 40 mg of prednisone or its equivalent [&gt; 160 mg hydrocortisone, &gt; 32 mg methylprednisolone, &gt; 6 mg dexamethasone, &gt; 200 mg cortisone] daily for &gt; 2 weeks) Positive urine and/or serum betahCG pregnancy test (only in women of reproductive age) Participating in or has participated in other investigational interventional studies (drug or device) within the last 30 days (or 5 times the halflife of the previously administered investigational compound, whichever is longer) prior to study treatment</criteria>
