	<brief_summary>This study consists of two parts. Part 1 evaluates the effect of renal impairment on the PK and PD of a single dose of ASP8232. In addition, the safety and tolerability will be assessed. Part 2 evaluates the PK, PD, and safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8232 compared with placebo in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Safety of ASP8232 in Subjects With Renal Impairment and in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-part study. Part 1 compares the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety and tolerability of ASP8232 in healthy subjects with subjects with different degrees of renal impairment; Part 2 is a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the PK, PD and safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ASP8232 in T2DM subjects with CKD. Part 1: Subjects reside in the clinic for 9 days, receiving a single oral dose of ASP8232 on Day 1 under fasted conditions followed by a 168-hours blood and urine PK/PD sampling period. Subjects are discharged on Day 8 and return to the clinic on Days 10, 12, 14, 21, 28, and 42 for the collection of blood PK/PD samples. An End of Study Visit (ESV) takes place after the last PK sample is collected on Day 56. Part 2: Subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -2 in order to collect PD urine samples before dosing begins on Day 1. Subjects receive multiple oral doses of ASP8232 or placebo for 28 days. They are discharged on Day 8 and return to the clinic on Days 14 and 21, and Days 27 to 29 for blood PK/PD and urine PD samples. An ESV takes place 14 to 28 days after the last PK/PD sample is collected.</detailed_description>
