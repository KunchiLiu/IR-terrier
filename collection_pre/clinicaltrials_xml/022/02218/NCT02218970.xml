	<brief_summary>Physical health does not have a high priority in today's treatment of patients with substance use disorder (SUD). SUD patients have a poor physical health not only due to injuries related to the substance abuse, but also because of the addiction-related lifestyle. There are few studies today that provide information about SUD patient's physical health, and especially there is little information about their muscular strength. One of the project's aims is to measure muscular strength in SUD patients who are being treated for their addiction, and see if they have decreased neuromuscular function. If so, we will investigate the effect of maximal strength training on neuromuscular function in these patients.</brief_summary>
