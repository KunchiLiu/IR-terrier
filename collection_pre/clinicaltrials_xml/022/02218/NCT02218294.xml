	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the extent that radioactive dose of BCX4161 taken by mouth ends up in the urine, feces and expired air. If there are metabolites of BCX4161 made by the body, the chemical composition of these metabolites and their profile over time in blood and urine will be determined.</brief_summary>
