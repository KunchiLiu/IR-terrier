	<brief_title>Luteal Phase Supplementation With Recombinant LH After GnRh Agonist Oocytes Triggering in Women at Risk of OHSS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators enrolled patients, undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for an IVF/ICSI cycles, who on the day of oocytes triggering were at risk of OHSS. These patients had an estradiol &gt; 4000 pg/ml and more than 24 follicles with a diameter greater than 12 mm. The investigators used 0,2 mg of triptorelin for the oocytes triggering and supplemented the luteal phase with recombinant LH at a dose of 75 UI twice/day for 10 days and vaginal gel progesterone and oral oestradiol for 14 days The investigators measured bhCG at 14 days from the pick up. In case of positive bhCG we have defined the IVF/ICSI outcome: Pregnancy Rate and Implantation Rate.</detailed_description>
