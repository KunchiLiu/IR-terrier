	<brief_title>Evaluation of Catheter Placement for Renal Replacement Therapy in Patients With Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the placement, timing, associated complications, efficacy of temporary and tunneled catheters for renal replacement therapy in patient with acute kidney injury. In particular, we will be assessing renal replacement adequacy for patients on dialysis and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration by monitoring urea reduction ratios, venous and arterial pressures. We will also be monitoring infection rates. We will compare these outcomes in patients receiving tunneled catheters and patients receiving temporary catheters.</detailed_description>
