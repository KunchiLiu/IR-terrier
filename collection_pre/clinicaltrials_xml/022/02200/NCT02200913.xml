	<brief_summary>Recent studies indicate that patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) present problems in balance. Alterations in proprioception are the possible causes of alteration of postural balance in LBP. Previous studies reported an improvement of CSE on joint mobility, pain, functional disability, and trunk muscle activation pattern in patients with clinical lumbar instability (CLI); however, it was an immediate effect. However, previous studies did not report indirect effect may occur in CLI as postural balance and other kinds of exercise as strengthening in CLI. The general trunk strengthening exercise is common used in physical therapy clinic on LBP, that improve pain, physical disability, and trunk muscles activity. To our knowledge, the usefulness of CSE has not yet been investigated in CLI patients with outcome measure of balance. The present study will conduct to fill the gaps of previous studies which will provide immediate-, accumulative- and detraining-effects of CSE on postural balance, pain intensity and ratio activation of trunk muscles and included blinding process of the assessor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Core Stabilization Exercise on Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal complaint. In most LBPs, it is benign and disappears within six weeks, but approximately 20% of individuals with LBP do not show any improvement in their condition, which may progress to chronic low back pain. LBP not only interferes with biomechanical change, but also causes ability to work leading to reduced productivity, economic burden to individuals and society for medical costs Recent studies indicate that patients with chronic low back pain present diminished postural control, manifesting problems in balance. Postural balance is controlled by sensory information, central processing and neuromuscular responses. Alterations in proprioception are the possible causes of alteration of postural balance in individuals with low back pain. For clinical studies using core stabilization exercise (CSE) as treatment have revealed conflicting findings on pain, functional disability and muscle responses in chronic LBP. The few studies that investigated CSE as an isolated factor. Kumar (2011) reported an improvement of CSE on joint mobility and pain pressure threshold in patients with clinical lumbar instability; however, it was an immediate effect of CSE and blinding process was not performed. However, an effectiveness of CSE on pain intensity, functional disability, and trunk muscle activation pattern were improved in clinical lumbar instability (CLI). In addition, after 10-week CSE provides greater training and retention effects on pain-related outcomes and induced activation of deep abdominal muscles in CLI compared with conventional treatment (stretching exercise and hot pack). However, previous studies did not report indirect effect may occur in CLI as postural balance and other kinds of exercise as strengthening in CLI. The general trunk strengthening exercise is common used in physical therapy clinic on LBP, that improve pain, physical disability, and trunk muscles activity. To our knowledge, the usefulness of CSE technique as abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) has not yet been investigated in CLI patients with outcome measure of balance.</detailed_description>
