	<brief_summary>Allergic transfusion reactions are a common complication of transfusion by blood components containing plasma. This study aims to investigate passive transfer of Immunoglobin E antibodies as a risk factor of allergic reactions to plasma transfusion by use of Solvent Detergent plasma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allergic Transfusion Reactions in Plasma Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective observation study, aiming to measure transfer of Immunoglobin E antibodies and other factors associated with allergic complications in patients receiving plasma transfusion. Samples from patients and plasma units will be investigated. Samples frozen until investigation. To assess biological relevance of findings, additional analysis of basophil reactivity will be performed and information on clinical allergy collected by use of a questionaire . In-patients will be recruited if receiving plasma transfusion during surgery or if an allergic transfusion complication occurs.</detailed_description>
