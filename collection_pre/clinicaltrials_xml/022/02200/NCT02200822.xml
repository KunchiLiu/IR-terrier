	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that in patients with recuperated/normalized left ventricular function, defined as an ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 50%, after implantation of cardiac resynchronization therapy, device treatment is sufficient and neurohumoral blocker therapy can safely be withdrawn</brief_summary>
