	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease is characterized in the advanced phases by an altered response to dompaminergic therapy for the occurrence of abnormal movements called dyskinesias, that worsens the quality of life of the patient and exposes him to comorbidities. Several data show a reduction in the amount of slow wave sleep that corrrelates inversely with disease duration. Since this stage of sleep is linked to mechanisms of deletion of superfluou information we hypothesize that the onset of dyskinesias is related to such alteration of sleep. -With this study we want to investigate, by means of high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG), the sleep and in particular the slow wave in order to clarify the relations with the development of dyskinesias.</brief_summary>
