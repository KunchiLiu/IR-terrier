	<brief_summary>For patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and a good performance status (PS), pemetrexed and cisplatin has been recommended for first-line NSCLC treatment. Recently, results from the PARAMOUNT trial showed that patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who had a good PS and had not progressed after completing four cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin induction therapy benefitted from pemetrexed continuation maintenance therapy. Furthermore, pemetrexed with bevacizumab continuous maintenance might be better treatment option, considering the results from AVAPEARL trial. Pemetrexed rechallenge has been reported to be effective in some patients. Therefore, in order to investigate the safety and efficacy of pemetrexed rechallenge with bevacizumab,we conducted this study.</brief_summary>
