	<brief_title>Tooth Extraction With Deep Sedation in Children: A Retrospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Majority of dental treatments can be performed under local anesthesia. However, this is not always possible for pediatric non-cooperated patients with severe anxiety. In these patients, unpleasant dental experiences may lead to development of dental phobia when they become adults . Therefore, it is important to eradicate anxiety, and to prevent a possible psychological trauma in pediatric patients. For this purpose, psychological and medical methods have been applied to increase patient compliance. It has been proven that general anesthesia especially prevents dental phobia in elderly, and increases the quality of life related to oral health. In this study we aimed to evaluated the patients in whom dental local anesthetic attempts were failed due to anxiety or fear and referred to our clinic for tooth extraction with deep sedation. All patients dates will evaluate from their patient file retrospectively from 2011 to 2014.</detailed_description>
