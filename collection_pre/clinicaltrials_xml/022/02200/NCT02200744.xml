	<brief_title>Incidence of Recall After Procedural Sedation With Propofol in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After procedural sedation for fracture or joint dislocation reduction using propofol, adult patients recall will be assessed with a standardised form. This recall assessment will be realised 2 hours (+/- 15 minutes) after the procedural sedation and the day after. The primary outcome measure will be the recall incidence 2 hours (+/- 15 minutes) after a procedural sedation. A secondary outcome will be the recall incidence one day after the procedural sedation. The recall will be defined by a positive answer to the third question of the Sandin form (Lancet. 2000;355(9205):707-11).</detailed_description>
