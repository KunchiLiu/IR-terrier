	<brief_summary>Objectives: To determine the effect of protein content of familiar breakfast meals on subjective appetite, food intake (FI), glycemic response and Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) in normal weight (NW) and overweight (OW)/obese (OB) children. Specific Objectives: 1a.To determine the effect of familiar breakfast meals (450 kcal containing eggs and varying in protein content (15, 30, and 45g) on subjective appetite, glycemic response and food intake at a test meal 4 h later in NW and. OW/OB children. 1b. To describe the effect of isocaloric (450 kcal) familiar breakfasts either high in protein (optimal protein from Objective 1a) or low in protein on TEF and substrate utilization over 5 h in NW and OW/OB children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Dietary Protein on Satiety, Food Intake and Thermic Effect of Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that increasing the high-quality protein content of a breakfast meal will dose dependently increase subjective satiety, lower FI and glycemic response, and increase the TEF in both NW and OW/OB children.</detailed_description>
