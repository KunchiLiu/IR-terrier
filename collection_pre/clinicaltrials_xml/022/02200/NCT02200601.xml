	<brief_summary>The study sponsor has developed a patented medical device called Seipher Wellness. This is a non-invasive medical device that assesses heart health based on established cardiac parameters; timing events of the cardiac cycle. These are specific parameters captured and analyzed by the device. A ratio of two specific timing parameters provides an assessment of the subject's overall heart health. The aim of this study is to validate the device algorithm across a range of subjects.</brief_summary>
