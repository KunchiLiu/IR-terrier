	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, prospective pilot study of CDX-301 with or without plerixafor as a stem cell mobilizer for allogeneic transplantation (stem cells that come from another person). HLA-matched sibling healthy volunteers (donors) and patients with protocol specified hematologic malignancies (recipients) will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
