	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate significant reduction in postprandial plasma glucose (ΔAUC0:30-4:30h) after a standardized breakfast from baseline to Day 29. Secondary Objectives: To demonstrate: - Changes from baseline to Day 29 in maximum postprandial plasma glucose excursion, C-peptide and glucagon levels after a standardized breakfast - Delaying gastric emptying (13C-acetic acid breath test) - Safety and tolerability</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration per patient could be minimum of 38 to 47 days depending on screening visit and post-treatment observation allowances. 13C-acetic acid breath test will be conducted only in investigational site which can be implemented (about 40 patients).</detailed_description>
