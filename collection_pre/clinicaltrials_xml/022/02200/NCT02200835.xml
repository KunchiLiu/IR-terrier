Accordingly, we enrolled 2015 patients with AAD from 15 hospitals in China to access differences in clinical features, management and outcomes between men and women. in this study, our results provided new insights into gender-related differences in clinical features, management and outcomes in the Chinese patients with AAD. Important implications may be helpful to improve diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes.</brief_summary>
