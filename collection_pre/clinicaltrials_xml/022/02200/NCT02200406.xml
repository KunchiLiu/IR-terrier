	<brief_summary>Background: Although substitution therapy has been shown to be highly effective to retain opioid-dependent patients in treatment and reduce drug use, this population is afflicted by numerous conditions including depression. Unfortunately, studies published thus far have reported inconsistent or no difference in response between placebo therapy and antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Objective: To assess the feasibility of Desvenlafaxine (DESV) administration among opioid-dependent subjects and explore its effect on depressive symptoms. Methods: Open-label pilot trial of 8 weeks of DESV 50-100 mg/day in 20 methadone-maintained individuals with comorbid depressive symptoms at the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal. Significance: This pilot study will lay down the foundation on which a larger multisite clinical trial could be conducted to examine DESV as new treatment for opioid-dependent population with comorbid depression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To assess the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of 8 weeks of Desvenlafaxine (DESV) administration among opioid-dependent subjects in a methadone-maintenance program, we will collect detailed information on compliance to DESV treatment, side effects, methadone plasma levels, methadone dose changes and QTc measures. To explore the effects of DESV on depressive symptoms among opioid-dependent subjects on methadone-maintenance treatment. The severity and symptoms of depression will be evaluated by using the MADRS, the HRDS, and the CGI scale. To explore the effects of DESV on substance use, anxiety, craving, quality of life and suicidal risk.</detailed_description>
