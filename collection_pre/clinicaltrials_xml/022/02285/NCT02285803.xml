	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the added effect of tDCS to TRT within patients with chronic, non-pulsatile tinnitus. Patients were randomised in two groups namely, TRT and real tDCS and the second one is TRT with sham tDCS. Evaluations took place at the start of therapy, at the end of the counselling and at last a follow-up visit will be planned after 84 days of the start of the therapy. Subjective outcome measurements such as Tinnitus Functional Index and Visual Analogue Scales of loudness are the primary outcome measurement. Secondary outcome measurements are the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, hyperacusis questionnaire and psychoacoustic measurements.</brief_summary>
