	<detailed_description>1. Adaption of the Cu-Q2oL questionnaire into Thai version by using forward-backward translation that is independently performed by two bilingual translators. The original Italian version is translated into Thai by two Thai native speakers, then the study team reviews the Thai-version Cu-Q2oL questionnaire for items comprehensibility and integrates the first consensus version which re-translated into Italian by an Italian native speaker afterwards. The comparison between the backward Italian version Cu-Q2oL questionnaire and the original Cu-Q2oL is carried out to find out whether there are any misconception and mistranslation in the intermediary forward version of questionnaire. After that, the second consensus version will be tested on 15 chronic urticaria patients to detect any misunderstanding points based on patients' comments. Finally, this Thai-version of CU-Q2oL questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity, reliability, interpretability and minimal clinical important difference. 2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionaire (CU-Q2oL), the severity of chronic urticaria symptoms will be assessed by investigators and patients using the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), the DLQI and CU-Q2oL questionnaire.</detailed_description>
