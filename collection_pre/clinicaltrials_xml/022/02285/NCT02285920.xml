	<brief_summary>The SPin-D Trial is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of spironolactone (SPL) for patients with hemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Cardiovascular Efficacy of Spironolactone in Dialysis-Dependent ESRD Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of chronic SPL therapy compared with placebo in maintenance hemodialysis patients and to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, mortality-powered trial of SPL. The effects of SPL compared with placebo on multiple cardiovascular efficacy parameters will also be analyzed. The primary efficacy parameter will be the change in the E' measurement on tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDI) as an index of diastolic function and a surrogate for myocardial fibrosis. Secondary cardiac parameters of interest that will be studied in the overall population or in sub-studies include heart rate variability, circulating markers of fibrosis, and coronary flow reserve (CFR) as an index of microvascular function. These parameters are designed to broaden insight into the potential effects of SPL on cardiac structure and function in individuals with dialysis-dependent ESRD and to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, mortality-powered trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Maintenance hemodialysis therapy for endstage renal disease 2. Age 1885 years 3. ≥3 calendar months since dialysis initiation. Note if a patient has been on dialysis for ≥3 but less than 6 calendar months, there must be no hospitalizations during the 6 weeks prior to screening, and no change in estimated dry weight (EDW) within 2 weeks of the screening date. 4. For women of childbearing potential, willingness to use a highly effective method of birth control for up to 4 weeks after the last dose to study drug. 5. Ability to provide informed consent 1. Serum potassium ≥6.5 mEq/L within the 3 months prior to screening 2. Serum potassium level ≥6.0 mEq/L within 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit. If a potassium value is not available through routine clinical care during this 2week period a potassium measurement will be performed as a research test. 3. Unscheduled dialysis for hyperkalemia within the 3 months prior to screening 4. Predialysis systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg within 2 weeks prior to screening or at the baseline visit 5. 2 or more dialysis sessions within the month prior to screening with either 2 intradialytic measurements of systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mm Hg or muscle cramping, lightheadedness, nausea or hypotension requiring infusion of saline or other intervention directed at hypotension 6. Current dual use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 7. Current use of digoxin 8. Current use of spironolactone or eplerenone 9. Allergy to spironolactone 10. Inability to maintain dialysis machine blood flow ≥300 mL/min during any of the most recent 3 dialysis sessions prior to the screening visit as an indicator of vascular access dysfunction 11. Mitral valve repair or replacement 12. Severe mitral valve disease by echocardiography, coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 13. Anticipated kidney transplant, change to peritoneal dialysis, or transfer to another dialysis unit within 9 months 14. Expected survival &lt;9 months 15. Pregnancy, anticipated pregnancy, or breastfeeding 16. Incarceration 17. Participation in another intervention study</criteria>
