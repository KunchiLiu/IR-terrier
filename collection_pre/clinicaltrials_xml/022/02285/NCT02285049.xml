The second version will be tested on 15 chronic urticaria patients to detect any misunderstanding points. Finally, this Thai-version of UCT questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity, reliability, interpretability and minimal clinical important difference. 2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of Urticaria Control Test, the severity of urticaria symptoms will be assessed by investigators and patients using UAS28, Patient's global assessment of disease severity (PatGA-LS), Physician's global assessment of disease control (PhyGA-LS), the UCT and DLQI questionnaire</detailed_description>
