	<brief_summary>Adolescent Idiopathic scoliosis affects 3-4% of the Canadian population, of which about 10% will need a brace treatment during pubertal growth spurt. The design is made relatively corsets empirically, hence the relative efficiency of this treatment. Our team has developed innovative methods for design, optimization and computer aided manufacturing-based numerical simulation models customized to each patient, and a system of evaluation and adjustment of corsets. In this project, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of this platform customized treatment and demonstrate its clinical application</brief_summary>
