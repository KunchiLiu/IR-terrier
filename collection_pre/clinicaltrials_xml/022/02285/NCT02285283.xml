	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled double-blinded trial is to determine if the addition of an oral antifungal to typical post-operative medical therapy can prevent or reduce the incidence of recurrence of nasal polyps in fungal sensitive patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT of Itraconazole for Fungal Sensitive Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CRSwNP patients scheduled for medically-indicated sinus surgery will undergo screening ELIspot assay to identify patients with fungal sensitivity based on positive fungal induced IL-4 ELIspot. Enrolled fungal sensitive CRSwNP patients will undergo their sinus surgery and randomized into either placebo or itraconazole 200 mg PO BID for 24 weeks in addition to standardized post-surgical regimen (9 days of perioperative prednisone, saline irrigations and pain medication as needed). Patients will be followed as outpatient in rhinology clinic for 48 weeks total. During these post-op visits, compliance with medications will be determined. Patients will be questioned about any possible side effects or adverse events to post-operative medications. Then, the patients will be evaluated by 2 nasal specific quality of life questionnaires and nasal endoscopy. The goals of the nasal endoscopy are to evaluate the state of the sinus mucosa and to determine recurrence of nasal polyps.</detailed_description>
