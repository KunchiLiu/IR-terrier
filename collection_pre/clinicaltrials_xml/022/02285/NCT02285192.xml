	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a radioactive substance called 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F- FDG), injected into the cervix during a PET/CT scan done before surgery can show us more clearly which lymph nodes in the pelvis (the area near your uterus and cervix) contain cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The study population will include women with stage IB1 cervical cancer (any histologic subtype) deemed eligible for surgery, and women with a clinical stage I highgrade endometrial cancer planning to undergo surgical staging. High grade is defined by the following: Uterine serous carcinoma Clear cell endometrial carcinoma Grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma Endometrial carcinosarcoma Clinical stage I grade 12 endometrial cancer also eligible with deep myoinvasion ≥ 50% shown on preop MRI and/or elevated preop CA125 &gt; 35 U/ml. Age ≥18 years Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL Plasma albumin ≥3 g/dL GOG performance status ≤2 Plasma glucose ≤200 mg/dL Plasma creatinine ≤1.6 Wellcontrolled hypertension Medical clearance for surgery and considered an appropriate surgical candidate Negative serum pregnancy test, if of childbearing potential If, based on surgeon's assessment, the patient is recommended to undergo surgical staging for histologically confirmed endometrial cancer or if IB1 cervical cancer is deemed eligible for surgical treatment of disease Participation in other research protocols does not exclude a patient from participation in this study Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL Plasma albumin &lt;3 g/dL GOG performance status &gt;2 Plasma glucose &gt;200 mg/dL Renal insufficiency with plasma creatinine &gt;1.6 Uncontrolled hypertension Patient does not meet medical clearance for surgery and is not considered an appropriate surgical candidate Pregnancy</criteria>
