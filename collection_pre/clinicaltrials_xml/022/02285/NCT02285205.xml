	<brief_summary>Lobeglitazone is highly selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist that decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. In vivo, It demonstrates that Lobeglitazone improves even more glycemic and lipid control in comparison to rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Currently, thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone is the only drug which is considered as an effective therapeutic agent for improving non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, single-arm, exploratory phase 4 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lobeglitazone once daily for 24 weeks on intrahepatic fat contents assessed by transient elastography (fibroscan) in T2D with NAFLD. Fifty subjects with T2D and NAFLD will take Lobeglitazone (0.5mg/tablet, orally, 1 tablet once daily) for 24 weeks. Primary endpoint is changes from baseline in controlled attenuation parameters (CAP) measured by transient elastography (fibroscan) after treatment with Lobeglitazone. Secondary endpoints are changes from baseline in glycemic profiles (HbA1c, Glycated albumin), Lipid parameters (Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C), Liver function parameters (AST, ALT, r-GT), and adverse events during the trial.</brief_summary>
