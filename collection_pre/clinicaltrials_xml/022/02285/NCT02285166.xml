	<brief_summary>The purpose of this survey is to determine the incidence rate of cardiovascular (CV) events associated with long-term treatment with and without omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga Granular Capsules) in high-risk hyperlipidemic patients treated by statin in daily medical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specified Drug-use Survey of the Granular Capsule Formulation of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters: OCEAN3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This survey is planned to determine the incidence rate of cardiovascular (CV) events associated with long-term treatment with omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga Granular Capsules) in high-risk hyperlipidemic patients treated by statin in daily medical practice. The incidence rate of CV events in the patients who are treated by the standard anti-hyperlipidemic therapies other than Lotriga is investigated in this survey so as to compare the events rates between two patients groups just for information. For adults, 2 g of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters is usually administered orally once daily immediately after meals. However, the dose can be increased up to twice daily (to a dose of 2 g) depending on patient's triglyceride (TG) level.</detailed_description>
