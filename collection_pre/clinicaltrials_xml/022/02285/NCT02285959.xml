	<brief_summary>The high-grade malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM. Initial therapy consists of surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. Currently, all patients experience a recurrence after this first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can effectively increase the concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body of systemic side effects. This technique threads a tiny catheter through the patient's femoral artery in the leg, up through the body and neck and into the brain. Once the catheter reaches the brain, chemotherapy is released to the blood vessels that feed the tumor.</brief_summary>

Patients must be able to understand and give written informed consent. Informed consent must be obtained at the time of patient screening. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men will be informed as to the potential risk of procreation while participating in this research trial and will be advised that they must use effective contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. Patients with significant intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with treatment or posttreatment clinical monitoring.</criteria>
