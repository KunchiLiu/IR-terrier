	<brief_summary>Nosebleeds (epistaxis) are a frequent cause of emergency department visits, reportedly inciting 1 in 200 visits. They are most common in those less than ten and older than seventy, often occurring in the winter months secondary to dry indoor heating. Epistaxis is associated with elevated blood pressures, but it is controversial whether hypertension is actual a contributing cause. In non-life-threatening epistaxis, the first step in management is commonly the application of a topical vasoconstrictive medication. In many cases this will lead to cessation of the bleeding or facilitate the exam in those that continue to bleed. Frequently used medications include phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, and lidocaine with epinephrine. Classic teaching has been to avoid the use of these medications in patients with elevated blood pressures due to concerns of inducing hypertensive crisis. Strict avoidance of topical vasoconstrictors in this patient group with epistaxis severely limits the treatment options for a many patients given the association between the two conditions. Though universally taught, the actual effect of these agents on blood pressure remains unquantified. Studies investigating the prevention of nose bleeding during nasotracheal intubations suggest that the effect might be minor with little variation between agents. Clinical question: What is the effect of commonly used intranasal vasoconstrictors on blood pressure in volunteers without a history of hypertension.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy volunteers over the age of eighteen that have been recently dismissed from the Emergency Department at Mayo Clinic Hospital, Saint Marys Campus. We will recruit a convenience sample of 100 patients from the Emergency Department who have completed their Emergency Department evaluation and treatment and are being discharged to home with nonpainful conditions. We will exclude persons under the age of eighteen Vulnerable populations (pregnant patients and prisoners) Those with an allergy to any of the study agents Those with acute pain Those using antihypertensive or antiarrhythmic agents Those with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities (namely history of arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure) Those with concomitant use of MAOInhibitors Those with a diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma or BPH Those with a history of cerebrovascular disease As well as those with a history of previous nasal surgery or known nasal anatomic abnormalities.</criteria>
