	<brief_summary>Troponins are sensitive and specific markers of cardiac injury. Critically ill patients frequently have elevated troponins. In this population, distinguishing patients with elevated troponins from those with myocardial infarction is difficult. However, troponin elevations on their own seem to be associated with an increased risk of death. The optimal treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or non ischemia related troponin elevations during critical illness is unclear. There are no trials in the ICU setting to guide management. This study is a 1-month pilot cohort study of troponin screening in 4 Ontario intensive care units. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the ability to perform a larger study, which will determine the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for elevated troponin values, how patients with elevated troponin values are treated as a baseline, and the incidence of myocardial infarction in critically ill patients. Knowing the prognostic impact of these conditions and understanding current management will thereafter guide researchers and clinicians on the importance of carefully evaluating potential risk-modifying therapies.</brief_summary>
