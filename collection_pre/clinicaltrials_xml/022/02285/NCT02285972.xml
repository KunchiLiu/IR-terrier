	<brief_summary>Propofol remains the most common drug for induction of general anaesthesia, although it causes considerable pain or discomfort on injection. Anesthesia providers have attempted a large number of remedies to prevent this pain on injection. Previously explored ideas include injecting propofol into larger veins, warming of the hand with hot packs, and intravenous pretreatment with numerous other medications. No studies to date have looked at the dexketoprofen and tenoxicam for the pretreatment of pain on injection caused by propofol. The investigators propose studying the use of dexketoprofen and tenoxicam for pretreatment of propofol related pain on injection.</brief_summary>
