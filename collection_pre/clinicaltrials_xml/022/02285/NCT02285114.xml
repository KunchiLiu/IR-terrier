	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents virologically suppressed (defined as having &lt; 50 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA for a period of at least 6 months) while on a stable 2-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) containing regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (F/TAF) in HIV-1 Infected Children and Adolescents Virologically Suppressed on a 2-NRTI-Containing Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be 2 Cohorts in this study. Cohort 1 (adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years) will be non-randomized and participants will switch their current 2-NRTI containing regimen to F/TAF while continuing on their 3rd antiretroviral (ARV) agent through 96 weeks. Upon review of safety and PK data in Cohort 1, screening into Part A of Cohort 2 will be initiated. Cohort 2 (children 6 to &lt; 12 years) will be randomized and will consist of Parts A and B. Participants in Cohort 2 Part A will be randomized to receive either F/TAF or emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) while continuing on their 3rd ARV agent through 96 weeks. Upon review of safety and intensive PK data in Cohort 2 Part A, screening into Cohort 2 Part B will be initiated. Participants in Cohort 2 Part B will be randomized to receive either F/TAF or FTC/TDF while continuing their 3rd ARV agent through 96 weeks.</detailed_description>

Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol. Pregnant or lactating females Have history of significant drug sensitivity or drug allergy Have previously participated in an investigational trial involving administration of any investigational agent, other than tenofovir, within 30 days prior to the study dosing</criteria>
