	<brief_summary>To investigate the predictive roles of adipokines and hepatokines to detect non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), diabetes, or dyslipidmia. To examine the association or effects of clinical and biochemical factors (lab results and medication, etc.) on serum levels of adipokines and hepatokines in certain subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), diabetes, or dyslipidmia.</brief_summary>
