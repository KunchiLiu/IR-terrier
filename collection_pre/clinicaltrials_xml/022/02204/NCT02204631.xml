	<brief_title>2 Phase Use Of Educational Materials In Head And Neck Cancer Center</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be two phases of the study. In "Phase I", 30 participants will be recruited for assessment of information satisfaction, psychological stress, illness perception, and symptom burden throughout their head and neck cancer treatment without any intervention. This group will represent the current standard of care in the head and neck group and serve as a "historical control" for the second group. In "Phase II", which will occur after "Phase I" group, 30 new participants will be recruited to receive a handbook and to have it integrated into their cancer care. The same participant reported outcome measures of information satisfaction, psychological stress, illness perception, and symptom burden will be assessed such that comparisons between phases can be made. This will serve as a pilot study of the implementation and maintenance of an educational intervention in clinical practice and how it affects participant-reported outcomes. Comparison of these two groups of participants will provide the baseline data to plan future interventions.</detailed_description>
