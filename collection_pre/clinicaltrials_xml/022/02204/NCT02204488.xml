	<brief_summary>Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis is a common cause of pain and loss of hand function in postmenopausal women. Many surgical treatments have been described and recent literature has show that the relatively simple trapeziectomy gives equal results and less complications, when compared to other techniques such as ligament reconstructions and interpositions. A relatively new treatment modality, which has been further developed in recent years is the total joint arthroplasty. Randomized prospective trials and long-term results are lacking, but prospective cohorts show a faster recovery and good results after one year, without an increase in complication rate. We hypothesize that a total joint arthroplasty gives a better objective and subjective result after one year than a trapeziectomy.</brief_summary>
