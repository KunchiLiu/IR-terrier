	<brief_summary>Trans-Radial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (TR-PCI) is rapidly becoming the gold standard. This is especially the case in primary Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI), where most benefits of the radial approach, such as reduced major bleeding and mortality, can be expected. However there is very limited research available looking at the consequences of trans-radial access for upper extremity function. The main objective of this study is to provide insight in the morbidity with regards to the upper extremity surrounding the radial access route in percutaneous coronary interventions. Secondary objectives are to provide insight in the consequences for functional status, factors influencing and financial costs of this morbidity, to identify subject who might benefit from early referral and treatment of this morbidity and to generate hypotheses for further clinical research into this matter. The investigators hypothesis is that approximately 20% of the population will experience upper extremity dysfunction after TR-PCI.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presenting for TRPCI at the study centre. The radial artery can be palpated and Doppler ultrasound examination of the radial artery shows nonocclusive flow. Currently enrolled in another study that clinically interferes with this study and that has not passed the primary endpoint. The clinical condition prohibits or hinders informed consent and/or baseline examinations. E.g. cardiogenic shock and cardiopulmonary resuscitation or subconscious and semiconscious state,. Comorbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the study or to comply with followup requirements, or impact the scientific integrity of the study, e.g. loss of voluntary motor control of the studied extremities.</criteria>
