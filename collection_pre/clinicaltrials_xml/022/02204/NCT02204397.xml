	<brief_title>Study of Tolerability and Safety of Adding Ustekinumab to INGAP Peptide for 12 Weeks in Adult Patients With TD1 Melitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) daily administration of INGAP-P (600 mg SC once a day in three separate injection sites) with ustekinumab (two single injections of 45 mg SC, one as pretreatment two weeks before INGAP-P treatment begins and the second one after 2 weeks of INGAP-P treatment) in adult patients with established type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Safety will be evaluated by assessing local tolerability, recording incidence of hypoglycemia, performing safety laboratory measures at frequent intervals, and following subjects very closely for any adverse events (AEs). Secondary objectives of this study are to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of INGAP-P and ustekinumab in adult patients with established T1DM, specifically by change from baseline to Week 12 in: 1) Maximal C-peptide (Cmax) during mixed meal test (MMT) and glucagon stimulated test (GST); 2) C-peptide release (AUC) during MMT and GST; 3) Fasting C-peptide; 4) Fasting glucose (before breakfast and after at least 8 hours of fasting); 5) Longer term glycemic control as reflected by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG); and, 6) Total daily insulin dose relative to body weight.</detailed_description>
