	<detailed_description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive deteriorating in the advanced age. This main target of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using novel coil design (H2) for stimulation of deep brain structures concomitantly with regular treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. TMS acts by generating magnetic fields in the brain which simulate neuro-chemical changes and stimulate neuronal activity translating into increased secretion of growth factors such as brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Hence it is postulated that TMS will have a positive effect on the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with AD and may ameliorated the progression of the disease. The treatment is non-invasive, with no significant side effects, and no need of hospitalization or anesthesia. The trial is phase II double blind study including 100 AD patients ages between 50 to 80 with mild or moderate AD (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] 16 to 26) divided into 3 groups. All participants will receive standard medical therapy for AD. In addition, patients recruited for the study will receive 16 sessions of TMS with the H2 coil over 8 weeks. The first group will receive excitatory stimulation of 10 Hz over the prefrontal and parietal cortex, the second group will receive inhibitory stimulation of 1 Hz over similar brain areas and control patients will receive the same amount of Sham sessions. Patient will receive 3 treatments per week in the first 3 weeks and then 1 treatment per week for additional 4 weeks. Patients will be evaluated before the treatments, after 8 weeks of treatment and after another 8 weeks without treatment. The evaluations will include cognitive function according to ADAS-COG and MMSE, Activity of daily living (ADL) functions according to ADSC-ADL, behavioral function according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), depression according to the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), care giver satisfaction according to the RUD LITE scale and computerized cognitive evaluation according to the NEXING battery. We expect that the cognitive, behavioral and ADL functions will improve better in the study group as compared to the Sham treated group. From previous trial of TMS in neurological patients, although not in AD, we anticipate that adverse events rate will be similar between groups proving the safety of deep TMS treatment in patients with AD. In case our hypothesis will be proven, deep TMS treatment will be added as an important modality to the conventional therapy of AD patients. All patients will be received 500 mcg/d of lithium as supplement nutritional in form spring mineral water</detailed_description>
