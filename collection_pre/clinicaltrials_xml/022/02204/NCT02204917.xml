	<brief_title>CeVUS With Intravesical Administration of OPTISON TM (Trademark) in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast enhanced Voiding Urosonography (ceVUS) is a radiation free, highly sensitive imaging modality for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urethral imaging in children. It employs ultrasound technology in combination with ultrasound contrast agent, which is administered intravesically via a bladder catheter. Currently, second generation ultrasound contrast agents are commercially available, comprising of gas-filled microbubbles. CeVUS in children is being widely practiced, primarily in Europe, despite the fact that none of the commercially available ultrasound contrast agents are yet approved for clinical applications in pediatric population. In the United States, there is limited clinical experience with ceVUS in children. Among the currently commercially available ultrasound contrast agents, OPTISON has already been used in research and off-label in clinical settings involving adults and children. One in-vitro study has been conducted aiming to optimize the ultrasound technical parameters and the dose of OPTISON for intravesical administration in children. In this clinical trial the investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic feasibility and safety of ceVUS with the intravesical use of OPTISON for vesicoureteral reflux detection and urethral imaging in children.</detailed_description>
