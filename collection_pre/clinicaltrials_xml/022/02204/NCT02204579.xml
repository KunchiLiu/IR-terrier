	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study looking at the effects of NPSP795 (a selective calcium receptor antagonist) on activating mutations of the Calcium-sensing receptor in patients with Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia. Patients with ADH have low blood calcium levels and an inappropriately increased renal calcium excretion, decreased renal phosphate excretion, and hyperphosphatemia. PTH and blood calcium levels will be tested during and after the IV infusion of NPSP795. Concentrations of NPSP795 and length of time of IV infusion will vary depending on measured levels of ionized calcium.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with a heterozygous activating mutation of the CaSR gene (ADH); if not previously confirmed, genetic testing will be performed at the screening visit At least 18 years of age Body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 18.5 to &lt; 39 kg/m2 Diseases or conditions that might compromise any major body system or interfere with the pharmacokinetics of NPSP795 History of treatment with PTH 184 or 134 within the previous 6 months History of hypocalcemia requiring frequent IV calcium infusions History of hypocalcemic seizure within the past 3 months Blood 25hydroxy vitamin D level &lt; 25 ng/mL. If subjects have a blood 25hydroxy vitamin D level &lt; 25 ng/mL at the outpatient screening visit, they will be prescribed vitamin D replacement. Once the 25hydroxy vitamin D level is &gt; 25 ng/mL, the subject will be eligible to continue on to the treatment phase of the study Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 25 mL/minute, and/or abnormal hepatic, hematologic, and/or clotting function 12 lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with clinically significant abnormalities Concomitant medications with the potential to interfere with NPSP795 metabolism History of thyroid or parathyroid surgery</criteria>
