	<brief_title>Study of Duvelisib in Combination With Rituximab vs Rituximab in Subjects With Previously Treated Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study IPI-145-08 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPI-145 in combination with rituximab vs placebo in combination with rituximab in subjects with previously treated CD20-positive follicular lymphoma. Approximately 400 subjects will receive 25 mg of IPI-145 or placebo, orally BID for 28 day continuous cycles, in combination with 375 mg/m2 of Rituximab given once weekly for 4 weeks during Cycle 1 and then once on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, 8, and 10. Patients will remain on treatment for up to 27 cycles and may continue treatment if clinical benefit is observed.</detailed_description>
