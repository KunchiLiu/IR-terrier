	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this research is to test the feasibility and tolerability of the tethered capsule Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) screening probe in healthy subjects, patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Eosinophilic Esophagitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Image the Esophagus Using the OFDI Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 54 subjects comprising of healthy volunteers, patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) or Barrett's Esophagus will be asked to swallow the OFDI capsule while being unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether that allows the capsule operator to navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsion called peristalsis as well as to bring it back up to pulled out of the mouth when the procedure is done. As the capsule progresses down the esophagus, multiple, two dimensional, microscopic cross- sectional images of the esophagus are acquired.</detailed_description>
