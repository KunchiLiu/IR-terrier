	<brief_summary>The objective of this prospective cohort study in patients with a known thoracic aortic aneurysm is to test the hypothesis that yearly aneurysm progression rate is higher in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) compared to patients without OSA, and that the need for aortic operation or proven or presumed death from aortic rupture or dissection happens more often in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and OSA compared to patients without OSA.</brief_summary>
