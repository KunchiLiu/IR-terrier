	<brief_summary>A better understanding of knee joint kinematics is important to explain the premature polyethylene wear failures within total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and to help design a prosthesis that most closely approximates the normal knee. Specifically, posterior stabilizing (PS) knees have been found to be associated with lower amounts of posterior femoral rollback, higher occurrence of reverse axial rotation and increased amount of condylar lift-off. The DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction's Attune PS fixed bearing (FB) knee system has incorporated subtle changes in its design to address restoration of kinematics that more closely resemble those of a normal knee. To understand if this design is able to effectively restore kinematics in the implanted knee, further in vivo analysis is necessary. This pilot study will analyze 5 subjects with the Attune PS FB 3 months post-operatively using the University of Tennessee's mobile fluoroscopy unit while performing three daily activities, level walking, ramp down and deep knee bend. Since this is a pilot study, there is no hypothesis.</brief_summary>
