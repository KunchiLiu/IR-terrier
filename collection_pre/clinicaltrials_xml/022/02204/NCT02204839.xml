	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesise that reducing basal insulin dose (Glargine, Lantus, Sanofi-Aventis, or Detemir, Levemir, Novo Nordisk), whilst employing current carbohydrate feeding and rapid-acting insulin dose recommendations will protect patients with type 1 diabetes from early- and late-onset hypoglycaemia following evening time exercise.</brief_summary>
