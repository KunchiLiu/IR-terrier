	<brief_summary>Rosacea is a chronic facial disfiguring dermatosis characterized by different stages like flushing, erythema, telangiectasia and papulo-pustular lesions. Recommended treatments include topical (metronidazole) and systemic (doxycycline) antibiotics with only a suspensive effect. The bipolar radiofrequency (RF) with Elos system (infrared light) is a device emitting an electromagnetic current inducing an increase in temperature when applied on the skin, potentiated by infrared light. The monopolar RF has already been used in rosacea on a small number of cases with positive and prolonged results. RF with Elos system has been evaluated on erythemato-telangiectasic rosacea with encouraging results. Demodex folliculorum (DF) is a long transparent mite which asymptomatically parasitizes pilosebaceous follicle of normal human skin sometimes responsible of inflammatory facial dermatoses. The prevalence and density of DF are increased in rosacea, and DF is suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of rosacea. DF is sensitive to heat, and the investigators hypothesize that radiofrequency treatment may affect the survival of the mite and should be effective to treat papulopustular rosacea.</brief_summary>
