	<brief_summary>To compare the acute effect of soluble fiber intake from foods or supplement after a common meal on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is a meal with a high content of soluble fiber from food determines glycemic and insulinemic response similar to a meal with a high content of soluble fiber from supplement sources.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycemic and Insulinemic Response With Different Sources of Soluble Fiber in Patients Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three breakfasts (high amount of fiber from diet food sources - HFD, high amount of soluble fiber from guar gum supplement - HFS and usual amount of fiber -UF), isocaloric and similar distribution of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the order of breakfasts randomly determined. Meals HFD and HFS have the same amount of fiber from different sources, origin in food and supplement respectively. Meal UF consist of the same foods meal HFS, but without the use of soluble fiber supplement and white bread instead of rye bread (low fiber content in relation to meals HFD and HFS). The supplement (Sachet 5g - Fiber Mais ®: 60% guar gum and 40% inulin) will be added to the plain water to meal HFD.</detailed_description>
