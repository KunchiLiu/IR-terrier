	<brief_title>FDG-PET/CT in Evaluation of Cytological Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules to Prevent Unnecessary Surgery (EfFECTS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Only about ¼ of patients with thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology are proven to suffer from a malignancy at diagnostic hemithyroidectomy. Therefore ~¾ is operated upon unbeneficially. Recent studies using FDG-PET/CT have suggested that it can decrease the fraction of unbeneficial procedures from ~73% to ~40%. Thereby the direct costs per patient, the number of hospitalization and average sick leave days might decrease and the experienced HRQoL might increase. A study will be undertaken to show the additional value of FDG-PET/CT after indeterminate cytology with respect to unbeneficial procedures, costs and utilities. Main objective: To determine the impact of FDG-PET/CT on decreasing the fraction of patients with cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules undergoing unbeneficial patient management. Study design: A prospective, multicentre, randomized, stratified controlled blinded trial with an experimental study-arm (FDG-PET/CT-driven) and a control study-arm (diagnostic hemithyroidectomy, independent of FDG-PET/CT-result). Study population: Adult patients with a cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodule, without exclusion criteria, in 15 (university and regional) hospitals distributed over the Netherlands. Intervention: One single FDG-PET/low-dose non-contrast enhanced CT of the head and neck is performed in all patients. Patient management depends on allocation and results of this FDG-PET/CT. Main study parameters/endpoints: The number of unbeneficial interventions, i.e. surgery for benign disease or watchful-waiting for malignancy. Secondary objectives: complication rate, consequences of incidental PET-findings, number of hospitalisation and sick leave days, volumes of healthcare consumed, experienced health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), genetic, cytological and (immuno)histopathological features of the nodules. Sample size calculation/data analysis: Based on above-mentioned estimated reduction in unbeneficial interventions from ~73% to ~40%, at least 96 patients with nodules&gt;10 mm need to be analyzed (2:1 allocation, α=0.05, power=0.90, single-sided Fisher's exact test). After correction for nodule size and data-attrition, 132 patients need to be included in total. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. Incremental Net Monetary Benefit based on the total direct costs per patients and the gain in HRQoL-adjusted survival years are computed. Cytological, histological and genetic parameters for FDG-avidity will be described. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: All patients undergo one FDG-PET/CT scan of head/neck (effective dose: &lt;3.5 mSv) and are asked to fill in 6 questionnaires at 4 timepoints. FDG-PET/CT negative patients in the experimental arm will undergo a single confirmatory US (±FNAC). An interim/posterior analysis of the control subjects is performed to ensure oncological safety. In case of an unexpected high false-negative ratio in this control arm, all patients will be advised to undergo surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Documented history of a solitary thyroid nodule or a dominant nodule within multinodular disease, with (USguided) FNAC performed by a dedicated radiologist or experienced endocrinologist or pathologist, demonstrating an indeterminate cytological examination (i.e. Bethesda category III or IV) according to the local pathologist and confirmed after central review; 2. Scheduled for surgical excision (preferably) within 2 months of the inclusion date; 3. Age ≥ 18 years; 4. Euthyroid state with a serum thyrotropin (TSH) or a free T4 level within the institutional upper and lower limits of normal, measured within 2 months of registration. In case of a suppressed TSH: a negative 123I, 131I or 99mTcO4 scintigraphy must be available ("cold nodule"); 5. In patients with multinodular disease and a dominant nodule, the nuclear medicine physician responsible for FDGPET/CT scan interpretation must determine whether the nodule is likely to be discriminated on FDGPET/CT imaging prior to enrolment; 6. Willing to participate in all aspects of the study; 1. High a priori probability of malignancy: FNAC Bethesda category V or VI during local reading or central review; Prior radiation exposure / radiotherapy to the thyroid; Prior neck surgery or radiation that in the opinion of the PI has disrupted tissue architecture of the thyroid; New unexplained hoarseness, change of voice, stridor or paralysis of a vocal cord; In case a benign reason has been found (e.g. vocal cord edema), the patient is eligible; Thyroid nodule discovered as a FDGPET positive incidentaloma New cervical lymphadenopathy highly suspicious for malignancy; In case malignancy is excluded, patient is eligible; Previous treatment for thyroid carcinoma or current diagnosis of any other malignancy that is known to metastasize to the thyroid; Known metastases of thyroid carcinoma; Known genetic predisposition for thyroid carcinoma: Familiar NonMedullary Thyroid Cancer (NMTC) Familiar Papillary Thyroid Cancer (FPTC) Familiar Adenomatoid Polyposis Coli syndrome (FAP, Gardner syndrome, APCgene mutations on chromosome 5q21) Morbus Cowden (PTEN mutation on chromosome 10q23.3) PTC / nodular thyroid hyperplasia / papillary renal tumours. Linked to locus 1q21. 2. Proven benign disease or insufficient material for a cytological diagnosis: FNAC Bethesda category I or II during local reading or central review 3. Performance of nonroutine additional diagnostic tests that alter the patients treatment policy (e.g. mutation analysis on cytology) 4. Inability to undergo randomization: Any patient that will receive thyroid surgery for other reasons (e.g. mechanical or cosmetic complaints). 5. Inability to undergo treatment: Inability to undergo surgery in the opinion of the surgeon / anaesthetist. 6. Contraindications for FDGPET/CT: Patient has evidence of infection localized to the neck in the 14 days prior to the FDGPET/CT scan; Inability to tolerate lying supine for the duration of an FDGPET/CT examination (~1015min); Poorly regulated diabetes mellitus (see next item); Hyperglycaemia at time of FDG injection prior to PET/CT (fasting serum glucose &gt;200mg/dL [&gt;11.1 mmol/L]); The use of shortacting insulins within 4 hours of the PET scan is not allowed If female and fertile: signs and symptoms of pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test / breastfeeding; A formal negative pregnancy test is not obligatory (severe) claustrophobia; Low dose benzodiazepines are allowed 7. General contraindications: Inability to give informed consent; Severe psychiatric disorder;</criteria>
