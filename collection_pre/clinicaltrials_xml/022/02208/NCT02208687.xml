	<brief_summary>Fatigue is present in at least 60% of the patients with a muscle disease and can be the most disabling symptom. In combination with other impairments, this often results in low levels of physical activity and decreased social participation, leading to large societal costs. Energetic is a self-management group program aimed at improving participation and physical endurance in these patients. Our hypothesis is that Energetic results in improved participation and improved physical endurance, less experienced fatigue and better quality of life compared to usual care, without increasing health care costs.</brief_summary>
