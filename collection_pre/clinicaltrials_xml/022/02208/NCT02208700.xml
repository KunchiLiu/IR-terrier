	<brief_summary>Patients with mechanical ventilation have shown improved weaning rates when enteral tube feeding high in EPA, GLA and antioxidants were fed to patients in the critical care setting. LTAC Patients on chronic mechanical ventilation will have decreased days an mechanical ventilation, decreased mortality rates and decreased organ failure when fed an enteral product high in EPA, GLA and antioxidants compared to an isotonic high fiber enteral nutrition product.</brief_summary>
