	<brief_summary>Diaphragm dysfunction is common after cardiac surgery and may delay weaning from mechanical ventilation and cause respiratory distress. The investigators' main objective is to determine the incidence of diaphragm dysfunction ( using the non-invasive ultrasonic method by calculating the inspiratory diaphragmatic thickening fraction) in a selected population of cardiac surgery patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation. The second endpoints are to determine the associated risk factors to post-operative diaphragm weakness and the consequence on the patient outcome.</brief_summary>
