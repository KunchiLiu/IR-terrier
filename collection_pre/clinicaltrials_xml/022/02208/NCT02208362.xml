	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T-cell immunotherapy in treating patients with malignant glioma that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to therapy (refractory). A T cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body. T cells are taken from the patient's blood and a modified gene is placed into them in the laboratory and this may help them recognize and kill glioma cells. Genetically modified T-cells may also help the body build an immune response against the tumor cells. Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility and safety of intratumoral (stratum 1), intracavitary (stratum 2), intraventricular (stratum 3), or dual delivery (both intratumoral and intraventricular) (stratum 4) cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo expanded autologous central memory T cells (TCM)-enriched T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector to express a interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2)-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), as well as a truncated human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) (IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ TCM) (IL13Rα2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes), for research participants with recurrent/refractory malignant glioma. II. To determine maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended phase II dosing plan (RP2D) for each stratum based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the full toxicity profile. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the timing and extent of brain inflammation, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), following T cell administration. II. To describe cytokine levels (cyst fluid, peripheral blood) over the study period. III. In research participants who receive the full schedule of three CAR+ T cell doses: estimate the six month progression free survival rate, disease response rates, and median overall survival. IV. In research participants who receive intraventricular infusions after progressing following intratumoral/intracranial infusions (stratum 1 or 2): estimate disease response rate and overall survival if the sample size is large enough. V. In research participants who receive at least one dose of CAR+ T cells estimate the mean change from baseline in quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and EORTC QLQ brain neoplasm (BN)-20 survey scale, domain and item scores during and post treatment. VI. For study participants who undergo a second resection or autopsy: To evaluate CAR+ T cell persistence in the tumor micro-environment and the location of the CAR+ T cells with respect to the injection site, and to evaluate IL13Ra2 antigen expression levels pre and post CAR+ T cell therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 strata. Patients receive IL13Rα2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via intratumoral (stratum 1) or intracavitary (stratum 2) or intraventricular (stratum 3) or dual delivery (both intratumoral and intraventricular) (stratum 4) catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression. Beginning as early as 1 week later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as they continue to remain eligible and there is product available. Patients who progress on intracavitary or intratumoral administration may move to intraventricular catheter for the optional infusions. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months and then yearly for 15 years.</detailed_description>
