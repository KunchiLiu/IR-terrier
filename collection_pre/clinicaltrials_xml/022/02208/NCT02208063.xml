	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial of telavancin versus standard IV therapy control (e.g., vancomycin, daptomycin, anti-staphylococcal penicillin (PCN), or cefazolin) in the treatment of subjects with complicated Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteremia and SA right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older with at least one blood culture positive for S. aureus within 48 hours before randomization At least one of the following signs or symptoms of bacteremia: Temperature ≥ 38.0°C WBC count &gt; 10,000 or &lt; 4,000 cells/µL or &gt; 10% immature neutrophils (bands) Tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 90 bpm) Tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min) Hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg) Signs or symptoms of localized catheterrelated infection At enrollment, subjects must have either 1) known rightsided infective endocarditis by Modified Duke's criteria 2) known complicated bacteremia, demonstrated as signs or symptoms of metastatic foci of S. aureus infection or 3) at least one risk factor for complicated bacteremia. Treatment with any potentially effective (antistaphylococcal) systemic antibiotic for more than 60 hours within 7 days before randomization. EXCEPTION: Documented resistance to the prior systemic antibacterial therapy Presence of an infection source that will not be managed or controlled within the first 3 days of study drug treatment Presence of prosthetic cardiac valve or cardiac device (eg, implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD]), permanent pacemaker, or cardiac valve support ring) Known or suspected leftsided infective endocarditis (LIE), by Modified Duke Criteria. NOTE: Rightsided infective endocarditis (RIE) is permitted Known or suspected osteomyelitis or meningitis. NOTE: Evidence of metastatic complications related to the primary infection such as rightsided endocarditis, septic arthritis, septic pulmonary emboli are permitted. S. aureus pneumonia is permitted Confirmed evidence (identification or gram stain) of a mixed polymicrobial infection with a Gramnegative pathogen that requires nonstudy antibiotic treatment with agent(s) that have activity against Gramnegative pathogens</criteria>
