	<brief_summary>The brachial plexus block is an anesthetic technique often used for surgical procedures of the upper limb. To get the brachial plexus block, several routes can be used, including the axillary and infraclavicular approach. Few studies have compared these techniques, considering the time to perform the block, the onset time and success rate, with conflicting results. Furthermore, there is little information in the literature comparing the length of postoperative analgesia provided by these techniques. Therefore, the investigators designed this study in order to elucidate the differences between these two techniques to assist the anesthesiologist to choose the best of them in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
