	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and end-stage renal disease. Evidence from randomized clinical trials suggests that treating urinary albumin excretion (UAE), dyslipidemia, and hypertension will reduce these risks. Unfortunately, less than 30% of the CKD population is screened and treated according to recommended guidelines. Using a cluster-randomized, controlled design and clinic-embedded pharmacists, this pilot pragmatic trial will randomize 6 Geisinger primary care clinics (72 patients) to usual care (group 1) or a pharmacist-directed "CKD Action Plan" (group 2). Determining the impact of the CKD Action Plan on screening and treatment guideline adherence is the primary goal of this pilot study.</brief_summary>
