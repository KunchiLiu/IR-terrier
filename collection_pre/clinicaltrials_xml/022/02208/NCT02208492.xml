	<brief_summary>Unlike the first generation antiepileptic medications, newer drugs for epilepsy such as levetiracetam are reported to have less adverse effect in children but not many studies have systematically reviewed the subject. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the effect of levetiracetam on neurocognition, behavioral issues and quality of life, as well as its seizure control efficacy and other adverse events in pediatric epilepsy patients, in comparison to carbamazepine, one of the classic antiepileptic medication, widely prescribed for both partial and generalized seizures, despite its well known side effects. This multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial is expected to enroll 130 patients from age 4 to 16 woh will be randomized into two groups, which will be prescribed with levetiracetam or carbamazepine. Series of neuropsychological assessment and behavioral and life evaluations of the patients will be performed at baseline period and after the 52 weeks of study period.</brief_summary>
