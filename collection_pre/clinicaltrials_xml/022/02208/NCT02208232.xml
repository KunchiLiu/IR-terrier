	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the axial IOL rotation after surgery with an MC 6125 AS IOL. At the end of surgery the orientation of the IOL is documented with a short video clip via the operating microscope unit. Follow-up examinations are performed 1 hour, 1 week and 6 months after surgery. Rotational stability of the IOL is assessed using retroillumination images with a method to avoid bias from cyclorotation or head tilt.</brief_summary>
