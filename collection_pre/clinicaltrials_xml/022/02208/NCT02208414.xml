	<brief_title>Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Crab or Shrimp Allergy Reduction Study Using Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nambudripad allergy elimination techniques (NAET) were developed by Dr. Devi Nambudripad in 1983. Many patients have been relieved of allergy and allergy-related disease by this treatment. Lack of well-controlled clinical study prevents NAET from being accepted as a treatment option in current medical system. The aim of this project is to conduct a double blind-placebo controlled study of applying NAET to treat crab or shrimp allergy. The parameters to be measured are allergic symptom, crab- or shrimp-specific IgE and skin test before and after NAET treatment</detailed_description>
