	<brief_title>King Video Laryngoscope Versus Direct Laryngoscopy for Prehospital Intubation: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will equip several local advanced life support ambulances with a low cost video laryngoscope for a total of 12 months. We will outfit ½ of the ambulance crews with the King Video Laryngoscope (KVL) for 6 months while the other ½ of the ambulances will use traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL). After 6 months, the groups will switch devices. We will randomly assign those ambulances that first use the KVL. After one year (12 months) we will compare the outcomes between the two methods including first pass intubation success, total success rate for intubation, and complications (need for surgical airway, rescue device, need to revert from KVL to DL, etc.). Please see the attached protocol page for additional details.</detailed_description>
