	<brief_summary>Crohn's disease is more common in areas of the world with less sunlight exposure. Sunlight is a major source of vitamin D. There is some research to suggest that patient's with higher vitamin D levels are less likely to undergo surgeries and have better control of their disease. We intend to study the effects of high dose vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D deficiency and Crohn's disease. We hypothesize that patients given high doses will have less hospitalizations, surgeries, steroid use.</brief_summary>
