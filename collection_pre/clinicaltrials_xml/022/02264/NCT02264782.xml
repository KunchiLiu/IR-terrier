	<brief_summary>PreView is a novel tool that functions within the system in a busy clinic setting, integrates information obtained from a particular patient with provider alerts, is efficient, relieves the burden of time constraints and is tailored to the individual patient. The goal of PreView is to support and simplify the physician's role in promoting cancer screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PreView: The Preventive Video Education in Waiting Rooms Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PreView is a multimedia interactive Video Doctor Plus Provider Alert intervention that assesses stage of change for cancer screening, uses an interactive Video Doctor who gives messages targeted to individual stage of change and individual barriers in a feasible and efficient manner, and generates individualized Provider Alerts. This innovative tool 1) focuses on all recommended cancer screening for a particular individual, 2) is tailored to an individual's stage of change and an individual's barriers to screening, and 3) has been pilot tested for feasibility but has not been tested in a primary care clinic setting and is thus a novel approach to increasing rates of cancer screening and discussions about cancer screening. UCSF research staff will contact potential participants directly to confirm eligibility and request optional and voluntary participation. PreView will remain at participating practices for a second year during the Maintenance Phase of the study. PreView will be placed in a conspicuous place, most likely in the waiting room. Eligible patients arriving for appointments will be encouraged by office staff and by signs to use it, but whether or not to use it will be completely optional. An information sheet about PreView will be available next to the PreView iPad for participants to review. A postcard with contact information for PreView staff will be placed next to the iPad for participants to provide feedback about PreView if they so desire. Their feedback is completely voluntary. At each site there will be a designated 'office champion' who will ensure that the iPad is charged and functioning, will ensure that the printer is working and will be an on-site resource person.</detailed_description>
