	<brief_summary>Tension headache is a common disabling disease and a worldwide public health problem. This research tries to demonstrate the efficacy of physical therapy, based on cervical training and postural self-correction instructions, which aims to increase the positive results obtained from traditional relaxation techniques (Schultz Autogenic Training). University students are selected, because headaches are very common in this sector of the population. The design is a non-pharmacological randomized controlled trial, with blinded evaluation of the response variables. The investigators compare two independent samples. One of them receives an only treatment (Autogenic Training) and the other group receives a combined program (Autogenic Training + specific cervical exercises and postural correction). Pain parameters (frequency, intensity and duration) and drug consumption are measured before treatment, and then, at 4 weeks and 3 months, to value the results.</brief_summary>
