	<brief_summary>The ongoing LAPCOR (Laboratory AntiPlatelet efficacy and Clinical Outcome Registry) registry was initiated in 2008 at a tertiary care cardiac center, and consecutive patients, who underwent intracoronary stent implantation, have been included regardless of whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on urgent or elective basis.Patients were included in the registry after having signed an informed consent for participation. No exclusion criterion has been applied for the registry participation. Efficacy of P2Y12 receptor antagonists has been measured by quantitative flow cytometric analysis of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation according to the manufacturer protocol (Platelet VASP; Diagnostica Stago, Biocytex, Asni√®res, France) on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Occurrence of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days, 6-months and one year follow up has been investigated.</brief_summary>
