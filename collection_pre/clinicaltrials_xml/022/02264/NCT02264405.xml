	<brief_summary>To assess the effectiveness of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation (AHSCT) for early severe or rapidly progressive Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) as currently performed by different study protocols used across Europe in various EBMT centres through the careful recording and analysis of routinely collected clinical and biological data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous SCT for Progressive Systemic Sclerosis: a Prospective NIS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different protocols are used in the different centres, it is not yet clear which approach will be the most efficient and the safest. Every centre will follow its own local protocol for AHSCT which usually refers to the recent update of the EBMT Guidelines for HSCT in autoimmune disease. Patient selection for AHSCT treatment technique with regard to the risk/benefit balance has to be carefully addressed by standard patient pretransplant evaluation, whereas treatment local regimen, follow-ups evaluation, supportive medication and prophylaxis will be recorded and analysed.</detailed_description>
