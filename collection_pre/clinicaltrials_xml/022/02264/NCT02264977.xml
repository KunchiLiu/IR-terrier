	<mesh_term>Aneurysm</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Presence of aortic aneurysm involving the aortic arch deemed to warrant surgical repair which requires proximal graft placement in Zone 0 or Zone 1: 1. Fusiform (≥ 55 mm), or 2. Fusiform (&gt;2 times native aortic diameter), or 3. Saccular (no diameter criteria) 2. Subject is considered a high risk candidate for conventional open surgical repair at the discretion of the Investigator 3. Age ≥18 years at time of informed consent signature 4. Subject is capable of complying with protocol requirements, including followup 5. Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed by Subject or legal representative 6. Must have appropriate proximal aortic landing zone, defined as: 1. Must require placement of the proximal extent of the Aortic Component in Zone 0 or Zone 1 for exclusion of the lesion 2. Acceptable proximal landing zone outer curvature length for the required device 3. Landing zone inner diameters between 1648 mm in Zone 1 Subjects and 2448mm in Zone 0 Subjects 4. Landing zone, which must include either the brachiocephalic or left common carotid native ostium, cannot be aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed 7. Must have appropriate distal aortic landing zone, defined as: 1. Outer curvature length must be ≥2cm proximal to the celiac artery 2. Aortic inner diameters between 1648 mm (diameter must be between 1642mm if using distal TAG® Device extension) 3. Landing zone cannot be aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed 4. Landing zone in native aorta or previously implanted GORE® TAG® Device 8. Must have appropriate target branch vessel landing zone, defined as: 1. Length of ≥3 cm proximal to first major branch vessel if using Aortic Component with 8 mm portal diameter, or length of ≥2.5 cm proximal to first major branch vessel if using Aortic Component with 12 mm portal diameter (required for Zone 0 Subjects) 2. Target branch vessel inner diameters of 615 mm if using Aortic Component with 8mm portal diameter, or inner diameters of 1118 mm if using Aortic Component with 12mm portal diameter (required for Zone 0 Subjects) 3. Target branch vessel landing zone must be in native aorta that cannot be aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed 1. Concomitant aneurysm/disease of the ascending aorta, or abdominal aorta requiring repair 2. Previous endovascular repair of the ascending aorta 3. Previous endovascular repair of the DTA with a nonGore device 4. Surgery within 30 days of treatment 5. Infected aorta 6. Dissection of the aorta 7. Intramural hematoma of the aortic arch or DTA without aneurysm 8. Life expectancy &lt;2 years 9. Myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 weeks prior to treatment 10. Patient has a systemic infection and may be at increased risk of endovascular graft infection 11. Pregnant female at time of informed consent signature 12. Degenerative connective tissue disease, e.g. Marfan's or EhlerDanlos Syndrome 13. Participation in another drug or medical device study within one year of study enrollment 14. Known history of drug abuse within one year of treatment 15. Significant thrombus or atheroma in the aortic arch 16. Tortuous or stenotic iliac and/or femoral arteries preventing introducer sheath insertion and the inability to use a conduit for vascular access 17. Planned coverage of celiac artery 18. Patient has known sensitivities or allergies to the device materials 19. Patient has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants or contrast media, which is not amenable to pretreatment 20. Previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT2) or known hypersensitivity to heparin 21. Diameter taper outside of the device sizing range between proximal and distal landing zones of aorta and the inability to use additional devices of different diameters to compensate for the taper 22. Mycotic aneurysm 23. Persistent refractory shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) 24. Patient has body habitus or other medical condition which prevents adequate visualization of the aorta</criteria>
