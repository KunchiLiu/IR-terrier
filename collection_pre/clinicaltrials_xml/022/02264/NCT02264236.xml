	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide mimotope-based vaccine, in patients of all races with stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer who have completed their primary chemotherapy without progressing, and who still have measurable residual disease. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is designed with the goal being to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine. Efficacy will be based primarily on the tumor response, and secondarily on progression-free survival. Information on safety and tolerability will be collected. Humoral and cellular immune responses will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
