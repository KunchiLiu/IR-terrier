	<brief_summary>The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ODM-203 in subjects with advanced solid tumours and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of ODM-203 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety profile of ODM-203 will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with ODM-203 to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties of ODM 203 will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels</detailed_description>
