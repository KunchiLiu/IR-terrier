	<brief_title>Severe Obesity Outcome Network Cohort (SOON)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult obese patients, attempting a tertiary medical center for the management of their obesity, are asked to participate in a cohort study. Data issued from routine clinical practice are collected. Medical history and actual medical condition: - Type 2 or type 1 diabetes - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - Cardiovascular diseases - Steatohepatitis/cirrhosis - Gastric disorders - Nutritional deficiency - Obstructive sleep apnea/Obesity hypoventilation syndrome All patients who do not have a previously known sleep apnea syndrome are evaluated by nocturnal polygraphy. Lifestyle and sleep habits, as well as social and economic characteristics, are assessed by questionnaires. Patients are asked to provide blood sample to constituate a serum bank and gene bank. Patients are asked, if undergoing bariatric surgery, to provide subcutaneous and visceral fat. When patients benefit from bariatric surgery, follow-up data are collected at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after bariatric surgery and yearly after that for at least 5 years.</detailed_description>
