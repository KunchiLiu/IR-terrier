	<brief_summary>In women being treated with medicines to help eggs to grow (called ovulation induction), The investigators wish to know whether adding medicines (called ovulation triggers) that help to release the egg (ovulation) would lead to more women having babies without causing harm compared with not giving them ovulation triggers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin &amp; Trigger</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women will be treated with clomiphene citrate to help eggs to develop to additionally receive a medicine (urinary hCG) to trigger their release or to receive no additional treatment. the investigators tried to determine the benefits and harms of administering an ovulation trigger to anovulatory women receiving treatment with ovulation-inducing agents in comparison with spontaneous ovulation following ovulation induction. so we will have comparison between 2 groups, group 1 will receive clomiphene citrate and trigger ovulation by human chorionic gonadotrophin and group 2 will receive clomiphene citrate with no drug to trigger ovulation.</detailed_description>
