	<brief_title>Fat-induced Release of GLP-1 in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A structured triglyceride (1,3-di-octanoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, called C8-diet oil), which upon digestion results in generation of two medium-chain fatty acids and 2-oleoyl-glycerol (2-OG), may lead to activation of GPR119 only, since medium fatty acids are poor agonists for fatty acid receptors.</detailed_description>
