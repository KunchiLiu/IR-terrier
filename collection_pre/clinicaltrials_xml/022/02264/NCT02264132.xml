	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study were to investigate relative BA at steady state and to investigate dose proportionality of pharmacokinetic parameters Relative BA at steady state: - Pramipexole 0.375 mg ER tablet q.d. versus pramipexole 0.125 mg IR tablet t.i.d. - Pramipexole 1.5 mg ER tablet q.d. versus pramipexole 0.5 mg IR tablet t.i.d. Dose proportionality of pharmacokinetic parameters: · Pramipexole ER dosages from 0.375 to 1.5 mg q.d.</brief_summary>
