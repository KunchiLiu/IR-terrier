	<brief_summary>The duration and adverse events of non-cuffed catheter in patients with hemodialysis will be investigated by multicenter prospective cohort. Totally, 1,400 patients with chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis will be enrolled. 900 patients will be given right internal jugular catheterization, and the other 500 patients unsuitable for right internal jugular catheterization will receive femoral catheterizations. Every patient will be followed-up for six months. During following-up period, the duration time and adverse events of non-cuffed catheter will be recorded in details, including inadequate hemodialysis blood flow, venous stenosis, venous thrombosis, infection, catheter thrombosis and so on. The central vein will be evaluated by CT Angiography to identify its stenosis at last visit after 6 months. This multicentre trial will provide evidence to develop guideline for duration time of using non-cuffed catheter.</brief_summary>
