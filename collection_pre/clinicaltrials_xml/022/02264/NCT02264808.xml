	<detailed_description>Children born with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) and already enrolled in IRB #504-2011 will be seen for a developmental follow-up at 18-20 months of age. The developmental assessment tool that will be used is called the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development: 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) Screening Test. The results of this test will then be compared to the child's HIE biomarkers concentrations already obtained at birth.</detailed_description>
