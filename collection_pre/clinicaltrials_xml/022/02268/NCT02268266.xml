	<brief_title>ERIGOÂ® Life- Control of Cardiovascular Parameters Via Verticalization and Simultaneous Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In early rehabilitation of neurological patients, safe mobilization and intensive sensorimotor stimulation are key factors for therapeutic success. Early activation and stimulation of the patient intend enhancement of neuroplasticity and recovery. Furthermore, it improves the patient's communication and cooperation skills and counteracts secondary damages due to immobilization. The study combines gradual verticalization during monitoring of vital parameters, with cyclic leg movement and foot loading. The table to ensures the necessary safety for the stabilization of the patient in the upright position. The patient stimulation is additionally enhanced by synchronized functional electrical stimulation (FES). By providing a safe solution for early mobilization, the Erigo counteracts the negative effects of immobility and accelerates the recovery process through intensive sensorimotor stimulation. It is the first choice therapy device for the early and safe mobilization of severely impaired, bed-ridden patients even in acute care.</detailed_description>
