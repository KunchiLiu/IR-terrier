	<brief_title>Correlating In Vitro Fertilization Outcomes After Euploid Blastocyst Transfer With Sperm DNA Fragmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if sperm DNA fragmentation is associated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes when euploid embryos are transferred. Euploid embryos are those that have a complete set of chromosomes (46, XX or 46, XY). Sperm DNA fragmentation refers to sperm DNA that is damaged or has an altered structure. The sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) is a method to evaluate sperm DNA Fragmentation. Couples will undergo a routine IVF cycle at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey. Semen specimens collected on the day of ICSI will undergo semen analysis as per routine. An aliquot of semen (0.5- 1mL) will be collected for subsequent evaluation of DNA fragmentation by the Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay (SCSA) testing at SCSA Diagnostics. All embryo biopsies will undergo CCS analysis in the genomics laboratory, Foundation for Assessment and Enhancement of Embryonic Competence.</detailed_description>
