	<brief_summary>Study A536-05 is an open-label extension study for patients previously enrolled in study A536-03 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01749514), to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ACE-536 in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACE-536 Extension Study - Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study A536-05 is an open-label extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects of up to 24 months of ACE-536 treatment in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes previously treated with ACE-536 for up to 3 months in study A536-03 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01749514). The starting dose level in study A536-05 will be 1.0 mg/kg by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 3 weeks. Dose titration/modification rules will be followed for individual patients and will be based upon safety and efficacy data collected during the course of treatment.</detailed_description>

Patients must have completely recovered from any previous surgery prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Known positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active infectious hepatitis B (HBV) or active infectious hepatitis C (HCV) Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mm Hg Pregnant or lactating females History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational drug Any other condition not specifically noted above which, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude the patient from participating in the study</criteria>
