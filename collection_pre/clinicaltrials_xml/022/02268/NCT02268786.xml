	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effect of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) by next generation sequencing (NGS) compared to standard morphological assessment of embryos on pregnancy rates through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). All embryos will be vitrified and a single embryo transfer (SET) will be performed with either screened or unscreened embryos depending on randomization.</brief_summary>
