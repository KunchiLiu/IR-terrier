IE 18: Subject who is susceptible to not comply with dietary qualitative restriction during the study period. IE 19: Vulnerable subjects defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in the clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate.
