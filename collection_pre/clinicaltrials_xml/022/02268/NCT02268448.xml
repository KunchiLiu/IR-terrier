	<brief_title>Atopic Dermatitis Itch</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will serve as a pilot study to determine the efficacy and safety of two novel oral agents (clonidine, naltrexone) in the treatment of chronic, non-experimentally induced itch in atopic dermatitis. In this study, eight subjects with symptomatic atopic dermatitis will be recruited and treated with either oral clonidine (four subjects) or oral naltrexone (four subjects) . Disease burden will be evaluated before and after 4 weeks of treatment through reporting of subjective symptomatology via surveys/questionnaire, neurometer study, and clinical assessment.</detailed_description>

Use of chronic pain medications (including opioids, antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs) 3. History of radiation or chemotherapy 4. History of traumatic injury on perspective test sites 5. Use of hormonereplacement medication within six weeks prior to the study start to avoid any confounding influence on sensory and pain perception (Fillingim &amp; Edwards, 2001). 6.
