	<brief_summary>Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a frequent and severe disease with an annual incidence of about 75000 cases in France and a short-term mortality rate of about 10%. Death is usually related to an acute right ventricular (RV) failure due to the increase in right ventricular afterload. Treatment of PE with RV failure consists in fluid expansion and thrombolysis in case of shock. However several studies suggest that fluid expansion may worsen acute RV failure by increasing RV dilatation and ischemia and left ventricular compression by RV dilatation. Thus, current guidelines regarding PE treatment remain unclear about the use of fluid expansion. In a preliminary study published by our group, we showed that diuretic treatment in the setting of PE with RV dilatation is safe and is associated with an increase in urine output, a decrease in heart rate and an increase in SpO2 in normotensive patients with oliguria. This may be related to the decrease of ventricular interdependence and enhancement of both LV and RV function. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the 24-hours clinical benefit of furosemide in patients referred for acute PE with RV dilatation compared to placebo. The combination of urine output and sPESI clinical parameters reflects hemodynamic status. It is relevant as it indicates the disappearance of pre-shock symptoms and is therefore associated with a lower event risk. Thus, it allows early discharge of the patients from the intensive care unit.</brief_summary>
