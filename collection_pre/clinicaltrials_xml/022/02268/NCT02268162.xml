	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the value of different bronchoscopy combination for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions suspected to be cancer. One-third of participants will receive routine bronchoscopy, while one-third of participants will receive bronchoscopy combined with a guiding equipment and the other one-third of participants will receive bronchoscopy combined with two or more guiding equipments. These guiding equipments include virtual bronchoscopic navigation(VBN), endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath(EBUS-GS) and fluoroscopy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible subjects are adults with solitary peripheral pulmonary lesions (mean diameter, ≤30mm and &gt;8mm from axial CT images) suspected to be cancer but were not pathologically confirmed. Patient has dysrhythmia or cardiovascular disease that poses a risk during exercise. Patient has uncontrollable hypertension (SBP &gt; 180mmHg). Patient has severe organ dysfunction (shock, severe hepatic and renal dysfunction, massive hemorrhage of upper gastrointestine, diffuse intravascular coagulation(DIC) and massive hemoptysis,etc). Patient has blood coagulation disorders (PT&gt;2 times the upper limit of normal(ULN) or Platelet(PLT)&lt;50000/ul）. Patient has severe dyspnea. Patient is allergic to local anesthetic. Patient is unable to provide informed consent. Patient is not an appropriate candidate for of is unable to tolerate flexible bronchoscopy procedures. Patient has any disease or condition that interferes with completion of initial or followup assessments of the effectiveness endpoints. Patient has demonstrated unwillingness or inability to complete screening or baseline data collection procedures. Patient participated in a study of an investigational drug or device within the past 30 days prior to participation in this study, or is currently participating in another clinical study. Female patient of childbearing potential has a positive result from a pregnancy test.</criteria>
