	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of CSJ148 in Stem Cell Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. 80 Patients will be enrolled and randomized to CSJ148 and placebo in a ratio of 3:1. Patients undergoing stem cell transplantation will be enrolled into the study. The study will consist of a screening period, a baseline visit, approximately 3-month treatment exposure period, an end-of-therapy visit, a follow-up period, and a study completion evaluation approximately 3.5 months after the last dose of study drug is administered.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male and female patients at least 18 years of age scheduled to undergo allogeneic bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood transplantation and begin conditioning chemotherapy within 2448 hours of planned dosing day. Subject seropositive for HCMV before transplantation; donor can be seropositive or seronegative for HCMV (donor positive/recipient positive or donor negative/recipient positive). Have had HCMVrelated organ disease within 6 months prior to enrollment. Detectable HCMV infection (positive pp65 antigenemia or plasma HCMV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays prior to enrollment Received any of the following within 30 days prior to enrollment: ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, acyclovir (&gt;25 mg/kg/day IV), valacyclovir (&gt;3 gm/day oral), famciclovir (&gt;1500 mg/day oral), HCMV immune globulin, immune globulin (&gt;500 mg/kg), or any other medication with antiHCMV activity. Require mechanical ventilation within 7 days prior to enrollment. Received any vasopressors or other agents for hemodynamic support within 7 days prior to enrollment.
