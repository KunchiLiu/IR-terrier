	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the Harvesting Health Program in improving the diet and physical activity level of cancer survivors. Nutrition and physical activity classes and the opportunity to harvest fruits, vegetables, and herbs may increase participants' fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity levels. Studying the participation rates and changes in participants' eating and physical activity habits may help doctors learn whether the program has an effect on participant lifestyle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Harvesting Health Program in Improving Diet and Physical Activity Level in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Measure survivor participation in regards to each aspect of the Harvesting Health Program (personalized and group education, gardening and harvesting, and utilization of novel web-based technologies). II. Assess survivor preferences regarding key Harvesting Health Program components impacting participation (physical facilities, schedule and timing, education topics and sessions, garden access, web portal usability, etc.). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. A customized "Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecard" has been developed and will be implemented to evaluate pre/post measures of diet and physical activity at baseline (month 0) and at months 6, 9 and 12. II. Participants are evaluated at baseline and at completion of the intervention for: (a) serum and body composition biomarkers of exposure and efficacy, and (b) health indices related to cancer survivorship and overall health. III. To assess Program sustainability, follow-up questionnaires will be completed at 9 and 12 months using the Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity Scorecard and questionnaires regarding quality of life outcomes. OUTLINE: Participants undergo a series of 10 education and training sessions over 1 hour every 2 weeks, comprising education on current research, evidence-based health guidelines, application techniques, reference materials specific to extended-stage cancer survivors, and recommendations and personal health goals for survivorship.</detailed_description>
