	<detailed_description>a 24-week phase 3, multi-center clinical trial, comprised of a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period ("Randomized Period"), followed by an 8-week open-label safety extension period, where all subjects receive KRX-0502 (ferric citrate) ("Extension Period"). The study will consist of 14 clinic visits over a period of 24 weeks. There will be a screening period of up to 14 days; Approximately 230 subjects will be randomized into the Randomized Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive either KRX-0502 or matching placebo, at baseline</detailed_description>

Subjects with known allergic reaction to previous oral iron therapy 15. Previous intolerance to oral ferric citrate 16. Psychiatric disorder that interferes with the subject's ability to comply with the study protocol 17. Planned surgery or hospitalization (anticipated to last &gt;72 hours) during the randomized period of the trial other than dialysis access related surgery. 18. Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the PI, renders the subject unable to or unlikely to complete the trial or that would interfere with optimal participation in the trial or produce significant risk to the subject 19.
