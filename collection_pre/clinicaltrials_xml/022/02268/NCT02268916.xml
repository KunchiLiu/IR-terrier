	<brief_title>Physical Activity and Participation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity is the cornerstone of good diabetes management, and yet effective physical activity intervention is not available. The investigators developed a lifestyle intervention based on individual's home activity patterns. The goal of the study is to test the efficacy of this intervention among Veterans with diabetes in a randomized-controlled trial. In addition to physical activity, the investigators will also assess if the intervention will improve social participation among Veterans.</detailed_description>
