	<brief_summary>Study of RTXM83 plus CHOP chemotherapy versus a rituximab plus CHOP therapy in patients with Non Hodgkin's lymphoma The primary endpoint of the investigation is to determine if the response rate obtained with RXM83 combined with CHOP is non inferior to the response rate obtained with reference rituximab combined with CHOP The present study is a non inferiority trial and the study hypothesis is the following: H0: pc ≥ pe + δ vs. H1: pc &lt; pe + δ where, pe: proportion of successes in the experimental group (RTXM83+CHOP) pc: proportion of successes in the control group (Reference Rituximab+CHOP) Type I error: the difference pc-pe is less than δ when in fact the difference is greater than or equal to δ ie, the investigators choose the experimental treatment when the control treatment is actually substantially better. Type II error: the difference -pe is greater than or equal to δ when it is actually lest than δ ie, the investigators choose the control treatment when the experimental treatment is essentially just as good.</brief_summary>
