	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, prospective interventional study of pregnant patients presenting to the emergency department with complaints of pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding. This study will be conducted at 4 sites across the United States. Patients who are eligible and consent to participate will be randomized to one of two conditions; 1) a pelvic ultrasound that is performed by a certified emergency department attending or physician, or 2) a pelvic ultrasound that is performed by a certified radiology technician (standard-of-care). The time to diagnosis and emergency department length of stay between the two groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
