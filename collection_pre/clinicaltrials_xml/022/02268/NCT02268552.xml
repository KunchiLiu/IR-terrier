	<brief_summary>An open-label, multi-part, first-in-human study of oral LMI070 in infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy after 13 weeks; and to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and optimal dosing regimen of orally administered LMI070 in patients with Type 1 SMA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Study of LMI070 in Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-part, first-in-human, proof of concept study in infants with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy who have exactly 2 copies of SMN2, to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of oral LMI070 after 13 weeks treatment. Parts 1 and 2 are intended to be non-confirmatory. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be dosed once weekly with LMI070. The LMI070 dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts until MTD is determined or when sufficient PK results confirm that the MTD cannot be reached due to a potential pharmacokinetic plateau at higher doses. A decision to dose escalate the next cohort will be made after safety data have been collected for 14 days following the first dose (14-day DLT window). PK will be used to confirm that there is no accumulation of the compound. Part 2 of the study will enroll new patients into one of up to 3 dosing regimens (depending on the results of Part 1) for 12 weeks. Patients who complete the first 13 weeks of Part 1 and are, in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor benefiting and/or tolerating LMI070, may continue treatment with higher doses of LMI070 that have been shown to be well tolerated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained from the parent / guardian before any assessment is performed. Type 1 SMA, diagnosed clinically, with symptom onset &lt;6 months of age and genetic confirmation of mutations in both alleles of the SMN1 gene, and with SMN2 copy number of 2. Best supportive care in place and stable for at least 14 days before screening. Age at screening between 1 and 7 months Must be able to demonstrate antigravity strength in both biceps. Must have or agree to have placement of feeding tube for enteral access via nasogastric (NG), nasojejunal (NJ), percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG), or percutaneous jejunostomy (PEJ) tube for dosing LMI070 (Part 1 only and for patients who cannot be administered orally ; tube may be removed between doses). At birth gestational age &gt;32 weeks and body weight at birth &gt;2 kg. Must live within 2 hours drive of study center. Clearance should be obtained from the site investigator and sponsor if the patient resides more than 2 hours ground travel from the study center Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits; and parent or guardian/subject has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the Site Investigator. Use of other investigational drugs within 14 days. Neurologic, or neuromuscular conditions other than SMA. Anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia Hepatic dysfunction Age adjusted renal dysfunction Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters, as assessed by the Site Investigator, at screening that would render the subject unsuitable for inclusion Intractable seizure disorder (other than inactive febrile seizures). Persistent (in the opinion of the Investigator) hypoxemia (O2 saturation awake &lt;92% or O2 saturation asleep &lt;91%, without ventilation support) or requiring oral suctioning &gt;2 per day, or presence of a tracheostomy. Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic antiviral or antimicrobial therapy at any time during the screening period. Current diagnosis of cardiac and/or vascular abnormalities or ECG abnormalities (such as long QT, heart block or Torsade's) indicating significant risk of safety for infant patients participating in the study such as: Concomitant clinically significant pediatric cardiac arrhythmias, e.g. sustained ventricular tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree AV block Prohibited Concomitant Medications Excluding SMA, any medically unstable condition including cardiomyopathy, hepatic dysfunction, kidney disorder, endocrine disorder, GI disorders, prematurity of &lt;32 weeks gestation, metabolic disorders, severe respiratory compromise and significant brain abnormalities or injuries including hypoxicischemic encephalopathy. Acute or ongoing medical condition that, according to the Site Investigator and discussed with sponsor, would interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical disability other than SMA that would interfere with the assessment of safety or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures including be assessed by CHOP INTEND motor scale, changes in hematologic parameters or gastrointestinal dysfunction that would compromise the ability of adequate assessment of safety.</criteria>
