	<brief_summary>Autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from a portion of the fat harvested from the patient's front abdominal wall. ADRC will be administered one-time intraarticularly. This is a single arm study with no control. All patients receive cell therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Safety of Autologous ADRC for Treatment of Degenerative Damage of Knee Articular Cartilage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with verified diagnosis knee joint osteoarthritis (degenerative damage of knee articular cartilage) will undergo knee arthroscopic debridement. 28 days later patients will will undergo liposuction from front abdominal wall under local anesthesia. After that autologous ADRC will be extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from harvested adipose tissue. Extracted ADRC will be administered one-time intraarticularly.</detailed_description>
