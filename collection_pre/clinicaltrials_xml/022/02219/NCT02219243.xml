	<brief_summary>A substantial number of children with social anxiety fail to gain benefit from contemporary cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) approaches. More novel treatment approaches for treatment of social anxiety are needed. The current study attempts to modify an interpretation style that is characteristic of children who also display high anxiety in social situations. Participants between the ages of 8-12 years old, with social anxiety, will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: two conditions are designed to manipulate the interpretation bias or a wait-list control condition. All study procedures will be conducted online. This study will help develop an effective cognitive intervention program for social anxiety in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interpretive Biases in Children With Social Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study aims to test the effectiveness of computer-based interpretation bias modification training as a therapeutic intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Individuals who experience social anxiety often have difficulty in engaging in social situations, such as speaking in front of a group and maintaining a conversation. For youngsters, this may take the form of avoidance, including avoiding situations such as raising one's hand in class, eating in front of other people and participating in small group activities. Additionally, those with social anxiety are more likely to interpret ambiguous social scenarios in a threatening way than are control subjects (Bogels, Snieder, &amp; Kindt, 2003; Miers, Blote, Bogels, &amp; Westenberg, 2008; Vassilopoulos &amp; Banerjee, 2008; Vassilopoulos, 2006; Muris, Meckelbach, &amp; Damsma, 2000). Research has shown that interpretation biases are modifiable at a young age (Muris, Huijding, Mayer, &amp; Hameetman, 2008; Vassilopoulous, Bangerjee, Prantzalou, 2009; Muris, Huijding, Mayer, Remmerswaal, &amp; Vreden, 2009; Lothmann, Holmes, Chan, &amp; Lau, 2010). Participants between the ages of 8-12 years old, with social anxiety, will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: two conditions are designed to manipulate the interpretation bias or a wait-list control condition. All study procedures will be conducted online. Subjects do not need to come to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to participate. Thirty children with social anxiety will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions, and will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. The waitlisted participants will also be invited to undergo the training program after the 1-month follow-up assessment is completed. This study is expected to generate important data that will guide the development of an accessible, cost-efficient, and effective cognitive intervention for individuals suffering from social anxiety.</detailed_description>
