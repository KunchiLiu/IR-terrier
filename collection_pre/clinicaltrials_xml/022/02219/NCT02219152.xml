	<brief_summary>Bleeding during transbronchial ro endobronchial biopsy is rather a common complication. Mostly this is an insignificant bleeding, but in 3% of the biopsies there is a substantial amount of bleeding that requires a special treatment or follow up. The goal of this study is to examine whether submission of tranexamic acid during the biopsy could diminish the amount of bleeding.</brief_summary>
