	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications: dolutegravir, elvitegravir and cobicistat in blood after the drug intake has been stopped in order to understand how long these drugs persist in the blood. The study will specifically look at blood levels of these three drugs after taking them every day for 10 days dolutegravir on a first stage and a combination of elitegravir and cobicistat in a second stage. If the participant decides to take part, the duration of the study will be up to 38 days plus a screening visit which will take place up to 28 days prior to the start of the study, and a follow up visit which takes place 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication. This study is not randomised which means that all participants will receive all study medications in the same order. The participant and the study doctor will know which study medications the participant is taking at all times during the study.</brief_summary>
