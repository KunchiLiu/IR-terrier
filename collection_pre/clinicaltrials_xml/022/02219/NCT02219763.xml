	<brief_title>The Effects of a Weight Management Program on Body Weight and Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate weight change and quality of life among individuals after completion of a 12-week comprehensive group weight management program. Findings from this study will also help with program development and improvement within our center. The already established weight management program is called Healthy Habits for Life (HHL) and includes a total of 14 visits (one individual visit both before and after the 12 group sessions). All patients who are enrolled in the Healthy Habits for Life group program at the Weight Center have an individual visit with a registered dietitian prior to beginning the group as part of standard care. At this visit the dietitian will obtain informed consent for participation in the research study and provide subjects consenting to participate in the study with the IWQOL-lite quality of life questionnaire. After completion of the 12 HHL group sessions, all patients at the Weight Center have another individual visit with the dietitian to review weight and behavior changes since the initial evaluation. At this visit, subjects participating in the research study will again be provided with the IWQOL-lite questionnaire to fill out.</detailed_description>
