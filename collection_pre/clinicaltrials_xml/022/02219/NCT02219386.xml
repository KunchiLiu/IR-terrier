	<brief_title>Dry Needling of the Trapezius Muscle in Office Workers With Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EVALUATION: A blind assesor does a complete evaluation of the patients to determine if they take part of the study. An assesment of pain (by visual analogue scale), Pain pressure theshold (kg/cm2 by algometry, Range of motion (CROM goniometer in degrees) and strength (digital dinamometry in Newtons) are performed. In this evaluation inclusion criteria is checked too. INTERVENTION: -TREATMENT GROUP(Deep dry needling group (DDN)): An experienced physical therapist performed this treatment. The intervention included DDN of every active MTrP found in the trapezius muscle using a 4 cm x 0.32 mm acupuncture needle with guided tube. ). In the case of upper trapezius active MTrPs, DDN was performed in the prone position. For medium and lower trapezius muscle MTrPs, DDN was performed in a side-lying position as described by Simons et al. (Simons et al., 1999). Once the needle was inserted into the MTrP previously marked by the blinded assessor, local twitch responses (LTRs) were obtained by using Hong's fast-in and fast-out technique, which involves rapid movements of the needle in and out of the MTrP. After that, the stretch is performed - Passive stretch of the trapezius muscle (both groups) Another experienced physical therapist, after taking part of training-sesions to do the same stretch as in DDN group, performed the stretch.Participants in this group received the same stretch as patients in treatment group.</detailed_description>
