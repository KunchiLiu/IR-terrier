	<brief_summary>A new Magnetic-controlled Capsule Endoscopy (MCE) was developed by ANKON and got SFDA's approval in China in 2013. It has recently been evaluated to compare the diagnostic accuracy of MCE with that of standard gastroscopy for gastric diseases in 70 patients with encouraging results (In Press). To further testify the diagnostic accuracy of MCE for both the diffuse and focal diseases in stomach, we performed this single-blinded multi-center prospective study compared MCE with gastroscopy in patients with gastric symptoms and indication for upper GI Endoscopy.</brief_summary>
