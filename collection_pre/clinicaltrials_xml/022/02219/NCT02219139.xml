	<brief_title>A Comparative, Randomized, Prospective, Performance Evaluation of Abutments in Single Tooth Gaps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One study abutment per patient will be placed. After healing for 6 to 7 weeks, patients will be asked to stop oral hygiene at the study site for 2 weeks. Sulcus fluid and plaque samples will be taken at the abutment site at several visits before and during abdication of oral hygiene. The study finishes with biopsy visit. Afterwards a regular abutment will be placed and the patients will be treated according to the standard protocol of the clinic to obtain their final restoration</detailed_description>
