	<brief_summary>Electronic noses detecting patterns of volatile molecules have recently been introduced for different diagnostic purposes. The diagnostic accuracy of a prototype e-nose device (Bruins et al (2013) in Bangladesh showed sensitivity of 76.5-95.9% and specificity of 85.3-98.5%. Here the investigators test a production type point-of-care hand-held device with less detectors. The investigators explore factors such as food intake, smoking, and co-morbidity, as well as the impact of TB treatment, and address the question whether the device could help monitor disease and response to treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study participants provide WIC and after time for consideration, when they approve, provide demographic anonymized data. The study population consists of six groups: Group 1 - 20 TB patients aged &gt; 18 yrs Group 2 - 20 non--‚ÄêTB patients &gt; 18 yrs (screened for TB - other conditions) Group 3 - 20 patients with a lung disease - no TB suspects (Lung Clinics in Yogyakarta,Indonesia; Group 4 - 50 apparently healthy matched controls Group 5 - 20 newly diagnosed TB patients enrolled before start of treatment, to be followed over time, until after end of treatment (8 months FU). Group 6 - 50 apparently healthy volunteers. Study participants breath normally by mouthpiece into the device using a nose clamp - for 5 min during each sampling. Electronic data are downloaded and transmitted by internet to Zutphen, Netherlands where data are processed to build the model.</detailed_description>
