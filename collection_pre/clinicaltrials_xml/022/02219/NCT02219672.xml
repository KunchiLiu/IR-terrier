	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective trial which will recruit 18 patients in acute HIV-1 infection phase. This study aims to evaluate the effects and side effects of ARV treatment in Chinese patients in acute HIV-1 infection phase, and to evaluate the impact of Triptolide wilfordii on HIV-1 reservoir.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Impact of Triptolide Woldifiion on HIV-1 Reservoir In Acute HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two arms will be enrolled in this study, 18 naive-treatment Chinese patients in acute HIV-1 infection phase would be allocated to two arms, and treated with the antiretroviral drugs (Tenofovir plus lamivudine plus Lopinavir / ritonavir plus raltegravir). Six months later, 12 patients will be treated with Triplitode, in order to observe the impact of of Triptolide wilfordii on HIV-1 reservoir of patients in acute infection phase. All patients should be explored for 18 months in terms of the clinical features, drugs side-effects, and immunological and viral response, and the HIV-1 reservoir. We hypothesis that Triptolide wilfordii might further reduce the HIV-1 reservoir. The result would provide proofs for further practical antiviral therapy for patients in acute infection phase in China or other resource limited countries.</detailed_description>
