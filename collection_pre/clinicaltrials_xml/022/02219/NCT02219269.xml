	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a prospective observational cohort study to investigate factors that influence contraceptive method utilization among women with medical conditions. The investigators will also investigate how women with medical conditions access to contraception and family planning fellowship trained specialist. After the baseline questionnaire, there be a 3 month and 6 month follow up questionnaire to investigate continuation and satisfaction with the contraceptive method. This study is unique because it will allow us to explore doing collaborative family planning research at the multiple UC medical campuses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Complex Contraception Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many women with complex medical conditions who do not desire pregnancy do not receive contraception counseling from their primary or subspecialty care clinicians, and often they are not using contraception. This is an important deficiency as many have conditions that could worsen with pregnancy or for whom pregnancy can be complicated by the medical condition. Thus it is important for women with chronic disease to only become pregnant if they intend to do so. The United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (USMEC), released in 2010, has greatly enhanced the ability of clinicians to counsel patient with complex medical conditions about their contraceptive options. It summarizes the safety of specific contraceptives when used on women with medical conditions. However, little is known about the contraceptive care of these women. We do not know if the availability of the USMEC has translated into evidence-based contraceptive counseling for these women. Further, little is known about their understanding of the interaction between their disease and pregnancy, their past experience and knowledge about contraception, and their contraceptive decision-making, satisfaction and continuation. The purpose of the Complex Contraception Registry to is to recruit a cohort of women with complex medical conditions who are seen in contraception referral practices run by family planning fellowship trained physicians. We will assess their past experiences and baseline knowledge, their post-counseling experiences and choice of contraception, and their long-term satisfaction with and continuation of contraception. A multi-center registry is necessary because individual institutions see relatively few women with rare diseases such as a history of transplant surgery. The UC Family Planning Collaborative will facilitate recruitment of participants from the 5 UC medical campuses and will oversee their follow-up for one year. Specific Aim include (1.) To investigate what factors influence contraceptive method utilization among women with complex medical conditions and their perceived risk of unintended pregnancy (2) To investigate how women with complex medical conditions access family planning fellowship trained specialist for contraception counseling and (3.) To assess satisfaction and continuation of contraceptive methods among women with complex medical conditions.</detailed_description>
