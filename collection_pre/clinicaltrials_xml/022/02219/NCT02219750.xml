	<brief_title>Comparison of Premixed Insulin With Basal-plus Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 24-week, prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in approximately 140 patients with type 2 diabetes from Mackay Memorial Hospitals and Mackay Memorial Hospital Taitung branch. After enrollment, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Basal-plus therapy(BPT) or Preprandial premix therapy(PPT). The effectiveness of advancing insulin therapy will be assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of study prescription. The safety will be followed during the 24-week study period. All study procedure will be conducted after obtaining informed consent.</detailed_description>
