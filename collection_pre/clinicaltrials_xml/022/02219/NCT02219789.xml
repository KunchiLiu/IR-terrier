	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib when given together with fulvestrant in treating patients with hormone positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes and cannot be removed by surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen and progesterone are type of hormones made by the body and they can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen or progesterone the body makes. Giving alisertib together with fulvestrant may be a better treatment for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib and Fulvestrant in Treating Patients With Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer That is Metastatic or Locally Advanced and Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the safety and tolerability of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant. II. To examine tumor response in postmenopausal women treated with alisertib in combination with fulvestrant. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess aurora A kinase expression in archived breast cancer tissue biospecimens of participants, and to describe levels in those who do or do not experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or objective response. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib. Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 (days 1 and 15 of course 1 only) and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic proof of metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive and/or progesterone positive per institutional standards Nonmeasurable or measurable disease Postmenopausal women, as verified by: Post bilateral surgical oophorectomy, or No spontaneous menses &gt;= 1 year, or No menses for &lt; 1 year with folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels in postmenopausal range, according to institutional standards Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/mm^3 Platelet (PLT) &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine transaminase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x ULN (=&lt; 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement) Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 gm/dL Calculated creatinine clearance must be &gt;= 45 ml/min using the CockcroftGault formula Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1 Ability to provide informed written consent Willing to return to enrolling institution for followup (during the active monitoring phase of the study) Life expectancy &gt;= 4 months Willing to provide tissue samples for research purposes Prior therapies: All women: at least one prior line of hormonal therapy for de novo disease (stage IV metastatic at diagnosis, no prior adjuvant therapy) or relapse &gt; 1 year after completion of adjuvant therapy; relapse on adjuvant hormonal therapy will count as the one prior line of therapy All women: at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy in the adjuvant and/or metastatic setting, but not more than 2 regimens in the metastatic setting Capable of swallowing tablets Known standard therapy for the patient's disease that is potentially curative or definitely capable of extending life expectancy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Any of the following prior therapies: Chemotherapy =&lt; 21 days prior to registration Mitomycin C/nitrosoureas =&lt; 42 days prior to registration Immunotherapy =&lt; 28 days prior to registration Biologic therapy =&lt; 28 days prior to registration Radiation therapy =&lt; 21 days prior to registration Radiation to &gt; 25% of bone marrow prior to registration Hormonal therapy =&lt; 14 days prior to registration Failure to recover to grade =&lt; 1 from acute, reversible effects of prior chemotherapy regardless of interval since last treatment Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases NOTE: metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy and patients have been neurologically stable and off of steroids &gt; 12 weeks are eligible Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational (utilized for a nonFood and Drug Administration [FDA]approved indication and in the context of a research investigation) Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: patients known to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are eligible for this trial Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for the primary neoplasm Other active malignancy =&lt;
