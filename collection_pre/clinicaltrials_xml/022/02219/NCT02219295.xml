	<brief_summary>We investigate the impact of taste receptors (sweet, bitter and umami) on human metabolism. There ist growing evidence, that components of the taste signalling system, including the taste receptor proteins , have important functions in the regulation of metabolic parameters in non-gustatory tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SEGATROM: Sensory and Gastrointestinal Impact of Taste Receptor Variants on Human Metabolism and Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We apply different sweet, bitter and umami taste compounds in a single dose in the human intervention. We use substances as for instance glucose, sucrose,saccharin and lactisol in the sweet part, and substances from cabbage, beer or red endive in the bitter part. For umami we take glutamate. Blood samples are collected at baseline and 6 times thereafter up to 3hours, to analyse the incretins GLP-1(glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP(gastrointestinal polypeptide) and other peptide hormones as insulin and PYY(peptide tyrosin trosin) in human beings. Gastrointestinal mucosa is taken by gastroscopy from the lower duodenum from study subjects for analysis for the presence or absence of functional taste receptors in gastrointestinal tissues.</detailed_description>
