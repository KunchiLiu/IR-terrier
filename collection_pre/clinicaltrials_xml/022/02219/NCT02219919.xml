	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial will investigate changes in pain intensity and nociceptive gain processing after the application of either physical therapy or surgery in women with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The purpose of this study will be to determine changes in pain intensity, widespread pressure pain sensitivity and segmental thermal changes after the application of a physical therapy program based on desensitization maneuvers of the central nervous system or endoscopic surgery in women with CTS at medium and long-term follow-up periods. We hypothesize that the physical therapy intervention targeted to desensitization of the central nervous system is more effective than surgical intervention for modulating altered nociceptive gain processing in women with CTS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nociceptive Gain Processing After Physical Therapy in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is increasing evidence suggesting that carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) represents a complex pain syndrome including both peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms. In fact, patients with unilateral CTS exhibit bilateral widespread pressure hyperalgesia and bilateral pain hypersensitivity suggesting the presence of altered nociceptive gain processing. In addition, these sensitization processes seem to be independent of electro-diagnostic findings. Previous studies support the use of physical therapy and surgical interventions for the management of pain and disability in these patients. However, there is no evidence related to changes in nociceptive gain process after the application of any therapeutic intervention. Preliminary evidence suggests that manual therapies can modulate sensitization mechanisms. Therefore, our objective is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to determine if manual therapies including desensitization maneuvers of the central nervous system are effective to decrease widespread pressure pain and thermal pain hypersensitivity in women with CTS.</detailed_description>
