	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Dasabuvir in Adults With Genotype 1b Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/ paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir administered for 12 weeks in HCV genotype 1b (GT1b)-infected, treatment-na√Øve and previous pegylated interferon (pegIFN)/ ribavirin (RBV) treatment-experienced adults with compensated cirrhosis. The duration of the study was up to 36 weeks (not including a screening period of up to 42 days) and consisted of a 12-week Treatment Period and a 24-week Post-Treatment Period for all participants who received study drugs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Chronic HCV genotype 1infection prior to study enrollment. Chronic HCVinfection is defined as the following: Positive for antiHCV antibody (Ab) or HCV RNA &gt; 1,000 IU/mL at least 6 months before Screening, and positive for HCV RNA and antiHCV Ab at the time of Screening; or HCV RNA &gt; 1,000 IU/mL at the time of Screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCVinfection (or a liver biopsy performed prior to enrollment with evidence of chronic hepatitis C disease). 2. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1binfection. 3. Compensated cirrhosis defined as a ChildPugh Score of 5 or 6 at Screening. 1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Positive test result for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody (confirmed by Western Blot). 3. Any current or past clinical evidence of ChildPugh B or C classification or clinical history of liver decompensation such as ascites (noted on physical exam), variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy. 4. Confirmed presence of hepatocellular carcinoma indicated on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to Screening or on an ultrasound performed at Screening (a positive ultrasound result will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.) 5. Use of contraindicated medications within 2 weeks of dosing 6. Screening laboratory analyses showing any of the following abnormal laboratory results: Calculated creatinine clearance (using CockcroftGault method) &lt; 30 mL/min Albumin &lt; 2.8 g/dL International normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.8. Participants with a known inherited blood disorder and INR &gt; 1.8 may be enrolled with permission of the AbbVie Study Designated Physician. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL Platelets &lt; 25,000 cells per mm3 Total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/dL</criteria>
