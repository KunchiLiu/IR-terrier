	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of two small doses of intravenous (IV) steroids around the time of knee replacement surgery decrease a patient's pain or use of pain medication. The investigators will also determine if the subjects receiving the steroid will have better pain control and better postoperative outcomes after their surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adequate pain control after total knee replacement (TKA) is of great importance not only to maximize patient comfort, but also to ensure optimal outcomes after surgery. This study is designed to assess whether the use of two small doses of intravenous (IV) steroids around the time of surgery decrease a patient's pain or use of pain medication. Secondly, the investigators will also determine if the use of these steroids as part of a multimodal pain management strategy leads to improved patient outcomes, including pain, nausea and vomiting, knee function and length of stay in the hospital after surgery. The study will compare the effect of two different doses of IV dexamethasone given preoperatively before TKA, when compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
