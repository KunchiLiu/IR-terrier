	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the reaction time (as measured by braking reaction time in seconds during simulated driving) under glare and no-glare conditions in subjects implanted with ACRYSOF® IQ intraocular lenses (IOLs) to subjects implanted with clear IOLs. This study will enroll subjects previously implanted with IOLs in both eyes for at least 3 months.</brief_summary>
