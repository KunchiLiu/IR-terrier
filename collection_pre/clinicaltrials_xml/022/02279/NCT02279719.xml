	<brief_title>A Study of BBI608 in Combination With Sorafenib, or BBI503 in Combination With Sorafenib in Adult Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, three-arm, phase 1 dose escalation study and phase 2 study of BBI608 in combination with sorafenib, or BBI503 in combination with sorafenib. The study population is adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received systemic chemotherapy. The phase 1 portion will involve dose-escalation of BBI608 administered in combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 1), and dose escalation of BBI503 administered in combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 2). The fixed starting dose-level of sorafenib for both arms will be 400 mg twice daily (800 mg total daily dose). Eligible patients will be randomized to either Arm 1 or Arm 2. The phase 2 portion will be an open-label, 3-arm, randomized trial of patients with advanced HCC who have not received prior systemic treatment. Patients will be randomized to receive either, Arm 1: sorafenib administered in combination with BBI608 (at the RP2D determined for BBI608 plus sorafenib during the phase 1 portion); Arm 2: sorafenib in combination with BBI503 (at the RP2D determined for BBI503 plus sorafenib during the phase 1 portion), or Arm 3: sorafenib alone at a starting dose of 400 mg twice daily. The starting dose for sorafenib is the same for all study arms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Signed written informed consent must be obtained and documented according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulatory requirements 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that is metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent. 1. Patients must not be candidates for curative resection 2. Patients who have recurrent disease after having had one or more prior resections may be eligible, provided that they are not candidates for further curative resection. 3. Patients who have recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma following hepatic transplantation are excluded unless the following criteria are met: i. Transplantation was performed at least 6 months prior to the relapse of HCC. ii. Patients are on stable immune suppressive therapy with no clinical evidence of rejection. iii. Are receiving ≤ 2.5 mg everolimus daily. d. Patients with known HIV infection are excluded. e. Patients with Hepatitis B are eligible provided there is no active viral replication. Patients with Hepatitis C who are not on interferon are eligible. 3. Patients who have a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma made through radiologic imaging may be eligible, provided they meet the criteria according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, AASLD (Bruix and Sherman, 2005; Bruix and Sherman, 2011) 4. Patients must be candidates for sorafenib 5. Must have had no previous systemic anticancer treatment, though previous locoregional therapy is allowed: a. Prior treatment with any of the following is allowed: transarterial embolization, transarterial chemoembolization, percutaneous ethanol injection, radioembolization, radiofrequency ablation, or other ablation techniques. 6. Must be ChildPugh class A a. Patients with uncontrolled massive ascites or presence of hepatic encephalopathy are excluded 7. Must have total serum bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dl 8. ≥ 18 years of age 9. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 11. Male or female patients of childproducing potential must agree to use contraception or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 30 days after the last BBI608 or BBI503 dose 12. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 13. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 5.0x the upper limit of normal (ULN) 14. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73m^2 according to the CockcroftGault estimation. 13. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 mg/dl 14. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L 15. Platelets ≥ 75 x 10^9/L 16. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months Exclusion Criteria 1. Previous treatment with sorafenib 2. Patients with known hypersensitivity to sorafenib or any other component of sorafenib. 3. Previous systemic antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or any prior systemic anticancer therapy, including prior treatment with systemic agents such as regorafenib, ramucirumab, pazopanib, or experimental agents such as brivanib. 4. Have had a surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia or inpatient hospitalization for recovery less than 4 weeks prior to beginning protocol therapy. 5. Have had a locoregional procedure for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (such as a percutaneous, transarterial, or radioablative procedure) less than 4 weeks prior to beginning protocol therapy. Protocol therapy may begin a minimum of 4 weeks after such a procedure provided the following criteria are met: 1. There is progression of disease documented by RECIST 1.1 2. All adverse events from the procedure have resolved or have been deemed irreversible and the patient meets inclusion criteria. 6. Any known symptomatic or untreated brain metastases requiring increase of steroid dose within 2 weeks prior to starting on study. Patients with treated brain metastases must be stable for 4 weeks after completion of that treatment. Patients must have no clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must be either off steroids or on a stable dose of steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to protocol enrollment. Patients with known leptomeningeal metastases are excluded, even if treated. 7. Pregnant or breastfeeding 8. Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s), (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, extensive gastric and small intestine resection) such that, in the opinion of the treating investigator, absorption of oral medications may be impaired. 9. Unable or unwilling to swallow BBI608, BBI503, or sorafenib capsules or tablets 10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active infection, clinically significant nonhealing or healing wounds, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, significant pulmonary disease (shortness of breath at rest or mild exertion), or uncontrolled infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements (e.g. no reliable transportation). 11. Subjects with a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: a) curatively resected nonmelanoma skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor with no known active disease present that, in the opinion of the investigator, will not affect patient outcome in the setting of current hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis. 12. Abnormal ECGs which are clinically significant such as QT prolongation (QTc &gt; 480 msec), clinically significant cardiac enlargement or hypertrophy, new bundle branch block, or signs of active ischemia. Patients with evidence of prior infarction who are New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II, III, or IV are excluded, as are patients with marked arrhythmias such as Wolff Parkinson White pattern or complete atrioventricular (AV) dissociation.</criteria>
