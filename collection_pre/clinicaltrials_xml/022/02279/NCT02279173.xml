	<brief_summary>This is a phase 3b single arm, open label, multicenter study describing the percentage of time pediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response while receiving romiplostim, defined as a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and in the absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Study of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects With ITP.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3b single arm, open label, multicenter study describing the percentage of time pediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response while receiving romiplostim, defined as a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and in the absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks. This protocol will provide open label romiplostim to thrombocytopenic pediatric subjects with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who have received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) or are ineligible for other ITP therapies.</detailed_description>
