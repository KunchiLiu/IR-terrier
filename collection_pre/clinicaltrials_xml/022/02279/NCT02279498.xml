	<brief_summary>Liprotamase powder is a non-porcine, soluble and stable mixture of three digestive enzymes including lipase, protease, and amylase. The purpose of the present study is to provide additional efficacy and safety data compared to approved, porcine-derived, enterically-coated and encapsulated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be comparative efficacy measured as the change in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) in Cystic Fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Liprotamase is stable in stomach and digestive fluids allowing administration in a variety of convenient formulations and with a number of foods without enteric coating.</brief_summary>
