	<detailed_description>The investigators will recruit English-speaking, early-stage breast cancer survivors (N=200) to a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving a 2 (group) by 3 (time) repeated measures design. The intervention will stimulate dietary behavior changes using individualized anti-inflammatory dietary prescriptions with six monthly workshops (culinary demonstrations, recipes and meal planning) and behavior change cures reinforced through evidence- and theory-based patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and tailored newsletters personalized to individual readiness for change. Control participants will receive minimal nutritional information at baseline, monthly American Cancer Society survivorship brochures, and two telephone calls prior to assessment appointments. Groups will be compared at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Dependent measures will include dietary behavior and levels of cancer-associated biomarkers.</detailed_description>
