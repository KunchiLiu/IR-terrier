	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Diagnosis of NYHA class III heart failure At least 1 heart failure hospitalization within previous 12 months Patients with reduced LVEF heart failure should be receiving a beta blocker for 3 months and an ACEI or ARB for one month unless in the investigator's opinion, the patient is intolerant to beta blockers, ACEI or ARB BMI ≤ 35. Patients with BMI &gt;35 will require their chest circumference to be measured at the axillary level. If &gt; 65 inches the patient will not be eligible for the study. Pulmonary artery branch diameter ≥ 7mm (implant target artery assessed during the right heart catheterization) Active infection History of recurrent (&gt; 1) pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis Inability to tolerate a right heart catheterization A major cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, open heart surgery, stroke, etc.) within previous 2 months Cardiac resynchronization device (CRT) implanted within previous 3 months Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt; 25 ml/min (obtained within 2 weeks of implant) who are nonresponsive to diuretic therapy or who are on chronic renal dialysis Congenital heart disease or mechanical right heart valve Likely to undergo heart transplantation or VAD within the next 6 months Known coagulation disorders Hypersensitivity or allergy to aspirin, and/or clopidogrel</criteria>
