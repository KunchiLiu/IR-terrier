	<brief_title>Trial of Combination of Elotuzumab Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in High-Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of the investigational drugs elotuzumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in smoldering multiple myeloma. Recent research studies have shown that early treatment of smoldering multiple myeloma may delay or prevent the progression to active multiple myeloma. The purpose of this research study is to learn whether the combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone works in treating smoldering multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>

AST ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min or a creatinine ≤ 2.2 mg/dL Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care Females of childbearing potential* must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma or any evidence of CRAB criteria including the new criteria for overt myeloma. Any prior therapy for active Myeloma should also be excluded. Prior therapy for smoldering myeloma is not an exclusion criteria. Bisphosphonates are not excluded Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational. Prior therapy with bisphosphonate is allowed. Prior radiation therapy to a solitary plasmacytoma is allowed. Prior clinical trials for smoldering MM or MGUS are allowed as long as the last therapy was at least 2 months prior and there was no improvement in M spike Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or lowrisk prostate cancer after curative therapy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to elotuzumab or lenalidomide Known seropositive for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus. Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus vaccine are eligible</criteria>
