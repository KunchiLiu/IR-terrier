	<brief_summary>This registry is a prospective, non-interventional, post authorisation safety study for patients diagnosed with Transfusion Dependent, IPSS low or intermediate-1-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), associated to a single abnormality of the chromosome 5 [del(5q)]. The purpose of this study is to collect additional data about the safety of an oral drug (lenalidomide, Revlimid®) that may have been prescribed to relieve anemia and decrease the need of blood transfusions. However, also patients affected by the MDS del(5q) who receive other treatments different from lenalidomide can be included in this study, if they agree.</brief_summary>
