	<brief_summary>DS-6051b is an orally administered inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases ROS1 and NTRKs. This phase 1 first-in-human study evaluates safety and tolerability of DS-6051b in cancer subjects and identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In addition, this study will also assess the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and preliminary efficacy of DS-6051b.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A First-in-human Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of DS-6051b</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Dose Escalation part (Part 1) of this study will evaluate safety and tolerability, and determine the tentative RP2D. Plasma exposure of DS-6051a and the exposure - QT interval prolongation relationship will also be assessed. Approximately 30 subjects with advanced solid tumors harboring ROS1 or NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 rearrangement, neuroendocrine carcinoma, or with advanced solid tumors and tumor-induced pain will be enrolled. After the safety profile of DS-6051b is adequately evaluated, the Dose Expansion part (Part 2) will be initiated to further assess the safety and tolerability, and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of DS-6051b at the tentative RP2D. Approximately 40 cancer subjects carrying a ROS1 or NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 rearrangement will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
