	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography Quantitative Analysis of Changes in Anterior Chamber After Laser Peripheral Lridotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the study ,primary angle closure(PAC) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) will be recruited. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images captured before and after laser peripheral iridotomy will be analysed to provide objective and reproducible quantification of anterior segment biometric parameters.The outcomes can provide useful information for clinical strategies in the treatment and management of pathology related to angle closure.</detailed_description>
