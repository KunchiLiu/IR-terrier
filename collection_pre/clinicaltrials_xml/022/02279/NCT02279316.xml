	<brief_summary>Move for your mind is a single blind, 3-arm randomized controlled clinical pilot trial. The study aims to test the effect of a weekly Dalcroze eurhythmics program (arm 1) and a home strength exercise program (arm 2) against control (no exercise) on the rate of falling, quality of life, gait performance and cognitive function. All groups receive vitamin D. In addition the study shall test the feasibility of the recruitment and the interventions in this target population. The study includes 60 seniors, age 65 and older, with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Participants are recruited by the memory clinic of City Hospital Waid. During the 12 months follow-up, participants will have 3 clinical visits (baseline, 6 and 12 month). Despite major efforts the target population is very difficult to recruit and adherence to treatment is low. We therefore decided to stop recruitment and to use this trial as a pilot trial for future clinical trials of the same topic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) will decrease rate of falls in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group. Secondary objectives Objective 1: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) decreases 12-month risk of falling at least once in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group. Objective 2: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) improves cognitive func-tion and alertness in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group. Objective 3: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) decreases gait variability in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group. Objective 4: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) improves quality of life in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.</detailed_description>
