	<brief_summary>Previous research on intensive care unit (ICU) survivors shows that rehabilitation is challenging, because of patients experiences of disease related problems both under and after treatment. Approximately 20 % of patients die within hospital, up to 80% suffer from hallucinations and nightmares, deal with paranoiac experiences, chronic pain and other symptoms and disability (Angus et al 2004; De Letter et al 2001; Ely et al 2001; Nelson et al 2006; Van den Berghe et al 2001; Van den Berghe et al 2003) . A recent study shows that 28% of intensive care survivors have chronic pain that reduce their health related quality of life (Boyle et al 2004). The aim of this study is to perform a survey about prevalence of pain type, and which consequences this causes when it comes to function and quality of life up to 12 months after the ICU stay. 1. What type of pain has ICU survivors and how do pain change over time, related to treatment/rehabilitation and the illness' development? 2. What is the relationship between different pain characteristic, quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep and PTSD in these patients? 3. What is these patients largest obstacle for good QoL after discharge from hospital?</brief_summary>
