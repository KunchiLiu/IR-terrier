	<brief_summary>The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of alogliptin tablets (Nesina Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients who have had an inadequate response to hypoglycemic agents (e.g., insulin preparations or rapid-acting insulin secretagogues)* in addition to dietary/exercise therapy in daily medical practice. * Patients receiving these hypoglycemic agents (excluding α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidines, sulfonylureas, and biguanides) were excluded from existing specified drug-use surveys for Nesina Tablets.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This survey was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of alogliptin tablets (Nesina Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients who have had an inadequate response to hypoglycemic agents (e.g., insulin preparations or rapid-acting insulin secretagogues)* in addition to dietary/exercise therapy in daily medical practice. For adults, 25 mg of alogliptin is usually administered orally once daily.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetic patients meeting the following criteria are included in this survey: Patients who have had an inadequate response to the following medications/therapies: • Use of one hypoglycemic agent such as insulin preparations and rapidacting insulin secretagogues, excluding other types of hypoglycemic agents (e.g., αglucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidines, sulfonylureas, and biguanides)*, in addition to dietary/exercise therapy * For use of Nesina Tablets in combination with these agents, a specified druguse survey is currently ongoing. Type 2 diabetic patients who meet any of the following criteria are excluded from this survey: Patients with contraindications for Nesina Tablets 1. Those with severe ketosis, in a state of diabetic coma or precoma, or with type 1 diabetes mellitus [Quickly rectifying hyperglycemia with administration of intravenous fluid or insulin is essential in these patients; therefore, administration of Nesina Tablets is not appropriate.] 2. Those with severe infections, before or after surgery, or with serious trauma [Controlling blood glucose with an injection of insulin is desirable for these patients; therefore, administration of Nesina Tablets is not appropriate.] 3. Those with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of Nesina Tablets</criteria>
