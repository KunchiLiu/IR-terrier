	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin lispro injection into either lipohypertrophic lesions or normal tissue, utilizing both state-of-the-art euglycaemic clamp and mixed meal tolerance testing. The magnitude of insulin efficacy after injection into these different areas is still unclear. The results from this study may expand the knowledge on the severity of this issue and may provide evidence for future treatment recommendations regarding injection sites for insulin administration.</brief_summary>
