	<brief_title>Baclofen in the Treatment of Muscle Cramps in Patients With Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle cramps are common in patients with liver disease and associated with significantly diminished quality of life. Patients with cirrhosis often experience muscle cramps with varied frequency and severity. The exact mechanisms by which they occur remain unclear, although a number of pathophysiological events unique to liver disease may contribute. Clinical studies have identified alterations in 3 areas: nerve function, energy metabolism, and plasma volume/electrolytes. Although a number of mechanisms for cramps in liver disease have been postulated and have been targeted by medical therapies, a clear picture of the causal events has not emerged. Several agents as vitamin E, human albumin, zinc, taurine, eperisone hydrochloride and branched-chain amino acids have shown some benefit in small uncontrolled studies, although large randomized controlled trials are lacking. Baclofen, a derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a muscle relaxant and an antispastic agent. It was introduced in 1966 as a possible treatment for spasticity due to corticospinal tract lesions. Baclofen was also tested with promising results in the treatment of other medical disorders such as cluster headaches, gastroesophageal reflux disease,chronic hiccups and cough. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of baclofen in the treatment of muscle cramps in patients with liver cirrhosis.</detailed_description>
