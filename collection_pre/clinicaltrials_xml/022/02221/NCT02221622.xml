	<detailed_description>1) Each dose group will be comprised of 8 participants (6 randomized to allopregnanolone; 2 randomized to placebo) administered one dose of allopregnanolone or placebo once per week for 12 weeks. A higher dose will be administered to the next group of participants when the lower dose is shown to be safe and tolerable. 2) Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted on blood samples taken from participants at the beginning and end of the trial. 3) The trial will assess safety including via MRI brain imaging.</detailed_description>
