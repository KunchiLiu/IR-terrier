	<brief_summary>Trochanteric bursitis is a common condition, effecting 20% of the population. \Most with trochanteric bursitis experience chronic intermittent or continuous hip pain at and around the greater trochanter. The cause of trochanteric bursitis is believed to be a result of inflammation of the bursa, though this has not been confirmed. Accordingly, the use of corticosteroid injections has been shown to provide considerable relief. However, routine "blind" injections, those performed without the aid of imaging, such as fluoroscopy, have shown limited success in the appropriate needle placement. Fortunately, blind injections have yielded positive results in majority of the cases. Additionally, the use of fluoroscopy has not shown to improve clinical outcome for trochanter bursa injections. Although the use of fluoroscopy has not shown positive benefit, other modes of imaging, such as ultrasound have not been studied and may be more useful. Fluoroscopy allows for bony-landmark based injections. Ultrasound allows for direct visualization of the soft tissue structures such as the bursa and has gained significant support for use in musculoskeletal injections. This prospective blinded study's aim is to evaluate, if any, the benefit of an ultrasound guided injection and whether ultrasound should be routinely used during trochanter bursa injections.</brief_summary>
