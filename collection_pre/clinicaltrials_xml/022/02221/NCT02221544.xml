	<brief_summary>This study is a double blind comparative study examining the effectiveness of the rTMS treatment on Freezing of Gait (FOG) phenomenon in patients with Parkinson's disease. We hypothesize that treatment using rTMS stimulation on frontal lobe areas will improve gait quality and decrease the frequency of FOG in patients with Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Low-frequency rTMS on Motor Function in PD Patients With Freezing of Gait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A course of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered over the supplementary motor area (SMA) improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study is a comparative study that examines the effectiveness of rTMS treatment technique Freezing of Gait (FOG) phenomenon in Parkinson's disease patients. We hypothesize that treatment using rTMS stimulation on frontal areas will decreasing frequency of FOGs in patients with Parkinson's disease and improve gait quality and quality of life.</detailed_description>
