	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of metformin component of the canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet compared with the metformin IR tablet co-administered with canagliflozin in healthy fed and fasted participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Metformin Component of Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Immediate Release (IR) Tablet of Canagliflozin and Metformin Compared to Metformin IR Tablet Co-administered With Canagliflozin in Healthy Fed and Fasted Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-center, single-dose, 4-treatment, 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one study group to another in a clinical trial, like the flip of a coin) study in healthy adult participants. The study will have 3 phases: Screening Phase (approximately 3 weeks, Day -22 to Day -2), Open-Label Treatment Phase (consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods of 3 days each [Day -1 to Day 2], each separated by a washout period of 7 days) and Follow-up Phase (5 to 7 days after last study-related procedure on Day 2 of treatment period 4). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences and will receive 2 treatments under fasting and 2 treatments under fed conditions. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time) at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
