	<brief_summary>The aim of LipiDown (Hawthorn + Phytosterol) clinical trial is to test the blood lipids reduction effect of plant sterols and hawthorn in milk powder in a pilot human trial: demonstrate potential to reduce total blood cholesterol more than 10% and/or total triglycerides more than 15%, as required by State food and drug administration (SFDA) regulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of a Low Fat Milk Product on Lipids Profile in Dyslipidemia Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed clinical trial is a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel, multicenter study with three treatment groups. The total number of 75 subjects should be enrolled to provide for a 20% dropout rate. Subjects will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups: - milk without sterols and hawthorn powder - milk with 1.2g/d sterols and 8g/d hawthorn powder - milk with 1.8g/d sterols and 8g/d hawthorn powder The trial population will consist of female or male volunteers aged 18 - 65 years of age with primary mild to moderate hyperlipidemia documented by a serum cholesterol of 5.18-6.21mmol/L AND serum Triglycerides (TG): 1.7-5.65mmol/L , for at least 1 time tested by central laboratory in the past 2 weeks prior to recruitment.</detailed_description>
