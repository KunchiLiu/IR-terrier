	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to compare the level of effectiveness of two massage treatment schedules for chronic CIPN in people treated with Oxaliplatin or taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel) for their cancer (breast and gastrointestinal) . Researchers also want to study how participants may respond to massage treatments, and how the treatments may affect quality of life and physical performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Massage for Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chemotherapy side effects affecting the nerves. Each year, thousands of patients receive oxaliplatin-based and taxane-based chemotherapy and more than 50% of these patients will have Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN can cause painful or abnormal skin sensation (such as pins and needles), numbness, and/or nerve damage that may affect movement. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of a dice) to 1 of 4 groups. The location of the massage and the massage schedule will vary by group. You will either have massages 3 times a week for 4 weeks or 2 times a week for 6 weeks. Massage Treatments (All Participants): Your massage treatments will be given on an outpatient basis in private rooms. For your massage, you will either lie on a table or sit in a reclined chair. The total time will be about 30 minutes, which includes positioning you on the chair or table. Study Visits: One (1) time every week: - Your vital signs will be measured. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be having. At Weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10: - You will complete the same 5 questionnaires. - You will perform leg function and balance tests. Length of Study: You may continue your participation on this study for up to 10 weeks, as long as the study doctor thinks it is your best interest. Your active participation in this study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visit. Follow-Up Visit: After you complete your final massage treatment, the following tests and/or procedures will be performed: - Your vital signs will be measured. - Your medical history will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be having. - You will complete the same 5 questionnaires. - You will perform leg function and balance tests. - You will complete a brief exit interview that will ask about questions such as if you think you benefitted from the massage. This interview should take about 10 minutes to complete. This is an investigational study. The use of massage treatments for chronic CIPN is investigational. Up to 90 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Patient selfreport neuropathy score greater than or equal to 3 on a 0 to 10 numeric scale and/or Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 4 point grading scale). 8. Within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment the patient must be on a stable dose of medications for management of CIPN symptoms. For at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment Stable dose is defined as: 1) No change in drug class; 2) Increases or decreases that are less than or equal to 20% of the total dosage. All drug classes are allowed.. 1. Patients with previously diagnosed peripheral neuropathy pre dating their neurotoxic chemotherapy administration or from causes other than chemotherapy. 2. Platelets less than 50,000 or neutrophil count less than 500 within 6 months prior to study enrollment. 3.
