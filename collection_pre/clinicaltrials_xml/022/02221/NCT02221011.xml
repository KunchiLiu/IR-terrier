	<brief_summary>The effect of traditional treatment for spasticity is barely satisfactory. The shock wave has been used to treat the spasticity with expressively response and the effect could persist for 1-3 months in different studies. However most sutdies lack the sham or control group. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of shock wave for spasticity in wrist and hand.</brief_summary>

Group I: patients receive one session of shock wave per week for 3 weeks; Group II: patients receive only one session of shock wave; Group III: patients receive the sham shock wave per week for 3 weeks. The outcome measurements include Modified Asthow scale, passive range of motion, Disability Assessment Scale and Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (hand function and wrist control).</detailed_description>
