	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to assess decision making skills of emergency physicians when dealing with hypotensive patients. The hypothesis is that decisions made based on physical exam and vital signs regarding fluid resuscitation by emergency physicians are not statistically equivalent to those that would be made based on the use of a non-invasive CVP measurement</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ED Decision Making Among Hypotensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If physicians can make appropriate decisions about the need for fluid resuscitation without CVP measurement, then this skill is worth being passed to physicians in training. Previously it was not possible gather enough information about the response of patients' because of the risk of using indwelling CVP sensors. But now because there is a low risk tool (Venus 1000 System), this study is now practical and safe.</detailed_description>
