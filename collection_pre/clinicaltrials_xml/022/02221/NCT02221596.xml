	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify the magnitude of muscle lipid redistribution and muscle oxygen use in individuals 60 years old or older following combined treatment of vitamin D repletion and aerobic training compared to vitamin D repletion alone, aerobic training alone, or no treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to recruit approximately 56 aged individuals with vitamin D insufficiency for a 13 week trial. All subjects will be 60 years of age or older. Participants will be randomized to one of four groups: vitamin D (50,000IU/wk) + aerobic training (7 days during the 13th week); vitamin D (50,000IU/wk) + normal daily activity during the 13th week; placebo + aerobic training (7 days during the 13th week); or placebo + normal daily activity during the 13th week. Following screening and informed consent process a physical activity questionnaire will be administered. A blood draw will then be conducted at baseline, midpoint and endpoint. Collected blood for the purposes of this study will assess vitamin D status (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, insulin, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. At baseline and endpoint muscle lipid will be assessed using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and muscle oxygen consumption will be determined using a novel hybrid diffuse optical instrument consisting of a near-infrared spectroscopy and a diffuse correlation spectroscopy. In addition, at each study time point 3 dietary recalls will be completed and physical activity will be measured using an accelerometer.</detailed_description>
