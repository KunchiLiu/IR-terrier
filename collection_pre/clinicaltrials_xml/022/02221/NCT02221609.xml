	<brief_title>Movement System Impairment Based Classification Versus General Exercise for Chronic Non-specific Low Back Pain: a Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subjects will be recruited from orthopedic outpatient clinics as well from the community. The examiner will screen the eligibility of each subject based on the eligibility criteria. All eligible subjects will receive information about the study and will sign an informed consent form before participating in the study. The examiner will collect the baseline data prior to randomisation. This examiner will be blinded to patients' allocation to treatment groups. The subjects will be randomly allocated to one of two groups (treatment based on MSI model or general exercise) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule conducted by a study researcher who will not be involved with the patients and assessment of outcomes. Participant allocation will be kept in a sealed opaque envelopes using a random numerical sequence. The examiner, responsible for the treatment will open the envelope in front of the patient and will communicate him about which treatment group he will be part of. The clinical outcomes of this study will be assessed before, after the treatment (2 months) and at 4 and 6 months after randomisation. Descriptive analyses will be done to check for data normality. The between-group comparisons to obtain the mean effects of the treatments will be conducted by means of interaction terms (group versus time interactions) using Linear Mixed Models. All data will be given to a statistician who will perform the statistical analysis in coded form. The statistical analysis will be done according to the principles of intention to treat. The SPSS 19 and SigmaPlot 10 will be used for these analyses.</detailed_description>
