	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess 3 different scoring systems to evaluate the adhesive quality of placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial]) JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023-G transdermal (through the skin) systems during a single system 72-hour application, replicated 3 times, of 2 patch sizes (5.5 centimeter^2 [cm^2] and 44 cm^2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Adhesion Quality and Wear of Placebo JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023 Transdermal System in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess 3 different scoring systems to evaluate the adhesive quality of "placebo" patch (an inactive patch that contains no active drug), JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023-G transdermal (through the skin) system. In this study, this patch is NOT being compared to a patch with a drug, and is NOT being used to test if the patch with the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial. The study consists 3 parts: Screening (21 days before study commences on Day 1), an adhesion assessment period (4 days), and an end of Study (EOS) assessment (recorded at 24 hours +/- 4 hours following patch removal). Total study duration per participant will be 26 days (including Screening). JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023 small (5.5 cm^2) and large (44 cm^2) patches will be applied on to left or right side of the paraspinal region based on randomization schedule. Adhesion assessments will be performed at patch application (hour 0, Baseline), and during the time interval of 8 to 10 hours, 24, 48, and 72 hours following patch application. Adhesion quality will be assessed by visual grading, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scale, digital image analysis and visual grading grid system. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
