Stable hormonal contraceptive for at least 3 months prior to study and through study completion 7. Vasectomized partner 10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening 11. Be able to understand and provide signed informed consent 1. Unable or unwilling to stop the use of Opium Tincture or any antidiarrheal medication at the screening visit. 2.

Have clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes (&gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal) or clinically relevant renal disease, (creatinine &gt;1.5) or any other clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results found during medical screening as determined by the Principal Investigator 5. Have a history of major mental illness that in the opinion of the Investigator may affect the ability of the subject to safely participate and reliably complete the study 6.

Have known or suspected pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or lactation 12. Have a planned surgery over the course of the study 13.
