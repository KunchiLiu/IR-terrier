	<brief_summary>Study to assess the blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan over a four-week treatment period; to determine potentially effective doses for pediatric patients for future studies; to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses of telmisartan. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state pharmacokinetics of telmisartan in children and adolescents aged 6 to &lt;18 years, and to determine if age-related differences exist</brief_summary>
