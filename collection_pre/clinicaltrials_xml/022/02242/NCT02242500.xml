	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes after coronally advanced flap technique (CAF) associated or not to a porcine collagen matrix graft (CM) in the treatment of single gingival recessions. For this blinded randomized controlled clinical trial, 40 patients with Miller Class I or II gingival recession ≥ 2 mm in canines or premolars will selected and randomly assigned to receive either CAF or CAF+CM. The clinical parameters evaluated will be probing depth, clinical attachment level, gingival recession height, height and thickness of keratinized tissue. Clinical measurements will be taken at baseline and 45 days, 2, 3 and 6 months after surgery.</brief_summary>
