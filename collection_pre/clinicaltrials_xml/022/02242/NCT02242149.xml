	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Diacerein on Glycemic Control and Liver Fat in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Recently, knowledge about diacerhein, an anthraquinone drug with powerful anti-inflammatory properties, revealed that this drug improves insulin sensitivity, mediated by the reversal of chronic subclinical inflammation. Amongst the numerous pathogenetic factors, oxidative stress and apoptosis of hepatocytes initiate many inflammatory processes and are involved in the progression of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Aims:The aim is to evaluate the effect of treatment with diacerein in improvement of glycemic parameters (mean glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar) and reduction of liver fat fraction. Methods:Two-hundred patients will be randomly allocated either to treatment with diacerein plus their usual therapeutic regimen or to placebo for 24 months. Clinic, laboratory evaluation (including glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, creatinine, ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), g-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, platelet count, total cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and urinary albumin excretion rate no 24-hour urine collection) will be performed before and every 3 months until the end of study. Pro-Inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin and cytokeratin-18 were measured before, at 12 months and at the end of study. Liver fat fraction measurement using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) by transient elastography. (Fibroscan) will be performed before and after the 12 and 24-month treatment, with the observers blinded to the allocation group.</detailed_description>
