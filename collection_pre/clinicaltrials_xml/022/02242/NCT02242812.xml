	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to show that telmisartan is not inferior to metoprolol succinate in respect of the percentage change from baseline in LVMI(H) after a 6.5 months treatment period. As secondary objectives, the improvement in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and blood pressure reduction were assessed</brief_summary>
