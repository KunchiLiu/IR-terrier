	<brief_title>Study of Gemcitabine and Abraxane for Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label Phase II study to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) as second line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received non-gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in the first line setting. All patients will receive both drugs on Days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days. The hypothesis is that this combination will have a 4-month progression free survival of 70% or higher.</detailed_description>
