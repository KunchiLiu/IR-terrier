	<brief_title>Study of the Safety and Tolerability of P 321 Ophthalmic Solution in Subjects With Dry Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, dose escalation, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2a trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of P-321 Ophthalmic Solution in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye for up to 4-weeks of treatment and up to 8 scheduled in clinic visits. This study will conduct a consecutive dose escalation of the following concentrations of P-321 Ophthalmic Solution given two times a day via ocular instillation: 0.0005% (Cohort 1), 0.0015% (Cohort 2), 0.005% (Cohort 3), and 0.01% (Cohort 4). Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled in four consecutive cohorts. Subjects will be randomized to P-321 Ophthalmic Solution or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Safety and tolerability assessments, drug plasma concentrations and drug urine concentrations will be evaluated throughout the study in all cohorts.</detailed_description>
