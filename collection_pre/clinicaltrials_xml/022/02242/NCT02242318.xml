	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the trial is to compare telmisartan 80 mg to valsartan 160 mg in lowering diastolic blood pressure in patients who missed a dose of their medication, as measured by ABPM (change from baseline in mean DBP over 24 hours), and to compare telmisartan 80 mg to valsartan 160 mg in lowering DBP during the last six hours of the dosing interval at the end of a 6 to 8-week treatment period, as measured by ABPM (change from baseline)</brief_summary>

Serum creatinine &gt; 2.3 mg/dL (or &gt; 203 μmol/l) 5. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, patients postrenal transplant or with only one kidney 6. Clinically relevant sodium depletion, hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia 7. Uncorrected volume depletion 8. Primary aldosteronism 9. Hereditary fructose intolerance 10. Biliary obstructive disorders 11. Patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists 12. History of drug or alcohol dependency within six months prior to start of runin period 13. Concomitant administration of any medications known to affect blood pressure, except medication allowed by the protocol 14. Any investigational therapy within one month of signing the informed consent form 15. Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class Congestive Heart Failure (CHF IIIIV)) 16. Unstable angina within the past three months prior to start of runin period 17. Stroke within the past six months prior to start of runin period 18. Myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery within the past three months prior to start of runin period 19. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) within the past three months prior to start of runin period 20. Sustained ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or other clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the investigator 21. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aortic or mitral valve 22. Patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus whose diabetes has not been stable and controlled for at least the past three months as defined by an HbA1C ≥ 10% 23. Night shift workers who routinely sleep during the daytime and whose work hours include midnight to 4:00 Ante Meridiem (AM) 24. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulations 25. Any clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of trial medication 26. Inability to comply with the protocol</criteria>
