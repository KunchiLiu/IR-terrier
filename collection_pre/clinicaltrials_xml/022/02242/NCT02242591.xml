	<brief_title>Effect of Adductor Canal Block vs. Placebo on Muscle Strength, Mobilisation and Pain After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be included on the first day after TKA surgery and randomized in two groups. Each group will receive 2 ACB with a 1 hour interval, one ACB with an active drug, Ropivacaine, and another ACB with a placebo drug, Saline. At T0, arm ACB_active/placebo will receive the active ACB with Ropivacaine followed by the placebo ACB at T60 (60 minutes after T0). At T0, arm ACB_placebo/active will receive the placebo ACB with Saline followed by the active ACB with Ropivacaine at T60 (60 minutes after T0). Outcome measurements will be made at T60, 1 hour after the first ACB, and the difference in outcome between the groups will be compared. Baseline values will be measured prior to the first ACB. Final measurements at T120 (120 minutes after the initial ACB), will determine if the differences between the groups are eliminated, since both groups then have received an active ACB.</detailed_description>
