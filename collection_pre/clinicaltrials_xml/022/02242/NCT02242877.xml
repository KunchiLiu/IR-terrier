	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effect of treatment with telmisartan on patients in whom the systolic BP is approximately 12 weeks after starting treatment under control for the first time between patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) at the beginning to patients with systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 55, with no upper limit Patient who has been treated and followed up for more than 12 months by the same general practitioner (GP) Hypertension measured at least once during the past 12 months and not under control at the time of inclusion in the study: isolated systolic hypertension, namely systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or systolic/diastolic hypertension, namely systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg; or systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg, if the patient has diabetes or chronic renal insufficiency Treatment with one or more antihypertensives which remains unchanged during the month prior to collecting the data Decision by the GP to add telmisartan (either in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or not) to the antihypertensive treatment; this decision is made by the treating doctor regardless of participation in the study. The prescription is issued in the normal way, in accordance with the conditions set down in the marketing authorisation Written informed consent of the patient to collect his/her data The patient refuses to allow his/her data to be collected Change in the antihypertensive treatment during the month prior to collection of the data Blood pressure under control The recommended target values corresponding to control of diastolic and systolic blood pressure are important because of the diseases associated with hypertension consequently, and in order to prevent the collection process becoming too complicated, data from patients with severe renal insufficiency or with proteinuria of ≥ 1 g/L or more are not collected in the context of this study</criteria>
