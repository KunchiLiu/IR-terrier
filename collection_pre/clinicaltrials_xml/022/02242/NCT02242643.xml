	<criteria>Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 6 and 35 months of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Subjects in stable health as determined by investigator's clinical examination and assessment of subject's medical history. Subjects are eligible regardless of history of administration of influenza vaccine in a previous season. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Routine registered childhood vaccinations are permitted. Child in care. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean a dose equivalent to either &gt; 2 mg/kg/day of body weight, or to ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone for persons who weigh ≥ 10 kg, when administered for more than 2 weeks. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Prior receipt of any seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine (registered or investigational) within six months preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. History of GuillainBarré syndrome within six weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines (including egg proteins); a history of anaphylactictype reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F by any route. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.</criteria>
