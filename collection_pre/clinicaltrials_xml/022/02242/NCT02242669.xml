	<detailed_description>Participants will include up to 200 participants from The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) for Aim 1. Aim 1 will measure characteristics of current DBSA members through cross-sectional surveys of demographics, clinical use history, and involvement in DBSA. 60 new DBSA members who began attending in the past month will be enrolled for Aim 2. Aim 3 will consist of 100 matched controls of people who have never attended a DBSA meeting. Assessments will be completed at McLean Hospital, in which a study staff member will thoroughly explain the study to participants. If participants are eligible for Aim 2, study staff will receive written consent from the participant.</detailed_description>
