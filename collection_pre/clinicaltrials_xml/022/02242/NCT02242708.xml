	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Autonomic Nervous System, Sleep Quality, and Immune Regulation for Shift Nurses Practicing Alternative Nostril Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breathing is regulated by autonomic nervous system. It is well-known that breathing exercise can regulate autonomic nervous function and promote relaxation. However, the mechanism for better immunity and sleep quality is not clear. We postulate that alternative nostril breathing might benefit nurses after undergoing shift work. The benefits could be due to improvement of autonomic nervous function, sleep quality, and even immune function. The study design will include a randomization of two groups, with a control group and one experimental groups for 3 months (12 weeks). The control group will do normal breathing. The experimental groups will do alternative nostril breathing twice a week (20 minutes/time) for 3 months. The study primary endpoints are 1) to improve autonomic nervous function, 2) to improve sleep quality and 3) to enhance human immunity. We anticipate to reach the primary endpoints and publish the primary results in one year.</detailed_description>
