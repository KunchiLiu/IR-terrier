	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure is the main death cause in muscular diseases. Non-invasive and volitional measures of inspiratory muscles strength include the nasal pressure with an occluded nostril and the maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax).Unfortunately, volitional maneuvers depend of patient effort. The mean of this reseach is to validate a non-invasive and non-volitional technique to evaluate diaphragm strength at muscular diseases patients.The methdology consist to compar PImax measure to nerves magnetical stimulation maneuvers measure.</brief_summary>
