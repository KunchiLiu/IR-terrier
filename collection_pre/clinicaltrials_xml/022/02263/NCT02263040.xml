	<brief_summary>The objective of this pilot study is to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Fluzone High Dose with Fluzone (standard adult dose) influenza vaccines in healthcare workers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Assess the Immunogenicity and Reactogenicity of High Versus Standard Dose TIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized controlled, observer blind trial of HDTIV (Fluzone High Dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) versus SDTIV (Fluzone, standard dose TIV) in 100 healthcare workers 18-64 years of age. Participants will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, one dose of either SDTIV or HDTIV containing the strains of influenza virus as recommended by the World Health Organization for the season of recruitment. All adverse events will be collected for 7 days following the injection, serious adverse events will be collected through day 21, and serum for antibody testing will be obtained on day 0 and day 21. The primary outcome will be seroconversion to each strain of vaccine included in the vaccine, as measured by change in HAI titer between day 0 to day 21.</detailed_description>

Healthcare worker, broadly defined as a person either providing health care, or working in an acute care hospital or long term healthcare facility; 3. Has access to email and the internet for adverse event reporting, or is willing to complete forms on paper and deliver to the site study office; 4. Understand the study, agree to its requirements, and give written consent; 1. Receipt of influenza vaccine for the current northern hemisphere season prior to randomization; 2. Serious adverse event to a previous dose of influenza vaccine; 3. IgE mediated allergic reaction to a previous dose of influenza vaccine or to any excipients in the study vaccines 4. Previous episode of GuillainBarré syndrome with 6 weeks of receiving an influenza vaccine; 5. Receipt of immunoglobulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months; 6. Receipt of another vaccine, or initiation of new medication, or hospital admission for any reason within the 30 days prior to the study dose of vaccine 7. Plans to receive any vaccine, initiate any medication, or be admitted to hospital before day 21 after vaccination (visit 2); 8. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (including HIV infection); or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) 9. Any condition, including but not limited to drug and alcohol addiction, which, in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the ability to comply with trial conduct or completion; 10. Moderate or severe acute illness or active infection or fever (temperature ≥37.8oC) on the day the vaccine dose is due (participant may receive dose of vaccine 48 hours after symptoms have resolved and body temperature has returned to normal without the use of antipyretics.</criteria>
