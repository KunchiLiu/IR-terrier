Comparing the surgeon satisfaction ,surgical view and bowel handling in operation of soap suds enema group, sodium chloride enema group and the NPO group in patients under going exploratory laparotomy in gynecologic surgery. 2. Comparing the side effects of soap suds enema group, sodium chloride enema group and the NPO group. Inclusion Criteria 1. Women under going laparotomy in gynecologic surgery 2. Surgeon consider not too difficult surgery. 3. Can understanding Thai language. 4. Can communicate with researcher. 5. Consenting participants. Exclusion Criteria 1. Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy. 2. Laparoscopic surgery 3. Do not consent to participate in research 4. Gastrointestinal infection 5. Underlying disease such as Intestinal disease, patient who cannot under going bowel preparation ,heart disease ,seizure. 6.
