	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare quilting suture of the "dead space" without drainage of the pectoral area to conventional closure with drainage to prevent post-operative seroma requiring intervention (aspiration or surgical intervention) within 21 days after mastectomy for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dead Space Closure With Quilting Suture Versus Conventional Closure With Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients are patients with operable breast cancer (invasive carcinoma and/or carcinoma in situ) for whom mastectomy is recommended or preferred by the patient either alone or in association with sentinel lymph node biopsy or standard level I/II axillary node dissection Randomization will be stratified by center and by type of surgery (mastectomy alone/ mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy / mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection). Two follow-up visits will be performed: at 21 days and 9 months after surgery, these appointments are conventional, thus our trial will not modify usual follow-up.</detailed_description>
