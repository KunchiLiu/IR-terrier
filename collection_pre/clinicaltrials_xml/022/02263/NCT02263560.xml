	<brief_summary>Many neurological patients express enhanced deficits while walking in a dark room (or during the night): the supraspinal structures involved in this navigational deficit have not been identified yet. In this project, the investigators will study post-stroke gaits of human patients and compare them to those of a control population during a goal-oriented task performed in different visual conditions. The investigators want to test the hypothesis that during simple goal-oriented locomotor tasks, only patients with specific (e.g. medio or infero- temporal) lesions will express navigational deficits.</brief_summary>
