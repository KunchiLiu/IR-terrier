	<brief_summary>Musculoskeletal injuries resulting in pain are one of the most common reasons for disability and missed duty among military personnel. Additionally, these injuries may create impairment in the area of optimal function, sleep and mood that may not be completely resolved with currently available therapies. This scenario creates the setting for testing and incorporation of additional treatment options to potentially improve care outcomes. Recent investigations have examined the adjunctive use of auricular therapy, which utilizes various interventions, typically needle-based, to stimulate the ear. This intervention appears to modulate the autonomic nervous system to produce more rapid onset of pain relief and reduction in pain related co-morbidities. For this trial of adjunctive auricular therapy, active duty personnel presenting with an acute or sub-acute musculoskeletal injury triaged to outpatient care for treatment will be studied. Subjects randomized to auricular treatment will receive, in addition to standard care, up to 12 treatments over a maximum of 3 months from a clinician trained in auricular therapy. This trial will specifically examine whether the addition of a specific auricular therapy protocol to standard care will have a beneficial impact on the pain and functionality of military personnel who sustain an acute or sub-acute musculoskeletal injury.</brief_summary>

For this trial of adjunctive auricular therapy, 150 subjects will be enrolled at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. Subjects will be active duty personnel aged 18-60 years old presenting with an acute or sub-acute musculoskeletal injury triaged to outpatient care for treatment. Subjects randomized to auricular treatment will receive, in addition to standard care, up to 12 treatments over a maximum of 3 months from a clinician trained in auricular therapy.
