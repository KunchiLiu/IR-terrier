	<brief_title>Understanding Physician Work Motivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Not that long ago, most physicians were solo practitioners. Today, more physicians are working in large, integrated delivery systems, and many are employed by hospitals and multispecialty group practices. These dramatic changes in the physician work environment raise important questions on how evolving physician payment and care delivery models support or undermine your motivation and ability to deliver high-quality patient care. To evaluate the impact of workplace changes on what motivates physician to deliver good patient care, this study aims to develop an accurate measure of physician work motivation. Simultaneously, the investigators plan to test hypotheses on the role of various workplace and psychological factors in physicians' work motivation. Namely, the investigators hypothesize that: 20 to 25% of the variance in work motivation is explained by psychological needs satisfaction; 5 to 10% of the variance in self-reported overall health status and depression is explained by work motivation; 5% of the variation in work motivation is explained by work that is seen as a calling; and 5 to 10% of the variation in medicine viewed as a calling is explained by the learning environment.</detailed_description>
