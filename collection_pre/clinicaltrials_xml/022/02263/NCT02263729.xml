	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of Losartan when used for treatment of an acute grade II or III hamstring strain and determining the effect of losartan on recovery of hamstring muscle function. Subjects will be adults age 18-35 with grade 2 or 3 hamstring injury who participate in Level 1 athletics or have a similar physical work load (e.g. military personnel). Military personnel will only be recruited at Brookings Medical Institute. Subjects will undergo examination, MRI, and functional assessment before, during, and after 4 weeks of losartan (50mg QD) or placebo.</brief_summary>
