	<detailed_description>Studies in similar endurance sports (e.g. marathon) could already indicate a high incidence for the appearance of hyponatremia during competitions. The loss of sodium through sweating and the excessive fluid intake during the competitions is a primary risk factor for the development of hyponatremia. Based on the known occurrence of hyponatremia in marathon runners, participants of the Ironman European Championship between the years 2005 and 2014 were screened for the occurrence of hyponatremia after finishing the race for safety reasons. Subjects were approached at random in the athlete's garden and invited to participate. All participants were 18 years or older.</detailed_description>
