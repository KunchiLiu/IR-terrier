The primary outcome measures were Serum MDA, CRP and Hb1AC. The secondary outcomes were modified gingival index(GI), Probing pocket depth(PPD), and Clinical attachment level(CAL). All the outcomes were measured at baseline, 2 months and 6 months. The results were that the Lycopene with scaling and root planing group gave: Statistically significant results in reducing Mean serum MDA levels at 2 months and 6 months respectively.</detailed_description>
