	<brief_summary>The Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) is one of the most complex joints in the individual. It is composed of the mandibular condyle is positioned within the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone, and the articular disk that separates these two bones. The normal biomechanics of the TMJ is the concave / convex relationship between the condyles and the articular disc. The movements of the TMJ joint are: mandibular depression and elevation (opening and closing of the mouth), mandibular protrusion and retraction, and lateral deviations. The DTM is a musculoskeletal disorder of the masticatory system that affects over 25% of the population. Physical therapy can be adopted this treatment in order to relieve musculoskeletal pain, reduce inflammation and restore normal motor functions. The physical therapy interventions taken include electrotherapy, exercise therapy, acupuncture and manual therapy. Overall objective is to assess the immediate effects of previous mobilization versus flow amplitude of mandibular depression in patients with temporomandibular dysfunction. The type of study will be a randomized study of two parallel groups balanced distribution (1: 1) and double-blind. The research will be conducted in the Laboratory of Human Movement Analysis of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Cear√°. The study population will consist of residents in the city of Fortaleza-CE individuals who voluntarily seek to participate in the study due to symptoms of TMD. Data, anthropometry, application of Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders will be collected. The physiotherapist responsible for the assessment before and after the interventions will be blind with respect to the distribution of the treatment groups. The patient will also be blind, because you will not know whether or caudal anterior mobilization was performed. Randomization codes are generated by computer using Random Allocation Software (version 1.0.0) at a ratio of 1: 1 by a researcher not involved in the data collection. These codes will be placed in sealed, opaque envelopes being numbered consecutively, which will ensure the covert allocation of study participants. Our data are considered confidential as joint property of the parties involved.</brief_summary>
