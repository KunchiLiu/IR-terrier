	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective, non-interventional study is to validate the Narrow Band Imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification for differentiating subcentimetric hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps by using Fuji Intelligent Color Enhancement (FICE) technology with high-definition without optical magnification.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resect and Discard Extension to FICE of NIcE Classification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. In order to create a video-library of endoscopic cases, patients undergoing screening or diagnostic colonoscopy will be considered for inclusion. Patients with at least one histologically verified &lt;10 mm polyp will be included. A short video-clip (around 15-20 seconds) of each polyp both at white-light and FICE-light will be recorded and stored in an anonymized database. 2. Once the video-library is completed, each of 7 experts will independently review all the cases. For each case, any observer will assess each of the three NICE criteria (colour/vascularization/surface), the degree of confidence (low/high), and classify the lesion as neoplastic or non-neoplastic. The primary outcomes are the accuracy of FICE technology with high-definition and without magnification, when adopting NICE classification, to differentiate between hyperplastic and adenomatous lesions, and the inter-observer agreement in such differentiation. Secondary end-points are to assess at multivariate measure the role of any individual criteria of NICE classification in the discrimination between the two histotypes, and possible adaptations of NICE classification in order to be applied with FICE.</detailed_description>
