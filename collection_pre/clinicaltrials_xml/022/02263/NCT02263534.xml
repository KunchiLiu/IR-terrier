	<brief_summary>Based on previous studies the single incision minisling is an easy less invasive procedure with fewer complications and cure rate similar to conventional midurethral slings in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the single incision mini-sling placed in the "U" position is not inferior to TVT in this patient population.</brief_summary>
