	<criteria>Positive for HBsAg and HBeAg for more than 6 months prior to baseline Detectable HBVDNA (&gt;20,000 IU/mL) as measured by polymerization chain reaction (PCR) or hybridization on at least 2 occasions at least one month apart with the latest determination obtained less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 42 days prior to baseline Compensated liver disease (ChildPugh Class A clinical classification) Either Liver biopsy performed within 2 years prior to baseline showing no or minimal fibrosis (Liver Biopsy Scores and stable normal ALT levels (less than or equal to upper limit of normal [ULN]) during the 6 months leading up to baseline (including two separate occasions at least 1 month apart over the 6 months prior to baseline). Screening ALT levels must be normal (&lt;/= ULN) OR Stable normal ALT levels (&lt;/= ULN), during the 1 year leading up to baseline (including three separate occasions at least 1 month apart over the 1 year prior to baseline) and no signs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, or splenomegaly on liver abdominal ultrasound at screening.
