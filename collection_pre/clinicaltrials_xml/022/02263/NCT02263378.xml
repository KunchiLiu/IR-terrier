	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a supplement in which ellagic acid plus annona muricata are combined, may modulate the immune response to high risk HPV infection. Sixty women will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled study, having a histological diagnosis of L-SIL correlated with high rish HPV types infection. Main outcome measure is the activation of onco suppressor protein by the supplement and secondary outcome is the clearance of HPV infection in the treated group.</brief_summary>
