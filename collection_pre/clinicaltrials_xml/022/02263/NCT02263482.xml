	<brief_summary>Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that is the common end of several cardiac diseases with symptoms such as muscle fatigue, dyspnea and reduction of quality of life. To improve respiratory and general functional capacity of these patients, there are strategies that can be used such as inspiratory muscle training and peripheral muscle training (dynamic resistance training).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle and Peripheral Muscle Training in Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After agreement with the written informed consent, 35 subjects with severe heart failure were included in this study. They were randomized in three groups: controls, low-intensity and moderate-intensity group. All volunteers were assessed at Baseline and 8-weeks intervention. Cardiac events were registered following two years from baseline. The present study aimed to assess the effects of a combined program of inspiratory and peripheral muscle training on respiratory and general functional capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure.</detailed_description>
