	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the protocol is to determine the effects of a new program of PEP'C "PEP'C with constant load and intermittent recovery" (PEP'C-R) on endurance parameters of older seniors. The study hypothesis: the investigators propose that PEP'C-R training offers a significant improvement in endurance parameters for older seniors. The secondary objectives are to determine the effects of PEP'C-R on maximal cardio-respiratory function, FMD (Flow-mediated dilation), PWV (pulse wave velocity), systolic and diastolic heart function, body composition (measured by impedance), biological, functional and cognitive functioning and quality of life.</brief_summary>
