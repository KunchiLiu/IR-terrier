	<brief_summary>The aim of this phase II trial was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with S-1 based chemotherapy in patients with pathologically positive lymph node after completely resected gastric cancer. Furthermore, the investigators sought to compare the dosimetric differences between the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), Tomotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques in treatment planning for gastric cancer as adjuvant radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
