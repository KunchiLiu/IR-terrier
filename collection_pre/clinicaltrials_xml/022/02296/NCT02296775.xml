	<brief_summary>This study will compare the plasma pharmacokinetic profile and the change in disease activity score in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis following treatment with two 1000 mg doses of DRL_RI or one of two sources of rituximab (Rituxan® or MabThera®). Patients will also be monitored for safety, B cell depletion and recovery, and for the development of immune responses to the administered study drugs</brief_summary>
