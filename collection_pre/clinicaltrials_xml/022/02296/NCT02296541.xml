	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Immune Response to Three Different DNA HIV Vaccines Administered With a MVA-CMDR Boost Vaccine in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity to four different HIV vaccines in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. The vaccines include three DNA vaccines—DNA Nat-B env, DNA CON-S env, and DNA Mosaic env—and a vaccine called MVA-CMDR that may boost the immune response to the DNA vaccines. The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 50 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and will receive either one of the experimental vaccine regimens or a placebo vaccine regimen. Group 1 participants will receive the DNA Nat-B env and MVA-CMDR vaccines or placebo. Group 2 participants will receive the DNA CON-S env and MVA-CMDR vaccines or placebo. Group 3 participants will receive DNA Mosaic env and MVA-CMDR vaccines or placebo. All participants will receive one of their assigned vaccines at study entry (Month 0), and Months 1, 2, 4, and 8. Total study duration will be either 3 years after enrollment (for participants in the United States) or 5 years after enrollment (for participants in Switzerland). For all participants, study visits will occur at study entry (Month 0), and Months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 4.5, 8, 8.25, 8.5, 11, 13.75, and 14. After the last study visit, participants will be contacted annually by phone or e-mail for a total of 3 (U.S. participants) or 5 (Switzerland participants) years to answer questions about their health. All study visits will include a physical exam, HIV risk reduction counseling, and an interview and/or questionnaire. Select study visits will include blood collection, urine and stool collection, HIV testing, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a pregnancy test for participants who were born female. For participants receiving the MVA-CMDR vaccine, select study visits may also include an assessment of cardiac symptoms.</detailed_description>

NonU.S. site may use locally available assays that have been approved by HVTN Laboratory Operations. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative antihepatitis C virus antibodies (antiHCV), or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the antiHCV is positive Urine Normal urine: Negative urine glucose, and Negative or trace urine protein, and Negative or trace urine hemoglobin (if trace hemoglobin is present on dipstick, a microscopic urinalysis with red blood cells levels within institutional normal range) Reproductive Status Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. Reproductive status: participants who were born female must: Agree to consistently use effective contraception (information on effective contraception methods can be found in the protocol) for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit; Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; Or be sexually abstinent. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required protocol clinic visit. General Blood products received within 120 days before first vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40 Intent to participate in another study of an investigational research agent during the planned duration of the HVTN 106 study Pregnant or breastfeeding Vaccines and Other Injections Smallpox vaccine received within the last 5 years HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For participants who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 106 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis and the identity of the study control/placebo must be obtained. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the last 5 years in a prior vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA. For participants who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 106 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. For participants who have received an experimental vaccine(s) more than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 106 PSRT on a casebycase basis.
