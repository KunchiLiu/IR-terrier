	<brief_title>AZD9291 Versus Gefitinib or Erlotinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised study assessing the efficacy and safety of AZD9291 (80 mg orally, once daily) versus a standard of care (SoC) Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) (either gefitinib [250 mg orally, once daily] or erlotinib [150 mg orally, once daily]) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that is known to be EGFR sensitising mutation (EGFRm) positive, treatment-naïve and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, aged at least 18 years. 2. Pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung. 3. Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy. 4. The tumour harbours one of the 2 common EGFR mutations known to be associated with EGFRTKI sensitivity (Ex19del, L858R). 5. Mandatory provision of an unstained, archived tumour tissue sample in a quantity sufficient to allow for central analysis of EGFR mutation status. 6. Patients must be treatmentnaïve for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and eligible to receive firstline treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib as selected by the participating centre. Prior adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy is permitted(chemotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational agents). 1. Treatment with any of the following: Prior treatment with any systemic anticancer therapy for locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Prior treatment with an EGFRTKI. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug. Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug. Patients currently receiving medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Alternative anticancer treatment Treatment with an investigational drug within five halflives of the compound or any of its related material. 2. Any concurrent and/or other active malignancy that has required treatment within 2 years of first dose of study drug. 3. Spinal cord compression, symptomatic and unstable brain metastases, except for those patients who have completed definitive therapy, are not on steroids, have a stable neurologic status for at least 2 weeks after completion of the definitive therapy and steroids. 4. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses; or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 5. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product, or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD9291. 6. Any of the following cardiac criteria: Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec, obtained from 3 ECGs, using the screening clinic ECG machinederived QTcF value. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECG. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in firstdegree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval. 7. Past medical history of ILD, druginduced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD.</criteria>
