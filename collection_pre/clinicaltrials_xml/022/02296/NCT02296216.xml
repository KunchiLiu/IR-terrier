	<brief_summary>Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment of acromegaly. Adjunctive radiotherapy can be necessary when surgery is ineffective to avoid a prolonged medical treatment. Several studies reported long-term extra-pituitary side-effects of conventional radiotherapy. However, none has evaluated potential side-effects induced by Gamma Knife radiosurgery, a highly precise stereotactic technique, that has been used as an effective treatment of acromegaly. Aims of the study: To determine potential long-term (superior to 10 years) extra-pituitary side-effects of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in patients treated for Acromegaly. Methods: Transversal exposed/unexposed study. Exposed patients have been treated by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery after unsuccessful surgery 10-20 years before inclusion, whereas unexposed patients have been treated by somatostatin analogs after unsuccessful surgery for at least 10 years before inclusion. 80 Patients (40 patients/group) will be evaluated in terms of cognitive dysfunction, quality of life, secondary tumor, stroke, pituitary deficits and growth hormone control of hypersecretion. Recruitment is planned to last for 2 years. Expected results: We should be able to determine whether Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a long-term safe technique. This result might modify the management and follow-up of patients with acromegaly unsuccessfully treated by surgery.</brief_summary>
