	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma; RAS and BRAF wildtype status; Firstline irinotecanbased (FOLFIRI or FOLFOXIRI) cetuximabcontaining therapy producing at least a partial response; Firstline progressionfree survival in response to cetuximabcontaining therapy ≥6 months; Documentation of progression to firstline cetuximab within 4 weeks after last cetuximab administration; Time between the end of firstline therapy and the start of thirdline treatment with cetuximab plus irinotecan ≥4 months; Secondline oxaliplatinbased (FOLFOXIRI, FOLFOX or XELOX) bevacizumabcontaining therapy; Documentation of progression to secondline treatment; Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria v1.1; Have tumor tissue (of primary tumor and metastases or at least one of the two) available for biomarker analysis; Male or female patients &gt; 18 years of age; ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2; Life expectancy of at least 3 months; Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function assessed within 14 days before starting study treatment; Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the baseline visit. For this trial, women of childbearing potential are defined as all women after puberty, unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12 months, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive; Subjects and their partners must be willing to avoid pregnancy during the trial and until 6 months after the last trial treatment. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential and female subjects of childbearing potential must, therefore, be willing to use adequate contraception as approved by the investigator, such as a twobarrier method or onebarrier method with spermicidal or intrauterine device. This requirement begins 2 weeks before receiving the first trial treatment and ends 6 months after receiving the last treatment; Signed informed consent obtained before any study specific procedure. Active uncontrolled infections or active disseminated intravascular coagulation; Past or current history of malignancies other than colorectal carcinoma, except for curatively treated basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix; Fertile women (&lt; 12 months after last menstruation) and men of childbearing potential not willing to use effective means of contraception Women who are pregnant or are breastfeeding; Previous grade 3/4 infusion related reaction to cetuximab.</criteria>
