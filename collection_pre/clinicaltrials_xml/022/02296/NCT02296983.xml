	<brief_summary>Previous Ebola outbreaks have been limited to individual countries and contained by infection control activities. The current outbreak in West Africa is international, and air travel has resulted in a number of infected travellers crossing national borders. There are currently no specific treatments generally available for Ebola and the mortality is high, particularly in countries with limited intensive care facilities. There is currently no vaccine and the personal protection required by healthcare workers treating patients is cumbersome and requires full compliance to be protective. There is now a consortium (VEBCON collaboration) of four clinical centres (in Kenya, Gabon, Switzerland and Germany), WHO and New Link Genetics (the vaccine manufacturer) under which this study will be conducted. The investigators are conducting this trial, a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation trial, designed to establish safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two doses of VSVΔG-ZEBOV, an Ebola Virus Vaccine Candidate for the first time in sub-Saharan African populations. The investigators plan to vaccinate 40 volunteers in Kenya. The trial will be conducted at the KEMRI-CGMR Coast site where healthcare workers (both clinical and laboratory) will be the primary target population as they are likely to be the recipients of a protective vaccine. The investigators will vaccinate a cohort of 20 volunteers at a low dose and then vaccinate a further cohort of 20 volunteers at full dose. Each volunteer will receive one dose of the vaccine. The investigators will follow them up for a period of one year looking to their safety and immunogenicity endpoints.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Find Out if the New Ebola Vaccine is Safe and Stimulates Immunity That Might Protect Adults in Kilifi, Kenya.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to assess safety and immunogenicity of an experimental ebola vaccine. An outbreak due to the Ebola Zaire (ZEBOV) strain of unprecedented magnitude and scope and with a high mortality continues to spread across West Africa. No vaccine is currently licensed. The specific opportunity at hand with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) is to achieve long-lasting protective immunity to ZEBOV on a time scale of weeks in humans upon a single-shot vaccination, offering a discrete benefit over prime-boost vaccination protocols. The current outbreak represents a global health emergency and the need for access to therapeutic intervention and vaccines is paramount. The vaccine investigated in this study might provide a critical tool to suppress future out-breaks of EVD in areas at risk. This study is 1 of 4 clinical trials currently conducted as part of the WHO-led VEBCON consortium, aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) vaccine candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.</detailed_description>
