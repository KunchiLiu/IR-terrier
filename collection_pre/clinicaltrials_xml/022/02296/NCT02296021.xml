	<brief_summary>This study aims at evaluating efficacy and safety of berberine-containing quadruple therapy(berberine, esomeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin) versus bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (bismuth,esomeprazole,clarithromycin and amoxicillin) in H. pylori eradication. It is hypothesized that berberine-containing quadruple therapy is non-inferior to bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Patients with confirmed H. pylori positive status will be randomized to one of the treatments described above. At week 2 and 6 follow-up visits, a urea breath test(UBT) will be performed to confirm eradication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Helicobacter Pylori Eradication With Berberine Quadruple Therapy Versus Bismuth-containing Quadruple Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will include three phases: screening, treatment and follow-up. Screening: this phase will last a maximum of 28 days and subjects eligibility will be evaluated after informed consent signature. Endoscopy and Urea Breath test will be performed in addition to the baseline routine evaluations. Treatment: Subjects are randomly assigned to treatment and will be treated for 14 days. A randomization visit will take place on Day 0 and an end-of-treatment visit will take place between day 12 and 14. Follow-up: includes two visits. approximately 14 days of treatment and 28 days after the end of treatment. Eradication of H. Pylori will be confirmed through urea breath test(UBT).</detailed_description>
