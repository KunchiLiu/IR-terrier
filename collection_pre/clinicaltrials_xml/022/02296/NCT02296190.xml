	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal MSP-2017 (Etripamil) for the Conversion of PSVT to Sinus Rhythm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the effects of 4 different doses of MSP-2017 (Etripamil) in subjects with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. It includes an up to 21-day Screening Period, a 1-day Treatment Visit, and either a Follow-up Visit or Early Termination Visit occurring 12 hours to 5 days after the Treatment Visit. Subjects will be randomized to yield at least 100 evaluable subjects distributed into 5 groups of at least 20 subjects each.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female, aged 18 years and older at Screening Has a history of PSVT Is scheduled for an electrophysiology study and catheter ablation Has provided written informed consent Agrees to use a medically accepted form of contraception or abstinence to prevent pregnancy. Males must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception or abstinence from the time of study drug administration through the Followup Visit. Females must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception or abstinence from Screening until 30 days following study drug administration. Postmenopausal female subjects must be amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months prior to Screening or ≥ 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) prior to Screening, if they do not wish to use an acceptable form of contraception or abstinence. Acceptable forms of contraception include: A condom and an intrauterine device; A condom and hormonal contraception; A condom and a diaphragm; Sterilization of the subject or the subject's partner(s) (sterilization procedure must have been performed 3 or more months prior); Hysterectomy of the subject or the subject's partner(s) If a female of childbearing potential: Has a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening (Screening must occur ≥7 days prior to randomization [ie, on or before Day 7]) and at the Treatment Visit (prePSVT induction); Has had a menstrual period within 28 days of the Treatment Visit. Has a history of serious allergic reaction to verapamil (especially when administered intravenously) including rash, itching or swelling (especially of the face, tongue, or throat), severe dizziness, or trouble breathing Is currently participating in another drug or device study, or has received an investigational drug or device within 30 days of Screening Has evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, neurologic, oncologic, pulmonary, psychiatric, or renal disease or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of study results Is a female who is breast feeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the study period Has evidence of any clinically significant acute or chronic condition of the nasal cavity (e.g., rhinitis or deviated septum) which could interfere with IN administration of the study drug in either or both nasal cavities Has any of the following at screening or at the Treatment Visit: Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg, Diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 mmHg Has evidence of hepatic impairment, defined as: Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels that are greater than or equal to 3× upper limit of normal (ULN) or Bilirubin levels that are greater than or equal to 2× ULN, unless due to Gilbert's syndrome Has evidence of renal impairment, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease method) Has taken digoxin, verapamil, diltiazem, or any Class I, II (e.g., beta blockers), or III antiarrhythmic drug less than the equivalent of 5 halflives of this drug prior to the Treatment Visit Has taken amiodarone within 30 days of the Treatment Visit Has taken drugs of abuse which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impact the validity of study results Has had myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina, or acute decompensation of heart failure within 6 months of Screening Has a history or evidence of second or thirddegree atrioventricular block Has an implanted device (e.g., pacemaker, or implantable cardioverter defibrillator) that precludes study participation in the opinion of the Investigator and Study Medical Monitor Has a history or evidence of preexcitation syndrome (e.g., WolffParkinson White syndrome, short PR, etc.) Has evidence of a QT interval (Bazett's correction) (QTcB) &gt;455 milliseconds at Screening or at the Treatment Visit Has a history or evidence of familial long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, sustained ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, or sudden cardiac death Has evidence of recurrent or chronic atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation; that could interfere with the current investigation; or Has a history or evidence of congestive heart failure (except New York Heart Association Class I) or pulmonary edema In addition, randomized subjects who meet any of the following criteria at the Treatment Visit (Day 1) prior to study drug administration, will be excluded from participation in the study: PSVT cannot be induced or the mechanism of PSVT is neither AVRT nor A VNRT It is not possible to sustain an episode of PSVT for 5 minutes The subject requires a continuous sedative (e.g., propofol), continuous analgesic, or inhaled anesthetic at any point until time 30. Minimally necessary dose(s) of benzodiazepine(s) (e.g., midazolam) and/or narcotic(s) (e.g., fentanyl) (given via single or multiple administration[s]) may be used at the Investigator's discretion. The identity(ies) and actual administered dose(s) of any benzodiazepine(s) and/or narcotic(s) should be recorded in the study documentation. Local anesthetic(s) may be used at the Investigator's discretion; any use should be recorded in the study documentation The subject has undergone prior ablation, and the subject's AV node function is abnormal in the opinion of the Investigator</criteria>
