	<detailed_description>This two-part open-label study will assess 2 different canakinumab taper regimens in patients with clinical remission (inactive disease for at least 24 continuous weeks) on canakinumab treatment without concomitant corticosteroids (CS) or methotrexate (MTX). The study will also collect long term safety and tolerability data on SJIA patients treated with canakinumab.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cohort 1: • Patients who are receiving canakinumab treatment (4 mg/kg every 4 weeks) for Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and have inactive disease at the last visit in Study CACZ885G2301E1 Cohort 2: Confirmed diagnosis of SJIA as per International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) definition that must have occurred at least 2 months prior to enrollment with an onset of disease &lt; 16 years of age. Active SJIA defined as having 2 or more of the following: Documented spiking, intermittent fever (body temperature &gt; 38°C) for at least 1 day within 1 week before first canakinumab dose; At least 2 joints with active arthritis Creactive protein (CRP) &gt; 30 mg/L (normal range &lt; 10 mg/L) Rash due to SJIA Serositis Lymphadenopathy Hepatosplenomegaly Negative TB screen (QuantiFERON or, if required by local guidelines, Purified Protein Derivative). With active or recurrent bacterial, fungal or viral infection at the time of enrollment, including patients with evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infection. With underlying metabolic, renal, hepatic, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions which in the opinion of the investigator immunocompromises the patient and /or places the patient at unacceptable risk for participation. With neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1500/mm3) at screening.</criteria>
