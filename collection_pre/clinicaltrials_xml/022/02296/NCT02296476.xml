	<brief_summary>Open-label, phase IIa, non-randomized, multicentric study of single-agent OTX015 in recurrent GBM (glioblastoma Multiforme) patients after standard front-line therapy failure. The first study step (dose escalation) will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using standard 3+3 dose escalation enrolling 3 patients per OTX015 dose level (DL), with an additional 3 patients to be enrolled at the first occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). MTD assessment will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 28 days of treatment. The second study step (expansion cohort) will assess OTX015 efficacy as measured by the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6) in recurrent GBM patients as assessed by local investigators and confirmed by an independent central review committee. A two-stage design is used in this step to allow for the possibility of stopping the trial early for lack of efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures and treatment. Patients registered for this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centers; 2. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of de novo glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization grade IV astrocytoma) with unequivocal tumor recurrence by MRI scan (performed on a stable steroid dosage received for at least 5 days) following frontline treatment with surgical resection, cranial radiotherapy and temozolomide; patients who do not undergo surgical resection as part of frontline therapy due to anatomical location based on neurosurgeon's assessment will be permitted if a confirmatory tumor biopsy was performed; 3. At least one measurable and/or nonmeasurable lesion as per Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria (Wen et al., 2010); 4. Age ≥ 18 years; 5. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months; 6. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70%; 7. Adequate bone marrow reserve, renal and liver function: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x109/L, Platelet count ≥ 150 x109/L, Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, Creatinine 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min (Cockroft and Gault formula or MDRD formula for patients aged &gt; 65 years), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN, and total bilirubin ≤ ULN; 8. An interval of ≥ 2 weeks since surgical resection, ≥ 4 weeks since chemotherapy (≥ 6 weeks for nitrosoureas), and ≥12 weeks since radiotherapy completion when starting study treatment; patients with recent tumor resection must have an MRI within 48 hours postsurgery; 9. Availability of archived tumor pathology specimen (paraffinembedded or frozen block). 1. Prior antineoplastic treatment for recurrent disease including VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors and cytotoxic agents; 2. Unable to undergo MRI because of noncompatible devices; 3. Unable to swallow oral medications or presence of a gastrointestinal disorder (e.g. malabsorption, resection) deemed to jeopardize intestinal absorption; 4. Persistent grade &gt;1 clinically significant toxicities related to prior antineoplastic therapies; 5. History of prior or concomitant malignancies within 5 years of study entry (other than excised nonmelanoma skin cancer or cured in situ cervical carcinoma). Males with concurrent controlled hormone dependent prostate cancer are allowed; 6. Other serious illness or medical conditions which in the investigator's opinion could hamper understanding of the study by the patient, patient's compliance to study treatment, patient's safety, or interpretation of study results. These include (but are not restricted to) existence of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders impairing the ability to obtain consent, uncontrolled infection and known HIV positivity; 7. Concurrent enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug (EIAED) use; 8. Concurrent strong CYP3A4 interacting drugs; 9. Participation in another clinical trial or treatment with any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to first study treatment administration, or 5 halflives of previously administered drugs, whichever is longer; 10. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients, and men and women with childbearing potential not using effective contraception while on study treatment.</criteria>
