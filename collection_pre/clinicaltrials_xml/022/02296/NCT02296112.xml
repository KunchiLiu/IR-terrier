	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies trametinib in treating patients with melanoma with v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) non-V600 mutations that has spread to other places in the body. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma With BRAF Non-V600 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the clinical efficacy of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600mutation (MUT) melanoma ("high activity" group). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the safety of trametinib. II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the clinical efficacy of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma ("low activity/unknown" group). II. Identify mechanisms of resistance to trametinib in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.</detailed_description>
