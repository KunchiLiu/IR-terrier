	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the effects of Lucentis (ranibizumab), Avastin ( bevacizumab), and Eylea ( aflibercept) on the levels of naturally occurring Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in the systemic circulation of Age Related Macular Degeneration patients currently treated with these medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Pharmacokinetics of and Effect on Systemic VEGF Levels in Age Related Macular Degeneration Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine plasma levels of VEGF and serum Pharmacokinetic (PK) levels after varying lengths of time following intravitreal injection with Avastin, Lucentis, or Eylea in exudative macular degeneration. Patients will be tested while following a normal course of treatment in our institute. All screenings and testing will be conducted in three study visits.</detailed_description>
