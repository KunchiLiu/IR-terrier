	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine if a more specific exercise routine that incorporates a progressive hip stability program will help to rehabilitate the hip and reduce symptoms of iliotibial band syndrome more than conventional hip exercises. Three different exercises interventions will be compared to determine its effectiveness in reducing pain, improving function and returning subjects to running symptom free. Secondary objective for this study is to establish an intervention program for female runners with this injury. There will be three treatment arms and participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group A- control (stretching), group B (conventional hip exercises and group C (experimental treatment- specific progressive hip exercises).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The gluteus medius muscle is part of a muscle group called the hip abductor muscles. The gluteus medius originates at the dorsal ilium (uppermost, largest bone of the pelvis) below the iliac crest and inserts at the top outside surfaces of the greater trochanter (top of the thigh bone). It is the major abductor of the thigh (moves the leg away from the midline of the body). The anterior fibres rotate the hip internally and the posterior fibres rotate the hip externally. Based on the anatomy and function of this muscle, the gluteus medius plays a major role in the mechanics of running. Research has shown that runners with iliotibial band syndrome have been shown to have weakness in this muscle. Most conventional exercises that have been research have been exercises that focus on only activation of this muscle in an unloaded position (non-weightbearing). Group B of this study will focus on those exercises that have been researched. Group C will be the experimental group in which we will begin with the conventional exercises and progress the exercises from a floor (unloaded) position to a more dynamic functional position (standing). This will be geared towards running specific exercises. We would like to know if there will be a difference in how fast symptoms reduce and strength gains occur and at what rate.</detailed_description>
