	<brief_summary>In this research study, the investigators will determine whether a procedure called Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) is helpful in preventing progression of disability in people with SPMS when compared to monthly corticosteroid infusions. This study will determine whether ECP has an effect on inflammatory cells in people with SPMS and whether it has a beneficial therapeutic effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of ECP in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) versus IVMP on disability progression in subjects with SPMS. At the initial screening visit, an extensive medical history will be obtained and a detailed neurological examination will be performed to determine eligibility. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in one of two study arms. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive ECP (study arm) or active treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (control arm) administered every 4 Weeks (1 gram per infusion) for 52 weeks. ECP will be administered according to the following schedule: Study Arm: Weeks 1-8: 3 times per week Weeks 9-16: Twice per week Weeks 17-36: Treatment on two consecutive days every 2 weeks (or optionally, one treatment per week) Weeks 37-43: Once every 2 weeks Weeks 44-52: Once every 4 Weeks All subjects, including patients who receive corticosteroids, will be evaluated using the MSFC tool at baseline and every 3 months through 2 years. They will also be scored using the EDSS at baseline and every 3 months through 2 years. Subjects in the control arm will be evaluated by MSFC and EDSS during the week prior to their next intravenous methylprednisolone infusion and every three months from baseline through two year mark. Blood will be collected for immune function (cytokines) testing at baseline, and months 3, 6, 9 and 12. MRI will be done at baseline as well as months 6 and 12 following initiation of treatment; if the disability measurements are stable or improved at any point in time, then ECP will be continued per protocol.. Patients in the ECP arm should have all of their treatments with the CELLEX ® System. Patients randomized to the ECP arm must receive their treatment within 5 days of baseline visit. In the ECP process, UVADEX ® (methoxsalen) Sterile Solution will be injected directly the recirculation bag of the extracorporeal circuit after completion of the buffy coat collection. The dose of UVADEX® (methoxsalen) Sterile Solution will be calculated based on the standard treatment volume formula.</detailed_description>
