	<brief_title>Continuous MONItoring of Blood LActate and Glucose Levels Using a New Central Veinous Microdialysis Catheter Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MAQUET Group offers a new device that gives real time blood lactate and glucose levels. It is a new central veinous catheter with a microdialysis system. It is planted in the superior vena cava. It has not yet been used and validated with a clinical purpose, and particularly in cardiac surgery. For now, reference method for determining blood lactate and glucose levels is co oxymetry. This new simple device could provide great fluency for determining blood lactate and glucose levels. It could allow medical teams gain time for diagnosis and treatment of both hyperlactatemia and hyperglycemia. The primary outcome of this study was to compare blood lactate and glucose absolute measures provided with the MAQUET new device (Maquet Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden) and with co oxymetry. The secondary outcome of this study was to compare variations of these absolutes measures.</detailed_description>
