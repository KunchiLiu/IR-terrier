	<brief_summary>The goal of this trial is to test the ability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) to improve locoregional recurrence and distant metastatic rates in high-risk patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) that are treated with current standard of care surgical approaches.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage III or IV HNSCC oral cavity, hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx (excluding p16 or HPVpositive oropharynx primaries and sinonasal primaries). Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan, as &gt;20 mm by chest xray, or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam by RECIST 1.1. At least 18 years of age. ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ IULN for patients with total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x IULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN (or ≤ 5 x IULN for patients with liver metastases) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR Creatinine clearance by CockcroftGault ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x IULN INR ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as INR or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants aPTT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as INR or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Sexually active women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use 2 methods of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 120 days after last dose of MK3475. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Prior treatment for head and neck cancer. Patients with HPVpositive or p16positive oropharyngeal SCCA. Patients with sinonasal SCCAs Patients with metastatic SCCA neck disease with an unknown primary tumor site Prior treatment with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways). Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of MK3475. A history of other malignancy ≤ 3 years previous with the exception of previous head and neck cancer treated only by surgery, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Note: patients with synchronous head and neck cancer primaries are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of MK3475. Currently receiving any other investigational agents or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of MK3475. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK3475 or other agents used in the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, immunosuppression, autoimmune conditions, underlying pulmonary disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of study entry. Known history of active TB (bacillus tuberculosis). Known active hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactsive) or hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).</criteria>
