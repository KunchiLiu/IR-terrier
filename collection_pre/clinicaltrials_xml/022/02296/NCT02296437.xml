	<brief_summary>Among antidepressant treatments, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective. However, patient concerns with cognitive side effects have encouraged trials of new, non-convulsive forms of mild brain stimulation such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Our past and present studies of tDCS suggest that it has antidepressant effects and is safe, painless and well tolerated. However, not all patients may have an adequate response, raising the need to find ways of optimising efficacy. This clinical pilot study will examine the feasibility and safety of combining tDCS with a cognitive training task which engages the same brain region targeted by tDCS for treatment of depression.</brief_summary>
