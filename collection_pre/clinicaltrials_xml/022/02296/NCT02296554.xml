	<brief_summary>Biceps Tenodesis is currently advocated for older, less active patients, but to date is not often advocated for Superior Labral Tear from Anterior to Posterior (SLAP) tears in young, active patients. The ideal surgical management for this pathology is not clearly known. More surgeons are using biceps tenodesis as a treatment for SLAP tears, including in the young, active population. If this study were to demonstrate that biceps tenodesis is similar to or better than SLAP repair, this would fundamentally change the treatment of SLAP tears. Perhaps more importantly, it would likely mean a less involved rehabilitation and earlier return to activities for patients with this pathology.</brief_summary>
