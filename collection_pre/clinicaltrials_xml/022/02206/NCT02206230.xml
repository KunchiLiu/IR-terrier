	<brief_title>Trial of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma, 18 - 70 years of age with good performance status (ECOG 0 - 2), will be well tolerated and yield survival non-inferior to conventional fractioned RT, allowing significant abbreviation of the length of the radiation course required for these patients with limited survival. The importance of hypofractionation is, therefore, not in improving survival, but rather to shorten RT duration to improve patient comfort and convenience. This approach is pertinent given the limited life expectancy of glioblastoma and has been used in patients with prolonged survival including breast and prostate cancers.</detailed_description>
