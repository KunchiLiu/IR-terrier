	<brief_summary>High mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein is both a nuclear factor and a secreted protein, and has recently been identified as a cytokine mediator of systemic inflammation. HMGB1 is released by inflammatory cells actively, or increased during cell death passively and mediates inflammatory response. It has been reported to have association with the prognosis after acute coronary syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury of myocardium, atherosclerosis and heart failure. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of serum levels of HMGB1 and post operative prognosis of patients who had undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass graft.</brief_summary>
