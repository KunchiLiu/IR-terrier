	<brief_summary>A major function of blood vessels is to control blood flow by dilating or constricting depending on the demand. Vascular dysfunction is a state in which blood vessels fail to carry out its normal roles such as regulating blood flow. Diabetes is a risk factor for vascular dysfunction. Dysfunction may involve the smaller and/or larger blood vessels. Failure in the ability of large (conduit) blood vessels to control blood flow may be an early feature of atherosclerosis, a leading cause of stroke and heart attack. Measures of blood vessel dilation give an indication of the health of the vessel. Ultrasound and MRI can assess vascular function by measuring changes in blood vessel dilation. Diabetes may also affect tiny vessels in the kidney. These vessels become porous allowing albumin (a protein in the blood) to leak into the urine. The investigators can easily measure the presence of albumin in the urine. This study aims to explore if MRI can demonstrate an association between vascular health in tiny and larger (conduit) blood vessels, by testing for an association between blood flow regulatory capacity of large vessels and presence of albumin in the urine.</brief_summary>
