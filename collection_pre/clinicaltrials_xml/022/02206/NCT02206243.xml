	<brief_title>Embozene® Microspheres for Prostatic Arterial Embolization in Patients With Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EmboProstate is an observational study that collects data of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia that are treated with 250 µm Embozene ® Microspheres (Boston Scientific). The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the microspheres for prostatic arterial embolization for benign prostata hyperplasia treatment. 10 adult male subjects will be enrolled in this study. If eligible patients are recruited, they will undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in our radiology department. Once the catheter is placed in the prostate artery, a fluid containing thousands of tiny particles (microspheres) is injected through the catheter into these small arteries which nourish the prostate. The injected embospheres will slow the blood flow to the prostate reducing urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH. Within one week after PAE as well as after one, three and six months post-procedure an MRI examination ill occur. A follow-up visit using a questionnaire is due after 6 months.</detailed_description>
