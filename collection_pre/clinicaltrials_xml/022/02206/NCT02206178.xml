	<brief_summary>Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used analgesic in the world, recommended for the symptomatic treatment of fever and pain. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of acetaminophen in association with N-acetylcysteine. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the association in healthy volunteers of acetaminophen and N-acétylcystéine 1. - decrease the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen in comparison to a group control 2. - and if this antinociceptive effect may depend of the genetic polymorphism of GSH enzyme.</brief_summary>
