	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to assess safety of antithrombotic drug ticagrelor plus oral anticoagulation adopted in persistent or permanent AF(Atrial fibrillation) patients（CHA2DS2VASc≥2） after PCI-S with specially regard to the occurrence of major bleeding complications. We hypothesized that baseline characteristics (ie age, anemia, previous major bleeding) and type of antithrombotic regimen could influence any bleeding events and the time of bleeding occurrence. We will test this hypothesis by comparing those AF patients who subsequently received double antithrombotic therapy (Ticagrelor + Warfarin) vs. triple antithrombotic therapy (Clopidogrel + Aspirin + Warfarin) after undergoing PCI-S.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently, the optimal antithrombotic treatment of AF patients with indication for long-term oral anticoagulation undergoing PCI-S is unknown. The randomized trials to assess the best antithrombotic regimen in this setting and the management of this population are challenging. It poses imperative demands for future prospective randomized studies to define the optimal antithrombotic regimen in patients requiring chronic anticoagulation undergoing coronary stenting. Additionally, the vast majority of current clinical studies about antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation together with PCI were retrospectively analysis to date ,whereas the prospective studies are rare and urgently needed</detailed_description>
