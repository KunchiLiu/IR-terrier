	<brief_title>PK and PD of Single, Escalating Doses of PER977 Following Enoxaparin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single escalating doses of PER977 from 100 to 300 mg, of 25 mg PER977 x 4 doses will be administered following administration of enoxaparin. Serial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments ( whole blood clotting time) will be performed. Adverse events will be monitored.</detailed_description>
