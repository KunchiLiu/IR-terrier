	<brief_summary>Significant increases in HIV diagnoses among gay and other homosexually active men, in Australia and internationally, have been observed since the late 1990s. The levels of high HIV risk sexual practices among gay men have also increased, particularly unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). Nationally, over three quarters of the new HIV infections diagnosed annually are among men who have sex with men (MSM). The proportion of heterosexual men and women among those diagnosed with HIV annually has also increased in recent years. Despite successes in some situations, HIV transmission has not been adequately reduced by the prevention methods available to those at risk, such as education, condoms, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The effectiveness of daily oral antiretroviral medications (ARVs) as preexposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) has now been established by clinical trials in both heterosexual adults and homosexual men. Whether PrEP confers high rates of protection in real life situations and is a feasible strategy to implement still requires further investigation. Through its "HIV prevention strategy 2015: New era," NSW Health committed to consider how to most appropriately and efficiently implement PrEP in line with evidence. This commitment translated in the support to this PrEP demonstration project. This demonstration project is designed to evaluate the off-label provision of daily combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, known as TRUVADA) as PrEP to a sample of sero-negative individuals at high risk for HIV infection in clinical settings in New South Wales. The project will inform policy development regarding primary HIV prevention with PrEP. This is an open-label, single-arm treatment evaluation study. All consenting and eligible HIV negative participants will receive TRUVADA prescribed for daily administration orally. At each followup visit, the following procedures will be conducted: clinical evaluations/ procedures, laboratory evaluations/ procedures, testing for HIV, STIs, hepatic and renal function, assessment for adherence to the prescribed medication, side effects, eligibility for next TRUVADA prescription, and willingness to continue on PrEP. As a study requirement, participants will be offered a self-administered assessment of behaviour, lifestyle and attitudes which will be conducted ideally within two and no more than seven days of the clinic visit in the participant's private space. Analyses will include: the feasibility of PrEP delivery, adherence to the study medication, safety and tolerability, the effects of PrEP use on behavior, and statistical analyses of the risk of HIV seroconversion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV negative at enrollment (per algorithm provided in protocol) At high and ongoing risk for acquiring HIV infection (per algorithm provided in protocol) Aged 18 years or over Resident of NSW (or elsewhere in Australia if they visit NSW with sufficient frequency to allow participation) Medicare eligible (to have Medicare coverage for the standardofcare services) Willing and able to provide informed consent Willing and able to take part in all required study procedures Proficiency in written and spoken English (necessary to complete attitude, behavioural and lifestyle surveys) HIV1 infected or has symptoms consistent with acute viral infection (If HIV positive status is not confirmed by testing, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm negative HIV1 status). Having an estimated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) &lt;60ml/min Having or developing clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (including nausea, vomiting, unusual or unexpected stomach discomfort, and weakness) Concurrently taking a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., highdose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs / NSAIDs) Allergic to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine (based on selfreport or recorded) Concurrently taking prescribed products containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA®, COMPLERA®, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD®, VIREAD; other drugs containing lamivudine; HEPSERA Mental health issues, memory loss or other cognitive impairment or intellectual disability that may compromise participant safety and/or regimen adherence Factors or conditions that may compromise a participant's retention in the study (incarceration, planned relocation or potential absence from NSW for a period of 3 months or longer during the course of the study) Unwilling to adhere to any of the required study procedures Currently breastfeeding Note: Safety for infants exposed to TRUVADA during pregnancy is not fully assessed but no harm has been reported. Therefore, planning to become pregnant or currently being pregnant is not an exclusion criterion for this study. However, women who are pregnant should learn about the risks and benefits of TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV during their pregnancy. Site investigators will review the risks and benefits of TRUVADA and of potential HIV infection with pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant.</criteria>
