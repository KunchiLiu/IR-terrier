	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a "one-size-fits- all" approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype. PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy. Primary Objective: To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily). Secondary - To evaluate ER protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. - To evaluate PR protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy. - To evaluate ER-related and ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in an effort to identify biomarkers of endocrine response and putative drivers of endocrine resistance in ILC. - To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA expression at baseline and post-treatment. Exploratory - To evaluate DNA methylation in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy. - To evaluate associations between germline and somatic DNA sequence variants with changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy. - To evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in ILC tissues by immunohistochemical or other protein analyses, such as histone modifications, at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer that is hormone receptorpositive and HER2negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages IIII. Invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation. Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment. Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants must agree to both a baseline research core biopsy, and if definitive surgery is not performed at day 2124 after treatment, a second posttreatment research core biopsy. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from tissue excised during their operation. Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented on the diagnostic core biopsy before trial enrollment. The tumor must be ERpositive. ER will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater. This will be determined at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial. Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient. Patients must be female Participants must be fully postmenopausal ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes &gt;3,000/mm3 absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mm3 platelets &gt;100,000/mm3 total bilirubin within normal laboratory limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 times the laboratory upper limit of normal creatinine within normal laboratory limits Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the diagnostic biopsy. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®) are allowed. Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent document. Prior or concurrent use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel therapy to treat the current breast cancer, including any history of prior irradiation to the ipsilateral breast. Concurrent use of any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions/hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to tamoxifen, anastrozole, or fulvestrant or any of their ingredients. History of thromboembolic disease or uterine cancer that is considered a contraindication to tamoxifen. Active hepatitis viral infections. Uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. HER2 positivity.</criteria>
