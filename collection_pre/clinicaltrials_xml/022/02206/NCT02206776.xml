	<brief_summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common illness that causes significant distress and impairment. Currently, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only medications that are FDA-approved to treat OCD. Unfortunately, SRIs can take a long time to work (2-3 months), and even then they usually only partially reduce OCD symptoms. The present study, will test if intranasal ketamine is feasible to use and can reduce OCD symptoms significantly more than a comparison medication called midazolam. Therefore, you may or may not receive ketamine as part of this study. Results from this study will allow doctors and researchers to better understand if you and others with OCD may respond to this class of medications.</brief_summary>
