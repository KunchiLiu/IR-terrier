	<brief_summary>In response to the high prevalence rates of childhood obesity in central Ohio, the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition (CHWN) established the Primary Care Obesity Network (PCON); a partnership between primary care physicians and Nationwide Children's Hospital's Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition, a tertiary care obesity center, the first of its kind in Ohio. The overall goal of PCON is to bring an effective and user friendly obesity management program to the community physician's office to prevent and treat the growing number of obese children in the setting of the private office. The predominant nutrition messaging approach to tackling childhood obesity has revolved around the food choices and portion sizes. While this is relevant, an area with significant potential for impact for maintaining optimal growth and a healthy weight for young children is addressing feeding behaviors and self-regulation of intake;. - the "how" of eating. The investigators objective it to investigate whether this self-regulation approach can be employed for an older age group of 6-11 years old.</brief_summary>
