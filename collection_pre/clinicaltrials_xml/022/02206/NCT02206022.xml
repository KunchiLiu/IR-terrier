	<brief_summary>At present, there is no reference protocol for Central Venous Catheter (CVC) insertion assuring analgesia, anxiolysis and safety. Medical teams use various levels of analgesia and anesthesia to realize this gesture, from single local anesthesia to general anesthesia. Remifentanil has been shown to decrease pain scores for insertion and removal of long-term central venous access. Remifentanil is also often employed for pediatric or labor analgesia for short acts as procedural sedation.</brief_summary>
