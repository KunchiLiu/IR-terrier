	<brief_summary>Recent research has revealed that subtle abnormalities can be found in sperm samples that seem to be normal with conventional analysis techniques. The DNA in the sperm heads is sometimes fragmented and this may be the reason why couples with a diagnosis of unexplained infertility do not achieve pregnancy. We are planning a study to examine the incidence of DNA fragmentation in the sperm of couples with previously unexplained infertility. In a first treatment cycle with intra-uterine insemination the percentage of DNA fragmentation in sperm will be measured. Afterwards the results of the patients who are pregnant will be compared with those of the not pregnant ones. We expect to find differences between both groups. 100 patients will be included in the study.</brief_summary>
