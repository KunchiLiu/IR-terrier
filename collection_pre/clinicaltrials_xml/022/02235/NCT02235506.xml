	<brief_summary>The investigators compared continuous epidural infusion with combined continuous femoral and single-shot sciatic nerve blocks. The primary outcome was the incidence of side effects, and secondary outcomes were pain relief, motor blockade,morphine consumption, and rehabilitation indices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Epidural Block With Adding Sciatic Block to Continuous Femoral Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The parcicipants were randomly assingned to epidural infusion group and femoral sciatic block. In epidural infusion group, a lumbar epidural catheter was placed at the L3-4 level using loss-ofresistance procedure. ropivacaine 0.2% and fentayl 2mcg/ml were infused at a rate of 5ml/hr from the end of operation. In femoral sciatic group, the femoral and sciatic nerve are located using ultrasound and 0.2% ropivacain is injected. A catheter is inserted to femoral nerve. From the end of operation, 0.2% ropivacaine was infused through the femoral catheter at a rate of 5ml/hr. The incidence of side effects is measured.</detailed_description>
