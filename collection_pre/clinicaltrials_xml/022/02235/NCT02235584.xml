	<brief_title>Insulinotropic Effect of GLP-1 and GIP After Dexamethasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we are going to examine the insulinotropic properties of GLP-1 and GIP before and after the development of insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance.The insulinotropic properties of GLP-1 and GIP are greatly reduced in type 2 diabetes. Since the development of type 2 diabetes is preceded by insulin resistance and glucose intolerance we wanted to examine the insulinotropic properties of GLP-1 and GIP in the early stages of type 2 diabetes. To do this, we want to induce insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance. This is achieved by 5 days of treatment with dexamethasone. Subjects are studied on 4 different days in randomized order, with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and glucose clamps + infusions of GLP-1, GIP and NaCl before and immediately after 5 days treatment with dexamethasone, 2mg bid. On day 1, 2 and 3 after the 5 days of dexamethasone, 2mg dexamethasone was given in the afternoon after the tests to ensure unchanged insulin resistance</detailed_description>
