	<brief_summary>The general aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of treating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by physician-directed pre-hospital thrombosis, using accelerated alteplase (Actilyse®) and a diagnostic technique involving remote electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition by paramedics</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ischemic cardiac pain of &gt;= 20 minutes and &lt;= 6 hours Age 18 80 years Ability to give informed consent (witnessed verbal or written) Ability to follow protocol and comply with follow up requirements Current participation in another clinical trial Patient will be ineligible for pre hospital administration of actilyse if any of the following apply: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with a thrombolytic agent within the preceding 4 days BP (blood pressure) &gt; 180/100 mmHg (on one measurement) Significant bleeding disorder within the past 6 months Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma (including any trauma associated with the current AMI) within 3 months History of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or central nervous system structural damage (e.g. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial surgery) Oral anticoagulation Recent (within 10 days) non compressible vascular puncture Pregnancy (positive urine pregnancy test) or lactation, parturition within the previous 30 days, or female of childbearing potential not using adequate birth control (oral contraception) Severe liver disease, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis portal hypertension (oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis Diabetes with definite history of retinopathy Other serious illness (e.g. malignancy, active infection) Bacterial endocarditis / pericarditis Acute pancreatitis Documented ulcerative gastrointestinal disease during last 3 month, arterial aneurysms, arterial / venous malformations Any other condition that the investigator feels would pose a significant hazard to the subject if the investigational therapy was to be initiated Patients who are not excluded from thrombolytic therapy by the criteria above will, in addition, need to satisfy the following 'inclusion' criteria prior to the pre hospital thrombolysis: 12 lead ECG criteria: ST segment elevation &gt;= 0.1 mV in two contiguous electrocardiogram (ECG) standard leads indicative of AMI, or ST elevation &gt;= 0.2 mV in two contiguous chest leads and all left bundle branch block (LBBB) with clinical indication of AMI</criteria>
