	<brief_title>Criteria of Extubation Failure of Brain Injured Patients. Elaboration of a Prognostic Score.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective clinical study in ICU with brain injured ventilated patients eligible to extubation. Identification of clinical and biological criteria associated with failure of extubation. Elaboration of a prognostic score of extubation failure of brain injured patients, based on criteria previously identified with multivariate analysis. Failure of extubation is defined by the need of re-intubation or the need for non-invasive ventilation within 48 hours or more after extubation.</detailed_description>
