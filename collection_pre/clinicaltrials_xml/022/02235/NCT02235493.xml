	<brief_title>Non-interventional Substudy of ALX-HPP-502 to Assess Natural History of Patients With Juvenile-onset HPP Who Served as Historical Controls in ENB-006-09</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.</detailed_description>
