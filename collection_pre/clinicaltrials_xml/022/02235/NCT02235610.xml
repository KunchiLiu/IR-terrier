	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the novel technique of donor EVLP in increasing lung transplant activity by allowing previously unusable donor lungs to be safely used in clinical lung transplantation. Furthermore, to utilize the EVLP technique in research settings thus allowing the evaluation of inflammatory molecules (biomarkers) that would benefit a successful pre-conditioning and increase knowledge of the lungs inflammatory response before transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) in Reconditioning Marginal Donor Lungs for Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human donor lungs that do not meet the standard clinical criteria for donor lung utilization but fit into the study inclusion criteria will be retrieved from the donor using current donor lung retrieval techniques. These lungs will be brought to the study transplant centre to be perfused in our system by the transplant team. Perfusion of these lungs will be performed using evaluation solution with addition of red blood cells cross matched with the recipient, heparin and antibiotics. Those lungs that after perfusion in our system meet the normal transplantation criteria will be considered for transplantation. Lungs will be excluded for transplantation if the organs don't meet the normal transplantation criteria.</detailed_description>
