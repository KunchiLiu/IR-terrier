	<brief_title>Effects of Aloe Vera Toothpaste on Periodontal Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Toothpastes are used with tooth brushing to better control microbial plaque. Herbal toothpastes have recently gained attention. This study aimed to assess the effects of Aloe Vera toothpaste on dental plaque and gingivitis. This single-blind cross-over clinical trial was conducted on 20 dental students (10 males and 10 females with a mean age of 24.5±4 yrs.) with gingivitis. Students were randomly divided into 2 groups. The first group used Aloe Vera toothpaste for 30 days and then their plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were recorded. A 2-week wash-out period was allowed and then subjects used fluoride toothpaste for the next 30 days and underwent PI and GI assessment again. This order was reversed in group 2. Wilcoxon-Sign Rank and two way Repeated Measure ANOVA tests were applied for statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
