	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal of our partnership with local African-American churches is to implement an effective, multi-component intervention to increase awareness of the critical importance of healthy lifestyle in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We will utilize the American Heart Association (AHA) prevention strategy, &amp;quot;Life's Simple 7&amp;quot; to address the major risk factors for CVD: diet, smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol and obesity in order to improve overall cardiovascular health. Our main strategy consists of a community-based participatory research approach that involves focus groups to assess participant knowledge and beliefs about CVD risk factors prior to program initiation. We will also determine participant dietary and exercise practices, knowledge and perceptions related to healthy lifestyle and chronic diseases, demographic/health status information, health care utilization, biometrics (weight, blood pressure, blood tests for glucose and cholesterol, etc.) and attitudes about medical research at baseline, program completion and 6-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
