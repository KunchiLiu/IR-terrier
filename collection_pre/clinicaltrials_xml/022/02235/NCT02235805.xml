	<brief_summary>Observational epidemiologic studies have observed an inverse relationship between daily dietary magnesium intake and blood pressure (BP). Except for BP, magnesium may also beneficially affect other cardiovascular risk markers. Whether all these effects translate into improved vascular function is not known. Different vascular function markers at various stages on the pathway between diet and disease exist. One of these markers, vascular stiffness, is closely related to the process of atherosclerosis, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, and predictive of future cardiovascular events and mortality. To examine the integrated effects of interventions on cardiovascular risk, vascular stiffness may therefore serve as a marker at the later stage of cardiovascular disease development. Therefore, it is imperative to examine in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way parallel-group human intervention study, the effect of magnesium on vascular stiffness. Focus will be on carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), the gold standard for the evaluation of vascular elasticity, to quantify vascular stiffness. Urinary excretion of magnesium will be used to assess dietary magnesium uptake. Furthermore, time courses of an increased magnesium intake on changes in BP, other markers reflecting vascular function, and plasma biomarkers related to low-grade inflammation and vascular activity will be measured to unravel possible cause-effect relationships.</brief_summary>
