	<brief_summary>It has previously been shown in healthy overweight subjects, that table water including a defined amount of amino acids and chromium can decrease the postprandial glucose and insulin response. In this study, the effect of this table water on glucose excursions after a test meal containing a defined amount of available carbohydrates, protein and fat will be studied in patients with early type 2 diabetes or prediabetes according to guidelines that are treated with dietary measures or metformin only. The study will be conducted in a cross -over design, double blinded and placebo controlled including 20 participants. The primary endpoint of the study is the incremental area under the curve for plasma glucose (iAUCgluc) within 180 minutes after ingestion of the meal.</brief_summary>
