	<brief_summary>In facial rejuvenating surgery, the current trend calls for fewer and less noticeable scars with desired results. Especially to improve the jowls and nasolabial folds, the thread lift is a simple and inexpensive technique for patients who do not wish to undergo the typical facelift surgery, but the weak points of it are less effective and shorter duration than the conventional facelift.The investigators propose the new method of the thread lifting the subdermal and subcutaneous layer with a fiberoptic needle by use of the retaining ligaments with two fixation points on both temporal fascia and retaining ligaments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In facial rejuvenating surgery, the current trend calls for fewer and less noticeable scars with desired results. Especially to improve the jowls and nasolabial folds, the thread lift is a simple and inexpensive technique for patients who do not wish to undergo the typical facelift surgery, but the weak points of it are less effective and shorter duration than the conventional facelift.The investigators propose the new method of the thread lifting the subdermal and subcutaneous layer with a fiberoptic needle by use of the retaining ligaments. This technique was performed in 97 patients, of whom 77 patients had primary procedures, and 20 patients underwent secondary procedures. All of 95 patients were highly satisfied with the results. There are no infection, no nerve injury, and no hematoma, but two reoperation cases due to suboptimal results.The thread lift by use of the retaining ligaments with V-lock barbed sutures is an alternative technique in the facelift.</detailed_description>
