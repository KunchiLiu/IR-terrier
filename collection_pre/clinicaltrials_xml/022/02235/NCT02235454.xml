	<brief_summary>The investigators prospectively evaluate the new glaucoma premium edition (GMPE) software for spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) and if this software is superior to the conventional one that is currently used for SDOCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SDOCT-GMPE Software</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new GMPE software can now identify the ocular structures without input from the operator thus reducing operator induced errors. It also measures the thickness of the entire optic nerve head so as to allow for another anatomic area of the eye to be measured for assessment of glaucoma. In addition, it permits collection of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness data in three concentric circles instead of just one in order to account for different sizes of optic nerves. Subjects who are receiving routine SDOCT (CPT 92133) will be recruited from the Duke Eye Center and its associated satellite clinics. Following informed consent, subjects undergo additional imaging using the SDOCT-GMPE software at the Duke Eye Center and its associated satellite clinics. The imaging results may be used in clinical care for the subjects.</detailed_description>
