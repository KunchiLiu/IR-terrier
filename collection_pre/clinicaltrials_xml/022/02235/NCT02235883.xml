	<brief_summary>The objective of the HEART Study is to develop a multiscale model of the coronary circulation based on multimodal imaging data (angiography, echocardiography). The predictive comprehensive multi-scale model, developed during this proof-of-concept study, will be used for analyzing functional aspects of coronary artery disease. Model validation is performed against invasive measurements</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective of HEART is the development and validation of a patient-specific multiscale computational model of the coronary circulation with high predictive power in healthy and diseased vessels: - Comprehensive modeling of the anatomical and hemodynamic phenomena in the coronary circulation based on input data acquired from both angiography and echocardiography; - Assessment of functional parameters and subsequent validation of the models; - High performance computing architecture for efficiently addressing the multi-scale complexity, which is a critical requirement for translation into clinical decision making. Patient measurements used as input data for the multiscale models, or for validating the computational results include: - Angiography: targeted angiographic views include LAO 30, LAO 30/20 cranial, LAO 30/20 caudal, RAO 30 (RCA views) and RAO 25/25 caudal, RAO 0/40 caudal, RAO 10/40 cranial, LAO 50/20 cranial, LAO 50/20 caudal (LCA views) - Echocardiography: - Standard apical acquisitions (2D harmonic 4-chamber, 2-chamber, 3-chamber) - Color flow Doppler/spectral Doppler (MR, AI, TR evaluation; CW and PW spectral Doppler) - Three-dimensional imaging (From apical 4-chamber view one ECG-triggered real time complete full volume acquisition including LV and LA - 1 acquisition at low volume per second (VPS) rate and one at high VPS, real time volumetric color flow Doppler, cover MV and AV). - Non-invasive pressure measurements: cuff-based measurements at the left and right arm, before echocardiography and angiography - Invasive pressure measurements: rest - aortic pressure (Pa), distal pressure (Pd), Pd/Pa ratio; hyperemia - aortic pressure (Pa), distal pressure (Pd), FFR (Pd/Pa)</detailed_description>
