	<brief_summary>This is a randomized trial designed to evaluate testicular outcomes after a single stage versus a two-stage surgical procedure to fix an undescended, one-sided testicle located in the abdomen. Also to determine and compare the costs, surgical complications and the health related quality of life for the two procedures. Testicular outcomes will be measured using a scrotal ultrasound 6-12 months after the procedure (after the second stage procedure for those randomized to a 2 stage surgery).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Boys age 4 months to 36 months Undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy for unilateral nonpalpable testis, who are found at laparoscopy to have an abdominal undescended testis, in whom a FowlerStephens Orchiopexy would be appropriate. Age &gt; 36 months Age &lt; 4 months Bilateral cryptorchidism Solitary testis Findings at laparoscopy for which FowlerStephens Orchiopexy would not be indicated Intraoperative mobility of the intraabdominal testis such that, with no (or minimal) mobilization, the testis is able to reach the contralateral internal ring, without dividing the spermatic vessels. Assessment of whether a single stage primary orchidopexy will be performed, is entirely at the discretion of the attending surgeon.</criteria>
