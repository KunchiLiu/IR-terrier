	<brief_summary>This pivotal trial of the Obalon Balloon System is intended to generate safety and effectiveness data required to support a future marketing application. The trial has been designed to evaluate a 6-month use of the Obalon Balloon System as an adjunct to a nutrition and lifestyle behavior modification program. Weight loss will be evaluated after the 6-month course to determine if a specific predefined superiority margin can be achieved in the device group compared to a sham-control group.</brief_summary>
