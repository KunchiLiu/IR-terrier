	<brief_title>A Randomized Cross-over Trial of Comparison Between Robotic and Laparoscopic Suturing for Gastric Defect by Novices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Da VinciÂ® Robotic Surgical System (DVRSS) has been widely applied to perform complex minimally invasive surgical procedures across different specialties. This study aimed to investigate the impact of DVRSS on surgical proficiencies among inexperience novice surgeons and compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. Methods Twenty medical students (n=20) without surgical experience were enrolled. After a constructive training for basic surgical techniques, participants were randomly allocated into DVR or laparoscopy group. Participants were asked to close five cases (also named five tasks) of a 2cm long incision on pig stomach by using DVR or laparoscopy. Surgical time, successful closure rate and pneumatic bursting pressure of gastric incision withstanding were recorded. In addition, participant performance and workload were quantified by using performance score, scales of Global Rating Scale Assessment (GSA) and NASA-Task Load Index (NASATLI).</detailed_description>
