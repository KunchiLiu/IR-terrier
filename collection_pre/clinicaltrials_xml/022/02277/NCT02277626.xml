FVC and FEV1 &gt; 40%predicted, and with stable lung function (no greater than a 10% variation in lung function parameters over the preceding 3 months). 1. Hospitalization for CF pulmonary complications in the 2 months preceding enrollment. 2. Hemoptysis &gt; 60 cc in a single episode in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment. 3. Chronic chest pain. 4.
