	<brief_summary>Rationale: Severe, early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) due to placental insufficiency is associated with a high risk of perinatal morbidity with long-lasting sequelae and mortality. Placental insufficiency is the result of abnormal formation and function of the placenta (placentation) with inadequate remodelling of the maternal spiral (uteroplacental) arteries. There is currently no therapy available with demonstrated effectiveness. Evidence suggests Sildenafil citrate improves uteroplacental blood flow, growth, and meaningful outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil (versus placebo) in achieving healthy perinatal survival. Study design: Multicenter nationwide randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Study population: Women with a singleton pregnancy between 20 and 30 weeks with severe fetal growth restriction of likely placental origin, and with estimated significant likelihood of perinatal death. Intervention: Sildenafil 25mg or placebo tablet orally three times daily. Main study parameters/endpoints: Perinatal healthy survival, i.e. survival without severe neonatal morbidity at term age. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Taking tablets three times daily. No additional ultrasounds, other than standard clinical protocol, one extra blood sample at inclusion. No risks anticipated, unexpected medication-associated risks can't be excluded on beforehand.</brief_summary>
