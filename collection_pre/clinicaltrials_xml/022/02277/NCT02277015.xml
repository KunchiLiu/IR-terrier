	<brief_summary>The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) 2010 cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines suggest that intubators should be able to secure the airway without interrupting chest compression. We examine the performance of the Berci-Kaplan DCI (BERCI), the GlideScope (GVL), the AirTraq, the Pentax AWS (Pentax) and the Miller laryngoscope (MIL) for endotracheal intubation (ETI) during pediatric resuscitation with and without chest compressions.</brief_summary>
