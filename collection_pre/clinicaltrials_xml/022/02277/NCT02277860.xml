	<brief_summary>Physical activity and exercise have become an accepted and valued component of cystic fibrosis care. Regular physical activity and exercise can slow the rate of decline of pulmonary function, improve physical fitness, and enhance quality of life. However, motivating people to be more active is challenging. Supervised, facility-based exercise programs are expensive and labor intensive (since groups of patients with CF cannot exercise together in the same physical location). Home-based exercise using an interactive exergame device may be an effective way to improve adherence to an exercise program for patients with CF. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-week, home-based exergame exercise intervention on aerobic capacity (peak VO2). The secondary endpoint is nasal potential difference, an indicator of how well sodium and chloride flow across the mucous membranes in the nose. Other outcomes include patient-reported quality of life and habitual physical activity level. Following baseline assessments participants will be begin a 12 week, partially-supervised exercise program consisting of at least 90 minutes per week of aerobic and resistance exercise training using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus exergaming device. Participants will receive at least monthly follow-up phone calls to provide additional exercise counseling and motivation. After 12 weeks, they will continue with the exergame intervention for another 12 weeks, but without external supervision.</brief_summary>
