	<brief_summary>The reference nebulizer used for pentamidine nebulization is currently the Respirgard II ®, disposable pneumatic nebulizer. Other nebulizers are on the market and appear to have comparable properties and better availability to the hospital. Several studies remark that all nebulizers with comparable properties could be used for the nebulization.The aim of our work will be to evaluate and compare the pulmonary deposition between the reference nebulizer Respirgard II ®, and one of these nebulizers available on the market, the Isoneb ®. We will measure and compare these data's for each of the nebulizers via nebulization Amikacine and urinary dosage.</brief_summary>
