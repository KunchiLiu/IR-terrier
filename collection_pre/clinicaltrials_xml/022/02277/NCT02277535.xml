	<brief_title>An Email Intervention to Prevent Iatrogenic Malnutrition in the ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study looks to determine if a targeted email to clinicians taking care of critically ill patients will allow reduce malnutrition in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Four ICUs will be included: medical ICU (MICU), coronary care unit (CCU) and two surgical ICUs. The investigators will rotate a 2 month period intervention amongst the aforementioned participating ICUs and follow simultaneous cohorts to evaluate the effect of our intervention (email feedback to treating clinicians) on nutrition delivery in the ICU. After the completion of the intervention, there will be a six-month follow-up of nutritional adequacy to assess the durability of changes in behavior.</detailed_description>
