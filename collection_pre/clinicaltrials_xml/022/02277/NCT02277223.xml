	<brief_summary>Background: Curcumin in an active phytochemical substance, used as part of the human diet, that has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties which were demonstrated in multiple experimental models of colitis including a positive effect on maintenance of remission in adult ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Objectives: To examine the effect of curcumin as complementary medication in induction and maintenance therapy in pediatric patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Design: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Pediatric gastroenterology centers. Participants: Children 6 year to 18 years who are diagnosed with mild to moderate UC and are planned to receive either 5-ASA or corticosteroids induction treatment. Main outcome measures: Disease activity defined by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) at 2 weeks and 6 months. Secondary outcome measures: Effect of curcumin treatment on serum inflammatory markers, calprotectin and fecal microbiota. Data analysis: Data will be collected and analyzed using SPSS (version 21.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Fisher's exact test will be used to explore univariate associations between primary outcomes and categorical variables. Associations of continues variables with primary outcome measures will be examined using ANOVA with repeated measures. P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical efficacy of induction and maintenance medications in pediatric UC is limited with a cumulative long-term risk of 20%-30% for colectomy. Remission rates following induction with corticosteroids and 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) range from 20% to 50%. 5-ASA is still regarded as first line induction and maintenance therapy for mild to moderate UC in both children and adults. 5-ASA is also indicated for maintenance therapy following successful induction with corticosteroids for moderate to severe disease. Still, steroid free clinical remission at 1 year under 5-ASA maintenance therapy is reported to range from 40% to 50%. Management of recurrent flares while taking 5-ASA medications involves repeated courses of corticosteroids and changing therapeutic regimes to include more potent medications such as thiopurines which carry an increased risk for significant adverse effects. Hence, improving efficacy of induction and maintenance treatment is of critical importance. Curcumin, an active phytochemical substance with anti-inflammatory properties was studied extensively in-vitro and in experimental models of colitis. In the only randomized controlled trial, performed in adults with quiescent disease, curcumin was shown to be an effective concomitant treatment (along with 5-ASA) for maintenance of remission. Therefore, our aim is to assess the efficacy of concomitant curcumin maintenance therapy for induction and maintenance therapy in pediatric UC patients with mild to moderate in a prospective randomized, placebo controlled trial. We hope that this study will further contribute to the understanding of the potential benefits of curcumin in pediatric UC patients.</detailed_description>
