	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of early lung cancer in high risk population, who smokes or has other risk factors, by different bronchoscopy,. Furthermore, another purpose is to determine whether the different bronchoscopy are significant different in diagnosing early lung cancer.</brief_summary>
