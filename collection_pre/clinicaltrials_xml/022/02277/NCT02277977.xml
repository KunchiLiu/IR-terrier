	<brief_summary>Microcirculatory disorders play a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. Without adequate therapy that may lead to multi-organ failure and death. Therefore useful therapeutic measures aim to improve the microcirculation, to avoid tissue hypoxia and thus multiple organ failure or death. Clinically, the microcirculation can currently be indirectly evaluated using the diuresis and metabolic parameters (eg, lactate). The aim of the present study is to measure the microcirculation in septic shock by means of contrast-enhanced sonography of the calf muscles. For this purpose, the method is applied to 24 subjects during and after septic shock. It will be investigated in this study whether the microcirculation measurement with ultrasound contrast reflects the severity of the disease. As well as to evaluate whether the use of this diagnostic method could lead to better treatment of the septic shock.</brief_summary>
