	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy is one of the main means for treating malignant tumor, during which radioactive lung injury is inevitable. Currently there is nearly no effective clinical treatment for late post-radiotherapy pulmonary fibrosis. This study intends to carry out an open, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial. During the treatment, the local lesions will be fully lavaged, and then clinical grade umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. After six-month observation, the investigators will initially evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment by measuring two key indicators-the CT density histogram and the patients' self-evaluation, and one secondary indicator—the changes of TGF-β1 contents, both before and after the treatment. Meanwhile, the investigators will make a preliminary discuss about the possible immunomodulatory effects of the umbilical cord MSCs.</brief_summary>

Subjects suffering from other serious diseases, such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cirrhosis, and acute glomerulonephritis. 6. Subjects with progressionfree survival (PFS) less than 0.5 years or Karnofsky performance scores less than 60 points. 7. Subjects with leukopenia (WBC less than 4x109 / L) or agranulocytosis (WBC less than 1.5x109 / L or neutrophils less than 0.5x109 / L) caused by any reason. 8.

Subjects with liver disease or liver damage: ALT, AST, total bilirubin&gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal 10. Subjects with a history of mental illness or suicide risk, with a history of epilepsy or other central nervous system disorders. 11. Subjects with severe arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, frequent superventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, etc.) or cardiac degree II or above conduction abnormalities displayed via 12lead ECG. 12. Subjects with a history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. 13. Subjects accepted by any other clinical trials within 3 months before the enrollment 14. Subjects with poor compliance, difficult to complete the study. 15. Any other conditions that might increase the risk of subjects or interfere with the clinical trial.</criteria>
