	<brief_summary>Among those patients experienced GERD symptoms, up to 89% report nocturnal symptoms, resulting in poor sleep quality. Sodium alginate oral suspension (Alginos) is a medication indicated for the relief of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. This multi-center, open-label, randomized trial intends to compare the addition of one dose Alginos (50mg/ml, 20ml) at bed time (Nexium plus Alginos), with no additional alginate treatment (Nexium alone), in erosive GERD patients taking Nexium (40mg/tablet) daily for 4 weeks. Efficacy endpoints include percentage of patients with relief or complete resolution of nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation), percentage of patients with relief or complete resolution of GERD-related sleep disturbance, the percentage of nights without nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation) over treatment period, change from baseline of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire total score, and change of the percentage of patients with relief of nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation) at post-treatment visit as compared to final visit in test group (Nexium plus Alginos). Safety endpoint is incidence of adverse events. The study hypothesis is that sodium alginate plus esomeprazole is superior to esomeprazole alone in relieving nighttime reflux symptoms and sleep disturbance in erosive GERD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esomeprazole Plus Alginate vs. Esomeprazole Alone for Treatment of Nighttime Reflux Symptom and Sleep Disturbances</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center, open-label, randomized trial aims to compared the efficacy and safety profiles of sodium alginate oral suspension (50mg/ml) 20ml at bedtime with that of esomeprazole (40mg/tablet) 1 tablet once daily for the treatment of erosive GERD patients in Taiwan. Patients will be enrolled into study if they are diagnosed as GERD (grade A~D); with history of heartburn (or regurgitation) for ≥ 3 months before entering study; with history of GERD-related sleep disturbances for ≥ 1 month before entering study; with nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation) graded as moderate, or severe, on ≥ 3 nights in the last 7 days of screening period; with GERD-related sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights in the last 7 days of screening period; with the global PSQI score &gt;5; and have signed the informed consent. Patients will be excluded if they are diagnosed as non-erosive GERD, Barrett's esophagus or esophageal stricture; with any conditions other than GERD that could be the primary cause of sleep disturbance; with active esophageal, gastric or duodenal ulcers; with history of esophageal, gastric or duodenal surgery; with active cancers of any kind; female patients who are pregnant or lactating; who were allergy to any of the study drugs; taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 7 days, or any prokinetic agent, H2-blocker, alginate preparations or antacid within 2 days before screening; with a history of drug addiction or alcohol abuse within the past 12 months; or with any other conditions or diseases that investigator considers it is not appropriate to enter the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with relief of nighttime heartburn (or acid regurgitation). The secondary efficacy endpoints are percentage of patients with complete resolution of nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation); percentage of patients with relief of GERD-related sleep disturbance; percentage of patients with complete resolution of GERD-related sleep disturbance; percentage of nights without nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation) over treatment period; change from baseline of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire total score (global PSQI score) at the end of study; and change of the percentage of patients with relief of nighttime heartburn (or acid regurgitation) at post-treatment visit (V4) as compared to final visit (V3) in test group (Nexium plus Alginos). The safety endpoint is incidence of adverse events. This study aims to prove that sodium alginate plus esomeprazole is superior to esomeprazole alone in relieving nighttime reflux symptoms and sleep disturbance in erosive GERD patients.</detailed_description>
