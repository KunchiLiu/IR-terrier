	<brief_summary>NICOM® is a recently developed noninvasive cardiac output monitoring device, and indices derived from NICOM® such as SVV has been reported to predict fluid responsiveness in the previous studies. However, its usefulness in prone positioning has not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the usefulness of stroke volume variation (SVV) derived from NICOM® to predict fluid responsiveness in prone patients undergoing spine surgery.</brief_summary>
