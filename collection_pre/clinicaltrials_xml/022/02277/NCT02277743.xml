EASI score ≥16 at the screening and baseline visits 4. IGA score ≥3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in which 3 is moderate and 4 is severe) at the screening and baseline visits 5. ≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the screening and baseline visits 6. Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response to treatment with topical medications or for whom topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable (eg, because of important side effects or safety risks 1. Participation in a prior dupilumab clinical study 2. Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks or within 5 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit 3. Having used any of the following treatments within 4 weeks before the baseline visit, or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to require such treatment(s) during the first 4 weeks of study treatment: Immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating drugs (eg, systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, mycophenolatemofetil, IFNγ, Janus kinase inhibitors, azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.) Phototherapy for AD 4. Treatment with topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) within 1 week before the baseline visit 5. Treatment with biologics as follows: Any celldepleting agents including but not limited to rituximab: within 6 months before the baseline visit, or until lymphocyte count returns to normal, whichever is longer Other biologics: within 5 halflives (if known) or 16 weeks prior to baseline visit, whichever is longer 6. Regular use (more than 2 visits per week) of a tanning booth/ parlor within 4 weeks of the screening visit 7.

NOTE: patients may be rescreened after infection resolves 10. Known or suspected history of immunosuppression, including history of invasive opportunistic infections (eg, tuberculosis [TB], histoplasmosis, listeriosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) despite infection resolution: or unusually frequent, recurrent, or prolonged infections, per investigator judgment 11.
