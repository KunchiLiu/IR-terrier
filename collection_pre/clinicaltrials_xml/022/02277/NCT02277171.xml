	<brief_summary>According to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of patients are affected by health-care associated infections worldwide each year, resulting in prolonged hospital stays, long-term disabilities, deaths, and financial losses for health systems. The most common hospital-acquired infection is Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), accounting for almost 40% of all nosocomial infections. Most hospital-acquired UTIs are associated with catheterization. In fact, urinary catheter-related bacteriuria is the most common health care associated infection worldwide. Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) develops following adhesion of planktonic bacteria to the surface of the catheter and colonization, creating a persistent environment called a biofilm. The nature of biofilm structure together with the physiological attributes of biofilm organisms confers an inherent resistance to various antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, disinfectants or germicides, augmenting the potential of these pathogens to cause infections in catheterized patients. Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally-produced gas molecule with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. NO is used in the clinics to treat pulmonary hypertension in neonates and adults. Studies have shown that low-dose NO is associated with prevention of biofilm formation, biofilm dispersal and elimination of bacteria. It is suggested that NO prevents bacteria attachment to catheter surfaces and inhibits biofilm formation in a mechanism involving reduction and modification of proteins that mediate cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions. The investigators team, using a proprietary technology impregnate urinary catheters with NO (i.e. NO-impregnated catheters). These catheters release low concentration of NO following exposure to urine over a 14-day period. In vitro studies showed that NO-impregnated catheters prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of Escherichia coli on exterior and luminal surfaces of the catheters. In addition, NO released from these catheters is able to eradicate up to 4log colony forming unit/ml of bacteria within the surrounding media. Moreover, NO-impregnated catheters exhibit superior performance compared to silver-coated catheters, and similar anti-infective properties compared to antibiotic-coated catheters. Primary objectives: To assess the safety and tolerability of NO-impregnated catheters in patients older than 18 years old undergoing radical prostatectomy and catheterized for 7-14 days.</brief_summary>
