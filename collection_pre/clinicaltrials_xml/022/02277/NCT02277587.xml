	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled, open, three-armed, multi-centre study designed to compare the effects of dual-release hydrocortisone preparations versus conventional glucocorticoid therapy on anthropometric parameters, metabolic syndrome, infectious, immunological profile, cardiovascular system, bone mass and quality of life in patients affected by primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual RElease Hydrocortisone Versus conventionAl Glucocorticoid replaceMent Therapy in Hypocortisolism (DREAM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypocortisolism is a disease with more than 80% 1-year mortality before the availability of synthetic glucocorticoids. Current replacement therapy has improved this dramatically, but recent data suggest that outcome is still compromised. Patient receiving conventional glucocorticoids therapy have compromised quality of life, reduced bone mass, increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease, infectious, tumors and premature mortality that is more than twice the mortality rate in the background population. Circulating cortisol levels follow a distinct diurnal pattern with high levels in the early morning and low trough values around midnight. Using available formulations for replacement therapy this circadian rhythm is had to mimic and also during the active time of the day high peaks and low troughs occur. In this trial a dual-release hydrocortisone preparations that has in healthy volunteers been able to mimic the circadian pattern of circulating cortisol was studied in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.</detailed_description>
