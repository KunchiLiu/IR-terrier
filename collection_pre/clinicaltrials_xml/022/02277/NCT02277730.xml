	<detailed_description>Hypotension occurs commonly during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section with maternal and fetal adverse effects. We developed a double-vasopressor automated system incorporating continuous non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring using Nexfin cardiac output monitor with a two-step algorithm. The system delivered phenylephrine 25 mcg or ephedrine 2 mg (if heart rate&lt;60 beats.min-1) every 30 seconds when systolic blood pressure was between 90-100% of baseline. The system delivered phenylephrine 50 mcg or ephedrine 4 mg (if heart rate&lt;60 beats.min-1) every 30 seconds when systolic blood pressure was &lt;90% of baseline. A randomised controlled trial will be done to compare with manual bolus technique. With the manual bolus technique, phenylephrine 50mcg or ephedrine 4mg (if heart rate&lt;60 beats.min-1) every 60 seconds when systolic blood pressure was between 90-100% of baseline. The system delivered phenylephrine 100mcg or ephedrine 8mg (if heart rate&lt;60 beats.min-1) every 60 seconds when systolic blood pressure was &lt;90% of baseline.</detailed_description>
