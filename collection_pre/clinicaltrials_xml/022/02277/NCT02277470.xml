	<brief_title>Study of the Pharmacokinetics of Golimumab in Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetic characteristics of golimumab will be assessed by using blood and stool samples; collected during induction and maintenance treatment Patients will undergo 13-16 blood sample collections, 13-16 stool sample collections and 3 endoscopies during 16 hospital visits in 1 year. They are also asked to fill in a short questionnaire (9x). At endoscopy visits a questionnaire regarding quality of life will be taken.The population pharmacokinetics of golimumab will be assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NON-MEM).</detailed_description>
