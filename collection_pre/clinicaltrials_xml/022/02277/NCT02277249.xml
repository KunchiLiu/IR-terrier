	<brief_summary>Current practice for the provision of late second trimester abortion (dilation and evacuation, or D&amp;E) often involves the administration of digoxin into the fetal compartment to induce fetal demise prior to the procedure. Digoxin may be administered transabdominally or transvaginally into the fetal compartment. Both modes of administration have been shown in prospective studies to be highly effective and safe. Both modes of administration are considered standard of care. This pilot study will directly compare transabdominal and transvaginal digoxin with respect to patient preference (i.e, patient pain score describing discomfort with injection).</brief_summary>
