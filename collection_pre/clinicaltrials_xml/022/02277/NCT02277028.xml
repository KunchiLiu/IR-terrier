	<brief_summary>This study will compare bilateral priming followed by task specific training to health care education followed by the same task specific training protocol. The intention is to understand the effects of priming on upper limb training post-stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bilateral Priming for Upper Extremity Hemiparesis in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Techniques to enhance use dependent plasticity have been examined in stroke rehabilitation research. The purpose of these techniques is to prime the cortex prior to training. The priming techniques previously described in the literature include medication (i.e. amphetamines), transcranial electric or magnetic stimulation, and manipulation of somatosensory input. Here, the investigators examine a priming technique which is non-invasive and free of side effects. The technique described in this study uses bilateral, symmetrical, rhythmic movement "bilateral priming" and its purpose is to ready the motor cortex for functional limb training. A "rocker" is used so that the less affected limb can drive the affected one in symmetrical wrist flexion and extension. In this project, the investigators intend to compare bilateral upper limb priming with task specfiic training to a health care education website program followed by the same task specific training as the experimental group.This active comparator (health care education) will receive stroke related health education via a website from the American Heart Association. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation willl include measurement of transcallosal inhibition persistence from the affected hemisphere to the less affected hemisphere and vice versa ( less affected to affected). The investigators expect the bilateral priming group to have greater changes in transcranial magnetic stimulation measures and greater improvements in behavioral measures at all time points.</detailed_description>
