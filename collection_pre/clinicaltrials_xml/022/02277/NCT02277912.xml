	<brief_title>Efficacy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in Central Post Stroke Pain ( CPSP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central post stroke pain is often very resistant to treatment. TMS has been shown to be a promising tool in treating difficult pain conditions. The best sites for stimulation are still not known and navigation has been used only in few studies. The aim is to evaluate the analgesic effects of Navigated Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( nrTMS ) on pain in a three armed crossover study. The navigation is done by using magnetic resonance imaging and stereotactic camera system. The three arms include stimulation to M1, S2 and sham stimulation to M1. 10 Hz repetitive stimulation is given to a specified location once a day 5 days a week for two weeks in each of the three arms. A months washout period is kept between each arm of the study. Pain and other variables are followed before, during and after the study for 6 months.</detailed_description>
