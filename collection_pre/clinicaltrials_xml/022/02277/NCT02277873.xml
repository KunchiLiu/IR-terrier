	<detailed_description>Retrospective, descriptive and observational study. Classical model performs comparisons of births among lunar periods, lineal, cubical and exponential estimation was performed in the SPSS software and the inflection point of the curve was estimated using the formula x=[In (1/ebx)]/ebx in the Geogebra model. The significance was establish by a p value of â‰¤ 0.05 (95% IC). The second analysis was performed by the difference of media between all the stages of the moon cycle as in another trials. The difference was establish by the T-student test. The difference between groups was performed by the one way ANOVA test.
