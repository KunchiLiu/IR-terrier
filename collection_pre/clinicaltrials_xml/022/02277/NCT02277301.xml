	<brief_title>Mellow Babies - a Pilot Waiting List Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychologically informed very early intervention programmes across the ante- and postnatal period have shown promise in delivering cost-effective long term positive outcomes. There is robust support for the view that early intervention to prevent and manage difficulties in the parent-infant relationship may produce long-term benefits such as reduction in rates of criminality, substance abuse and educational underachievement. A meta-analysis of sensitivity and attachment interventions in early childhood has shown that the most effective interventions use a moderate number of sessions (n=5-16) and are focussed on parental sensitivity. Although Mellow Parenting interventions (Mellow Babies is probably the best-evidenced) are quite widely used in a number of countries, no definitive randomised trials have been carried out. To date there has been a single small waiting list trial suggesting improvement in maternal mood and mother-child interaction, We aim to inform the design of a definitive RCT with a waiting-list control trial with adequate power to estimate an effect size. This is a parallel randomised open-label blinded end-point (PROBE) clinical trial with a waiting-list control group. The study will be conducted in three areas: Lisburn, North Down &amp; Ards, and Downpatrick. At least 50 women with infants under 18 months old will be recruited in September 2014. Participating women will be given information on the study, in particular being informed that participation would involve either receiving the intervention the following month or after a delay of 20 weeks. Signed consent (which will include consent to follow up after one year, beyond the timespan of this study) will be sought after an interval of at least 24 hours to allow the women to arrive at an informed decision.</detailed_description>
