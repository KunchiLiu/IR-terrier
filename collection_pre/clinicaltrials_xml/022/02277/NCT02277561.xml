	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well voxel based diffusion tensor imaging in predicting response in patients with brain metastases undergoing whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Voxel based diffusion tensor imaging (VB-DTI) may allow doctors to measure response to whole brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery earlier than is possible with a standard magnetic resonance imaging. The earlier ability to measure response may allow for consideration of alternative therapies at an earlier stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Voxel Based Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Predicting Response in Patients With Brain Metastases Undergoing Whole Brain Radiation Therapy or Stereotactic Radiosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if voxel based diffusion tensor imaging will provide an early predictive assessment of therapy response, as compared to radiographic volumetric response criteria. OUTLINE: Patients undergoing whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for a total of 10 fractions also undergo VB-DTI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 1 week after WBRT initiation, and 7-11 days after completion of WBRT. Patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) without WBRT also undergo VB-DTI MRI at baseline and 7-11 days after completion of SRS. After completion of study, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months and then every 6 months until death.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with multiple lesions from solid tumors on clinical MRI diagnosing the brain metastases may be treated with either WBRT or SRS if clinically indicated at the time of presentation but not both Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 70 Patients presenting with brain metastases from a newly diagnosed cancer may have systemic disease (brain disease at the time of initial cancer diagnosis) Patients with a history of cancer, but newly diagnosed brain metastases must have clinically stable systemic disease If a biopsy is performed, the patient has to be at least 1 week postbiopsy The patient must be able to commit to diffusionweighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and chemical shift imaging (CSI) prior to treatment, after the first week of treatment, and 711 days after the completion of treatment at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) Patients undergoing SRS without WBRT must be able to commit to diffusionweighted MR imaging, DTI, and CSI prior to treatment, and 711 days after the completion of the SRS treatment at the MRRC The patient must also be able to commit to posttreatment followup visits at Montefiore Medical Center involving serial MR imaging; the followup visits are to occur bimonthly for 6 months and then every 6 months until death Any medical condition, which would make the imaging studies or WBRT unsafe or poorly tolerated Patient is receiving concurrent chemotherapy Known allergic reaction to contrast or shellfish Patients with brain metastases to be treated with radiosurgery Patients with brain metastasis resulting from hematologic malignancies and small cell lung cancer Implanted metal devices or foreign bodies that serve as a contraindication to MR imaging Creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dl and creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mg/dl Uncontrolled, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias Severe claustrophobia Pregnant female Any prior radiation therapy to the brain KPS &lt; 70 Patients with leptomeningeal disease</criteria>
