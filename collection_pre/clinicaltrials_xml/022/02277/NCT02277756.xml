	<brief_summary>Pain insensibility is often described in people with autism. The aim of this study is to test the pain perception in adults with autistic spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. An experimental model of pain is used to measure endogenous modulation systems. Thermic stimulations (tonic heat pain stimulation and cold-pressor test) are used to test excitatory and inhibitory pain mechanisms. Salivary cortisol and automatic nervous system (heart rate and blood pressure with an electrocardiogram (Brest :system dantec keypoint natus G3 ; Paris: nexfin HDÂ®) are also tested and behavioral response to thermal stimulation assessed by an inspired behavior scale.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adults with autism without intellectual disability (IQ &gt; 85) are matched with members of siblings and control group (sex and chronological age). Pain reactivity (Visual analog scale,endogenous modulation systems, salivary cortisol, automatic nervous system and behavioral responses to thermal stimulation assessed by an inspired behavior scale.) in adult with autism is tested using an experimental model of pain. Excitatory and inhibitory modulation systems were elicited using a temporal summation test administered before and after activation of the Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) by means of a cold-pressor test. Demographic and clinical data are also collected (sensory profile, sleep disorders and depression inventory).</detailed_description>
