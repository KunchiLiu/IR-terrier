	<brief_summary>Medtronic , Inc. is sponsoring the World-wide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection Prevention Trial (WRAP-IT), a randomized, prospective, multi-center, single blinded, post-market, interventional clinical study. This study will evaluate the ability of the TYRX envelope to reduce major CIED infections through 12-months post-procedure following CIED generator replacement, upgrade, revision, or de novo CRT-D implant. Additionally, this large device study provides the unique opportunity to prospectively characterize the performance of Medtronic's lead monitoring features in subjects whose CIED system includes a transvenous RV defibrillation lead. Finally, the WRAP-IT study will serve as a post-approval study for those geographies requiring a post-approval study of the TYRX envelope.</brief_summary>

Patient has existing CIED and is undergoing IPG (including CRTP), ICD or CRTD replacement or upgrade with a new Medtronic generator i. Subjects planned to have leads added, or extracted and added for upgrades can be enrolled OR b. Patient will undergo a de novo Medtronic CRTD system implant per approved indications OR c. Patient has existing study eligible Medtronic CIED in which the pocket was not accessed within the last 365 days, and is undergoing pocket or lead revision Willing to provide the contact information for the physician who provides followup for his/her CIED Willing and able to comply with scheduled followup and study related activities Known allergy to minocycline or rifampin or their derivatives, or any other known contraindications to implantation of the TYRX envelope. Current therapy with chronic oral immunosuppressive agents or â‰¥ 20mg/day of Prednisone or equivalent. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Prior Cardiac transplantation or existing Ventricular Assist Device (VAD). Require longterm vascular access for any reason. Prior history of a CIED infection, other prosthetic device infection, or endovascular infection, including endocarditis, in the past 12 months. Physical, clinical, or laboratory signs or symptoms consistent with an active infection (including but not limited to pneumonia, urinary tract, cellulitis, or bacteremia) Systemic lupus erythematous, because minocycline has been reported to aggravate this condition Female patient who is pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not on a reliable form of birth control. Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to device procedure Participation in another study that may confound the results of this study. Coenrollment in concurrent trials is only allowed when documented preapproval is obtained from the Medtronic study manager.</criteria>
