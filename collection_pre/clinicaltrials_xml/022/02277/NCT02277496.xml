	<brief_summary>The project, which being conducted as stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, is designed to evaluate a participatory implementation model in NYC HealthCorps (HC) high schools and to assess outcomes within and across school settings . The behavioral objectives from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines to address obesity in youth include: 1) decreasing sugary beverage intake; 2) increasing frequency of breakfast; 3) increasing vegetable and fruit intake to 2Â½ cups per day;4) decreasing frequency of fast food meals;5) becoming physically active (goal of 1 hour per day); and 6) reducing sedentary behavior time (&lt;2 hour day). The study is employing system dynamics modeling (SDM) to assess wellness programming options and to evaluate the program implementation within the context of diverse school ecologies. The RE-AIM evaluation metric (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) is used to guide SDM development and validation. The Specific Aims are: 1. To refine the participatory school wellness program model and toolkits. The study team will add simulation exercises to engage stakeholders and refine toolkit strategies that address institutional/community level program implementation barriers and individual level barriers to achieving healthy lifestyle recommendations. 2. To assess the impact of participatory implementation programming in participating schools. Primary hypothesis: Students will achieve key health behaviors after their New York City (NYC) HealthCorps school is randomized to participatory implementation compared to students in the wait-listed HealthCorps control schools; Secondary hypothesis: Improvements in the key behaviors will be greater in students whose BMI z-scores decrease compare to those whose BMI z-scores did not decrease. 3. To evaluate implementation with system dynamics modeling to facilitate dissemination. The simulation analysis will apply the RE-AIM framework to address: Reach (participation rates), effectiveness (outcomes), adoption (acceptability), implementation (intervention fidelity), and maintenance (sustainability of lifestyle changes by students and programs by schools), in order to facilitate refining the toolkits and training program for dissemination to other school setting and diverse educational venues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wellness Program Implementation: School &amp; Student Toolkits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project focuses on enhancing implementation of school wellness activities with the goal of achieving federal lifestyle recommendations to reduce obesity. The study will evaluate whether using a toolkit approach with problem-solving and other strategies helps schools and students develop healthier lifestyle choices. At the school level, we will focus on implementation barriers identified by (or brought to) the school Wellness Councils (e.g., crowded gym, lack of equipment, food service issues) using a toolkit approach that builds on the Alliance for a Healthier Generation school toolkits. At the student level, the toolkit will focus on the FitnessGram feedback and self-assessment strategies to personalize behavioral goal setting when addressing obesity related lifestyle recommendations in physical education (PE) programming. A stepped-wedge trial design will be used to achieve sequential roll out to all NYC HealthCorps affiliated schools over time. This design allows for random selection of schools that will receive this enhanced support and uses participation research principles to determine how to address obesity-related school mandates. Consistent with participatory research principles, all HealthCorps coordinators have received training to function as Wellness Council facilitators. This study will evaluate a participatory implementation model designed to extend wellness and stakeholder collaborations towards achieving policy standards and goals focusing on specifics for FitnessGram testing, food service, and PE curriculum. By the end of the study, all HealthCorps schools will have participatory implementation for wellness programming with the order being randomly determined. A subset of four NYC HealthCorps-affiliated schools will be randomly selected each year to receive the participatory implementation support, with schools not yet randomized serving as the control schools. The structure of the trial involves a comparison of schools with participatory implementation of wellness programming and those with delayed implementation. This implementation approach increases the potential for learning lessons that can be generalized more widely as in pragmatic trials. In keeping with participatory research principles, school Wellness Councils will use data obtained during the trial as feedback for potential refinement of their toolkit components. The research team will work with school Wellness Councils and key stakeholders to develop additional school toolkit items utilizing problem-solving strategies and low-cost methods to address implementation barriers. The elements of participatory action research focus on forming a school Wellness Council partnership to build trust, shared vision, and mutual capacity, and includes engagement at multiple levels as well as active participation of stakeholders to create more salient and effective programs. The HealthCorps coordinator will guide stakeholders via the Wellness Council and by specific program area to engage in a 6-step iterative process listed below: 1. Examine local indicator data e.g., FitnessGram, Health Behavior Survey with Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (YBRFSS) items, food service data, school environment/climate data, community data 2. Consider how current programs/curricula and alternatives relate to behavioral indicators (using a social ecological framework) to student, family, school, and community consideration of media and other spheres of influence, 3. Develop program/curriculum S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time limited (considering semester/school year)) goals focusing on Dietary Guidelines and FitnessGram indicators 4. Identify barriers and develop strategies for the school and student toolkit 5. Implement school program elements with ongoing monitoring by stakeholders and the Wellness Council 6. Use an iterative process to adapt to new needs and sustain program Basic simulation models, such as the Grab-and-Go Breakfast model which will be used to demonstrate the potential effects of implementing a given toolkit option. The school and student toolkits developed during the formative evaluation will serve as a template to be used with the intervention schools. The initial training and guide/toolkit formatting will be based on those used by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation in their school wellness programming. Initial feedback from HealthCorps coordinators indicates that the Alliance Wellness Council guide/toolkit can be readily implemented in HealthCorps high schools. The HealthCorps coordinators will build on the Alliance's collaborative guidelines and training to enhance collaboration as an active Wellness Council. In addition, to build youth leadership thereby obtaining student support, the research team will work closely with an existing HealthCorps youth leadership program to address issues related to the family, (home food environment), school (food service, garden) and community (food options/ NYC Department of Health nutrition programs - Adopt-A-Bodega, Health Bucks for farmers' markets, Green Cart produce stands). During the wait-listed phase, the study provide no additional support to the wait-listed HealthCorps control schools, beyond the HealthCorps training/support program. However, the investigators provide training and technical support related to the FitnessGram measurements and data collection, consistent with the approach used by school-based participatory research projects to achieve measurement fidelity for control schools. The outcomes simulation will expand the types of data used to include the survey's psychosocial variables and extensive administrative data such as attendance, demographics, and reduced/free lunch and student, teacher and parent school evaluations. The simulation analysis will also integrate a data from the control students who have received no intervention. This group of students are considered the third arm, which is listed as the no intervention control students in the three arm trial.</detailed_description>
