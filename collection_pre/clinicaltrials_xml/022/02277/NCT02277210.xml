	<brief_summary>Oocyte aspiration under the guidance of transvaginal ultrasound is an integral part in IVF treatment. Follicular flushing has been advocated. However, subsequent data from randomized trials failed to demonstrate any benefits with routine follicular flushing in normally responding patients. Instead, it has been shown to prolong the operating time, increase the procedure-related pain and analgesics requirement. Most of the IVF centers no longer perform routine follicular flushing in normally responding patients. The potential role of follicular flushing in patients with a limited number of developing follicles is conflicting based on the recently published randomized trials. The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of follicular flushing on the ongoing pregnancy rate in patients who developed four or fewer follicles of 14mm following standard ovarian stimulation for IVF.</brief_summary>
