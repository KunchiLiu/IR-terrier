	<brief_title>Trial to Reduce Hospitalizations in Children With Medical Complexity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will pilot test an intervention that includes contingency planning and care transitions within an established medical home program caring for children with medical complexity. Children with medical complexity receiving care within the UCLA Medical Home Program will be randomized to the pilot intervention or usual medical home care. The primary goal will be to reduce admissions and readmissions in the intervention group.</detailed_description>
