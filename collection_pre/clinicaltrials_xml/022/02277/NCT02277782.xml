	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of intrathecal hydromorphone on the duration of labor analgesia and the incidence of epidural-associated temperature increase in laboring parturients. We hypothesize that intrathecal administration of longer-acting hydromorphone will: 1. Prolong the duration and improve the quality of analgesia in labor, and 2. Decrease the incidence of epidural-associated temperature increase in labor.</brief_summary>
