	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance is closely correlated with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Adipokines may play important roles in the pathogenesis of obesity, which are a link between obesity and obesity-related disorders.C1q/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP3) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) are novel adipokine that modulates the action of insulin in various diseases. This study addressed the relationship between CTRP3, RBP4 and IR in newly diagnosed obesity and essential hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum CTRP3 and RBP4 Levels in Obesity and Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serum CTRP3 and RBP4, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined in 480 newly diagnosed obesity and essential hypertensive patients not taking anti-obese and antihypertensive medications and 66 normal weight (NW) and normotensive subjects. All subjects were divided into two groups depending on body mass index (BMI), including NW group and obesity group, and then four subgroups were divided according to obesity and hypertension, including NW-normal blood pressure subgroup (NW-NBP), NW-hypertension subgroup (NW-HTN), obese-normal blood pressure subgroup (OB-NBP), obese-hypertension subgroup (OB-HTN).</detailed_description>
