	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to quantify the relative contribution of variables obtained during a physical fitness evaluation and a short screening questionnaire in determining the short-term and long term risk of persistent disabling low back pain in patients with chronic low back pain. It has been hypothesized that patients with higher physical fitness will present a lower risk of persistent disabling low back pain and so, a lower score on the questionnaire.</brief_summary>
