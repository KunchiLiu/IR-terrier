	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the longitudinal efficacy of a potassium nitrate mouthwash formulation when used as an adjunct to brushing with a standard fluoride dentifrice for the relief of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) compared to brushing with a standard fluoride dentifrice alone. This will be a single centre, eight week, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff Sensitivity Score of the two selected test teeth) study in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet all the criteria at the Screening and Baseline visit. Participants will be assessed at Baseline, and at four and eight weeks to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants in good general health, with selfreported history of dentinal hypersensitivity lasting more than 6 months but not more than 10 years. Participants with minimum of 20 natural teeth. At screening, a minimum of four, nonadjacent teeth. 1. Teeth showing signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or abrasion. 2. Teeth with Gingival Index score ≤1 and a clinical mobility of ≤1. 3. Teeth that are determined to be sensitive by the participant following a 1 second air blast to the cervical margin. Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes dry mouth. Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12 months of screening. In the 8 weeks prior to screening use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of DH.</criteria>
