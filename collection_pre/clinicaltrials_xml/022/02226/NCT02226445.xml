	<brief_summary>The investigators knowledge of factors associated with treatment drop-out and missed appointments among adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) within a naturalistic, clinical setting is very limited. Drop-out rates among adult ADHD patients in randomised controlled trials (RCTÂ´s) have been reported to be 26.6% - 50%, and similar rates are reported in two naturalistic studies of medication adherence. Based on proposed hypotheses that past behaviour patterns are more predictive of current behaviours of treatment drop-out and missed appointments than are sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the aim of the present study is to examine the associations of 1) sociodemographic variables, 2) clinical variables, 3) risk-taking behaviour 4) educational and occupational instability and 5) behaviours during primary/lower secondary school with treatment drop-out and number of missed appointments. The target group of the study consists of all patients who initiates assessment at the adult ADHD Clinic at Regional Psychiatric Services West, Herning, Central Denmark Region in the period from September 1, 2010 to September 1, 2011. The patients are referred to this Clinic from general practitioners and specialised psychiatric authorities. The investigators study is designed as an observational, cohort study in which the patients are offered medical and non-manualised psychosocial treatment as it is usually offered in this tertiary ADHD Clinic from which the data are collected. Data regarding sociodemography, clinical symptoms and impairments, risk-taking behaviour, educational and occupational instability and behaviours during primary/lower secondary school are collected using a semistructured protocol. In the investigators study the investigators define treatment drop-out as premature termination of ongoing treatment, without any prior clinical or agreed resolution. No standardized definition of treatment drop-out is used through out the literature of adherence to treatment among patients in the psychiatric care system.</brief_summary>
