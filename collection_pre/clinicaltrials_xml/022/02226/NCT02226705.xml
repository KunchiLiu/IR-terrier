	<brief_summary>Radical endoscopic transnasal surgery associated with medical treatment with liposomal amphotericine B may increase the local control of Rhino-Sinusal Mucormycosis and the survival rate. The objective of this study is to evaluate the local control rate and survival rate at 3 months after radical endoscopic transnasal surgery extended towards the skull base in association with antifungal therapy and early surgical reevaluation of the extent of the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Surgical Treatment of Rhino-Sinusal Mucormycosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Treatment of Rhino-Sinusal Mucormycosis remains a challenge because of the severity of the disease with high mortality rates. Mainly involving diabetic and immunodeficient patients, first clinical presentation is a common infection of the sinuses which can extend towards deep spaces of the face, orbits, the skull base and the brain. The mortality rates range from 20 to 50%, up to 80% in case of cerebral extension. through Transnasal Endoscopic Surgery extended to the Skull Base. Hypothesis : We hypothesize that infected tissues are devascularized and because of that antifungal therapies can hardly reach areas of infected tissues. Radical endoscopic transnasal surgery associated with medical treatment with liposomal amphotericine B may increase the local control of the disease and the survival rate. Clinical evaluation of the extent of the disease within the first 7 days following initial surgery may represent a prognosis factor. Methods : First national mutlicentric and multidisciplinary cohort on Rhino-Sinusal Mucormycosis Radiological staging for evaluation of the extent of the disease using CT scan, MRI and PET Scan at initial stage before surgery Radical surgery and/or endoscopic transnasal surgery extended towards the skull base associated with liposomal amphotericine B medical treatment. At day 7 new radiological evaluation and second surgical look to adapt surgical resection of infected tissues, perform biopsies to search for mycormycosis, biofilms and dosage of the concentration of liposomal amphotericin B inside tissues. New radiological and surgical looks in case of absence of local control obtained on the second look and further. Study of the response rate by an endoscopic &amp; scan follow-up (with biopsies for anatomopathological et mycological studies) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months &amp; one year. PET scan initially &amp; at 3 months. Number of subjects included : Phase II type trial (exclusion of a zero hypothesis of survival rate &lt;50% ), N= 23 patients Total length of the study 4 years Inclusion period time : 3 years Time of participation per patient : 1 year Number of center and/or participating departments: 24 Mean number of patients included per year and per center : 0 to 3 patients</detailed_description>
