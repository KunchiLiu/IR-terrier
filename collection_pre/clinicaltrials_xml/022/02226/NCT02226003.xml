	<brief_summary>This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) in combination with sitagliptin in the treatment of participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise. The primary hypothesis of the study is that ertugliflozin plus sitagliptin is more effective in lowering of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) than placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each participant will be in the study for approximately 39 weeks including: a 1-week screening period, an 8-week (or greater) antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) wash-off period, a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a 26-week double-blind treatment period, and a post-treatment telephone contact 14 days after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>
