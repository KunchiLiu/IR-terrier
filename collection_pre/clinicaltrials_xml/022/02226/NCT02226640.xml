	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is approaching epidemic prevalence in the US adult population (over 1 in 10 of all US adults over 20). Diabetes is diagnosed based on fasting hyperglycemia, oral glucose intolerance or markers of hyperglycemia such as HbA1c. However, we now recognize that diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder. With the existing overly simplistic diagnostic criteria, treatment failure rates are high for virtually every agent currently in the drug arsenal - including insulin. In the late 1990's oncologists pioneered the use of high-throughput molecular technologies, such as transcriptome profiling and more recently metabolomics to identify discrete sub-classes of cancers that cannot be distinguished histologically or by a small number of biochemical markers. That effort rapidly accelerated the pace of scientific discovery and quickly led to the development of personalized cancer therapeutics. We believe that those cancer efforts provide a roadmap for biomarker discovery and personalized therapy in diabetes. molecular phenotyping (profiling the metabolome, transcriptome, and epigenome) with advanced bioinformatics analysis will identify discrete subtypes of diabetes - ushering in a new era of personalized diagnosis and therapy in diabetes.</detailed_description>
