	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), combined with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is now the standard first and second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. The efficacy of bevacizumab with cytotoxic agents in the third-line treatment of patients with mCRC is still unknown.</brief_summary>
