	<brief_summary>In the critically patient bed rest and immobilization are some of the responsable of the development of respiratory complications. Early physical exercise is a tool to prevent respiratory complications as lost of respiratory muscle strength, decrease in functional residual capacity and hypoxemia improving oxygenation. New technology as electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are available to visualize changes of regional lung aeration. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of early physical exercise improving alveolar recruitment and pulmonary ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, evaluated with EIT. The ICU patients included at day of evaluation will be evaluated continuously with EIT in different positions. 1) in the supine position (at 30Â° of inclination), 2) Sitting in chair 3) Active physical exercise 4) And rest in chair after exercise</brief_summary>
