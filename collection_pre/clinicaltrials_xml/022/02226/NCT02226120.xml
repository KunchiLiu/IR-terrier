	<criteria>1. Written informed consent for the extension must be obtained before any assessment is performed. 2. Patients who have completed PARADIGMHF (protocol CLCZ696B2314) and are able to be safely enrolled into the openlabel trial as judged by the investigator. 1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer 2. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the study drugs, drugs of similar chemical classes, ACEIs, ARBs, or NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to LCZ696 3. Known history of angioedema 4. Requirement of simultaneous treatment with both ACEIs and ARBs 5. Current acute decompensated HF (exacerbation of chronic HF manifested by signs and symptoms that may require intravenous therapy) 6. Symptomatic hypotension and/or a SBP &lt; 100 mmHg at Visit 1 (screening) 7. Estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 as measured by the simplified MDRD formula at Visit 1 (screening) 8. Presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis 9. Serum potassium &gt; 5.2 mmol/L at Visit 1 (screening) 10. Evidence of hepatic disease as determined by any one of the following: AST or ALT values exceeding 3 x ULN at Visit 1, history of hepatic encephalopathy, history of esophageal varices, or history of portacaval shunt 11. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women 12. Women of childbearing potential 13. Any condition, not identified in the protocol, that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to prevent the patient from safely tolerating LCZ696 or complying with the requirements of the study.</criteria>
