	<brief_summary>The objective of the present trial is to demonstrate Magnetic stimulation as an useful complementary treatment in order to improve patients' evolution without the need of extensive surgical lesion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Antagonistic Muscle Magnetic Stimulation and Selective Periferal Neurotomy to Improve Results on Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with refractory post stroke upper right limb spasticity will operated by Median nerve or Median/ Cubital selective neurotomy depending upon more affected territories. Some of them could be also also operated with posterioris tibialis neurotomy to treat equine's foot whenever also clinically present. Preoperative motor blocks might be possitive in all cases. A week later, they will be treated by magnetic stimulation on selected antagonistic muscles, related to pre - operative affected ones, mostly deltoids, triceps and finger extensors with an equipment Dipol Zeta D5 (Russian Federation), with 1.5 tesla of intensity. Trials will be repeated twice a week in sessions of 30 minutes during 6 months with simultaneous intensive classic rehabilitation. Patients will be monthly evaluated by the mean score of Modified Ashworth Scale, related to fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder and also with Barthel Scale.</detailed_description>
