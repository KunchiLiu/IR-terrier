	<brief_summary>Exclusion of the LAA(Left Atrial Appendage) using the TigerPaw II System with VATS technique is safe and effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Video-Assisted Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this confirmatory study is to demonstrate that the LAAx, Inc. TigerPaw® II System can be safely and effectively used to exclude the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) during cardiac surgery utilizing thoracoscopic camera and light source and thus remove, from the cleared indication for use, the direct vision limitation.</detailed_description>
