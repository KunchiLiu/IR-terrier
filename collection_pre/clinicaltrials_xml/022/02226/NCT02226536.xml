	<brief_summary>Introduction: the global sugar consumption has increased in the past 50 years and their abusive intake is responsible for the insulin resistance and causes the metabolic syndrome - obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary heart disease. Objective: To evaluate the effect of scheduled diet without glucose as treatment of labyrinthine disorders associated with glucose-insulin index. Study Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients and Methods: A study conducted at the University of SÃ£o Paulo with 51 patients divided into two groups: Diet Group (DG) that comprises subjects treated with fractionated diet with glucose restriction and control group (CG) where individuals were not counseled regarding diet. Patients underwent computerized dynamic posturography - sensory organization test (CDP - SOT) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in the first and thirtieth days of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>51 patientes with dizziness and glucose intolerance diagnosed by the glucose tolerance test were selected. The subjects were submited to CDP SOT conditions and a visual analogue scale to measure his self perception about dizziness. Then, they were randomized in two groups: with and without fractioned diet without glucose during 30 days. The CDP was repeated in order to verify a statistical difference of SOT condition 5 that reflects the individual hability to maintain the own posture with the vestibule solely and CS - that represents the final balance situation. The VAS was repeated too in order to verify the self perception of the dizziness after diet.</detailed_description>
