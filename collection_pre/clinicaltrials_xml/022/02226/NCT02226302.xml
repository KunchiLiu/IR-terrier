	<brief_summary>The objective is to develop an organotypic model to assess the effects of obesity on the expression and methylation status of estrogen-responsive genes in endometrial cancer. Omental fat samples will be removed from participants during surgery and these fat samples will be used in laboratory analyses.</brief_summary>
