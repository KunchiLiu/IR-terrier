	<criteria>Male or female subjects, 18 years or older. Subjects diagnosed with either POAG or OHT in both eyes. The diagnosis of POAG must include evidence of: 1. Optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer structural abnormalities (substantiated by OCT); and/or 2. Visual field abnormality (substantiated with the Humphrey automated perimeter using the SITA Standard 242 testing algorithm. Mean deviation (MD) score must be 15dB &lt; MD &lt; 0dB. Subjects with a 9:00AM (+/ 1 hour) median IOP in both eyes that is: 1. Greater than or equal to 18mmHg at the Screening Visit or have documented history of IOP being greater than or equal to 22mmHg; 2. Greater than or equal to 22mmHg at both Eligibility Visits. Subjects currently using one or more topical medications to control their IOP. Subjects able and willing to comply with the protocol, including randomization assignment and all followup visits. Subjects that sign the informed consent form. Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study. Subjects with any form of glaucoma other than primary openangle glaucoma (e.g., pseudo exfoliation or pigmentary glaucoma). Other exclusion criteria apply</criteria>
