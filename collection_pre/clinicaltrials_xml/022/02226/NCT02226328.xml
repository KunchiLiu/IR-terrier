	<brief_summary>Flexible bronchoscopy almost always requires sedation to be successful. In order to increase the availability of propofol for sedation, non-anaesthesiologist administered propofol sedation has been suggested as an alternative to traditional midazolam/opioid sedation or the general anaesthesia provided by anaesthesiologists. Hypothesis: Patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy prefers non-anaesthesiologist administered sedation with propofol as opposed to non-anaesthesiologist administered sedation with midazolam and fentanyl. Propofol sedation is as safe as midazolam and fentanyl sedation.</brief_summary>
