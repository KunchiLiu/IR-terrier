	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a disease in which the immune system attacks the healthy cells and tissues, causing inflammation that can damage organs in the body. About 50% of SLE patients experience inflammation in the kidneys. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of two dosing arms of ACTHar gel in treating proliferative Lupus Nephritis (LN). This study hypothesizes that both dosing arms of ACTHar are safe and effective in treating proliferative LN (Class III and IV).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that mainly affects females of childbearing age. The disease is characterized by immune activation and the development of autoantibodies. About 50% of SLE patients experience inflammation of the kidneys. Lupus Nephritis (LN) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), accompanied by Prednisone, is considered the current standard of care for LN. However, long-term use of Prednisone has many serious side effects. ACTHar Gel is an FDA approved drug comprised of an active substance called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH belongs to an anti-inflammatory group called melanocortins and carries out its effects by binding to five different melanocortin receptors (MCRs). Specifically, ACTH binding to melanocortin 2 receptor subtype (MC2R) on the adrenal cortex stimulates the production of cortisol that reduces inflammation in the kidney. In addition to binding to melanocortin 1-5 receptor subtype (MC1-5R) and acting directly on kidney tissues, ACTH may bind to MCRs on various cell types, such as immune cells, and activate processes to protect the kidney. This study will evaluate the most effective dose of ACTHar gel in proliferative LN (Class III and IV) when given with MMF, the standard of care LN therapy. The intent of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of ACTHar gel in an attempt to change the clinical care requirements regarding steroid use in treating LN.</detailed_description>
