	<brief_summary>Traumatic events have potentially debilitating long-lasting effects on the child's normal development and, therefore, should be effectively treated. Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy has been found to be effective in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults and in adolescents. It has not yet been tested in toddlers. The purpose of this study is to examine the treatment efficacy of 2 methods of treatment for toddlers with PTSD and their parents. A randomized control trial could examine the efficacy of PE versus dyadic play therapy (TP-CT). Exploration of these questions under more rigorous conditions would help broaden our knowledge about developmentally sensitive treatment tools for this age group. Our research hypotheses are: 1. PE would more effective than TP-CT in reducing post-traumatic symptoms in toddlers. 2. PE would more effective than TP-CT in reducing post-traumatic symptoms of the toddlers' parents. 3. These results will be preserved in a follow-up of 3-6 months post treatment. Following psychiatric assessment, 100 toddlers will be randomly assigned to PE and TP-CT (50 participants in each group).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Beyond what was detailed in the previous section of the brief summary, it should be noted that the toddlers will be assessed and treated at least 1 month post-trauma and at least 1 month after discharge from hospital in order to avoid acute reaction either to the traumatic event or to the medical procedures during their hospitalization and adjustment problems.</detailed_description>
