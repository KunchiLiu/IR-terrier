	<brief_title>ShearWaveâ„¢ Elastography of Breast Lesions in Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chinese women are known to have denser breasts than women in Western countries. Mammography cannot find abnormalities easily in denser breasts, while breast ultrasound is not affected by density. Adding elastography, a stiffness measurement, to a breast ultrasound exam should improve the diagnosis of a lesion.</detailed_description>
