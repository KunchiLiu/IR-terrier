	<brief_summary>Mind-body practices, such as yoga, ta'i chi, mindfulness and biofeedback, commonly use slow breathing techniques to induce physiological and mental relaxation. Medical research suggests that slow breathing techniques induce physiological relaxation. This 6 week study will compare the effects of different types of breathing. The hypothesis is that different breathing techniques produce different physiological and mental changes.</brief_summary>
