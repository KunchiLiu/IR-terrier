	<brief_summary>According to the World Health Organization, cancer is a leading cause of death in men and women, accounting for 7.6 million deaths (around 13% of all deaths) in 2008. Surgery remains the best option for patients presenting with operable Stage I or II cancers, however the five year survival rate for these candidates remains at a dismally low. The high rates of recurrence suggest that surgeons are unable to completely detect and remove primary tumor nodules in a satisfactory manner as well as lingering metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. By ensuring a negative margin through near-infrared imagery it would be possible for us to improve the rates of recurrence from patients and thus overall survival.</brief_summary>
