	<brief_summary>The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that Intra-Articular Hyaluronic Acid (IAHA) is superior to placebo in slowing structural progression and on long term symptomatic effect in primary knee Osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The investigators will perform a multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Assess the Structural Effect and Long-term Symptomatic Relief of Intra-articular Injections of Hyaluronic Acid in Primary Knee OA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The target population will be patients with the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis who are followed at two Portuguese hospitals (Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Norte - Hospital Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental - Hospital Egas Moniz). All patients selected will be included in the intention-to-treat group. Then, using blocked randomization method they will be assigned to receive either IAHA, or placebo (saline solution). At both hospitals the study will consist of four injections of IAHA, 6 months apart, plus a 6 month period after the injection, resulting in a total follow-up period of 24 months. Before each new cycle a follow-up consultation will be performed in order to assess pain and function (KOOS), quality of life (SF-36), adverse events and consumption of acetaminophen and NSAIDS regarding the week before evaluation. X-rays will be performed in the beginning of follow-up, one year after that and 6 months after the last cycle of IAHA or placebo injections (24 months). Ultrasound evaluation will be performed at the target knee in same time points as X-rays by two rheumatologists trained in musculoskeletal ultrasound examination. Additionally, the investigators will assess potential biochemical biomarkers of knee OA structural progression and response to treatment. Measurements will be performed in both serum and urine and, If possible, synovial fluid aspiration will be performed and together with blood and urine samples stored at the Biobanco-IMM Instituto de Medicina Molecular for analysis. Biologic samples collection will be performed at baseline and repeated at the 4th, 12th, 24th, 36th weeks, and then every 6 months.</detailed_description>
