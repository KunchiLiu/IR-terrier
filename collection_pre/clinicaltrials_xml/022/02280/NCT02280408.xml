	<brief_summary>Ebola virus has infected and killed people, mostly in Africa. In 2014, the Ebola virus has affected several thousand people. There is no approved effective way to treat or prevent Ebola. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine for it. This is a study of the anti-Ebola vaccine VSV ZEBOV (BPSC-1001) to see if it is safe and to see how it affects people's immune system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of Prime-Boost Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) Ebola Vaccine in Healthy Adults (V920-002)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 1994 and the present, there have been many Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks affecting mostly central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of individuals affected and in disruption of typical activities of civil society. This is a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study to evaluate a novel vaccine to Ebola using a live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replacing the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola (VSVΔG-ZEBOV also known as BPSC-1001).</detailed_description>

A clinically significant condition or process includes but is not limited to: A process that would affect the immune response A process that would require medication that affects the immune response Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert grave danger to the participant s health or wellbeing during the study period A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with reactions to vaccine Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below Active malignancy Asplenia History of GuillainBarré Syndrome History of neurological or neuropsychiatric disorder that may either increase risk (history of encephalitis, narcolepsy, stroke, depression, bipolar disorder, seizure, etc.) or could interfere with the assessment of safety (e.g., frequent headaches) History of autoimmune disease History of hemoglobinopathy or a coagulopathy Women who are breastfeeding Positive urine or serum pregnancy test Abnormal chemistry panel; defined as: Defined as any Grade 3 or greater toxicity (regardless of clinical significance) by the toxicity table Evaluating only creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate Abnormal complete blood count (CBC) defined as: Defined as any Grade 3 or greater toxicity (regardless of clinical significance) by the toxicity table Evaluating only the white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets Abnormal urinalysis defined as: Defined as any Grade 3 or greater toxicity (regardless of clinical significance) by the toxicity table Evaluating red blood cells (RBC), protein, and glucose only Positive serology for hepatitis B surface antigen Positive serology for hepatitis C Positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Known allergy to the components of the VSVΔGZEBOV vaccine (BPSC1001) vaccine product (VSV, albumin, tris) History of severe local or systemic reactions to any vaccination or a history of severe allergic reactions FACTORS THAT MAY LIMIT VSB REPLICATION OR MAKE INTERPRETATION OF IMMUNOGENICITY DIFFICULT: History of prior infection with a filovirus or prior participation in a filovirus vaccine trial Veterinarian or ranchers exposed to livestock known to be infected with VSV History of prior infection with VSV or receipt of a VSV vectored vaccine FACTOR THAT WOULD INCREASE RISK TO OTHERS DUE TO VSB VIRAL SHEDDING: Is a healthcare worker who will have direct contact with patients within 14 days of each vaccination Is an animal care worker, who will have direct contact with animals (livestock or domestic, besides subjects family pet) within 14 days of each vaccination Has a household contact (HHC) who is immunodeficient (in the opinion of the investigator), pregnant, has an unstable medical condition, or is under the age of 5 years Is a childcare worker who has direct contact with children 5 years of age or younger FACTORS THAT COULD IMPAIR INTERPRETATION OR EXECUTION OF THE STUDY: Receipt of any investigational drug within 5 half lives or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration (i.e., Day 0) Receipt of licensed vaccines 14 days before the planned study immunization Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 120 days preceding study entry or that are planned during the study period Immunosuppressive medications received within 168 days before first vaccination. (Not including: [1] corticosteroid nasal spray for allergic rhinitis; [2] topical corticosteroids for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or [3] oral/parenteral corticosteroids given for nonchronic conditions not expected to recur [length of therapy 10 days or less with completion at least 30 days prior to vaccination(s)].) Allergy treatment with antigen injections within 30 days before first vaccination or that are scheduled through Day 56 Participants who, in the judgment of the investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the requirements of this protocol</criteria>
