	<brief_summary>Individuals older than 60 years old, discharged after suffering brain stroke with referral to the rehabilitation outpatient clinic, will be assessed for orthostatic balance. Patients with positive Romberg test are invited to participate in the trial. Participants will be randomized to either the current rehabilitation protocol or to an supplemental intervention focused on oculomotor and gaze stability exercises to be applied at home for three weeks. Participants will be assessed with standardized, validated tools.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Oculomotor and Gaze Stability Exercises on the Improvement of Balance After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aims to evaluated the effect of a home program of oculomotor and gaze stability exercises on improvement the balance in stroke patients. Individuals older than 60 years old, discharged after suffering brain stroke and referred to the neurologic rehabilitation outpatient clinic, will be assessed for a neuro-motor deficits. Patients will be consider eligible if they had positive Romberg test (disorder of orthostatic balance) and they will be invited to participate in the trial. Patients with previous balance problems will be excluded. Participants will be allocated in two intervention groups through block randomization, either the current rehabilitation protocol or to an supplemental intervention focused on oculomotor and gaze stability exercises to be applied at home for three weeks. Participants will be assessed with Motor Assessment Scale, Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test.</detailed_description>
