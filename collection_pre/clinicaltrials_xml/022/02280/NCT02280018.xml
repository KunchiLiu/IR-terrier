	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of JNJ-49122944 in healthy male participants after a single intravenous ([IV] within a vein) dose administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of a Single Intravenous Dose of JNJ-49122944 in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), and single-center study. The study will consist of Screening Period (2 to 21 days prior to participants' dose administration), Double-blind Treatment Period (single dose of JNJ-49122944 or placebo on Day 1), and Safety Follow-up Period (4 to 7 days after discharge). The total duration of participation for each participant, including screening, will be up to approximately 4 weeks. Blood samples will be collected for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
