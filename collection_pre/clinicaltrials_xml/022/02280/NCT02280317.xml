	<criteria>The study will enrol patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. The MTD/MAD may also be evaluated in patients with other advanced tumour types for whom no standard effective therapy is available and a rationale for use of VAL201 exists. The average timeframe is 13 weeks per subject and the outcome measured is a composite average for each group. Inclusion criteria: Specific Inclusion Criteria for Patients with Prostate Cancer Patients with incurable, locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer where a policy of intermittent hormone therapy has been decided. Who have specific clinical parameters. Specific Inclusion Criteria for Patients with Other Advanced Solid Tumours Patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumour for whom no standard effective therapy is available and a rationale for use of VAL201 exists. Patients with incurable, locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer where a policy of intermittent hormone therapy has been decided. These patients must also have the following: 1. Rising PSA on three consecutive samples (once noncastrate levels established); each over 2 weeks apart, with the last two values being greater than 2 ng/mL. Higher than and at least 25% over the nadir. 2. Absent or very mild prostate cancerrelated symptoms. 3. No plans for any therapy for prostate cancer in the next two months. General Inclusion Criteria for all Patients Adult patients defined by age greater than 18 years at time of consent. Ability to give written, informed consent prior to any studyspecific Screening procedures, with the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice. Patient is capable of understanding the protocol requirements, is willing and able to comply with the study protocol procedures, and has signed the informed consent document. Evaluable disease, either measurable on imaging, or with informative tumour marker(s) and a set of specific biochemical and haematological parameters relating to the specific cancer. Negative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test in women of childbearing potential. Sexually active male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control. Female patients may be surgically sterile. Laboratory values at Screening: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L. Platelets ≥100 x 109/L. Haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL without blood transfusion or colony stimulating factor support. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); AST (SGOT) ≤2.5 times the ULN; ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 times the ULN; ≤5 x ULN for patients with advanced solid tumours with liver metastases. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &gt;50 mL/min based on the CockcroftGault formula. Exclusion criteria Specific Exclusion Criteria for Patients with Prostate Cancer Patients has received an anticancer therapy, including investigational agents, within the precious 6 weeks or 4 weeks. Any patients who have undergone prior orchidectomy. Specific Exclusion Criteria for Patients with Other Advanced Solid Tumours Pregnant or lactating female patients. Documented, symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases. History of clinically significant cardiac condition, including ischemic cardiac event, myocardial infarction or unstable cardiac disease within 3 months previous to the indication of home therapy. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus positivity. Active Hepatitis B or C or other active liver disease (other than malignancy). Any active, clinically significant, viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection within previous 4 weeks prior to home therapy. Any medical history that would jeopardize compliance.</criteria>
