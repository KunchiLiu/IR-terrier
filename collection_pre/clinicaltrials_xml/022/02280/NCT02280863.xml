	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a hybrid closed loop (HCL) system in participants with type 1 diabetes. This HCL system utilizes the PID-IFB controller during the day and night in a closely monitored outpatient environment to allow assessment of the practical aspects of using the system for both the participant with diabetes and their parent or designated remote monitor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid Closed-Loop Hotel Studies With Medtronic PID Controller</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will be asked to use the CGM and the study insulin pump provided for approximately 3 to 7 days prior to initiation of the HCL PID-IFB system. All participants with diabetes and the parent/ guardian of participants &lt; 18 years of age will be asked to stay overnight in a hotel while the HCL PID-IFB system is on and to remain close to Stanford University during the day. For participants &gt; 18 years of age, designated remote monitors will be asked to receive alerts for low/ high glucose levels. In order to assess user experience/ evaluation of the system both the participants with diabetes using the HCL and the parent/ legal guardian of participants &lt; 18 years of age or the designate remote monitor for participants &gt; 18 years of age will also be asked to provide their consent to participate in these evaluations.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment; C peptide level and antibody determinations are not needed.)

Subject has performed an average of at least 3 meter glucose readings per day in the preceding 2 weeks Subject has used a downloadable insulin pump for at least 3 months Subject comprehends written English Female patients who are sexually active must be on acceptable method of contraception e.g. oral contraceptive pill, diaphragm, IUD Female patients must have a negative urine pregnancy test Informed Consent Form signed by the subject and/or parent and assent signed by the subject if &lt; age 18 Parent/guardian (for subjects &lt; 18 years) and subject understand the study protocol and agree to comply with it. Both parents must sign if possible. Total daily insulin requirement greater than 0.4 units/kg/day over the preceding two weeks. No expectation that subject will be moving out of the area of the clinical center during the study. Adults will need to be working within 20 minutes of our research staff during the day. A person willing to fulfill the role of a remote monitor (such as parent, spouse or significant other).
