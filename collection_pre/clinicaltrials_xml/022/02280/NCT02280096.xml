	<brief_summary>Twenty four RRMS patients over the age of 18, with similar degree of disability, and with an evolution of at last 6 months, who are in first-line immunomodulatory therapy and have a stable disease (no more than one outbreak per year) will be included in the present study. Patients will be administered a neuropsychological test battery selected for this study and divided into two sessions of one and a half-hour each. Emotional state will be assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory in a different session. Cognitive impairment is defined as the alteration of two or more neuropsychological tests. Patients will be divided randomly into two groups where one will receive placebo and the other one 4-AP for a period of four months in increasing doses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with stable multiple sclerosis are being recruited from the neurological services of IMSS at the hospital CMN Siglo XXI over the period of 1 year. Of those meeting inclusion criteria, 24 will be selected for the study. After signing an informed consent, they will be randomized into 12 for the intervention arm and 12 for the placebo arm. All patients will receive capsules for daily consumption according to their assignment, with no visible difference between capsules. Dosage will be 6.5-7.5 mg/kg to a limit of 50 mg. These capsules will be taken for a period of 4 months. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered at baseline, after 4 months, and after an additional four months of follow-up to assess cognitive performance and motor function. Emotional state will be assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory at each of the three aforementioned points. After the follow-up period, all test results will be analyzed and compared to determine the efficacy and safety of 4-aminopyridine on the cognitive performance and motor function of patients. Mann-Whitney U will be used for statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
