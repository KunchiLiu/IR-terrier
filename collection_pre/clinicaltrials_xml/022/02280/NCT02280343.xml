	<brief_summary>Inhalation of dust containing asbestos results in a process of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis called asbestosis. The Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) evaluates the respiratory mechanics describing resistive, elastic and inertial properties. We believe that this technique may contribute to the early diagnosis of asbestosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oscillation Mechanics of the Respiratory System Asbestos Exposed: Early Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of this study were (1) to use the FOT to analyze how respiratory mechanics is affected in patients with asbestos exposed, (2) to identify the best FOT parameters for the diagnosis of respiratory changes in these patients (3) Assess whether the presence of obstructive changes is associated with the smoking habit.The control group (CG) included 24 subjects with normal spirometric data and without a history of smoking or pulmonary disease formed by workers and students UERJ and FioCruz. Volunteers with asbestos exposure were from the Department of CESTEH/ FioCruz, totaling 24 exposed and 7 with diagnoses of asbestosis. The diagnosis of asbestosis was established based on a history of substantial exposure to asbestos dusts and compatible radiological features, together with exclusion of other competing diagnoses. The tests included a standardized questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, clinical evaluation; Plain radiography of the chest; FOT, plethysmography and spirometry, in that order.</detailed_description>
