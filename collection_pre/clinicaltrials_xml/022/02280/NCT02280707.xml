	<brief_summary>This study, randomized, delivered, and analyzed at the school level, evaluated the effect of simple, structural changes to school lunch rooms to make drinking water easier for students during lunch time. Half of the schools received posters promoting drinking water and installed cup dispensers stocked with cups next to lunchroom water fountains, while the other half received no intervention. The intervention outcomes were average water consumption and the proportion of students in the lunchroom who opted to drink water, as well as the proportion of students with sugary drinks at lunch. No identifying information on individual children was collected.</brief_summary>
