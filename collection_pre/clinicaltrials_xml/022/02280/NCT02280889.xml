	<brief_summary>Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are a quite common congenital disorder. Over years, surgical excision was proposed to the patients because transformation into a malignant skin tumor (melanoma) was feared. Recent data proof that the risk for malignancy was overestimated. Nowadays still a lot of patients express their wish for surgical removal out of aesthetic reasons and psychological impacts. Many patients and families experience stigmatization because of the nevus. To proof a medical indication for surgical removal the investigators want to evaluate the quality of life and stigmatization before and after nevus surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Stigmatization in Children With Congenital Melanocytic Nevi Before and After Nevus Excision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All children with CMN that will have their nevus removed in our surgical department will be asked to participate. The investigators will send a package of questionnaires to evaluate quality of life and stigmatization before nevus surgery. One year after surgical therapy is finished (sometimes more then one session is necessary), the scar will be clinically evaluated and also another questionnaire package will be sent to evaluate the same parameters again. All parameters are checked for the patients and the families as well. Therefore self and proxy reports of the parents are asked. Moreover, for the patients this is done with interviews in case they are older than 7 years.</detailed_description>
