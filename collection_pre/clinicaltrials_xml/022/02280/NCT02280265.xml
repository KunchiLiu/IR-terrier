	<brief_summary>Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive, congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or defective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Prophylaxis is recommended as the standard of care for boys with severe haemophilia by WHO and World Federation Of Hemophilia (WFH). The efficacy and safety of prophylaxis in preventing bleeds and arthropathy in patients with hemophilia has been confirmed in well-designed clinical studies.To keep the factor level above 1%, the standard dosage for patients with severe hemophilia A is 20-40 Units /kg/infusion (average 30 Units /kg) every other day or three times a week. This dosage has a very high consumption of factor, up to 5000-6000 international unit (IU)/kg/year. The high consumption of factor and cost present a major barrier to use the standard prophylaxis in many countries particularly in the developing world. In China the majority of boys with severe hemophilia A can only pay for on-demand treatment or low-dose prophylaxis. Ao after the affordability of patients was solved and many patients will get more chance to receive standard prophylaxis. This study is designed to evaluate the Annual Bleeding rate (ABR), joint health outcomes and QoL outcomes in subjects using ADVATE(Recombinant Human Coagulation Factor VIII for injection) standard prophylaxis under the conditions of routine practice.</brief_summary>
