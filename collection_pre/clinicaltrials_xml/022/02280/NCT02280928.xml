	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to (1) develop and test the effectiveness of home-based interventions on dual-task performance in older adults; and (2) determine the generalizability of the four trainings (i.e. single-task motor training, single-task cognitive training, dual-task motor-cognitive training, and dual-task cognitive-cognitive trainings) to novel tasks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development and Evaluation of a Home-Based Dual-Task Training Program to Improve Balance Performance for Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although, dual-task motor-cognitive training has proven to be more effective in improving dual-task balance performance than traditional single-task motor training, poor evidence of training-related transfer to a novel dual task has been shown. Additionally, another important impediment to the development of intervention to improve dual-task balance performance is that the previous studies have largely focused on training in a laboratory, or clinical setting, often with one-on-one supervision by a therapist or research assistant. Even though the home-based approach is more pragmatic, desirable, and encourages accessibility, no study has been done to examine the efficacy of home-based dual-task training. Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps in the literature by conducting a home-based program designed to improve dual-task performance with a broader transfer-of-training effects in older adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups (i.e. single-task motor training, single-task cognitive training, dual-task motor-cognitive training, and dual-task cognitive-cognitive trainings).</detailed_description>
