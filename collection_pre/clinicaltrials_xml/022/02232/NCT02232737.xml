	<brief_summary>This study will examine extended exposure to cigarettes varying in nicotine content among people with affective disorders. People with affective disorders are at an increased risk for smoking, nicotine dependence, and using high nicotine yield cigarettes and are also at significantly increased risk for smoking-related adverse health consequences. Studies testing an innovative regulatory strategy of reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to a non-addictive level have shown promising beneficial effects (decreased smoking rate, reduced toxicant exposure, and increased cessation) in the general population of smokers. However, these studies have uniformly excluded vulnerable populations like people with current affective disorders, who may respond differently considering their greater vulnerability to smoking and nicotine dependence. Thus, little is known scientifically about how this highly vulnerable subgroup of smokers may respond to a nicotine reduction policy. This project is designed to fill that substantial knowledge gap.</brief_summary>
