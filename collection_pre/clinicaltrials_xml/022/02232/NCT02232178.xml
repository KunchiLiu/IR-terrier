	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics, Relative Bioavailability and Safety of Xaracoll Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernioplasty is a common surgery. Common surgical methods used include laparoscopic and open placement of synthetic mesh. Managing postoperative pain and preventing morbidity after open mesh hernioplasty remain considerable medical challenges. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile. Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The Xaracoll implant is a thin flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the surgical site to provide postoperative pain control. This study will assess the pharmacokinetic profile of 2 doses of the XaraColl implant after open laparotomy hernioplasty and assess the relative bioavailability of the Xaracoll implant compared to a local bupivacaine infiltration.</detailed_description>
