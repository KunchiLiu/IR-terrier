	<brief_summary>The aim of the Study to evaluate the effect of Graded motor imagery on upper limb motor functions and quality of life in patients with stroke that was conducted in two centers in india. The primary outcome measures were upper limb motor functions at 6 weeks and secondary outcome measure was quality of life at 6 weeks. Research Hypothesis: There would be significant effect of GMI on Upper limb motor functions and quality of life in patients with stroke.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is essentially a brain based treatment, targeting the activation of different brain regions in a graded manner. GMI is a three stage treatment programme comprising of Left Right discrimination training, Explicit Motor imagery and Mirror therapy. In this Study, GMI approach is applied on the patients with Stroke to enhance their Upper limb motor functions and Quality of life. Conventional treatment: Patients of group A and group B had received conventional treatment for 6 weeks. Conventional treatment consists of Task oriented upper extremity functional exercises. Components of Task oriented training include weight bearing, supportive reactions, and reaching, grasping, holding and release activities. It was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour duration. Graded Motor Imagery: Patients of group A had received GMI programme with conventional treatment for 6 weeks. It is a three stage process, was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour duration. It comprises of: - Left Right discrimination training (Implicit Motor Imagery) - 2 weeks - Explicit Motor Imagery (Imagined movements) - 2 weeks - Mirror Therapy - 2 weeks</detailed_description>
