	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is explore the issues that relate to testing a particular dietary treatment, the low FODMAP diet, in a randomised trial using an appropriate control diet with which to compare it. In this trial the investigators will look at its effect on symptoms of people with persistent disturbance in their bowel pattern 3 months after an intestinal infection with Campylobacter. The investigators will also look at the changes in gut bacteria that occur with the diet.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participation in the CERAMIC study (see linked protocol) Ongoing post infective bowel dysfunction (PIBD) 3 months after confirmation of Campylobacter spp. in stool sample. This is defined as responding 'No' to the question "have your bowels returned to normal since your Campylobacter infection?" Will consent to use of data and samples acquired for CERAMIC in the analysis of CEDRIC As for CERAMIC study (so already confirmed) Pregnancy declared by the candidate History declared by the candidate of preexisting gastrointestinal disorder, including but not limited to: Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Coeliac Disease; Pancreatitis; Gallstone disease (biliary colic, cholecystitis); Diverticulitis; Cancer of the gastrointestinal tract; Irritable Bowel Syndrome Reported history of previous resection of any part of the gastrointestinal tract other than appendix or gallbladder Intestinal stoma Habitual use of opiate analgesics likely to alter bowel function e.g. morphine Use of antibiotics in the preceding four weeks other than for treatment of index infection. Any condition where the candidate is likely to require a course of antibiotics in the next 3 months e.g. severe chronic respiratory disease, recurrent urinary tract infection, lower limb ulceration Inability to complete the symptom questionnaires e.g. cognitive dysfunction, limiting memory and understanding Anyone who in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to be able to comply with the protocol e.g. cognitive dysfunction, chaotic lifestyle related to substance abuse Addition criteria for CEDRIC study: Use of antibiotics or prescribed probiotics during the CERAMIC study Failure to provide research stool samples during CERAMIC study Dietary practice not compatible with safe implementation of the trial diet e.g.veganism Medical reasons for preexisting controlled diet that cannot be safely randomised e.g. endstage kidney disease, diabetes</criteria>
