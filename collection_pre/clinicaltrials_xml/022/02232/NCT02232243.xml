	<brief_summary>Baseline levels of PAR-4 secreted by normal cells are generally inadequate to cause massive apoptosis in cancer cells and drugs that bolster the secretion of PAR-4 would constitute an important therapeutic advance.The apoptosis sensitizing features of hydroxychloroquine enhance the anti-tumor effects of a broad range of cancer therapeutics. The investigators hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine will induce at least 2-fold increase in systemic (plasma) PAR-4 levels compared to pre-treatment plasma levels in patients with resectable solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor that is planned for surgical resection. Age ≥18 years. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A). Patients must be able to ingest oral medications. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin Less than 1.5 x ULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Patients must be able to undergo surgical resection of their tumor as determined by the treating surgeon. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients with metastatic cancer and/or cancer that is not amenable to surgery. Patients with significant malabsorption as determined by the treating physician. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with primary brain tumors amenable to surgery are allowed on this protocol. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to hydroxychloroquine. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with hydroxychloroquine. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Patients that are on enzymeinducing antiepileptic medications</criteria>
