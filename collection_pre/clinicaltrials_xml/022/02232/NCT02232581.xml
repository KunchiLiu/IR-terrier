	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to determine the mean change in HIV viral load from baseline to Week 4 compared with placebo after 4 weeks of treatment in highly experienced HIV-infected patients. Secondary objectives were to determine (1) the tolerability, hematologic and hepatic safety of different doses of alovudine and (2) the effect of baseline nucleoside genotypic susceptibility on virologic response after 4 weeks of alovudine administration</brief_summary>
