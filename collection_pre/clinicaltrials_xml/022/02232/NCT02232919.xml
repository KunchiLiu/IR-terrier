	<brief_summary>The burden of morbid obesity to the circulatory, endocrine, and locomotor systems, as well as the psychological effects and related health-care costs, are well established in the medical literature. Lifestyle and dietary patterns remain critical factors modulating long-term weight control of morbidly obese individuals (bodymass index â‰¥ 40). Various dietary, pharmacological, and behavioral interventions have largely failed as therapies, often necessitating surgery as the last treatment option. Long term results of bariatric surgery suggest that sustained and substantial weight loss can decrease morbidity related to obesity secondary complications such as diabetes type 2 and cancers, enhancing the role of surgery for morbidly obese subjects. However the adverse effects of bariatric surgery are considerable and impact on quality of life. Its long-term failure rates and complications call for novel and effective long-term therapies, such as neurosurgical interventions. The investigators now propose to enhance our targeting capabilities in a feasibility study of low frequency electrical stimulation using VMH-DBS (ventromedial hypothalamic) in six morbidly obese patients. After successful targeting, DBS stimulation parameters will be systematically evaluated and individually optimized at three-month intervals over a one-year stimulation period. Detailed recording of side effects, weight changes, food intake patterns, metabolic changes, and behavioral evaluations will be obtained throughout the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuromodulation of metabolism and feeding behavior is at hand using modern systems of deep brain stimulation (DBS). It constitutes a minimally invasive approach for these challenging patients. The surgical procedure is reversible and proven to have acceptable side effects in the frail population of Parkinson's disease patients [Gorgulho, Hemorrhage and Infection]. Improvement of functional stereotactic surgery methods is necessary however to the challenge of implanting DBS electrodes in the hypothalamus. Recently, a case report of a patient with DBS implanted in the hypothalamus for treatment of morbid obesity who reported side effects related to memory appeared in the literature. The authors used the side effect findings to suggest the location of their implant as a site for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This illustrates the need of betterment of our techniques of targeting in DBS surgery, especially for targets located in highly functional structures, such as the hypothalamus.</detailed_description>
