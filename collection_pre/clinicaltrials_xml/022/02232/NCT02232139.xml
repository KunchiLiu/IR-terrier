	<brief_summary>The aim of the investigation is to validate the SmartPhone-based 4-Reaction Choice Time Test (4CRT) as a measure for recovery of the psychomotor function in patients after general anesthesia. One hundred female patients, scheduled to ambulatory gynecological surgery in general anesthesia, will be randomized to the group with pharmacological anxiolytic premedication with midazolam (N=50) and to the group without midazolam (N=50). All patients will be monitored using 4CRT before and after standardized general anesthesia. The reaction time, measured with 4CRT is the primary outcome parameter of the investigation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement of Psychomotor Recovery After Anesthesia Using 4CRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>4CRT is a classical psychological test, used to measure the psychomotor speed. This test measures choice reaction time. The participants are instructed to respond by pressing the keys 1-4 of the keyboard, corresponding to the numbers, appearing on the screen of computer (PDA, SmartPhone). The average of the response latency, measured during the 10 trials is usually taken as 4CRT outcome.</detailed_description>
