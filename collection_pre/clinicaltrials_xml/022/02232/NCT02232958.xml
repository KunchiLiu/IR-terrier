	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to extend our previous work, in which we demonstrated an increase in the internal and cross network connectivity of resting state neural networks in patients with cerebral small vessel disease by treatment with hyperbaric oxygen, to at least 20 more individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of HBO on Functional Connectivity of Resting State Networks in Patients With Cerebral Small Vessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients without contraindications to Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment or magnetic resonance imaging who exhibit white matter hyper-intensities on MRI will be recruited to have a functional MRI followed by10 hyperbaric oxygen treatments at 2 ATA for one hour. These treatments will be done once daily, from Monday through Friday, on 2 consecutive weeks. 4-6 weeks later, they have a repeat fMRI. These fMRI's will be analyzed regarding any changes in the resting state connectivity of various circuits.</detailed_description>
