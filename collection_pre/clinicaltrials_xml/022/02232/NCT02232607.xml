	<criteria>Age 18 to 80 years History of stable, exertional angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society functional class II to III) for at least 3 months duration prior to enrolment in the study Patients not currently receiving treatment with antianginal medication (other than shortacting nitrates) Between visits 2 and 3 two treadmill exercise tests, demonstrating ≥ 0.1 mV of horizontal or down sloping STsegment depression, must be carried out. The difference in symptomlimited exercise duration between these two tests must not exceed 20% Total treadmill exercise duration &gt; 3 minutes (i.e. stage 2 or above on a standard Bruce protocol) Coronary artery disease, preferably (not mandatory) documented by a history of proven myocardial infarction and/or coronary angiography indicating ≥ 50% reduction in luminal diameter of one or more coronary arteries or their primary branches Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to enrolment in the study Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass surgery within 6 months Other types of angina (variant, unstable) Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) Resting heart rate &lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 100 bpm Significant valvular heart disease Heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma with clinical symptoms requiring regular medication Significant arrhythmia (since this may interfere with the interpretation of the electrocardiogram) including Wolff ParkinsonWhite syndrome, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sick sinus syndrome, significant AtrioVentricular heart block, intraventricular conduction defect (QRS &gt; 0.12 seconds) ventricular preexcitation, bundle branch block, the presence of a pacemaker, the presence of an implanted automatic defibrillator, uncorrected hypokalaemia (potassium &lt; 3.5 mmol/litre) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Significant liver disease (Aspartate Aminotransferase or Alanine Aminotransferase &gt; twice the upper limit of reference range) Significant renal disease (creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of reference range) Any clinical condition which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the safe fulfilment of the protocol and the safe administration of trial medication Inability to perform repeated exercise testing due to extracardiac reasons Concomitant treatment with any other antianginal medication, whether or not prescribed for this indication (e.g. calcium channel blockers, βblockers or longacting nitrates) Concomitant treatment with antiarrhythmic medication, digitalis or tricyclic antidepressants or other agents known to affect STsegment morphology Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational drug Pregnant or nursing women or women of child bearing potential Participation in any other clinical trial within 2 months of enrolment History of drug or alcohol abuse</criteria>
