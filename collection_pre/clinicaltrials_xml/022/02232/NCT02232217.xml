	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of brief cognitive behavioral treatment for child sleep (CBTcs) to improve sleep in an important high-risk population, overweight/obese (OV/OB) youth with behavioral sleep disorders. OV/OB youth with behavioral sleep disorders and their parent(s) will be randomly assigned to 8 sessions of either CBTcs or an Educational Control (EC). CBTcs will address behavioral sleep issues in children; EC will address sleep and dietary education and general coping strategies. Child sleep (total wake time, total sleep time, bed/wake times), height, weight, physical activity, dietary intake, quality of life (QOL), fatigue, and daytime sleepiness will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. It is hypothesized the children in the CBTcs will experience greater improvement in sleep than children in the EC.</brief_summary>
