	<brief_summary>This will be an open-label, randomised, single-dose, 2-way crossover study to determine the comparative bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium from the Chemi Enoxaparin s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL) with that from the reference IMP, ClexaneÂ® s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL), following single dose administration in healthy male and female subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioavailability Study of Enoxaparin Sodium Chemi and Clexane s.c.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject will receive each treatment over two separate treatment periods under fasting conditions. Each dosing day for male subjects will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. The study will comprise of a pre-study screen (within 14 days of the first dose), followed by 2 Treatment Periods (1 and 2). During each treatment period, subjects will reside at Simbec from the evening before dosing (Day 1), until at least 36 h post dose (evening of Day 2). On admission (Day -1), subjects will provide a urine sample for a drugs of abuse screen; this sample will also be tested to confirm a negative pregnancy result in female volunteers. A single dose of the randomised treatment will be given on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight fast and blood PK/PD samples collected from pre-dose up to 36 h post dose (14 samples). Safety will also be evaluated at specified times throughout the study. The post study visit will be conducted on Day 2 (36 h post-dose) of Treatment Period 2.</detailed_description>
