	<criteria>1. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes for ≥ 5 years 2. On their current insulin regimen for ≥ 3 months prior to study entry 3. Screening HbA1c result ≤ 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) 4. Reports self testing of blood glucose levels on a regular basis equivalent to a minimum of 3 times daily for at least 2 months prior to study entry 5. In the investigator's opinion the subject is considered technically capable of using the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System 6. Aged 18 years or over. 1. Subject has been diagnosed with hypoglycaemic unawareness (i.e. subject has a diagnosis of impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia recorded in their medical notes OR in the investigator's opinion the subject currently experiences less than minimal warning symptoms for impending hypoglycaemia) 2. Subject is currently prescribed animal insulin 3. Subject is currently prescribed oral steroid therapy or is likely to require oral steroid therapy for any acute or chronic condition during the study 4. Has known allergy to medical grade adhesives 5. Currently participating in another device or drug study that could affect glucose measurements or glucose management 6. Currently using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device or has used one within the previous 4 months 7. Currently using Sensor augmented pump therapy 8. Is planning to use a CGM device at any time during the study 9. A female subject who is pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the study duration 10. A breast feeding mother 11. Currently receiving dialysis treatment or planning to receive dialysis during the study 12. Has a pacemaker 13. Has experienced an acute myocardial infarction within previous 6 months 14. Has a concomitant disease or condition that may compromise subject safety including; unstable coronary heart disease, cystic fibrosis, serious psychiatric disorder, or any other uncontrolled medical condition 15. Has experienced an episode of confirmed or suspected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the previous 6 months 16. In the investigator's opinion, the subject is considered unsuitable for inclusion in the study for any other reason.</criteria>
