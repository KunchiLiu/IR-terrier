	<brief_summary>Hypertension affects an estimated 1.5 billion people world-wide and is a chief contributor to death, stroke, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, coronary artery disease and dementia. A number of important causal environmental factors have been identified and include excessive salt or alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, inadequate fruit, vegetable and potassium intake and obesity. Although there have been significant improvements in management, a high percentage of patients still do not achieve target blood pressures. Coffee is a popular beverage globally and elevates blood pressure variably among individuals. Customers in the United States comprise more than half of the population over the age of 18 years, consume an average of 1 cup (typical size: 270 ml) of coffee three times per day and spend an estimated $ 40 billion on the purchase of it each year. A major active constituent in coffee is caffeine, which is the most widely used pharmacological substance in the world. Drug therapy plays a major role in the management of hypertension. Concomitant intake of coffee is likely substantial. However, the interaction between coffee or caffeine and blood pressure lowering drugs has been assessed in only a few clinical studies conducted more than two decades ago. Moreover, it appears to have the potential to confound the routine drug management of hypertension. This clinical investigation reports the actions of a customary amount of coffee on the circulatory effects and blood concentrations of felodipine, a drug belonging to a class of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension. Application of results from this study to clinical practice has the possibility to improve the management of hypertension.</brief_summary>
