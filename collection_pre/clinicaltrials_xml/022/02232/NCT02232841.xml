	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) as a bedside diagnostic tool for lung pathologies in patients who are mechanically ventilated. In electrical impedance tomography low amplitude, low frequency current is applied on electrodes, and the resulting voltage is measured and used to computed the electrical properties of the interior of the chest as they change in time. The computed properties are used to form an image, which can then be used for monitoring and diagnosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to characterize the ability of the electrical impedance tomography system (hardware and software) to distinguish between lung pathologies by assessing the sensitivity and specificity as well as the overall agreement with the CT scan in terms of spatial resolution. The study will test, as well as refine, the mathematical algorithms needed to create meaningful outputs on adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation and who also have received or will be receiving a CT scan as part of their standard of care.</detailed_description>
