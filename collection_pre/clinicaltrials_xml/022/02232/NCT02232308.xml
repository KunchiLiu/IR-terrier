	<brief_title>Modulation of Heme Oxygenase 1 by Nizatidine and Lisinopril in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current therapeutic options for gastroparesis are limited to dietary modifications and pharmacological (i.e., prokinetic and symptomatic) agents. Exciting and novel preliminary data from our programs demonstrate that (i) reduced expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is responsible for loss of interstitial cells of Cajal and delayed gastric emptying in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, (ii) upregulation of (HO-1) reverses delayed gastric emptying in this model, perhaps by generating carbon monoxide (CO), which has anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective actions, and may relax smooth muscle, and (iii) hemin upregulates HO-1 in humans. However, hemin is exorbitant and can only be administered intravenously. A large throughput screening assay uncovered that the histamine H2 receptor antagonist nizatidine and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril upregulate HO-1 in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. Hence, this double-blind placebo-controlled study will randomly assign 24 healthy subjects to one of 4 arms, and HO-1 protein activity and concentration will be assessed.</detailed_description>
