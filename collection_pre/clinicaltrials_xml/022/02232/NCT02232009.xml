	<brief_summary>The investigational device studied is an MR Scanner for neonates and infants with a small size profile that makes it capable of being sited in a NICU or other neonatal and infant care units. The study hypothesis is to demonstrate feasibility of attaining diagnostic quality images and data using the MR scanner for neonates and infants with various hardware and software configurations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subjects will be included that are: 1. Currently admitted for treatment or observation at the investigational site at the time of enrollment; 2. In the weight range less than 5.0 kg (&lt;5.0 kg ) and more than 0.5 kg (&gt;0.5 kg ); 3. Viable neonates (birth to 1 month of age) or infants (&gt;1 month to two years of age); 4. Able to safely undergo an MRI scan, as determined by the site's coinvestigator neonatologist or medically qualified delegate; 5. Have parent(s), guardian(s), or legally authorized representative(s) willing and able to provide written informed consent for the subject's participation; 6. Are of appropriate size and shape to fit into the bore of the magnet, inclusive of all monitoring equipment, if any, necessary for the subject's routine clinical care: 1. Maximum width (shouldertoshoulder measurement) less than eighteen (18 cm). 2. Maximum length (headtofoot measurement) less than sixty (60) cm. Subjects will be excluded that: 1. Have parent(s), guardian(s), or legally authorized representative(s) that require that they accompany the subject into the MR environment that have contraindications to the MR environment or would otherwise be put at undue risk or discomfort, as determined by the investigators; 2. Require any nonremovable medical devices that are not compatible with MR scanning (labeled as MR Unsafe, MR condition for which the scanning conditions are not met, or no MR safety labeling) that may pose hazards in the MR scanning or MR environment, in the opinion of the neonatologist coinvestigator or medically qualified delegate; 3. Have other contraindications or could otherwise be expected to experience detrimental effects to safety, wellbeing, or medical care, as determined by the neonatologist coinvestigator; 4. Require any scheduled standard of care procedures that are expected to be adversely impacted by participation in this study, in the opinion of the principal investigator, neonatologist coinvestigator, or medically qualified delegate; and 5. Have been previously enrolled AND undergone any study procedures under the current study protocol (i.e. the same subject cannot undergo study procedures, including swaddling and/or MR scanning, more than once).</criteria>
