	<brief_summary>This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of RG7625 in healthy male and female volunteers. The study will employ an interleaved cohort ('leapfrog') design in which dosing is alternated between two cohorts and each individual within a cohort will receive study drug dosing on four occasions - in effect giving a four treatment, four period, four-way crossover for each individual. The minimum duration for each participant is approximately 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
