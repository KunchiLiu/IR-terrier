	<brief_summary>ASTRO-APS is a prospective, randomized, open-label blinded endpoint pilot study among patients with a clinical diagnosis of the AntiPhospholipid Syndrome and are already taking an anticoagulant for the secondary prevention of thrombosis (blood clots). Subjects will be randomized to receive either warfarin (target INR range 2-3) or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Patients will follow up with the study team for 13 months. 2 in-clinic follow-up visits will be performed as well as 4 telephone follow-up visits. Study participants will be asked to consent to follow up telephone calls and questionnaires at 3 month intervals following the completion of the study procedures for the main portion of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apixaban for the Secondary Prevention of Thromboembolism Among Patients With the AntiphosPholipid Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study has two primary aims. The first is to identify patients with a clinical diagnosis of APS and then describe their recruitment, enrollment, screening failure rate, adherence to therapy, clinical characteristics, and APS diagnostic criteria in terms of broadly accepted published standards. Essential in this aim is capture of ability to identify, recruit, randomize, and retain patients with APS receiving a direct oral anticoagulant. We will also report compliance and patient satisfaction; central to durable anticoagulation management. The second aim is to report rates of thrombosis (arterial or venous) and death caused by thrombosis, as well as major bleeding plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding over one year among APS patients randomized to either warfarin or apixaban. As such, we will report the rate of Thrombosis (arterial and/or venous) [ Time Frame: Up to 13 months after enrollment ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] and Major and non-major bleeding [ Time Frame: Up to 13 months after enrollment ] [ Designated as safety issue: Yes ]</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be ≥ 18 years of age 2. Have a clinical diagnosis of the APS for which the patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy for the secondary prevention of thrombosis 2.a. Anticoagulation is defined as warfarin sodium titrated at the discretion of the clinician to a target INR 2.5 (range 23), 3.0 (range 2.53.5), or 3.5 (range 34). 2. b. Should the patient be receiving some other form of anticoagulation (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran etexilate, lowmolecular weight heparin) and are willing to be randomized to warfarin with a target INR 2.5 or apixaban 5 mg PO BID and they meet all other inclusion criteria 3. Have completed at least 6months of anticoagulation for the indication of thrombosis and are without acute neurologic symptoms consistent with thrombosis, CVA, or TIA for a minimum of six months. 4. Be willing to provide informed consent to contact the subjects anticoagulation provider for INRs and dosing as well as details regarding any adverse events 5. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. 6. Women must not be breastfeeding 7. Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug apixaban plus 5 halflives of study drug apixaban (3 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 33 days posttreatment completion. 8. Males who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug apixaban plus 5 halflives of the study drug apixaban (3 days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 93 days posttreatment completion. 9. Azoospermic males and women of childbearing potential who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy testing. 10. Be willing to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 1. Another indication for longterm anticoagulation for which no FDA approval of apixaban exists (e.g. mechanical heart valve) 2. A life expectancy of less than 1 year 3. Is unable to attend followup appointments 4. Is participating in a conflicting clinical trial or has participated in a trial within the last 30 days 5. Is receiving concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy 6. Requires aspirin dose of greater than 165mg daily 7. A hemoglobin level of less than 8 mg per deciliter 8. A platelet count of less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter 9. Serum creatinine level of more than 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 μmol per liter) or a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 25 ml per minute 10. Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level greater than 2 times the upper limit of the normal range 11. A total bilirubin more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. 12. Have active cancer for which treatment (chemotherapy/radiation therapy) is being delivered or has been delivered within the last 3 months 13. Are actively receiving a strong dual inhibitor of CYP3A4 and Pgp, such as: 13.a Ketoconazole 13.b Itraconazole 13.c Ritonavir 13.d clarithromycin 14. Are actively taking a strong dual inducer of CYP3A4 and Pgp, such as: 14.a rifampin 14.b carbamazepine 14.c phenytoin 14.d St. John's wort 15. Intend pregnancy or breastfeeding within the next year 16. Have a known allergy to apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban 17. Have experienced thrombosis while receiving warfarin at a target INR of 23 and have been assigned a higher target INR at the discretion of their clinician. 18. Patients with active pathological bleeding. 19. A history of arterial thromboembolism (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction or other arterial thrombosis) 20. Requires clopidogrel, tigacrolor, prasugrel, or another P2Y12 inhibitor 21. Have a history of catastrophic APS (CAPS) as defined by clinical routine 22. Have radiographic evidence of prior arterial thrombosis on MRI as defined per clinical routine upon screening MRI 23. At the discretion of the investigator are considered to not be candidates secondary to s a safety concern.</criteria>
