	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common condition that may induce hemodynamic and metabolic dysregulation. However, it is not clear if OSA is a mere epiphenomenon or contributes to increase the morbidity associated with metabolic syndrome. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of OSA treatment with CPAP in consecutive patients with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
