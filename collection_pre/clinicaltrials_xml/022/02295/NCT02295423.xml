	<brief_summary>The investigators hope to survey anesthesiologists who have participated in a non-CME regional anesthesia workshop at VAPAHCS over the past 4 years on the number and types of nerve block procedures that they performed, nerve localization method (e.g., ultrasound, electrical stimulation, or both), and whether the nerve blocks performed were single-injection or catheter-based.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-Up Study to Assess Implementation of Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia Skills</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators expect to recruit approximately 100 participants through the use of an IRB-approved survey and cover letter which will be distributed to anesthesiologists who have participated in a non-CME regional anesthesia workshop at VAPAHCS over the past 4 years. Prospective subjects will provide consent to participate by completing the requested survey. Subjects will not receive monetary remuneration for their participation. Selection for inclusion will not be based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status. There will be no recruitment of participants from vulnerable populations. Participants will receive a link to an online survey and if they prefer an alternate method, the investigators will send the participant the survey in Word document format or survey by telephone. The survey will ask for the number and types of nerve block procedures that the participant performed, nerve localization method (e.g., ultrasound, electrical stimulation, or both), and whether the nerve blocks performed were single-injection or catheter-based.</detailed_description>
