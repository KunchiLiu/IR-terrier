	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms impact adherence to a 12-week physical activity program and whether exercise can help improve PTSD symptoms and health outcomes in older Veterans. Forty Veterans over the age of 60 with PTSD will be recruited to participate in a 12-week physical activity program consisting of aerobic and strengthening activities. Participants will be randomized to an intervention arm or usual care wait-list control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise and PTSD in Older Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is substantial evidence that physical inactivity contributes to poorer physical health outcomes in older adults. There is a paucity of work examining physical activity in Veterans with PTSD. Consequently, the efficacy of exercise as a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the treatment for PTSD symptoms and related health sequelae has not been established. Methods: Forty Veterans 60 years and older with PTSD will be recruited to participate in a 12-week physical activity program consisting of aerobic and strength-training activities. Participants will be randomized to an intervention arm or usual care wait-list control. Outcomes: Changes in physical function, PTSD symptom severity, and aerobic endurance will be assessed between the two study arms. Summary: This pilot trial will extend the investigators' understanding of the physical and psychological benefits of physical activity in Veterans with PTSD. The results from this study will be used to be used to develop a larger, randomized controlled exercise trial for Veterans with PTSD. Once new, effective exercise therapies for Veterans with PTSD are established, we can augment traditional PTSD therapy with exercise therapy to promote the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases common in this vulnerable population.</detailed_description>
