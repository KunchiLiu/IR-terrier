	<brief_title>Nausea in Patients Receiving Hydromorphone vs Oxycodone After Total Hip Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nausea and vomiting in the post-operative period is considered strongly undesirable by patients and has adverse effects on recovery from outpatient procedures, contributing significantly to delays in discharge from recovery. A know major contributor to the occurrence of post-operative nausea and vomiting is the use of opiate medications which are the cornerstone of post-operative pain management. The investigators hypothesize that the occurrence of this side-effect is different between patients prescribed oxycodone and those receiving hydromorphone for acute pain management after total hip replacement surgery. This investigation is a randomized, double-blind, head-to-head comparison to equipotent administration of oxycodone vs. hydromorphone to determine whether such a difference exists.</detailed_description>
