	<brief_title>The Effects of Rhus Coriaria L. on Serum Lipid Levels of Patients With Hyperlipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhus (Somagh) is found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide, often growing in areas of marginal agricultural capacity. Rhus is used as an herbal remedy in traditional medicine because of its assumed analgesic, antidiarrhetic, antiseptic, anorexic and antihypergylcemic properties. The fruits of Rhus contain flavonols, phenolic acids, hydrolysable tannins, anthocyans and organic acids such as malice, citric and tartaric acids. Some studies have shown that polyphenols could have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer and could be regarded as bioactive compounds with a high potential health-promoting capacity. Phenolic compounds inhibit lipid peroxidation, scavenge the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, and enhance the activities of detoxifying enzymes.Moreover, the hypocholesterolemic action of dietary polyphenols has been reported. The hypocholesterolemic effect of Rhus fruit powder and its components have been reported previously in rabbits and mice.</detailed_description>
