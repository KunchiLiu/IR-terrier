	<brief_summary>Currently, most of the protocols used for desensitization to Hymenoptera venoms consist of a very rapid increase in doses of venom extracts administered during the SIT in a day without systemic reaction of the patient which is not yet explained. The hypothesis is that this good tolerance is due to a rapid decrease in the response of mast cells and basophils to the allergen.. The main objective is to study basophil activation in response to the allergen during the first day of desensitization, measured by basophil activation test. The initiation of desensitization follow a protocol of rapid growth rates. The basophil activation level in the course of desensitization will be analyzed by flow cytometry after in vitro stimulation by allergen. Changes in T cell polarization is also analyzed by flow cytometry. Evolution of the expression of different proteins in blood basophils will be studied by measuring their messenger RNAs</brief_summary>
