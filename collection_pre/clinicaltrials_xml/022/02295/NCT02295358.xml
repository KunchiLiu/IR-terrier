	<brief_summary>This study is designed with the intention to further elucidate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on intraocular pressure (IOP) and signs/symptoms of dry eye. Prior studies have shown statistically significant lowering of IOP with use of omega-3 fatty acids but have only been performed in animal models. This study will be the first to attempt replication in human models. A limited number of studies have shown an increase in tear production/volume as well as a decrease in the subjective symptoms of dry eye, but more studies are needed to better define these effects. Better understanding of the effects of this supplement on intraocular pressure and dry eye will contribute to the expanding knowledge about the pathophysiology of glaucoma/ocular hypertension and dry eye syndrome and potentially lead to further studies about new potential treatment options for these conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation on Intraocular Pressure &amp; Ocular Surface</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research project is to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on intraocular pressure (IOP) as well as the signs and symptoms of dry eye. We hypothesize that dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will be associated with a significant change in intraocular pressure compared to baseline measurements prior to beginning supplementation. We further hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will be associated with a significant increase in tear production and volume as well as a significant change in patients' subjective complaints of dry eye.</detailed_description>
