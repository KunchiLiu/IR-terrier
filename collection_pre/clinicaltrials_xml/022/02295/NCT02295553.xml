	<brief_title>Ketamine and Propofol for Upper Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach and small intestine is performed using a scope that is inserted while the patient is under under deep sedation or general anesthesia. The most common method of providing general anesthesia for upper endoscopy is intravenous administration of medications such as propofol, often in combination with other medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, remifentanil or ketamine. One study found that the combination of propofol and ketamine provides better conditions (less patient movement, more stable heart and breathing) but more side effects afterwards compared to propofol and fentanyl.</detailed_description>
