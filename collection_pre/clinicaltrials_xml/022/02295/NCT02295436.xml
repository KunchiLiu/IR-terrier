	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of minodronic acid tablets following single and multiple oral administration in healthy Chinese subjects. Additionally, the effects of age and food on minodronic acid pharmacokinetics was also explored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Tolerability of Minodronic Acid and Food and Age Effects on the Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single-center, phase I study in healthy young (19-30 years) and elderly (60-65 years) volunteers, which was conducted in four parts. In Part 1, minodronic acid tablets were administered to young volunteers at doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg. In Part 2, after a single dose, young volunteers in the 1-mg dose group received repeated oral doses of minodronic acid once daily for 7 days. In Part 3, a single oral dose of minodronic acid 1 mg was administered to elderly volunteers. In part 4, after a washout period of 8 days, volunteers in the 4-mg dose group received a single dose of 4 mg minodronic acid under fed conditions (administrated 30 minutes before high-fat breakfast). Plasma samples were collected and plasma concentrations of minodronic acid were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study by physical examinations, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses, and monitoring of adverse effects.</detailed_description>
