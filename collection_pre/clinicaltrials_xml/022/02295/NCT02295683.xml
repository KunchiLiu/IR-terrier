	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Denervation by Iberis System in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension - Iberis-HTN Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-interventional and open-label registry to collect descriptive data from patients who receive renal sympathetic denervation treatment in accordance with routine hospital practice using Iberis system. This registry will collect data prospectively from patients that receive renal sympathetic denervation treatment with use of Iberis renal denervation system and treatment will be applied according to the routine hospital practice. No additional tests are required specific to this registry. The registry will serve as a tool to collect clinical data in order to expand the knowledge base of safety, efficacy and functionality of the Iberis system in patients with resistant hypertension. A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled in Europe</detailed_description>
