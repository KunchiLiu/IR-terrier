	<brief_summary>Accurate diagnosis of food allergy depends on the identification of the causative allergenic molecule(s). The proposed study intends to investigate and compare the pattern of IgE antibody sensitisation in walnut allergic subjects from three different regions of Europe (south (SEU) and central/north (C/NEU), to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a panel of novel allergen reagents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accurate diagnosis of food allergy depends on the identification of the causative allergenic molecule(s). Thus, full characterization of the major allergens of walnut and their clinical importance is an important undertaking. The proposed study intends to investigate and compare the pattern of IgE antibody sensitisation in walnut allergic subjects from three different regions of Europe (south (SEU) and central/north (C/NEU), to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a panel of novel allergen reagents. With a view towards improved in vitro diagnostic methods, we intend to evaluate the diagnostic potential of recombinant walnut allergens in patients with walnut allergy confirmed by a positive provocation or supported by a convincing history of anaphylactic reaction(s) to walnut in the past, patients with pollinosis but no symptoms of walnut allergy and non-atopic control subjects.</detailed_description>
