	<brief_title>Effect of Oral Administration of Methylene Blue MMX Tablets on Double Stranded DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral 200 mg Methylene Blue MMX® tablets, (administered as 8 x 25 mg), prior to endoscopy, on double-stranded DNA breaks in colonic biopsy samples assessed by histone γH2AX analysis, compared to control biopsies collected during standard white light colonoscopy without the prior use of Methylene Blue MMX®. Secondary Objectives : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Methylene Blue MMX® tablets.. To evaluate the staining score for colonoscopy obtained with oral Methylene Blue MMX® tablets . Time to reach the caecum during colonoscopy and withdrawal time from caecum to exit.</detailed_description>
