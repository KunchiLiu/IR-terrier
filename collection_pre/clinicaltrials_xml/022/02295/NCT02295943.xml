	<brief_summary>The macular hole formation takes place in the centre of the retina. A closure of the macular hole is believed to take place if the central retinal area is kept dry in the postoperative period. Therefore the eye is filled with a gas mix and the patients are urged to avoid the supine position in the first postoperative days. The investigators have developed a positioning measuring device which can measure the extent of supine positioning time. Patients are to carry the positioning measuring device during the first postoperative 24 hours. Hereby the investigators search new knowledge concerning patients compliance and its relation to macular hole closure.</brief_summary>
