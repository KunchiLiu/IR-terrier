	<brief_summary>This is a phase II randomized study of 4-months induction first-line chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI + cetuximab followed by maintenance with cetuximab or bevacizumab in patients affected by KRAS wild type (wt) mCRC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemoterapy With Folfoxiri Plus Cetuxumab in Unresectable Colorectal Cancer Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to obtain a rapid disease control with the therapy and the maximum tumoral shrinkage, and than to treat patient with less intensive maintenance to inhibit tumoral regrowth.</detailed_description>
