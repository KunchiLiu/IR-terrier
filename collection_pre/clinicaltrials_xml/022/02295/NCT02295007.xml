	<brief_summary>Children 2-11 years of age who are given the influenza vaccine (inactivated influenza (IIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)) as part of their routine care can enroll in this study if their parent has the ability to receive and send text messages. Children enrolled in this study will be observed daily for an eight-day period starting on the day of vaccine administration, and then continuing over the next 7 days, and then weekly for 42 days. On the day of enrollment and nightly for the next seven days, the parent will report via text message what their child's highest temperature is. If fever is present, they will then be prompted for additional information including other symptoms, antipyretic use and medical care sought. On day 3 as well as weekly from day 7 through day 42 post-vaccination, parents will be asked via text message about breathing problems, specifically cough, wheezing and chest tightness. They will also be asked about medications taken and care sought. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of collecting this data.</brief_summary>
