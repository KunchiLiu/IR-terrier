	<brief_title>EMMA: Empowerment, Motivation and Medical Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally, the success of patients to manage their diabetes has been judged by their ability to adhere to a prescribed therapeutic regimen, and efforts have been spent developing strategies to promote adherence. It is estimated that 20% to 50% of patients with chronic conditions are not adherent to their prescribed medication regimen, with non-adherence being defined as &lt;80% adherence to prescribed, relevant medication. The treatment regimen often comprises several elements such as poly-pharmacy including insulin administration, self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet and physical exercise. It is thus not just a matter of 'taking a pill or not' but implies lifestyle changes, knowledge and competence, and internal motivation for self-management. The investigators developed a consultation program based on dialogue tools. The EMMA program aims to support medication adherence and blood glucose control by facilitating rapport, exploring patient concerns and challenges, enabling knowledge exchange and supporting goal-setting and action-planning. A pilot test of the program appeared feasible and acceptable to patients and health care professionals and showed significant decrease on HbA1c. EMMA is now ready to be tested in a randomized controlled study (RCT) study.</detailed_description>
