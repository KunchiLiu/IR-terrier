	<brief_summary>This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of an intervention to improve sleep quality and decrease fatigue levels in children with a diagnosis of ALL, during maintenance treatment. Families were randomized to usual care or the intervention. The intervention included a sleep hygiene and relaxation education session with a nurse practitioner, literature for home, two story books, and a follow-up phone call. Self-reported measures were used in addition to actigraphy to measure children's quality and quantity of sleep.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Hygiene and Relaxation Intervention to Improve Sleep and Fatigue for Children Receiving Maintenance Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep is an essential restorative function that promotes both physical and cognitive health. Previous studies have demonstrated that children on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) maintenance therapy have problematic sleep patterns and experience fatigue. This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of an intervention to improve sleep quality and decrease fatigue levels in children aged 4-10, with a diagnosis of ALL, during maintenance treatment. Families were randomized to usual care or the intervention. The intervention included a sleep hygiene and relaxation education session with a nurse practitioner, literature for home, two story books, and a follow-up phone call. Self-reported measures were used in addition to actigraphy to measure children's quality and quantity of sleep. Sleep tips were evaluated by intervention group families.</detailed_description>
