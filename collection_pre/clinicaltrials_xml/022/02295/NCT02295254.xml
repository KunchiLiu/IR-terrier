	<brief_summary>The human gut contain a wide range of microorganisms creating the gut microbiome. The microbiome has great impact on metabolic and immunologic processes and responses. Travelers who travel to tropical destinations where the intestinal infection risk is high are prone to microbiome changes. During the current study the travelers will give feces specimen before and after the travel and their microbiome will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microbiome Changes in Travelers to Tropical Destinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individual differences in the microorganisms variety are affected by external factors such as food, age, geographic location, medication consumption, host genetics and exposure to microorganisms in early stages of life. During the current study the geographic location affect will be tested by comparing the microorganism environment before and after traveling to tropical destinations.</detailed_description>
