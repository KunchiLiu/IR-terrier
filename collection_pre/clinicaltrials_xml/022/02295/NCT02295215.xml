	<brief_summary>The prevalence of Chagas' disease continues high even in the developed countries. Chagasic Cardiomyopathy with preserved ventricular function is an understudied form of Chagas disease. Since a majority of patients with these changes progress to dilated form with ventricular dysfunction with all its serious consequences, it is interesting to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease at the stage where there electrocardiographic changes and preserved ventricular function. And besides, search strategies to slow the progress, or even prevent the chronic phase of the disease. For this reason the investigators will evaluate the effects of exercise training in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy without ventricular dysfunction.</brief_summary>
