	<brief_summary>Although numerous studies have demonstrated that a high percentage of primary care providers (PCPs) are knowledgeable about the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for managing ADHD, many fail to implement these guidelines correctly. The goal of this project is to increase the use of evidence-based practices (EBP) for assessing and treating children with ADHD between 5 and 12 years in the context of primary care practice. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the whether a 3-part intervention (education about ADHD management and communication training, collaborative consultation, and performance feedback regarding use of EBPs) is effective in improving EBP use among primary care providers.</brief_summary>
