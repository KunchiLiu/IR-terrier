	<brief_summary>The investigators will be evaluated the effects of a single loading dose of remifentanil (1Âµg/kg), administered as an adjunct to sevoflurane, on duration of hemodynamic profile, seizure activity, and recovery times during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depression</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Remifentanil on Attenuating the Hemodynamic Responses After Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive patients will enrolled this trial. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation values will be recorded prior to anesthetic induction (T1); following anesthetic induction (T2); and 0, 1, 3, and 10 minute after the seizure have ended (T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively). The peak heart rate during the seizure will be recorded from the Electrocardiogram.</detailed_description>
