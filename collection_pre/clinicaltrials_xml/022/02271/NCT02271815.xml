	<brief_summary>There is a need for dentifrices that more effectively remove oral biofilm, and inhibit biofilm re-formation. This is particularly important is long-term orthodontic fixtures or prosthodontic appliances, and for debilitated, diabetic and immunocompromised condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical and Imaging Study to Evaluate a Novel Dentifrice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a novel dental gel, on de- and re-mineralization and the microstructure of the enamel surface in vivo of teeth and on the gingival soft tissue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of over-the-counter toothpaste Colgate product, Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste and Zendium Classic toothpaste and use imaging devices call Optical Coherence Tomography and Multiphoton Microscopy to measure the change in oral tissue. Imaging devices are: - Optical Coherence Tomography, this imaging device can be used to identify the presence of the inflammation of the gum. The inflammation presence in the gingival pockets and compare to the effect of the toothpaste. - Multiphoton Microscopy, this imaging device can be used to identify the presence of the bacterial. The results can determine effects of the toothpaste on the development and breakup of bacterial and any other changes.</detailed_description>
