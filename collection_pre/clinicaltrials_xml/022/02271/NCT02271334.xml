	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profiles of A006, an Albuterol dry powder inhaler (DPI), following a single dose of 110 mcg (T1) or 220 mcg (T2), in healthy male and female adult volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Pharmacokinetics and Safety of A006 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double or evaluator-blinded, single dose, four-arm, crossover PK study in eighteen (18) healthy volunteers, both male and female adults, at 18-40 years of age. All candidates will be screened and only those who satisfy all enrollment criteria will be enrolled into this study. Each study subject will participate in a screening visit and four (4) study visits with one (1) randomized study treatment given in each visit. PK samples will be analyzed with an established LC/MS/MS method. An End-of-Study (EOS) safety evaluation will be conducted at the end of Study Visit-4.</detailed_description>
