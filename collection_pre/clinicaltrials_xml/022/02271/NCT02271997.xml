	<brief_title>Optimizing Iron Suppletion After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morbid obesity is worldwide a still growing problem. The number of bariatric procedures are still increasing with 9000 bariatric operations in 2009. The golden standard is the Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGB). The RYGB ensures an excess weight loss of 60-70% in our hospital. Unfortunately vitamin and mineral deficiencies are a consequence from RYGB. Iron deficiency occurs in 14-66% in the first two years after surgery. Worldwide there are three most used options of treatment for this: treatment with ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate and intravenous injection of Ferinject. Our goal is to determine which treatment is the most effective to normalize ferritin values in the blood and which treatment is the most cost-effective one after a RYGB.</detailed_description>
