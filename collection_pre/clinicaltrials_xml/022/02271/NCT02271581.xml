	<brief_summary>There is a growing body of evidence that implicates inflammation as a mechanism of disease progression and reduced survival in patients with advanced cancer. Elevated c-reactive protein levels have been shown to be associated with reduced performance status, specific cancer related symptoms and reduced overall survival. C-reactive protein levels are a surrogate for IL-6 expression. IL-6 is part of an inflammatory signature predicting cancer recurrence. VeriStrat® is a multivariate test which measures protein expression related to a host/tumor interaction mediated by inflammation. The investigators hope to examine the relationship between quality of life outcomes per FACT-L survey and correlate them with changes in c-reactive protein levels and the VeriStrat® status. The hypothesis of this study is that the remarkable survival benefit in the Temel study is mediated by reduced inflammation with improvement of symptom control.</brief_summary>
