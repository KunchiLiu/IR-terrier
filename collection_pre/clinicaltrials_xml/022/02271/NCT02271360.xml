	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of oral Calcium Dobesilate to oral Cabergoline in the prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in high-risk women underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Dobesilate Versus Cabergoline for Prevention of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred and twenty women at risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome during ICSI cycles will be randomly scheduled into two equal groups. In group A, (Calcium Dobesilate group), 1 cap / 8 hs Doxium ( 500mg) will be given at day of HCG injection and for 21 days; while in group B (Cabergoline group), 1 tab/day Cabergoline( 0.5 mg) will be given at day of HCG injection and for 8 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients enrolled in the study were infertile women undergoing ICSI with one of the following criteria: previous episodes of OHSS, polycystic ovaries (i.e., &gt; 24 antral follicles present on baseline ultrasound examination), high AMH (&gt; 3.0 ng/mL), large number of small follicles (8 to 12 mm) seen on ultrasound during ovarian stimulation, high s.E2 at hCG trigger (E2 &gt;3000 pg/ml or rapidly rising s.E2), presence of &gt; 20 follicles by ultrasound on day of retrieval or large number of oocytes retrieved (&gt; 20).</criteria>
