	<brief_summary>This study consist of 4-months induction first-line chemotherapy with the G.O.N.O. FOLFOXIRI regimen plus bevacizumab followed by maintenance with bevacizumab or bevacizumab plus metronomic chemotherapy (with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide) in mCRC patients. The main objective of this study is to preliminarily evaluate the potential effects of the combination of a metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide to maintenance bevacizumab on pharmacodynamic and clinical parameters among mCRC patients.</brief_summary>
