	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib, to compare the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib after single oral administration of 840 mg and 1680 mg and to assess the effects of a single dose of ibrutinib on QT/QTc intervals and electrocardiogram (ECG) in healthy adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Ibrutinib on Cardiac Repolarization in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving), single-center, 2-period, sequential design part. It consists of a Screening phase (Day-21 to -2), Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2. In treatment period 1, 8 participants including two women will receive 840 milligram (mg) ibrutinib capsules + 6 placebo capsules. In treatment period 2, participants will receive 1680 mg ibrutinib capsules. Treatment periods will be separated by a Washout period of not less than 7 days. A high-fat breakfast will be provided 2 hours before dosing. Blood samples will be collected after each dosing for pharmacokinetic assessments. Part 2 is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) and positive-controlled (participants are assigned to either a recognized effective treatment or the study medication), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), single dose, and 4-way crossover (the same medications are provided to all participants but in a different sequence) part. Participants will receive either of the 4 treatments: Treatment A (Ibrutinib 1680 mg + moxifloxacin-matching placebo); Treatment B (Ibrutinib 840 mg+ ibrutinib-matching placebo + moxifloxacin-matching placebo); Treatment C (ibrutinib-matching placebo + moxifloxacin-matching placebo); and Treatment D: (moxifloxacin 400 mg + ibrutinib-matching placebo). Each treatment period will be separated by a Washout period of not less than 7 days. Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
