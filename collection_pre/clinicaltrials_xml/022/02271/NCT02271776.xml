	<brief_summary>Based on our hypothesis that orally administered GOS will be fermented into a SCFA pattern high in acetate and that this will lead to beneficial effects on human substrate and energy metabolism, we aim to address the following primary objective: To investigate the effects of a 12-week supplementation of GOS on peripheral insulin sensitivity and body weight control in obese adults with impaired glucose homeostasis.</brief_summary>
