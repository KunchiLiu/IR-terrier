	<brief_title>How Are Changing the Practices After the Introduction of the Pleth Variability Index? A Before/After Survey.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to qualify the capability of general anesthesiologist to adopt Pleth Variability Index (PVI) into their practice. It also seeks to establish whether the introduction of the PVI in the clinical practice is associated with a modification of the practice. In this scope, the intent is to see the impact of introduction of PVI monitoring on anesthesiologist practices, and to do this by comparing their survey response both before and after use of PVI in their surgeries, and to see how clinical practices for GDT and outcomes may have changed. To that end, the intent is to conduct this at sites with no current experience in use of PVI parameter, so that one can closely follow the change in clinician practice as PVI is adopted.</detailed_description>
