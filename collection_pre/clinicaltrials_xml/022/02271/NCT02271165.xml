	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of human immunoglobulin SCIg in the form of Hizentra (Immune globulin Subcutaneous) in patients with Dermatomyositis. Hizentra provides effective protection against infection by maintaining a steady and normal level of immunoglobulin in the body) in patients with primary immunodeficiency. At present, patients with steroid resistant dermatomyositis can only be treated with IVIg (The healthy antibodies in IVIG can block the damaging antibodies that attack muscle and skin in dermatomyositis) treatment. An evaluation can then be made to see if SCIg is a suitable replacement and exerts immunomodulatory effect on complement antibodies.</brief_summary>
