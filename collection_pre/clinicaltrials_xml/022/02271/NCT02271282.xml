	<brief_summary>Repletion of testosterone (Te) in older men drives GH secretion after its aromatization to estradiol (E2), which acts via the estrogen receptor (ER). Conversely, we postulate that estrogen deprivation in postmenopausal women attenuates growth hormone (GH) secretion and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) production, thus favoring development of metabolic syndrome in men treated with toremifene, a new estrogen antagonist used adjunctively in prostatic cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estradiol-Receptor Blockade in Older Men and Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic concentrations of Te, E2, GH, IGF-I and insulin growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) decline in healthy aging men and women. Relative sex-steroid deprivation accentuates GH and IGF-I depletion, since Te stimulates GH and IGF-I production in older men, hypogonadal males of all ages, and patients undergoing (genotypic female-to-male) gender reassignment. The estrogen-receptor antagonist, tamoxifen, blocks this effect of Te, suggesting involvement of E2 in GH's stimulation at least in young men. E2 alone stimulates GH secretion in young and older women. Because Te is converted to E2 by aromatization in the body, we postulate that E2 is the active moiety in both men and women. Moreover, we hypothesize that the decline of E2 in older men and women contributes to the fall in GH output. These basic concepts will be tested here.</detailed_description>
