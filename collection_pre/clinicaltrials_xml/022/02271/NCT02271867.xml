	<brief_summary>Thermal quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a method to evaluate peripheral nerve blocks in a quantitative way. It assesses the neurosensory effects of local anesthetics, like nerve block intensity, duration, recovery, neurotoxicity, the effect of spread of local anesthetic solutions and the effect and the eventual neurotoxicity of adjuvants. We aimed at investigating, in a quantitative way, the block characteristics of 3 different commonly used local anesthetics on peripheral nerves through the application of thermal QST by measuring changes in sensory detection thresholds. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate if QST could be of value for measuring gradual changes in block characteristics on the adjacent nerves at distance of the injection site in an US-ISB.</brief_summary>
