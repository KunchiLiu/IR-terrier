	<brief_summary>This study will examine whether an intervention with vitamin D or fish oil supplements can reduce the risk of heart failure among adult men and women during a follow up period of up to five years (starting from the time of randomization into the parent VITAL trial). The investigators hypotheses are that both vitamin D and fish oil supplements will each reduce the risk of heart failure.</brief_summary>
