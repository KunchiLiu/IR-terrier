	<brief_title>to evaluate188Re-BMEDA-liposome in Patient With Primary Solid Tumor in Advanced or Metastatic Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhenium-188 is an ideal radionuclide for therapeutic use due to its maximum beta emission of 2.12MeV, short physical half-life of 16.9 hours, and its 155-keV gamma emission for imaging purposes. 188Re-BMEDA-liposome consists of 2 separate components (Rhenium-188 and liposome) and BMEDA as a linker. This study aims to find the MTD, evaluate the safety, efficacy profiles and investigate the biodistribution, radioactivity and radiation dosimetry of 188Re-BMEDA-liposome on primary solid tumor in metastatic stage patient by a single intravenous injection course.</detailed_description>
