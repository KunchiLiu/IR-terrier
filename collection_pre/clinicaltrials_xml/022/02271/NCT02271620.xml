	<brief_summary>- To determine prevalence of local allergic rhinitis (LAR) - To evaluate clinical characteristic and severity of local allergic rhinitis - To measure changing of tryptase and Specific IgE for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) after nasal allergen provocation test (NAPT)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of Children With Local Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children 8-18 years with NAR were recruited. A NAPT with Der p 1 solutions (NAPT-DP) at 200 AU/mL, 600 AU/mL and 2000 AU/mL at 15-minute interval was performed, respectively. The immediate responses to NAPT-DP were assessed using symptoms score, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and acoustic rhinometry (ARM). The nasal tryptase and sIgE-DP were measured at baseline, 15 min and 1 h after positive NAPT-DP. Allergic rhinitis (AR) patients were used as positive control.</detailed_description>
