	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Habits on Metabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More than a third of U.S. adults are obese (BMI greater than 30), 8-12% of adults suffer from type 2 diabetes, and up to 30% of adults have pre-diabetes. Recent research studies have suggested that it is not just what we eat, but also when we eat that may put us at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Skipping breakfast and eating late at night have been associated with an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), substantiated by recent animal and human experimental studies showing that altered meal timing itself, without changes in caloric intake, can influence weight regulation and impaired glucose tolerance. This research will determine in prediabetic and non-diabetic participants whether delaying meal times worsens glucose tolerance, leads to physiological changes favoring a positive energy balance, and increases caloric intake. This research will provide mechanistic insights into the metabolic consequences of changing meal timing and may help in evidence-based approaches to improve dietary interventions in the fight against obesity and T2D.</detailed_description>
