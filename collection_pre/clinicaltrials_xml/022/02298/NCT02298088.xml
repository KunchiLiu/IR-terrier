	<criteria>Patients of both sexes aged â‰¥ 18 years and &lt; 75 years with ACS with ST segment elevation with onset during the previous 24 hours, documented by cardiac ischemic symptoms due to atherosclerosis of &gt; 10 minutes duration at rest, treated with pharmacological thrombolysis Fibrinolytic therapy should be given to patients with STEMI and onset of ischemic symptoms within the previous 12 hours Patients with acute coronary syndrome with ST segment elevation will be included provided they present ST segment elevation at the J point in two contiguous leads in electrocardiogram with cutpoints: &gt; 0.1mV in all leads other than leads V2V3, where the following cut points apply: &gt; 0.2 mV in men &gt; 40 years; &gt; 0.25 mV in men &lt; 40 years, or &gt;0.15 mV in women and at least 1 of the following criteria: Anginalike chest pain or ischemic equivalent chest pain; Abnormalities above the reference value for markers of myocardial necrosis (troponin and CKMB). The patient must be able to give informed consent in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines and local legislation and/or regulations. Any contraindication against the use of clopidogrel (eg, hypersensitivity, moderate or severe liver disease, active bleeding or bleeding history, history of intracranial hemorrhage) Need for oral anticoagulation therapy, Concomitant oral or IV therapy with strong CYP3A inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, grapefruit juice N1 L/d), CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (cyclosporine, quinidine), or strong CYP3Ainducers (rifampin/rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine) Increased risk of bradycardia events Dialysis required Known clinically important thrombocytopenia Known clinically important anemia Any other condition that may put the patient at risk or influence study results in the investigators' opinion (eg, cardiogenic shock, severe hemodynamic instability, active cancer) Participant in another investigational drug or device study within 30 d Pregnancy or lactation Any condition that increases the risk for noncompliance or being lost to followup Involvement in the planning or conduct of the study Previous enrollment or randomization in this study Contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy including: 15 Any prior intracranial hemorrhage Known structural cerebral vascular lesion (eg, Arterial Venous Malformation AVM) Known malignant intracranial neoplasm (primary or metastatic) Ischemic stroke within 3 months Suspected aortic dissection Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis (excluding menses) Significant closed head trauma or facial trauma within 3 months</criteria>
