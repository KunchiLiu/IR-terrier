	<brief_title>Infliximab for Kawasaki Disease Patients Resistant to IVIG : a Multicentre, Prospective, Randomised Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kawasaki disease(KD), the most common cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries, is a self-limited vasculitis that is treated with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin. Resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin in Kawasaki disease which is defined as a temperature of 38.0°C or higher at 36 hours to 7 days after completion of the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin increases the risk of coronary artery lesions. We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, prospective trial to determine whether the use of infliximab to the children who don't respond to the first dose of IVIG(2g/kg) reduces the risk of coronary artery diseases. The IVIG-resistant children will be randomly assigned to either the infliximab or IVIG group in a 1:1 ratio and receive either infliximab (5 mg/kg at 1 mg/mL intravenously over 2 h) or IVIG (2g/kg). The level of leukocyte (WBC)counts, C-reactive protein, alanine transaminase,interleukin- 1( IL-1), interleukin- 6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-a(TNF-a), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1(STNFR-I), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2(STNFR-2), the fever days,and the cost of hospital stay will be analyzed between these two groups.The final outcome is the incidence of coronary artery lesions.</detailed_description>
