	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of sustained response rate after discontinuation of treatment with TPO-RAs, Eltrombopag and Romiplostim, in persistent or chronic pITP patients who failed one or more therapy lines, splenectomy included.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response Rate and Duration After Discontinuation Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing evidence exists in the literature on the persistent response after TPO-RAs discontinuation. However, the available data consist of description of case reports from different patients' series. At this time, systematic data collections on this topic do not exist and the real incidence of such persistent response is unknown. Therefore, because of the increasing interest in this new and challenging therapeutic field, also for the therapeutic implications, we would like to investigate the impact of TPO- RAs on the achievement of sustained and persistent responses after their discontinuation in the Italian adult patients affected by pITP who have been referred to the GIMEMA Centers.</detailed_description>
