	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM). In this current Phase 1, first-in-human study, the three different antigen amounts that have been selected will be evaluated in a stepwise manner in three different cohorts (cohort 1: low dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine, cohort 2: middle dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine, and cohort 3: high dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine). In addition, the effect of an adjuvant, either aluminum hydroxide or MF59, and antibody kinetics post-vaccination at different time points will be evaluated as compared to unadjuvanted RSV F subunit vaccine at the same dosage levels</brief_summary>

Any respiratory illness within 7 days prior to receiving the first study vaccination. Any active pulmonary infection or other inflammatory conditions, even in the absence of febrile episodes, within 14 days prior to the first study vaccination. Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. 3. Individuals participating in any clinical trial with another investigational product 28 days prior to receiving the first study vaccination or intent to participate in another clinical study at any time during the conduct of this study. 4. Individuals who have received any vaccine 28 days prior to enrollment in this study, or who plan to receive any nonstudy vaccines within 28 days of the second dose of study vaccine. 5.
