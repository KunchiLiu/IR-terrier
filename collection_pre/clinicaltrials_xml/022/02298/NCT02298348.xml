	<brief_summary>This study will combine three drugs: sorafenib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan. Adding sorafenib to cyclophosphamide and topotecan may increase the effectiveness of this combination. The investigators first need to find out the highest dose of sorafenib that can be given safely together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. This is the first study to test giving these three drugs together and will help determine the highest dose of sorafenib that can safely be given together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan to patients with resistant/relapsed neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib and Cyclophosphamide/Topotecan in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will combine three drugs: sorafenib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan. This study involves the use of an experimental drug, called sorafenib. Sorafenib blocks the function of a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been tested by itself (as a single-agent) in children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma. In the laboratory, sorafenib appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller, and in addition can help immune cells to be more active in attacking tumors and blocks other harmful immune cells from promoting tumor growth and function. Sorafenib also helps to block tumor cells from developing blood vessels used to "feed" to tumor. Sorafenib is an FDA-approved drug currently widely used for adults with specific types of liver and kidney cancer. Cyclophosphamide and topotecan are both FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs. These drugs are approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer. These drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma. In some neuroblastoma patients, this combination has reduced the amount of tumor burden. Adding sorafenib to cyclophosphamide and topotecan may increase the effectiveness of this combination. The investigators first need to find out the highest dose of sorafenib that can be given safely together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. This is the first study to test giving these three drugs together and will help determine the highest dose of sorafenib that can safely be given together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan to patients with resistant/relapsed neuroblastoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be &lt; 30 years of age when registered on study. Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines. Patients must have highrisk neuroblastoma according to COG risk classification at the time of study enrollment. Patients who were initially considered low or intermediate risk, but then reclassified as high risk are also eligible. Patients must have at least ONE of the following: Recurrent/progressive disease at any time prior to study enrollment regardless of response to frontline therapy. Refractory disease: persistent sites of disease after achieving a best overall response of no response to front line therapy after a minimum of 4 cycles of induction therapy AND patient has never had recurrent/progressive disease. Persistent disease: persistent sites of disease after achieving a best overall response of partial response to frontline therapy after a minimum of 4 cycles of induction therapy AND patient has never had recurrent/progressive disease. Patients must have at least ONE of the following (lesions may have received prior radiation therapy as long as they meet the other criteria listed below): At least one MIBG avid bone site or diffuse MIBG uptake. For recurrent/progressive or refractory disease, a biopsy is not required regardless of number of MIBG avid lesions For persistent disease, if patient has only 1 or 2 MIBG avid lesions OR a Curie core of 1 2, then biopsy confirmation of neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroma in at least one site present at the time of enrollment (bone marrow, bone or soft tissue) is required to be obtained at any time point prior to enrollment and two weeks subsequent to most recent prior therapy. If a patient has 3 or more MIBG avid lesions OR a Curie Score of ≥ 3 then no biopsy is required for eligibility. Any amount of neuroblastoma tumor cells in the bone marrow based on routine morphology (with or without immunocytochemistry) in at least one sample from bilateral aspirates and biopsies. At least one soft tissue site that meets criteria for a TARGET lesion defined by: Size: Lesion can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a longest diameter ≥ 10mm, or for lymph nodes ≥ 15mm short axis. Lesions meeting size criteria will be considered measurable. In addition to size, a site needs to meet one of the following criteria: MIBG avid. For patients with persistent disease only: If a patient has only 1 or 2 MIBG avid lesions OR a Curie Score of 1 2, then biopsy confirmation of neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma in at least one site present at time of enrollment (either bone marrow, bone and/or soft tissue) is required to be obtained at any time point prior to enrollment and at least two weeks subsequent to most recent prior therapy. If a patient has 3 or more MIBG avid lesions OR a Curie Score of ≥ 3 then no biopsy is required for eligibility. FDGPET avid (only if tumor known to be MIBG nonavid). These patients must have had a biopsy confirming neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma in at least one FDGPET avid site present at the time of enrollment done prior to enrollment and at least two weeks subsequent to the most recent prior therapy. Nonavid lesion (both MIBG and FDGPET nonavid). These patients must have had a biopsy confirming neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma in at least one nonavid lesion present at the time of enrollment done prior to enrollment and at least two weeks subsequent to the most recent prior therapy. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks and a Lansky (&lt; 16 years age) or Karnofsky (&gt; 16 years age) score of at least 50 Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all previous chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to study enrollment.

Please refer to table posted at www.nant.org for definition of halflives for specific monoclonal antibodies. Patients must not have received radiation for a minimum of two weeks prior to study enrollment. Patients are eligible 12 weeks after date of autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion following myeloablative therapy (timed from first day of this protocol therapy). Patients are not eligible post allogeneic stem cell transplant. Patients who have received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion to support nonmyeloablative therapy (such as 131IMIBG) are eligible at any time as long as they meet the other criteria for eligibility. A minimum of 6 weeks must have elapsed after 131IMIBG therapy prior to start of protocol therapy. Patients who have received prior treatment with cyclophosphamide and topotecan are eligible if they did not have tumor relapse/progression while receiving this combination.
