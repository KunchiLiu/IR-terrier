	<brief_summary>This study tests the efficacy of an 8-week, Skype-based, group resiliency training intervention (The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program) for improving psychological stress in patients with Neurofibromatosis. A control group will receive a general health education curriculum. The investigators hypothesize that patients will improve on measures of psychological stress as a result of the resiliency program. A substudy (Unique Protocol ID: 2013P002605b) has been approved to test this study on a sub-population: patients with NF2 who are hard of hearing.</brief_summary>
