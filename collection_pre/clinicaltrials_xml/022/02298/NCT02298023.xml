	<brief_summary>Main purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of tendon injury. ALLO-ASC will be administrated to the patients with supraspinatus partial thickness tear by ultrasonographic guided injection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Injection volume depends on the size of lesion on ultrasound examination. And all injection will be done under ultrasound guidance. Double blind Randomized placebo controlled study will be done with following 3 groups. Each group will have 8 people, so, the total patients will be 24 people. 1. Stem cell treatment group : stem cell 0.5cc (Total: 10 million cells) + Fibrin glue 0.5cc + range of motion exercise 2. Placebo Comparator (Fibrin) group : Normal saline 0.5cc + Fibrin glue 0.5cc + range of motion exercise 3. Exercise comparator group : Normal saline 0.5cc + Normal saline 0.5cc + range of motion exercise The investigators will compare the efficacy difference with VAS(visual analog scale, primary outcome), ASES(American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) Score, UCLA(University of California, Los Angles) Shoulder Score, DASH(The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Score and change of hypoechogenic lesion with ultrasonography. These measurement will be done at 6 and 12 weeks after injections and long-term follow-up will be also planned to 6 months, 12months and 24 months.</detailed_description>
