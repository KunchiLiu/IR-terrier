	<brief_title>Tea Components, Mental Stress and Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Caffeine and (mental) stress can increase blood pressure. In a typical everyday and/or work environment they commonly coincide. Tea has the reputation of being a relaxing drink. L-theanine is an amino acid found almost exclusively in tea. In a previous study it was shown that caffeine increased blood pressure, while theanine antagonised these effects. In the current study the effect of theanine to a placebo on blood pressure are directly compared.</detailed_description>
