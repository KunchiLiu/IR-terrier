	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat (INCB024360) administered in combination with atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and Stage IV urothelial carcinoma who have failed a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. The study will be conducted in two phases. The dose escalation phase will utilize a 3 + 3 design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a Pharmacologically Active Dose (PAD) of the combination. This will be followed by a dose expansion phase, which will be comprised of three cohorts. Expansion Cohorts 1 &amp; 2 will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics at the dose identified in phase one. Expansion Cohort 3 will evaluate the change in biomarker expression following treatment with epacadostat as monotherapy followed by epacadostat and atezolizumab administered in combination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects, age 18 years or older Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC Stage IIIB or Stage IV NSCLC who are not candidates for multimodality treatment and have received at least 1 line of standard platinumbased therapy: Prior systemic regimens must include at least 2 cycles of a platinumbased therapy and may include platinum therapy used as a radiosensitizer. Maintenance chemotherapy is allowed. Tumors with driver mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive or anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive) should have had disease progression or been intolerant to the standard tyrosinekinase inhibitor (TKI), and should include a second line TKI where such therapy is available and indicated. Subjects initially treated with a platinum regimen for Stage IIIB disease who later develop metastatic disease and are retreated with a platinum regimen are allowed. Histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma. Stage IV locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinumcontaining chemotherapy or had disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinumcontaining chemotherapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1. Presence of measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 Availability of an adequate archival tumor specimen or willingness to undergo a pretreatment tumor biopsy. Subjects enrolled in Expansion Cohort 3 must be willing to have 2 ontreatment tumor biopsies. For males and females of childbearing potential, willingness to use adequate birth control through 90 days after the last dose of epacadostat or atezolizumab. Laboratory and medical history parameters not within protocoldefined range. Current treatment with an investigational study drug or immunologicalbased agent for any reason, or receipt of anticancer medication within 21 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) before first dose. Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, antiCTLA4, antiPD1, antiPDL1, and any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation) or an IDO inhibitor. Prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks before study Day 1, or has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Has an active or inactive autoimmune process. Has a history of pneumonitis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial lung disease. Prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of therapy; Must have recovered from all radiationrelated toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases or CNS metastases that have progressed after completion of radiotherapy. Use of systemic corticosteroids â‰¤ 2 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
