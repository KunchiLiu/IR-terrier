	<brief_title>Cetuximab, Cisplatin and BYL719 for HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HPV status and tobacco use are the major independent prognostic factors for patients with OPSCC. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC have a favorable prognosis when treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery. This has resulted in national trials investigating de-intensification strategies for good-risk patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, where current multimodality paradigms may represent overtreatment. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network, a mitogenic pathway regulating cellular metabolism, proliferation and survival, plays a major role in HPV biology. Starting with early infection, activation of PI3K suppresses autophagy and induces functional protein translational machinery. Activation of the pathway is a nearly universal aspect of mammalian viral infection, and is of particular importance for dsDNA viruses such as HPV. The oncoproteins E5, E6 and E7 also have direct roles in pathway activation. Moreover, HPV-associated OPSCC demonstrates a strikingly high prevalence of genomic activation of the PI3K pathway, including activating PIK3CA mutations (27-31%), PIK3CA amplification (20%), and loss of PTEN (30%), the negative regulator of PI3K. Overall genomic events hypothesized to result in PI3K pathway activation are present in approximately 45-60% of HPV-transformed OPSCC. BYL719 is an oral, small molecule, alpha-specific inhibitor of PI3-Kinase. Because HPV-associated OPSCC demonstrates a high rate of both genomic and non-genomic PI3K pathway activation, we hypothesize that adding BYL719 to platinum-taxane induction chemotherapy in HPV-associated OPSCC will increase clinico-radiologic complete response relative to historical control. In this phase I/II trial, eligible patients wiht HPV-associated OPSCC will be treated with 3 cycles of induction BYL719, cisplatin and paclitaxel. Induction will be followed by minimally-invasive, transoral surgery (TORS or TLM) then risk-adapted IMRT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnosed, cytologically or histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (and common variants, including poorly differentiated carcinoma; undifferentiated carcinoma; basaloid carcinoma) of the oropharynx. Patients must have resectable oropharyngeal and nodal disease, including the following stages according to the American Joint Commission on Cancer Staging 7th edition: T1N13 T2N13 T3N03 T4aN03. Note: Eligible T4a tumors may include deep/extrinsic tongue muscle invasion and must be judged resectable by TLM or TORS, according to the surgeoninvestigator. Patients with T4a tumors with clear radiologic mandibular, hard palate or medial pterygoid invasion are not eligible. Carcinoma must be HPVassociated, which is defined as positive for p16 protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC). p16 positivity is defined as ≥70% of tumor cells demonstrating diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for p16 by immunohistochemistry in a CLIA certified pathology lab. p16 testing is standard at participating institutions and may be conducted locally.

No prior systemic chemotherapy, systemic biologic/molecular targeted therapy or radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Patients may have received chemotherapy or radiation for a previous, curatively treated nonHNSCC malignancy, provided at least 2 years have elapsed without evidence of recurrence. Patients must be untreated with radiation above the clavicles. Patients with a history of curativelytreated nonHNSCC malignancy must be diseasefree for at least 2 years except for excised and cured: carcinomainsitu of breast or cervix; nonmelanomatous skin cancer; T12, N0, M0 resected differentiated thyroid carcinoma; superficial bladder cancer; T1a or T1b prostate cancer comprising &lt; 5% of resected tissue with normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) since resection.

A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid, during the period of BYL719 treatment (induction chemotherapy) and for 4 weeks following completion of BYL719. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and 12 weeks after completion of all study treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
