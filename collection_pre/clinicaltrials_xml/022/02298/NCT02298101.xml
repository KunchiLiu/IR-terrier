	<brief_summary>Aeroneb Solo Adapter is a vibrating-mesh nebulizer Aeroneb Solo combined to a spacer specifically designed for spontaneously breathing patients. This device has not been investigated in vivo yet. It's known that using a spacer during nebulization improves aerosol delivery. We hypothetized that lung deposition could be highly increased with the Aeroneb Solo Adapter in comparison to a standard jet nebulizer.</brief_summary>
