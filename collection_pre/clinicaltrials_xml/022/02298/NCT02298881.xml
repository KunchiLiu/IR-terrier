	<detailed_description>"Dry eye" is a very common eye condition, which may or may not be caused by specific microorganisms that live on the surface of the eye. In this study, a combination of tissue culture and molecular biology techniques will be used to identify every microbe (bacteria, fungus, or virus) on the surface of eyes of people with dry eye syndrome, as well as a 'control' group of people who don't have dry eye disease.</detailed_description>
