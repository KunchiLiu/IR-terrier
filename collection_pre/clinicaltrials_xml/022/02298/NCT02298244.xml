	<brief_summary>Some patients with a long history of AF develops PH "reactive" type with an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance due to vasoconstriction or structural changes of the vascular wall. RFA PVI + RFA GP is the "gold standard" in the treatment of patients with persistent AF, do not respond to optimal therapy. The rear area of the pulmonary artery bifurcation is adjacent to the roof and part of the front of the left atrium. In the projection of this area are ganglionic plexus of the left atrium, the sympathetic nerve fibers of the pulmonary artery and baroreceptors main pulmonary artery.Recent studies have shown that radiofrequency denervation of the pulmonary artery improves the quality of life in patients with PH.</brief_summary>
