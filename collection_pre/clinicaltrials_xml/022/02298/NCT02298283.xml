	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin as Consolidation Treatment in Patients With Stage I/II HL and PET Positivity After 2 Cycles of ABVD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate the progression free survival after treatment for patient with stage I/II supradiaphragmatic HL patient and PET positive after 2 courses of ABVD. The treatment consist of 3 phases : - induction treatment with 2 cycles every 3 weeks of bleomycin, etoposide, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, oncovin, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) escalated - radiotherapy 30 Gy starting 3 to 4 weeks after last day of second course of BEACOPP-escalated - consolidation treatment with 8 cycles every 21 days of brentuximab vedotin</detailed_description>
