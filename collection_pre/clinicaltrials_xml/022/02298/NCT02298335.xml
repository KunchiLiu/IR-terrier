	<brief_title>Glucocorticoid in Treatment of Adult Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome：a Prospective Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In full-dose induction period, patients scheme to visit at the 4th and 8th week, and in protracted tapering period at 10th , 22nd, 42nd and 66th week. If the patients reach complete remission within 4 weeks, prednisone may be decreased at the 6th week, otherwise keep on the course to the 8th week. All patients reach complete remission will shift to protracted tapering period and follow up until prednisone withdrawal, except the cases that relapse and drop out the study. If proteinuria reappears in someone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor（ACEI） or angiotensin receptor blocker（ARB） will be considered combination, on the premise of the blood pressure is affordable.</detailed_description>
