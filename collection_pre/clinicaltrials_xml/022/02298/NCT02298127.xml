	<brief_title>Auricular Acupressure for Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uncontrolled trials indicated that auricular acupressure is an effective treatment for addictive behaviors such as smoking cessation. However, some methodological limitations can be identified among clinical trials in this area, and it is not clear whether it is more efficacious to use the commonly-used acupoints or other points that are specifically for reducing the withdrawal symptoms of nicotine. The study addresses the identified methodological shortcomings of the previous similar studies. It consists of a total of three intervention groups, which allows comparisons between the commonly-used acupoints of acupressure, acupoints specific to smoking cessation, and a sham-controlled intervention. The study does not only focus on the efficacy of smoking cessation but also assesses the mediate effect of auricular acupressure on nicotine withdrawal by questionnaire and biomarkers. This is the first study of its kind to yield information on the acceptability and effectiveness of a safe, available auricular acupressure technique on smoking cessation in Hong Kong. The findings could provide further information for the development of future tobacco-control activities targeting smokers in a wider population who would like to use acupressure as a treatment option.</detailed_description>
