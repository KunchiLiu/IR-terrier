	<brief_summary>Currently investigators do not have diagnostic and prognostic markers for SSc which almost always starts with a vascular disease (Raynaud's disease) isolated for several years. The primary purpose is to highlight discriminating metabolic profiles depending on the characteristics of the disease, allowing early diagnosis of SSc at the onset of vascular lesions, by comparing the profiles of SSc beginners (&lt;3 years) to established forms (&gt; 3 years). Secondary purposes: - Prognosis: to study the metabolomics profile of SSc when a visceral complication occurs - Diagnosis: to compare the metabolomics profile of SSc to undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCDT), Raynaud's disease (RD), vascular disease (VD) and healthy controls - Exploratory: to compare the metabolomics profile of blood, urine and skin of SSc patients</brief_summary>
