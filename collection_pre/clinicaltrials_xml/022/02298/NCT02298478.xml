	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a computer-aided self-help treatment for flying phobia with or without support by the therapist, compared to a waiting list control group. The principal hypothesis is that the two intervention groups will improve significantly compared to the waiting list control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Computer-aided Self-help Treatment for Flying Phobia: NO-FEAR Airlines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the most prevalent phobias in our society is the fear of flying or flying phobia (FP). Surveys which identify clinically significant phobias estimate point prevalence at approximately 2.5% of the adult population. Around 10% of the general population do not fly due to intense fear, 25% of the population that fly experience intense distress during the flight and 20% of people depend on alcohol or tranquilizers to overcome the fear of flying. The most effective psychological technique for the treatment of phobias is in vivo exposure. Besides, not all patients benefit from in vivo exposure, given that an important amount of them do not accept the intervention or drop out (around 25%) when they are informed about the intervention procedure or they have problems to access to these therapies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are pioneer applications that can improve treatment adherence and acceptance. Specifically, Computerized programs boasts remarkable advantages beyond strictly therapeutic and effectiveness-related ones in treating fear of flying: a reduction in direct therapeutic contact time, the possibility of standardizing treatment to the maximum, the low cost - which allows a greater extension - and, perhaps most importantly, access to patients who would not be very willing to subject themselves to live exposure (a real flight) with a steep exposure gradient. The application of cognitive-behavioural procedures such as exposure through interactive computer programs is especially recommended.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be between 1865 years of age, To meet current DSM5 criteria for specific phobia (flying phobia). Be willing to participate in the study. Be able to use a computer and having an Internet connection at home. Be able to understand and read Spanish. Have an email address. Be receiving psychological treatment for fear of flying. A severe mental disorder on Axis I: abuse or dependence of alcohol or other substances, psychotic disorder, dementia or bipolar disorder. Presence of depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation or plan. Presence of heart disease. Pregnant women (from the fourth month). Participants with comorbid and related disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, claustrophobia or acrophobia) will be included once flying phobia is the primary diagnosis. In contrast, participants who do not meet inclusion criteria will be encouraged to seek treatment alternatives better suited to their specific needs.</criteria>
