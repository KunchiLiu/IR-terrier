	<brief_summary>There are many risk prediction models. And their estimates are different. This study aimed to investigate the differences between the estimates of Fuwai and Reynolds risk model in Chinese, and investigate the reason for the differences.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of the Estimates of Fuwai and Reynolds Risk Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participants will examined for cardiovascular risk factors, and their cardiovascular risks will be calculated based on the values of the risk factors using cardiovascular risk models. The estimates of different risk models will be compared, and the levels of traditional risk factors will be adjusted in order to evaluate the impacts of uncommon risk factors such as social and genetic risk factors.</detailed_description>
