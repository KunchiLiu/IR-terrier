	<brief_summary>This study will compare surgical and non surgical treatments of peri-implantitis. Peri-implantitis is an inflammation around dental implants that can lead to the loss of the implant over time if no treatment is established. The signs of peri-implantitis included bleeding of the gingiva, swelling and redness. Most of times there is no pain. Patients presenting with these characteristics will be included at random to one of the treatment groups. Those allocated to the non-surgical group will received implant cleansing after local anesthesia using adequate instruments. In the surgical group, patients will be submitted to a surgical procedure around the implant for visualization and cleansing also after local anesthesia. All patients will be followed over a 12-month period. The hypothesis is that surgical treatment is better than non-surgical treatment regarding clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and immunological.characteristics.</brief_summary>
