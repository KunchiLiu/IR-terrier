	<brief_title>Megakaryocytic Progenitor Cells for Prophylaxis and Treatment of Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thrombocytopenia is a common and potentially fatal complication of chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Owing to the short storage time and increased demand of platelets from unrelated donors, a constant shortage in the supply of platelets has become an important medical and society challenge. Therefore, investigation of alternative sources of platelets would be beneficial. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be used to generate functional megakaryocytic progenitors (MPs), megakaryocytes, and platelets on a large scale. Functional MPs and platelets have successfully been produced in vitro from CD34+ hematopoietic cells from bone marrow, cord blood, and peripheral blood. Several studies have reported that transplantation of in vitro auto-producing MPs can promote platelet recovery after high-dose therapy and HSC transplantation. Umbilical cord blood is an abundant source of HSCs. In vitro large scale production of MPs from cord blood could represent an effective platelet substitute. Theoretically, the additional transplantation of ex vivo generated progenitor and post-progenitor cells might lead to the production of sufficient numbers of mature functional cells within a few days after transplantation.</detailed_description>
