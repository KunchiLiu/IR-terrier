	<brief_summary>Despite an increasing pharmacopoeia of effective medications for the treatment of bipolar disorder, patient outcomes continue to be impacted by treatment adherence. Non-adherence to treatments is also a major obstacle in translating efficacy in research settings into effectiveness in clinical practice. Non-adherence with bipolar disorder (BD) medication treatment dramatically worsens outcomes. Reasons for non-adherence among individuals with BD are multi-dimensional, and it has been suggested that a multifaceted intervention will be more effective. The study is aimed to assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention on enhancing medications adherence in patients with bipolar disorders.</brief_summary>
