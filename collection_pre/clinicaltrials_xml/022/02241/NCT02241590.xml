	<brief_summary>Liver Cirrhosis is a common pathological consequence of chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is one of most etiologies of liver cirrhosis in China. The effective inhibition of HBV can partially stop or reverse liver fibrosis in patients with chronic Hepatitis and liver cirrhosis due to HBV, and the anti-fibrotic strategy focusing on the regulation of hepatic extracellular matrix is still required and hopefully improve the efficacy of anti-virals for liver fibrotic patients with HBV, especially is necessary for in the patients with advance fibrosis stage ie. liver cirrhosis. Fuzheng Huayu has been found to enhance the degradation of collagens in fibrotic liver and have a good action against liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, there are no high quality clinical evidences which can demonstrate if the combination of anti-viral and anti-fibrotic therapy can improve the reversion of liver cirrhosis due to HBV. The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of the combination of Entecavir and Fuzheng Huayu for the reversion of liver fibrosis in patients with liver cirrhosis due to HBV.</brief_summary>
