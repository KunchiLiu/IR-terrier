	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), has on joint pain and functionality in people with Osteoarthritis (OA). SVF contains components with "regenerative" properties, including stem cells that have shown promise for ameliorating specific disease conditions. This study is designed to evaluate joint pain and functionality changes in individuals with OA for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.</brief_summary>
