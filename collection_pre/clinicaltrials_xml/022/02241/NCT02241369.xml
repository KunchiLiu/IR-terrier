	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-3106 alone or in combination with INO-9012 DNA vaccines delivered by Electroporation to subjects with HPV6 associated aerodigestive precancerous lesions and malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy in Subjects With HPV-6 Associated Aerodigestive Precancerous Lesions and Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 mg or 6 mg INO-3106 alone or in combination with 1 mg of INO-9012 (DNA plasmid encoding human interleukin 12) delivered by electroporation (EP) in subjects with HPV6 associated aerodigestive precancerous lesions and malignancies. Subjects will be enrolled in 2 cohorts (3 subjects in each cohort): Cohort I: First 3 subjects will be enrolled sequentially and will receive INO-3106 alone or in combination with INO-9012. Cohort II: The next 3 subjects will be treated with 6 mg of INO-3106 and 1 mg of INO-9012, or at the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) determined in Cohort I.</detailed_description>
