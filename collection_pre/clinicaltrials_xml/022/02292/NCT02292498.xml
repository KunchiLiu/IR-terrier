	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if thermal images can be used to diagnose bacterial pneumonia instead of a chest x-ray. More specifically, the objectives of this study are: 1) to determine if thermal imaging, using a commercial thermal camera can accurately detect the presence of bacterial pneumonia in patients receiving a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia; 2) to evaluate the use of thermal imaging to monitor the course and resolution of pneumonia in patients receiving chest x-rays for this purpose.</brief_summary>
