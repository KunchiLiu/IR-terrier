	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is associated with respiratory muscle weakness and autonomic neuropathy. The exercise of inspiratory muscles has been investigating in various clinical situations and may cause similar benefits as the conventional exercises. The assessment of glucose variability has been used as an alternative tool to evaluate the others mechanisms than the absolute values of glucose levels, special during the exercise. However, the effect of inspiratory muscle exercise on glucose levels and glucose variability is not clear yet. The aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the acute effects of inspiratory muscle exercise using a high load of 60% of MIP on glucose levels and glucose variability in patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Effects of Inspiratory Muscle Exercise on Glucose Level and Glucose Variability in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-intensity exercise of inspiratory muscle was able to reduce glucose levels in previous studies, but the mechanisms underlying this reduction remain largely unknown. The present study will investigate this phenomenon, and whether confirmed, the inspiratory muscle loading would be a new approach for lowering glucose levels and glucose variability in type 2 diabetes. The subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited from the ambulatory of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. The patients will be randomized to inspiratory muscle exercise with a high intensity load (MIP 60%) or to exercise with a load placebo (MIP 2%), on two different days. The subjects will come in the laboratory for three days consecutively during 2 weeks. On the first day will be placed the CGMS device. On the second day will be the controlled ventilation protocol with subsequently inspiratory muscle exercise, using 2% or 60% of MIP as randomized a priori. On the third day the CGMS will be removed. Individuals who are using beta-blockers will be advised to withdraw the medication 24 hours before the protocols. During all protocols will be recorded the continuous blood pressure to assess heart rate and blood pressure variabilities, both time and frequency domains will be analyzed. Also, the calf blood flow, inspiratory pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation will be taking.</detailed_description>
