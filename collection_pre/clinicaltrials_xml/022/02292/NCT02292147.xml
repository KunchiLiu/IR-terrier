	<brief_title>Functional Outcome After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional outcome after cerebral anoxia due to cardiac arrest is poorly documented.. Survival after out of hospital cardiac arrest has improved and long term follow up of the patients is not routinely effective. Patients showing sign of awakening very early are considered in a good outcome group. Nevertheless they can experience some restriction and difficulties when they try to return to their premorbid level of functioning. We aim to study their long term functional outcome and their level of anxiety, depression, quality of life and caregiver burden as well as their general cognitive functioning. Prognosis factors will be studied in the acute phase.</detailed_description>
