	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes for blindness in industrialized countries. It is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, morphological changes in the optic nerve head and a characteristic loss of visual field. Although increased intraocular pressure has been identified as the major risk factor for the development and the progression of the disease it has been speculated for a long time that impaired ocular blood flow may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. This concept has been supported by several epidemiological studies showing that low ocular perfusion pressure and small retinal vessel caliber are associated with the disease. The proposed study tests the hypothesis that patients with glaucoma have reduced total retinal blood flow as compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, autoregulation of blood flow will be investigated during an increase in ocular perfusion pressure. This is of importance because it may clarify the degree of vascular involvement in glaucoma.</brief_summary>
