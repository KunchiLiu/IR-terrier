	<criteria>Willing and able to provide written informed consent Have either previously participated in a Gileadsponsored HCV study and received a sofosbuvircontaining regimen without interferon OR at preselected sites only, have received an alloral SOFbased regimen outside a clinical study. These individuals must have documentation of the regimen, start and end of treatment dates (month and year), and of having achieved SVR12. Have achieved SVR either in a Gileadsponsored study, as defined in the treatment protocol OR for individuals who enroll after receiving an alloral SOFbased regimen outside a clinical study, SVR will be defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ approximately 12 weeks following last dose of treatment. Have liver cirrhosis, as defined in the treatment protocol, and have not had a liver transplant after receiving a SOFcontaining regimen OR individuals who enroll after receiving an alloral SOFbased regimen outside a clinical study, will have had cirrhosis confirmed prior to initiation of HCV treatment. Individuals planning to initiate a new course of HCV therapy, including approved products and any investigational agents, during the course of this Registry History of clinicallysignificant illness or any other major medical disorder that may interfere with the followup, assessments, or compliance with the protocol</criteria>
