	<brief_title>The Combination of Adductor Canal Block and Periarticular Injection. A Novel Technique for Patients Undergoing Total Knee Replacement (ACB PAI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 106 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty will be randomized into two groups: one to receive only Periarticular injections and the other periarticular injections AND adductor canal block. Patients will be asked their numeric pain scores before surgery as baseline and at 24 and 48 hours post-operation. Patients also will be asked questions from painOUT questionnaire at 24 and 48 hours. Time to reach discharge criteria based on physical therapy assessments will also be measured.</detailed_description>
