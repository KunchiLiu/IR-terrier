	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa administered intravenously in pediatric patients every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. Secondary Objective: To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and evaluate the pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa administered intravenously in pediatric patients every 2 weeks for 52 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The maximum study duration per patient is approximately 18 months (screening period: up to 60 days; treatment period: 64 weeks; post-treatment period: up to 37 days, not applicable if patient enrolls in a long term extension treatment trial).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: The patient and/or patient's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must provide written informed assent/consent prior to any protocolrelated procedures being performed. The patient is aged 0 to &lt;18 years of age on the date of informed assent/consent. The patient has documented deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase as measured in peripheral leukocytes, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphocytes. The patient has a spleen volume ≥5 multiples of normal (MN) measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); patients who have had partial splenectomy will be allowed if the procedure was performed ≥1 year before screening and the residual spleen volume is ≥5 MN. The patient's height is 1 Zscore or lower. A negative serum pregnancy test in female patients of childbearing potential. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients must be willing to practice true abstinence in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or use 2 acceptable effective methods of contraception. Exclusion criteria: The patient has received an investigational drug within 30 days before study enrollment. The patient has any of the following medical conditions: An active, serious, intercurrent illness. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cirrhosis (determined by clinical evaluation). Significant cardiac disease (eg, clinically significant arrhythmia, moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension or valvular dysfunction, or &lt;40% left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiogram). Malignancy diagnosed within the previous 5 years (except basal cell carcinoma). Any other extenuating circumstance that can significantly interfere with study compliance, including all prescribed evaluations and followup activities. The patient has acute or rapidly progressive neurological abnormalities. The patient is homozygous for SMPD1 gene mutations R496L, L302P, and fs330 or any combination of these 3 mutations. The patient has a delay of gross motor skills. The patient has had a major organ transplant (eg, bone marrow, liver). The patient requires use of invasive ventilatory support. The patient requires use of noninvasive ventilatory support while awake and for &gt;12 hours a day. The patient, in the investigator's opinion, is unable to adhere to the requirements of the study. The patient has a platelet count &lt;60 × 10^3/µL (based on the average of 2 screening samples obtained up to 24 hours apart). The patient has alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;250 IU/L or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL. The patient has an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 The patient is unwilling or unable to abstain from ingesting alcohol the day before through 3 days after each infusion of olipudase alfa during the treatment period. Measuring alcohol concentration in blood is not required. The patient is scheduled during the study for inpatient hospitalization including elective surgery. The patient requires medication(s) that may can decrease olipudase alfa activity (eg, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine; tricyclic antidepressants [eg, imipramine, or desipramine]). The patient is breastfeeding. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
