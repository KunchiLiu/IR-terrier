	<brief_title>Peer to Peer Delivery of Behavioral Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project focuses on helping to solve a growing problem in health care today. Through increased screening in the older adult population, detection of depression has increased which has established a growing need for mental health resources. Unfortunately, there are limited resources to keep up with the steady increase of individuals in need. Training peers to work with older depressed adults in techniques such as behavioral activation provides an alternative model to help moderate the increased need and provide a unique intervention of care. Developing an innovative peer facilitated program has the potential to enhance the delivery of quality health care. The specific aims of the study are 1) to train peer coaches and implement Peer to Peer in the community 2) to examine depression ratings over time.</detailed_description>
