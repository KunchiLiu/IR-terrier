	<brief_summary>Prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multicenter observational study. The objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the MGuard™ Prime stent in the treatment of de novo stenotic lesions in coronary arteries in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a real-world setting.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject is &gt;18 years of age. 2. Subject is experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) of &gt;30 minutes and &lt;24 hours. 3. Based on coronary anatomy, primary PCI is indicated for the culprit lesion with anticipated use of stenting. 4. Subject agrees to all required followup procedures and visits and has provided informed consent where required. 5. The target lesion is a de novo lesion in a native coronary artery. 6. The reference vessel diameter (RVD) of the infarct lesion is 2.754.0 mm by visual assessment. 1. Subject undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 2. Cardiogenic shock (SBP &lt;80 mmHg for &gt;30 minutes, or requiring IV pressors or intraaortic balloon bump (IABP) or other hemodynamic support device for hypotension). 3. Comorbid condition(s) or others that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the trial or to comply with followup requirements, or impact the scientific integrity of the trial. 4. Target lesion involves a bifurcation with a side branch &gt;/=2.0 mm in diameter. 5. In the Investigator's opinion the lesion/vessel is unsuitable for treatment with the MGuard™ Prime Embolic Protection Stent System for any reason.</criteria>
