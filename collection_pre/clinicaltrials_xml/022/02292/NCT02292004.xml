	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and early efficacy of a newly developed device, bridge-enhanced scaffold (MIACH™,) used to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL.) Ten participants will undergo surgery with the new device (Experimental Group) and 10 will undergo a standard ACL reconstruction surgery (Control Group.)</brief_summary>
