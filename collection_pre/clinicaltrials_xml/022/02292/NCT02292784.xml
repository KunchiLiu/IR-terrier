	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and outcomes of infants and children who were exposed to retosiban or comparator in utero in the planned Phase III spontaneous preterm labor (SPTL) treatment studies, to provide assurance that treatment is not associated with significant adverse outcomes in early childhood. The enrolled infants and children will be followed at pre-specified intervals until they reach 5 years chronological age. This study does not require medical interventions or study visits to an investigational site, instead, parents or legal guardians will be prompted at certain time points to complete developmental questionnaires and other data on their children's health status via an electronic device. Data collected during the infant and child follow up study will be managed by a centralized research coordinating center (RCC). Regionally based pediatricians will serve as study principal investigators (referred to as RCC-PIs) for this study. All communications the RCC-PI has with the parent/legal guardian or the child's health care provider (HCP) will occur remotely; there will be no clinic visits.</brief_summary>
