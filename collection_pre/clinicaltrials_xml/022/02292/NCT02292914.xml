	<brief_summary>The robot-assisted surgery allows three-dimensional view, detailed access of small structures, depth perception and articulated movements with wide latitude. Thinking about the inclusion of this branch of surgical outcome ICESP encouraged the training of their doctors and other health professionals , and has three tutors in the area of robot- assisted laparoscopic surgery , and various medical clinical staff , already trained , and already perform the procedure in other centers . The da Vinci ® Surgical System ( only existing in the World market) , consisting of one or two consoles for the surgeon and a tutor if necessary was adopted. Ergonomically designed, a stand next to the patient , with four interactive robotic arms , one of them , a vision system for high performance and the other three for exclusive EndoWrist ® instruments . Driven by the latest robotic technology , computer programs , frictionless transmission of manual controls , movements in scale and filtered made by the surgeon in the da Vinci ® System console are translated into precise movements of the instruments EndoWrist ® For surgeons , the da Vinci ® System offers superior 3D viewing with larger surgical precision ergonomic comfort and dexterity . For hospitals , the da Vinci ® Surgical System enables clinical and economic benefits of minimally invasive surgery are applied to a broader base of patients cirúrgicos.The main objective is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery in the surgical treatment of cancer in operations below, as their specialties : Digestive , Urology , Gynecology , Head and Neck and Thorax . This is a prospective study lasting 36 months , where 1120 patients with surgical diseases in programming for the following operations will be studied : transthoracic esophagectomy ; subtotal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy ; partial pancreatectomy ; resection of the rectum ; prostatectomy ; cystectomy ; partial nephrectomy ; hysterectomy with or without pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy ; resection of malignant tumors of the mouth and orofaringolaringe and lung lobectomy . Patients will come from the outpatient services of the Institute of Cancer of São Paulo - ICESP</brief_summary>
