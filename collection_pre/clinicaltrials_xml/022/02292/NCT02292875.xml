	<brief_summary>Grass pollen allergens are recognised as a major cause of allergic diseases in humans and animals. Worldwide, at least 40% of allergic patients are sensitised to grass pollen allergens and between 50-90% of hayfever or seasonal allergy sufferers are allergic to grass pollen. ToleroMune Grass is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of grass allergy. The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to Grass in the EEU among subjects who completed all dosing visits in study TG002 approximately two years after the start of treatment.</brief_summary>
