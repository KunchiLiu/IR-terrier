	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well irinotecan and cetuximab with or without bevacizumab work in treating patients with RAS wild-type colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Irinotecan may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving irinotecan and cetuximab with or without bevacizumab may work betting in treating patients with colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Cetuximab With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With RAS Wild-Type Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess and compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients receiving irinotecan, cetuximab, and bevacizumab with patients receiving irinotecan, cetuximab and placebo, in the population of patients with RAS wild-type, irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who also previously received bevacizumab in at least one prior line therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the adverse event (AE) profile and safety of the proposed treatment in this population. II. To assess and compare the overall survival (OS) between treatment arms in this population. III. To assess and compare the disease control rate (DCR) between treatment arms in this population. IV. To assess and compare the overall response rate (ORR) between treatment arms in this population. V. To assess and compare the duration of response between treatment arms in this population. VI. To assess and compare time to treatment failure between treatment arms in this population. VII. To assess relative dose intensity of treatment agents between treatment arms in this population. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the change in genotype concentrations of prespecified gene mutations in circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) collected serially during protocol treatment. II. Explore the predictive value of pretreatment mutation status for cetuximab sensitivity and resistance. III. Explore the predictive value of dynamic changes in mutation status for cetuximab sensitivity and resistance. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 90-120 minutes, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 90-120 minutes, placebo IV over 30-90 minutes, and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) colorectal cancer with histological confirmation of adenocarcinoma Measurable disease RAS wildtype tumor; Note: evidence of EGFR expression in the tumor is not required Previous failure of at least one fluoropyrimidine and irinotecancontaining chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease; Note: previous failure is defined as disease progression while receiving treatment or within 6 weeks after the last dose of irinotecan; failure for this assessment is defined as any enlargement of measurable or assessable lesion(s) or the development of any new lesion; a rising tumor marker alone is not sufficient to define failure; patients can have received irinotecan in any previous line of therapy Treatment with bevacizumab in at least one prior line of therapy for metastatic disease Negative serum or urine pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only; Note: childbearing potential is defined as a female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months; or women on hormone replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone level &gt; 35 mIU/mL); women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or who are practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be of childbearing potential Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS): 0 or 1 Total serum bilirubin =&lt;
