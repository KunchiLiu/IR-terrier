	<brief_summary>High food impulsiveness, impaired food reward and stress response are involved in the phenomena of weight gain and resistance at weight loss. Henceforth, hypnosis is a complementary medicine which is recognized as effective for defined indications. Complexity and diversity of methodological studies with hypnosis does not allow to conclude on its efficacy in treating this disease. In obese subjects with high food impulsiveness, it is expected that Erickson's hypnosis and self-hypnosis practice would improve food disinhibition assessed by an adapted questionary (TFEQ 51).</brief_summary>
