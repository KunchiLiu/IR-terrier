	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Asahi ViE Dialyzer in Canada</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to evaluate specific parameters related to ViE-21 performance including (A) Performance evaluated by uremic solute removal rates of urea, creatinine, ALB and B2-MG, (B) Determination of KUF, (C) Biocompatibility evaluated by WBC, PLT and C3a measurements, (D) Type and number of AEs, (E) Type and number of device malfunctions. Prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-armed, controlled study. Each patient shall have data collected for six dialysis sessions each on a control dialyzer prior to and after 36 sessions with the ViE-21. These data shall be the basis of comparison for the ViE-21 performance. These data will be utilized in support of a US Regulatory Submission. Note: ALB: albumin, B2-MG: beta-2-microglobulin, KUF: coefficient of ultrafiltration, WBC: white blood cell, PLT: platelet, C3a: activated complement 3, AE: adverse event</detailed_description>
