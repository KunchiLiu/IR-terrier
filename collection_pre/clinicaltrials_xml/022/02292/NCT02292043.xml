	<brief_title>Effects of HTEA ON Heart Failure Secondary to Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy or Post-myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators would evaluate the effects of the novel method, HTEA on cardiac function in the heart failure patients secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and post-myocardial infarction. The specific index is 6 miniutes walk distance, echocardiography, NYHA, NTproBNP level, peripherial WBC, RBC, PLT, Cre, UA, K+, Na+ upon entrance to hospital and 4 weeks after HTEA treatment, and 3 months after discharge. The morbidity and re-hospitalization would also calculated 3 months after discharge.</detailed_description>
