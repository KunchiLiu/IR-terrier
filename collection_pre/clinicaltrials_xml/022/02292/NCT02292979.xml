	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin + AVD combination (doxorubicine, vinblastine, dacarbazine) in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma stage I / II with an unfavorable diagnosis, assessed by the negativity of PET (positron emission tomography ) after two cycles of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Associated With Chemotherapy in Untreated Patients With Hodgkin Lymphoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive either ABVD chemotherapy (standard treatment = doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) or the Brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy AVD (study treatment), depending on randomization. Radiotherapy is planned after chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy. PET scans will be performed before inclusion, after 2 cycles of chemotherapy and after 4 cycles of chemotherapy (if PET after two cycles was positive), at the end of treatment and during follow-up period.</detailed_description>
