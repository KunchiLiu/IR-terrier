	<criteria>Subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and healthy subjects Signed and dated informed consent form For small modifications of the insulin doses to achieve certain blood glucose values (system accuracy evaluation): Male or female subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 with intensified insulin therapy (intensified conventional therapy) or insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) Pregnancy or lactation period Severe acute illness that in the opinion of the investigating physician might confound the results of the test or which could result in a risk to the patient caused by the test Mental incapacity or language barriers precluding adequate compliance with the test procedures Severe chronic illness besides diabetes mellitus as assessed by the investigating physician that might confound the results of the test or which could result in a risk to the patient caused by the test Legal incompetence or limited legal competence Dependency from the sponsor or the clinical investigator (e.g. coworkers of the sponsor or the clinical research center) For user performance evaluation: Subjects having used the test systems before themselves or having participated in a study with these Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems For system accuracy evaluation: subjects intended to provide blood samples with glucose concentrations between 50 and 80 mg/dl must not have coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction in history, cerebral events in history, peripheral artery occlusive disease or impaired hypoglycaemia awareness</criteria>
