	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of Kinesio tape on muscle strength of the quadriceps femoris in people with knee pain or symptoms and decreased muscle strength in the quadriceps femoris - a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Kinesio Taping on Muscle Strength in Quadriceps Femoris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of recoil tape with 0-30% tension, by using one application of Kinesio tape over the muscle fibers of the quadriceps femoris from its origin to its insertion. The participants will be divided into intervention group (taping) and control group (no intervention). Muscle strength test will be performed before and immediately after taping (20-30 minutes) for both groups using hand-held dynamometer measurements (MicroFET 3). Work is based on the following hypothesis: "Kinesio taping using recoil taping provides increased isometric muscle strength in quadriceps femoris immediately after application".</detailed_description>
