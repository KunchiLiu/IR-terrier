	<brief_title>Effects of Acthar on Recovery From Cognitive Relapses in MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label study of Acthar administered as treatment for an acute cognitive relapse. Primary and secondary endpoints will be collected prior to Acthar administration and at 3-month follow-up. Comparison will be made to a stable MS control group. The objectives of the study are: 1. To replicate prior findings with steroid therapy for MS patients for cognitive relapses, using instead Acthar Gel as the treating agent. The investigators will determine if the decrease on cognitive endpoints at the time of relapse exceeds that of stable MS controls. 2. To compare the effects above to a previously acquired dataset of relapsing patients treated with steroids. This is a quasi-experimental design in so far as the steroid treated group data were previously acquired in a separate study. The primary hypothesis of the study is that, due to the enhanced melanocortin response in Acthar the recovery from cognitive changes occurring during cognitively focused relapse will be significant compared to stable MS patients matched on age, time since testing, and cognitive performance on the SDMT. Target enrollment for the Acthar treatment group will be 30 MS patients under care at the Jacobs Neurological Institute with existing neuropsychological baseline in the past four years in whom a cognitive relapse or new supratentorial GAD enhancing lesion(s) on MRI have been identified. Cognitive relapse will be identified based on clinical presentation of acute worsening of cognitive symptoms in the domains of processing speed, concentration, episodic memory, working memory, and/or fatigue. Patients whose clinical MRI indicate new active GAD enhancing lesions will be screened for the presence of self-perceived cognitive decline, without new physical symptoms. Thirty (30) clinically stable MS patients matched on age, time since testing, and cognitive performance on the SDMT will be recruited from the pool of patients with existing cognitive baselines.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males/Females between 18 and 65 years of age who are capable of understanding and complying with the protocol (ie. have completed at least a 9th grade education and are fluent English). 2. Have a diagnosis of Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS) or early Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) as per revised McDonald's Criteria. 3. Have an Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) of â‰¤ 7.0. 4. Have had valid neuropsychological testing (NP) within the past 4 years 5. Experiencing an acute cognitive relapse identified by a clinical care provider as a.) a cognitive symptom of recent origin developing over 48 hours, or b.) supratentorial GAD enhancing lesions on MRI with confirmed cognitive decline. Confirmation of cognitive decline will be obtained by administering the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) as a screening procedure for the study and comparing it to scores obtained within 4 years (see inclusion criteria #4). Participants qualify if a raw point change on the SDMT greater than or equal to 3 points is detected. 6. Are capable of performing the requirements of neuropsychological (NP) testing, including near visual acuity 20/70 or better with correction. 7. Have given written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to his/her future medical care. 1. Are found to have evidence on MRI of new lesions in the brainstem, spinal cord, or optic nerve. 2. Have clear new physical signs or symptoms that are referable to the cord, brainstem or optic nerve. 3. Have cognitive deficits/impairment caused by concomitant medication usage, or are attributable to another medical condition or significant neurological/psychological disease. 4. Have evidence of current major depression as determined by a positive Beck Depression InventoryFast Screen (BDIFS) and clinician interview. 5. Patients with changes to medications known to influence cognition (narcotics, stimulants, etc.) or disease modifying therapy within one month of study initiation (or within a time frame deemed high risk by treating physician) will be excluded. 6. Are taking any medication, or have any medical condition contraindicated with Acthar. 7. Presence of current infections as determined by clinician interview. 8. Are currently nursing, intentionally seeking pregnancy, or deemed atrisk for unplanned pregnancy.</criteria>
