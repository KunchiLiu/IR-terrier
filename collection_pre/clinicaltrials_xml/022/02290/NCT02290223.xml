	<brief_title>Patient Activation to Address Chronic Pain and Opioid Management in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic pain (PWCP) typically have multiple chronic conditions, and many points of contact with the health system. They can feel disempowered, and experience fragmented care and poor outcomes. PWCP report concerns about under-treatment of pain, difficulties in obtaining medication, and stigma. Prescription opioids are a very common, and controversial, pain treatment. PWCP often lack the skills and knowledge to talk to their physicians about their pain and opioid use, and to navigate the health care system. The study's aims compare the effectiveness of an innovative behavioral Patient Activation plus Usual Care (PA+UC) intervention to Usual Care (UC) only on patient-centered outcomes among PWCP. While most studies have focused on chronic opioid users, this takes an upstream approach, focusing on patients as they start regular opioid use. The overarching research question is: Can patients' increased activation improve their quality of life? With our stakeholder group of patient, clinical, and operational advisors, we propose a pragmatic, randomized trial to examine the comparative effectiveness of a group-based PA intervention in two large primary care clinics in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). We will randomize 324 PWCP to either the PA+UC arm or UC only arm. The curriculum will cover patient activation and empowerment, how to talk to doctors about prescription opioid use, and self-management of chronic pain, including how to navigate the health care system and a patient portal. We will further develop the study questions, intervention curriculum, outcome measures, and dissemination plan with our stakeholder groups. We will examine effects over 12 months using follow-up patient interviews combined with electronic health records and a mixed effects modeling approach. Patient outcomes include patient-reported activation, quality of life, prescription opioid use, pain severity and function, patient-provider communication, patient satisfaction, knowledge of opioid use risks and benefits, self-care, including use of health information technology, and service utilization.</detailed_description>
