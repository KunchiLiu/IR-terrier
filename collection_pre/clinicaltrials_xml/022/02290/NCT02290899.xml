	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate how the brain responds to a procedure known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and how tDCS affects performance on a behavioral task. Research suggest that this procedure leads to improvement in brain and behavioral measures of inhibitory control (controlling impulses) in healthy control participants. The investigators want to explore whether the same improvement will be seen in kids with ADHD.</brief_summary>
