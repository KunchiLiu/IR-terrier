	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an extended half-life anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody compared to placebo when administered to healthy preterm infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b/2a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Dose-escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MEDI8897, a Monoclonal Antibody With an Extended Half-life Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, in Healthy Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b/2a study will be a dose-escalation design to begin data collection on PK and safety in children. The population to be enrolled is healthy preterm infants born between 32 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days gestation who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or other local guidelines. These subjects will not be receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo comparator group to begin collecting data on incidence rates of RSV medically attended lower respiratory illness (MA-LRI) and efficacy. Enrollment is planned at approximately 20 sites in the USA, Chile, and South Africa.</detailed_description>
