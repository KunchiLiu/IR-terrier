	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the cannulation time during primary wire guided ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography) according to two different length of guide wire: long wire or short wire rapid exchange, artery by a prospective randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time of Cannulation During Primary ERCP With Short Guide Wire Rapid Exchange or With Long Guide Wire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In primary Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) cannulation is wire guided. Up to now there is no doubt about the efficacy of such a procedure. The use of long wire requires the help of another person behind primary operator. The use of short wire rapid exchange allows the primary operator to perform all the steps by himself. Time of cannulation is known to be directly associated to post ERCP pancreatitis. Aim of the study is to assess which length of guide wire allows the shorter cannulation time during primary ERCP. Post ERCP pancreatitis onset will be assessed for all patients</detailed_description>
