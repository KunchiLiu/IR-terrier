	<brief_title>Calcium Dobesilate Versus Coasting for Prevention of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred and twenty women at risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome during ICSI cycles will be randomly scheduled into two equal groups. In group A, (Calcium Dobesilate group), 1 cap / 8 hs Doxium ( 500mg) will be given at day of HCG injection and for 3 weeks ; while in group B (Coasting group), coasting (withholding gonadotrophins while maintaining pituitary suppression) follow up every day by measuring E2 for 3 days then either giving triggering or cycle cancellation is done</detailed_description>
