	<brief_summary>This is a pilot randomized controlled trial intervention to improve lifestyle behaviors (physical activity and health diet) for Filipino Americans with type 2 diabetes on metformin. If the PilAm Go4Health intervention demonstrates potential efficacy, it may identify effective intervention strategies to significantly reduce risks for heart disease risks (i.e., metabolic syndrome) in Filipino Americans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PilAm Go4Health Weight Loss Program to Prevent Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Filipino Americans are the second largest Asian population and fastest growing racial group in the United States. They have one of the highest rates of insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes = T2DM) and central obesity (fat distributions primarily in the abdominal region). T2DM and central obesity are two of five major risk factors for metabolic syndrome that lead to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Key factors contributing to obesity and T2DM in Filipinos are their physical inactivity, and a diet high in fat and soda intake. However, there are very few research studies on improving health behaviors to reduce risks for metabolic syndrome in Filipino Americans. To help reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in overweight/obese Filipino Americans with T2DM, the proposed project will test a culturally appropriate health behavior intervention program to reduce weight and waist circumference, blood glucose levels (evaluating insulin resistance) through increasing physical activity, and lowering fat and sugar sweetened beverage intake. This intervention uses a mobile phone health app and social networking to encourage adherence to target health behaviors. The goals are to: 1. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the culturally appropriate PilAm Go4Health Weight Loss Program 2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of the intervention on weight, BMI, and insulin resistance 3. To conduct post-program process evaluations too improve the intervention relevancy for the target population.</detailed_description>
