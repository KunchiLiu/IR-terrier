	<brief_title>Retinal Oxygen Saturation in Patients With Graves' Ophthalmopathy and in Normal People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graves'ophthalmopathy (GO), also called thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, is often mild and self-limiting, and probably declining in frequency, with only 3-5% of cases posing a threat to eyesight, remaining a pathogenetic enigma and a therapeutic dilemma. In its nonsevere expression, the symptoms and signs include Photophobia, Foreign body sensation, Eyelid retraction, increased intraocular pressure, Lagophthalmos, and Mild diplopia. In its severe expression, it is a disfiguring and invalidating disease with the optic nerve damaged. However, in this study, we want to find if the retinal vessels is affected in the early stage of the disease through observing the oxygen saturation of the retinal vessels and compare it with that of the normal people.</detailed_description>
