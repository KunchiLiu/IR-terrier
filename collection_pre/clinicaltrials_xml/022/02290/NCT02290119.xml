	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to understand the effects of soft-tissue balancing on Gait, function and rehabilitation potential after sensor-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty and correlate Intra-operative subjective feel with OrthoSensor Outputs Secondary objectives are to quantify and observe: - Pain medication use - Swelling - Muscle strength and girth - Gait efficiency - Patient satisfaction - Activity levels, functional return (i.e., back to work, resume normal activities) - Patient perception of a balanced knee</brief_summary>
