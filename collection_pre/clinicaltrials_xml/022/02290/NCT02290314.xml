	<brief_summary>Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is the forward displacement (slip) of one vertebra on an adjacent vertebra resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal or compression of the exiting nerve roots. It is commonly associated with low back and leg pain, and is a frequent reason for spine surgery particularly in individuals over age 65 years. Recently novel minimally invasive surgical techniques have heightened public and government interest by touting benefits of reduced approached-related morbidity which in turn leads to quicker recovery, shorter hospital stay, improved short-term clinical outcomes, and reduced health care cost. However, there is no randomized controlled trial evidence to describe the actual advantages and disadvantages associated with minimally invasive spinal fusion. This pilot study is a randomized control trial comparing minimally invasive MID-line Lumbar Fusion (MIDLF) to traditional "open" posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with respect to length of stay, approach related morbidity, patient centered outcome measures, and cost-effectiveness in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.</brief_summary>
