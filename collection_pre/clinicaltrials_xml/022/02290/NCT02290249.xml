	<brief_summary>Background and aims: Glidescope and Airtraq were designed to facilitate intubation and to improve teaching intubation. The investigators want to find their efficacy in normal airway, tongue edema and face-to-face orotracheal intubation models by novice personal. Material and Methods: After Kocaeli Human Researches Ethics Committee approval, thirty six medical students who were on the beginning of their third year were enrolled in this study. After watching a video about the intubation of one of these devices, they attempted to intubate an adult manikin in three different airway models in a random order; first in normal airway, second, tongue edema and finally, in an entrapped manikin by face-to-face approach with Glidescope or Airtraq. Intubation attempts, insertion and intubation times, success rates, Cormack-Lehane grades, need of maneuvers of these devices were recorded.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trauma victims mostly had to be intubated at the scene of the area with the paramedics. In a suspect of a cervical trauma, patients must be intubated with the least movement. Videolaryngoscopic techniques had several advantages at this condition. We want to investigate which can be used easily by novice personnel.</detailed_description>
