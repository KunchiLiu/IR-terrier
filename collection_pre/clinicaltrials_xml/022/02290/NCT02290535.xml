	<brief_summary>The investigator will determine a compliance of two diagnostic techniques (EIT and Body plethysmography) in collective of children and teenagers with obstructive lung disease and a matched control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Impedance Tomography of Lung in Child and Young Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study is verification of the correlation between EIT-derived data and following extracted parameters of the pulmonary function: - forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) - forced vital capacity (FVC) - relative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1/FVC) - maximal expiratory flow (MEF 25) - total lung capacity (TLC) - resistance (Raw). These findings could bring out new prospective opportunity for pulmonary function tests without cooperation. Furthermore, the study aims to clarify whether EIT technique can be used for regional pulmonary function testing. In addition, dynamic lung function parameter and static radiological techniques will be correlated with EIT.</detailed_description>
