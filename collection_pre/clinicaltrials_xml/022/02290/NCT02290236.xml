	<brief_summary>The overall aim with this project is to describe the correlation between measured and charted saturation after intensive care and also describe the saturation-pattern in these patients. The investigators will also correlate post-ICU desaturations measured as oxygen denaturation index and complications to pre-ICU obstructive sleep apnea and the STOP BANG screening questionnaire.</brief_summary>
