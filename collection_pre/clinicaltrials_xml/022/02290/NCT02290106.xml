	<brief_summary>HMG co-A reductase inhibitors, commonly called statins, are an effective treatment for dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic heart disease with proven mortality benefit. While the lipid-lowering effects of statins are well-known, other metabolic effects, including effects on glucose tolerance and ectopic fat distribution, are less completely understood. Recent studies have shown that some statins may increase the risk of diabetes. Further, research has suggested that statins may have some benefit in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition associated with obesity that includes increased fat in the liver (steatosis) and, in some cases, inflammation and hepatocellular damage (steatohepatitis). Pitavastatin, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009, is the most recent statin to enter the market. Unlike most statins, pitavastatin is not primarily metabolized through cytochrome P450 (CYP450), and thus has reduced potential for interactions with other medications that are metabolized by CYP450. Previous studies have suggested that pitavastatin may be neutral to glucose homeostasis and may improve hepatic lipid. Neither of these effects has been proven definitively, however, and the current proposal aims to characterize in detail the effects of pitavastatin on glucose homeostasis, hepatic steatosis, and steatohepatitis.</brief_summary>
