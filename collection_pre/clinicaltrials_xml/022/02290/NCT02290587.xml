	<brief_summary>In recent years, studies have brought knowledge of the difficulties of social cognition in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The brain tissue alteration at the origin of these difficulties in social cognition mechanisms remain poorly understood. Although recent behavioral studies indicated social disturbances in many of these patients, functional studies investigating specific theory of mind in MS are lacking. The use of new techniques for morphological and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can identify brain activation networks, mapping the achievement and tissue integrity may be related to disorders of social cognition and cognitive. The investigators propose to study social cognition in MS patients using morphological and functional imaging to determine the mechanisms underlying phenomena such as cerebral compensation and its relationship with cognitive impairment.</brief_summary>
