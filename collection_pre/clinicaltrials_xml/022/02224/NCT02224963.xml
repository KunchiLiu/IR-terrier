	<detailed_description>Loss of independence and valued activities places Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) patients at increased risk for depression, anxiety, and disability. Patients' emotional and behavioral responses to AMD can exacerbate the long-term health threat of the disease and contribute to preventable health care costs, loss of productivity, and burden to family members.This is a randomized controlled trial of a psycho-social intervention that addresses three mental health promotion goals: (1) increase emotional well-being, (2) improve future outlook, and (3) protect or enhance current and future-oriented functioning. The trial examines the effects of the PREPSI for 250 AMD patients, 60 and older, regardless of actual vision acuity. All study participants receive 4 group-based vision education classes and resource information. Subjects are then randomized to Preventive Problem Solving Intervention (PREPSI) consisting of 8 sessions with certified problem-solving trainers or to an Enhanced Attention Control arm. Assessors blind to treatment condition measure Psychological Well-being immediately post-intervention (Week 16) and at 6-month follow-up, Change in Future Outlook, including Preparation for Future Care from baseline to 16 week and 6-month follow-up, and Vision Functioning at 6 month follow-up. Measures include the Psychological Well-being Scale (Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995), the Preparation of Future Care Needs Scale (SÃ¶rensen &amp; Pinquart, 2001), and the National Eye Institute Vision Functioning Questionnaire-25 (Stelmack, Stelmack, &amp; Massof, 2002). The primary hypothesis is that PREPSI participants will report greater Psychological Well-being and more Preparation for Future Care immediately post-intervention (at 16 weeks) and at 6-month follow-up. The PREPSI is a short, standardized modification of problem-solving therapy that trains participants to identify and clearly define current and future problems, and then generate, evaluate, choose, and implement solutions. The long-term goal of the investigators research program is to improve quality of life in late adulthood by conducting basic and translational research on preventive future planning.</detailed_description>
