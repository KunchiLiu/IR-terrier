	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of frailty as a multidimensional risk factor on the outcomes of adult cardiac and vascular surgery. For the purpose of defining patient frailty a multimodal questionnaire has been developed including measurement of psychological, socioeconomical, neurological and behavioral aspects. This study also features an investigation of the possible relationship between sudden regional weather changes, individual meteorological susceptibility of the patients and the outcomes of adult cardiac and vascular surgery.</brief_summary>
