	<brief_summary>Aims are: - develop an Internet-based education programme about venous leg ulcer nursing care (ELC) - evaluate the clinical, cognitive and economical outcomes of education programme Research questions are: 1. What are the cognitive outcomes of ELC (perceived knowledge, attitudes towards venous leg ulcer nursing care, theoretical knowledge level and practical knowledge)? Hypotheses for research question 1 are: 1. Nurses using the ELC will have better knowledge (perceived, practical and theoretical knowledge) than those who will not use the ELC. 2. Nurses using the ELC will have more positive attitudes towards venous leg ulcer nursing care than those who will not use the ELC. 2. What are the clinical outcomes of ELC (ulcer healing, ulcer size, treatment supplies)? Hypotheses for research question 2 are: 1. Ulcer healing progresses better among patients who are taken care by nurses using the ELC. 2. Ulcer sizes will be 10 % smaller among the patients cared for nurses using the ELC. 3. Nurses using the ELC will use mire adequate treatment supplies than those who will not use the ELC. 3. What are the economical outcomes (treatment time and supply usage) of ELC? Hypothesis for research question 3 is: 1. The economical expenditures will be lower among nurses using the ELC. The ultimate aim is to promote evidence-based nursing care among patients with venous leg ulcer.</brief_summary>
