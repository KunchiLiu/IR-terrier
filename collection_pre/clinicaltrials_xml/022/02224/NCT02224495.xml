	<brief_summary>Exercise training, as part of cardiac rehabilitation, is effective in improving functional capacity and quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease. Other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular benefits have been reported, namely in glucose metabolism, skeletal muscle function, oxidative stress, vascular function, pulmonary circulation, ischaemia-reperfusion lesion and ventricular remodelling. However, the benefit of exercise training on systolic and diastolic function is controversial especially after acute myocardial infarction where no longitudinal study has evaluated diastolic function using modern echocardiographic parameters. The hypothesis is that a structured program of exercise training can improve systolic and diastolic function in patients after myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
