	<brief_summary>This single ascending dose study is the first evaluation of PF-06650833 in humans. The goals are to assess the safety, tolerability and blood levels of ascending doses of multiple formulations of PF-06650833 and to perform a preliminary assessment of the effect of food on exposure, in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of Single Ascending Doses of Multiple Formulations of PF-06650833 in Healthy Subjects Under Fasted and Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female subjects of non childbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). Screening supine blood pressure 100 mm Hg (systolic) or 50 mm Hg (diastolic); or 140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic) following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If blood pressure (BP) is 140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. Pulse or heart rate (HR) &gt;100 bpm after at least 5 minutes of rest. If the pulse/HR is &gt;100 bpm, the pulse/HR should be repeated two more times (separated by at least 2 minutes) and the average of the three pulse/HR values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.</criteria>
