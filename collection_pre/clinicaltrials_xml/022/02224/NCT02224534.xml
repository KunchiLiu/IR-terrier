	<brief_title>Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel in Left Ventricular Remodeling After ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators designed the HEALING-AMI study to compare the influence of ticagrelor (180 mg loading and 90 mg twice daily maintenance) vs. clopidogrel (600 mg loading and 75 mg daily maintenance) on long-term left ventricular (LV) remodeling measured by 3D echocardiography in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. The primary objective of the HEALING-AMI study is to demonstrate the novel role of long-term ticagrelor therapy in reducing the risk of LV remodeling,. The secondary objectives are to reveal the cross-talk between platelet and inflammatory process in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Moreover, this study will determine whether the high platelet inhibition by ticagrelor culminate the protection of infarcted myocardium.</detailed_description>
