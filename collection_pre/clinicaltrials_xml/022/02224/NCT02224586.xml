	<brief_summary>It is just an observation study. The investigates want to explore the signal changes of resting state functional Magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) after light treatment in jaundice infants. Signal changes contain blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL).Indicator of BOLD is amplitude of low-frequency fluctuationï¼ˆALFF).Indicator of ASL is cerebral blood flow (CBF). The investigates assume that the children with jaundice after light therapy, ALFF and CBF will change. Focus on the globus pallidus and subthalamic nuclei. The two brain regions were proved to be abnormal in MRI T1, T2 structure signal in kernicterus. Doctors observe the status of infants aside.Using monitoring probe can see clearly.</brief_summary>
