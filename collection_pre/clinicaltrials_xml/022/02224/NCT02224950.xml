	<brief_summary>The study will primarily focus on evaluating the benefits of using a lyocell/chitosan/ceramide fabric as a treatment for young children with mild or moderate eczema. More specifically, the study will focus on the upper limb area in these patients and will examine whether wearing a sleeve made from a lyocell/chitosan/ceramide fabric can improve eczema symptoms compared with wearing a cotton sleeve, no sleeve, or the lyocell / chitosan combination. Patients will be evaluated at 3 intervals over a 3-week period using the following four variables: an eczema severity index, amount of itching, bacteria levels in the affected areas of skin, and amount of water loss in the affected areas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be evaluated using the following four variables: an eczema severity index, amount/severity of itching, bacteria levels in the affected areas of skin, and amount of water loss in the affected areas. The eczema severity will be scored using the EASI (upper limb subscale); itch will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale for itch; the skin will be swabbed for bacterial cultures and results are quantified based on microbiology lab standards to be mild, moderate or heavy growth of the bacteria identified; and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) will be measured using a tewameter/capacitive moisture sensor.</detailed_description>
