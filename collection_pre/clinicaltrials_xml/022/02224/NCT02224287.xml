	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized trial to study the effect of assigning the control of the fluoroscopic x-ray activation to the surgeon as compared to the radiation technologist. Radiation exposure will be assessed from the collected data, fluoroscopy time, and dose parameters (cumulative absorbed dose and dose area product). From exposure data, entrance skin dose (ESD) and midline absorbed dose (MLD) will be calculated. The primary outcome in this study will be total fluoroscopy time for the procedure. A secondary outcome will be the ESD. The investigators will further analyze the contribution of clinical predictors (e.g. stone size/location) and procedural predictors on fluoroscopy times and ESD. It is hypothesized that a 30% reduction in fluoroscopy time will occur when the operating surgeon is controlling the activation of the x-ray beam.</brief_summary>
