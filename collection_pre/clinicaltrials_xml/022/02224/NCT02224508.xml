	<brief_summary>Background: Sixty million American adults suffer from moderate to severe chronic pain. Of these, 5 to 8 million currently use opioids long-term. With increased opioid prescribing for chronic pain, an epidemic of prescription opioid addiction and overdose has arisen. This necessitates action to stem opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Group Health (GH), a large nonprofit health plan, developed and implemented opioid risk reduction strategies for doctors and patients in some, but not all, of its clinics. The risk reduction initiative achieved large opioid dose reductions, near universal documentation of care plans, and marked increases in patient monitoring. Rigorous evaluation of patient outcomes resulting from the opioid risk reduction initiative, incorporating patient perspectives, is needed to guide health care improvement efforts to reduce opioid risks regionally and nationally. Research goal: The investigators will evaluate a major health plan initiative to reduce risks of long-term opioid use for chronic pain. Starting in 2008, some GH clinics reduced prescribing of high opioid doses. In 2010 the same clinics increased care planning and monitoring of chronic opioid therapy (COT) patients. Our research goal is to evaluate effects of this initiative on health and safety outcomes of COT patients. We will test whether the initiative influenced pain outcomes; patient-reported opioid benefits and problems; and opioid-related adverse events. Design and Outcomes: The investigators will assess effects of GH's opioid risk reduction initiative among COT patients using opioids long-term. The investigators will compare COT patients from clinics that implemented the initiative with COT patients from care settings that did not implement the initiative. The investigators will use survey data to assess patient-reported outcomes including pain severity, depressive symptoms, and patient perceptions of opioid benefits and problems, including validated measures of prescription opioid use disorder. They will interview and compare 800 COT patients using opioids long-term from clinics that implemented the risk reduction initiative and 800 COT patients from care settings that did not. Impact: This research will provide an urgently needed, rigorous evaluation of a major risk reduction initiative among COT patients. Evaluation results will guide efforts of health plans, clinicians and patients nationwide to ensure safe, effective and compassionate chronic pain care.</brief_summary>
