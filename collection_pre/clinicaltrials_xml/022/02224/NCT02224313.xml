	<brief_title>Effect of Oral Estradiol and Progesterone Therapy on Vaginal Cytokines in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project recruits 10 healthy, premenopausal women (aged 20-40 years-old) with regular menstrual cycle with interval of 24-35 days and duration of 2-7 days and 20 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 45-60 years-old) with an intact uterus and at least 12 months but not more than 36 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Premenopausal women will not receive any study medication(s). Postmenopausal women will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below. - Oral "estradiol" 0.5 mg tablet for 14 days, then oral "estradiol" 0.5 mg tablet and "progesterone" 100 mg capsule for 14 days - Oral "estradiol" 1.0 mg tablet for 14 days, then oral "estradiol" 1.0 mg tablet and "progesterone" 100 mg capsule for 14 days</detailed_description>
