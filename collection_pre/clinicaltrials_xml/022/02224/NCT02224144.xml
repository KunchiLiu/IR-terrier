	<detailed_description>Kidney transplant recipients at highest fracture risk, as determined by epidemiologic studies (Caucasians and older recipients). Rocaltrol (calcitriol) is a synthetic vitamin D analog which is active in the regulation of the absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and its utilization in the body. The study involves a one-year commitment and a total of 6 visits. All visits include answering questionnaires on the following: 1. Historical (including medication adherence and reconciliation, rejection history, fracture history, adverse event monitoring); 2. Dietary: Block Food Frequency Questionnaire; 3. Frailty Assessment: Grip Strength Questionnaire 4. Dietary Calcium Assessment Blood is drawn 3 times over the course of the study on the first, second and last visits. Imaging methods are obtained on the first and last visits. Imaging Methods for Measurement of Bone Mass, Microarchitecture and Mechanical Competence include: 1. DXA: Areal Bone Minderal Density (BMD) of spine (L 1-4, AP), right proximal femur and forearm using Hologic QDR 4500 (Hologic, Inc.,Waltham, MA) in the array (fan beam) mode. 2. HRpQCT: XtremeCT II (Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) 3. Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) by DXA: Visual semi-quantitative identification of vertebral fractures is obtained from images acquired by fan-bean DXA scanners. 4. Body Composition by DXA: Total fat mass, lean mass, and percent fat mass will be measured by DXA. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) will be used to estimate mechanical competence (strength) from HRpQCT images. And HRpQCT Cortical Porosity would lead to analyses of cortical porosity.</detailed_description>
