	<brief_summary>This study is dedicated to achieving a better understanding of how to identify patterns that indicate someone might be at high risk for relapse in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The investigators are utilizing smartphone technology along with on body sensors to achieve this goal. The study will observe participants behavior in their natural environment for a period of 16 weeks or until a signal of relapse is obtained. Participants will also complete scales in a clinical research environment biweekly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction of Relapse in Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Disorder With Smartphones and On-body Sensors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will follow a group of participants who have recently been discharged from the emergency room or the hospital using several new "high-tech" methods, including the use of a smartphone, health and wellness wristbands/watches and an optional arm patch sensor. These devices (some of which are commercially available to the public for purchase), will capture ongoing physiological information including sweat gland activity, movement, skin temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and sleep. The smart phone, and an installed application, will administer bidaily and weekly symptom assessment, track the general location of the participant, and collect statistics about text messaging and cell phone use. In addition to the on-body devices participants will come into the clinical research office to complete clinical scales every other week. These scales will be used to determine symptom exacerbation or relapse. This signature will then be utilized as a marker to examine the data collected from the devices. The investigators hope to go beyond clinical evaluation and identify a signature of relapse that is reliably detected from on body devices in a natural setting. This would cut down on the time it takes to successfully treat psychotic illnesses and would reduce the amount of pain and and suffering experienced by patients during relapse.</detailed_description>
