	<criteria>Subjects with initial presentation of organ confined prostate cancer (clinical stage ≤ T2b) Negative metastatic workup with bone scan and CT abdomen/pelvis, within 6 months of study treatment, if indicated by PSA &gt;10 Age 40 years to 85 years of age Multiparametric MRI at UCLA within 6 months of study treatment, demonstrating a Region of interest (ROI) of MRI suspicion level 3 or higher ROI located proximal to the external sphincter by a margin of at least 2 cm Transrectal ultrasoundguided biopsy with ≥ 10 systematic biopsy cores and ≥ 2 MRIultrasound fusion targeted biopsy cores from above MRIderived ROI Histologicallyconfirmed adenocarcinoma from targeted biopsy cores (≥ 2 cores) Overall Gleason score not to exceed 3+4 Subjects desire focal therapy and declined conventional treatment (active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, cryosurgery and hormone therapy) Signed informed consent for the LITT treatment through the 12 month follow up visit Any significant cancer outside of MRI target (ROI) area, defined as Gleason score &gt; 3+4 &lt; 10 years life expectancy American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) criteria of IV or higher Unfit for conscious sedation anesthesia Active bleeding disorder as determined by abnormal prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, INR or platelet count (as determined by institutional lab parameters) at the time of screening Use of coumadin or any other anticoagulant, unless anticoagulation can be temporarily reversed or stopped for a window of at least 7 days periprocedure Active urinary tract infection Prostate abscess, chronic or acute prostatitis, or neurogenic bladder Any prior treatment for prostate cancer Radical prostatectomy Radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy) Cryotherapy High intensity focused ultrasound treatment Photodynamic therapy Androgen deprivation therapy Prior prostate, bladder neck, or urethral stricture surgery Any prostate debulking procedure, including: transurethral resection of prostate, photovaporization, or electrovaporization Transurethral incision of bladder neck Urethral stricture dilation or reconstruction Any current 5alpha reductase inhibitors (history of use ≥ 6 months prior to MRI is acceptable) Prior significant rectal surgery (hemorrhoidectomy is acceptable) Rectal fissure, fibrosis, stenosis, or other anatomic abnormality precluding insertion of transrectal device History of inflammatory bowel disease Urinary tract or rectal fistula Any contraindication to MRI (contrast allergy severe claustrophobia, MRIincompatible prosthesis)</criteria>
