	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) Turbuhaler is effective in treating asthma when used 'as needed' in patients with milder asthma. The efficacy of Symbicort 'as needed' will be compared with Pulmicort (budesonide) Turbuhaler twice daily plus terbutaline Turbuhaler 'as needed'</brief_summary>
