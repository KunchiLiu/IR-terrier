	<brief_title>Smartphone-Delivered Training for Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will also be performed during your first visit: - You will complete questionnaires about your smoking history and behavior. These will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. - Urine will be collected to check your cotinine and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical that measures the amount of cigarette by-products in your body. Anabasine is a chemical that helps the study staff tell if you are using tobacco or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). - You will have an electroencephalography (EEG) lab session. During the lab session, you will perform a task that is designed to measure your attention and emotions. This will involve looking at groups of pictures of abstract art, words, and screens with different colors as well as pictures with smoking images. During the visit, your brain electrical activity will be measured with an EEG. To do this, a net-like cap will be placed over your scalp. These tasks will take about 60 minutes to complete. Smartphone Use: You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups: - If you are in Group 1, you will receive attentional bias modification (ABM) training through a smartphone. This type of training is designed to help you quit smoking. - If you are in Group 2, you will receive "sham" training. This program looks like ABM training, but is not actually designed to help you. You will not know which type of training you are receiving. After the lab session on Day 1, you will be provided with a smartphone to use while you are on study. You will be trained on how to use the smartphone and smartphone application that will help you prepare to quit smoking. This training will take about 20 minutes to complete. On Days 2-14, you will complete a training program while at home through the smartphone and application provided. Each of the daily training sessions will take about 30 minutes. After the training portion has been completed, you will answer questions about your smoking on a daily basis. These questions will take about 10 minutes to complete each day. Study Visits: During Visit 2 (Day 15): - Your CO level will be measured. - You will complete the questionnaires about your smoking history and smoking behavior. - A urine sample will be collected to check your cotinine and anabasine levels. - You will have another EEG lab session. - You will be given an 8-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy or "the patch" and you will track your patch use in your smoking diary. - You will meet with a counselor for counseling on quitting smoking. This counseling session will last about 30 minutes. - You will return the smartphone. Your smoking "quit date" will be scheduled for the day after your visit 2, although you are free to reduce or quit smoking before this visit if you choose to do so. Your study counselor will contact you every two weeks (Days 29, 43, and 57) for 3 telephone counseling sessions that will last about 15 minutes each. During Visit 3 (Day 72): - Your CO level will be measured. - You will complete the questionnaires about your smoking history and smoking behavior. - A urine sample will be collected to check your cotinine and anabasine levels - You will have another EEG lab session. - You will return unused nicotine patches to the study staff Length of Study: You will be on study for about 10 weeks. Your participation in the study will be over after Visit 3. This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch used in this study is FDA approved and commercially available. Up to 750 participants will be screened, and up to 250 eligible participants will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
