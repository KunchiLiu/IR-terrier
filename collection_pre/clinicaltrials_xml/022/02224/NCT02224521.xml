	<brief_title>GSK2190915A - Bioavailability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that attenuates the production of leukotrienes, through the blockage of the first committed step in the leukotriene pathway, 5 lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. Leukotrienes are potent inflammatory molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophage and neutrophils in response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli. Clinical studies conducted to date with GSK2190915 have utilised an aqueous formulation of the compound. However, to progress the compound further in clinical development, a solid dose formulation is necessary. This study will evaluate the optimal capsule formulation from a selection of three available capsule formulations, and a dose, that can be taken forward for future clinical development. Since it is expected that the compound will be developed for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the study will also include a repeat-dose cohort with elderly subjects (smokers and non-smokers over 65 years of age) in order to evaluate the repeat-dose derived pharmacokinetic parameters of the selected capsule formulation in this population. This is a multi-cohort study and upto 6 cohorts will be performed. In cohort 1, the bioavailability of single doses of 50 milligrammes (50 mg) of three capsule formulations (capsule formulations A, B and C) in the fasted state will be assessed. Depending on the bioavailability data obtained from cohort 1, one, two or three capsule formulations may be taken forward into cohort 2. If only one formulation is deemed to be suitable for progression, cohort 2 will be a single-dose, 4-way complete crossover study to investigate both food-effect and dose proportionality in 10 healthy adult subjects. The decision to progress this formulation to the final (repeat-dose) cohort (cohort 4) will be made based on favourable food interaction and proportionality in bioavailability between high and low doses in cohort 2. If more than one capsule formulation fulfils the bioavailability criteria following cohort 1, cohort 2 will be a food-effect study with a 100mg single dose of two or three selected capsule formulations in healthy adult subjects. Progression to Cohort 3 will be dependent on the formulation/s meeting predetermined pharmacokinetic (PK) criteria. Cohort 3 will be a complete crossover study with single doses of 20mg and 200mg of each of upto two capsule formulations taken forward from cohort 2 in 10 healthy adult subjects in the fasted state. The aim of performing this cohort is to explore the dose proportionality between low and high doses of the two selected capsule formulations. Cohort 4 is a 12-day repeat-dose, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 12 healthy elderly subjects (&gt;65 years) in the fed or fasted state with once-daily dosing of the highest dose (200mg) of the capsule formulation (A, B or C) taken forward from the previous cohorts. The aim of this cohort is to investigate the accumulation of the selected formulation during repeat dosing. Cohort 5 will be a 4-way complete crossover study with single doses of 100mg of two tablet formulations (milled and micronised) administered to healthy volunteers in the fed and fasted states. The aim of performing this cohort is to explore the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the two tablet formulations with a view to assessing their suitability for use in subsequent late- phase studies. Cohort 6 will be a 4-way complete crossover study with single doses of 100mg of two modified tablet formulations (different from Cohort 5 formulations) administered to healthy volunteers in the fed and fasted states. The aim of performing this cohort is to explore the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the two modified tablet formulations with a view to assessing their suitability for use in subsequent late- phase studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORTS 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. A subject will be eligible for inclusion in cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of this study only if all of the following criteria apply: 1. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times Upper Limit of Normal, ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35 percent). 2. Healthy as determined by the Investigator, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and Electrocardiogram (ECG). A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study objectives. 3. Male or female (of non childbearing potential) between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate only if she is of: •Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation (in which case the male partner should use an acceptable form of contraception as specified in section 8.1) or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 million international units, MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 picogrammes per millilitre (less than 140 picomoles per litre) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.] 4. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 5 terminal halflives postlast dose. 5.
