	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two methods that are currently used at the end of a CT guided lung biopsy to close the hole on the surface of the lung in order to minimize the chance of air leaking out of the hole. The two techniques consist of either injecting a very small amount of your the blood called a blood patch into the biopsy hole or injecting a gel-based FDA approved artificial plug called BioSentry that will eventually get absorbed into the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Autologous Blood Patch Injection Versus BioSentry Hydrogel Tract Plug in the Reduction of Pneumothorax Risk Following Lung Biopsy Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will determine the rate of all pneumothoraces and those pneumothoraces requiring treatment following percutaneous lung biopsy in patients who have received ABPI or BioSentry at the end of the biopsy procedure. The data collected will be used to determine if there is equal effectiveness in the reduction of pneumothorax rates from both interventions.</detailed_description>
