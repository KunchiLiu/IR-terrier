	<brief_summary>The general aim of the current study was to investigate the safety and tolerability, and pharmacodynamics (endotoxin-induced inflammatory response of a single intravenous bolus administration of 2 ng/kg body weight Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) of BI 653048 BS H3PO4 capsules in healthy male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses of 25 mg to 200 mg over three days compared to the active comparator prednisolone and placebo. Pharmacodynamics were assessed by investigating the influence of LPS administration on inflammatory parameters. More specifically, it was evaluated whether and to what extent the symptoms induced by LPS challenge can be attenuated by ascending BI 653048 BS H3PO4 doses using prednisolone as positive control and placebo as negative control. A secondary objective was the exploration of pharmacokinetics of BI 653048 BS, the investigation of other pharmacodynamic parameters (biomarker) and of the tolerability of LPS.</brief_summary>
