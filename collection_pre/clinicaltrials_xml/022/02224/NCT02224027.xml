	<brief_title>Comparison of Laryngeal Mask and I-gel to Laryngoscope by Novice Operators in Simulated Difficult Airway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compares the insertion success rate and insertion time among the proceal laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, and tracheal tube. Following a short lecture, airway novices try to insert proceal laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, and tracheal tube into manikin with difficult laryngoscopy scenarios.</detailed_description>
