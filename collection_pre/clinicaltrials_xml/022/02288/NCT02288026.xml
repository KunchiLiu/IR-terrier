	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare early-stage peripheral non-small cell lung cancer lobectomy and sub-lobectomy surgery to evaluate if sub-lobectomy is as feasible and effective for the treatment of early-stage (diameter ≤2cm) peripheral non-small cell lung cancer as lobectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives:To establish a database of patients with early lung cancer surgery,and evaluate if sub-lobectomy surgery is as feasible and effective as lobectomy surgery in patients with early-stage peripheral non-small cell lung cancer,by assessing the retainability of lung function.and improvement of quality of life in those patients. Outline:This is a prospective, matched, controlled, open, multi-center clinical study. Select the early-stage peripheral NSCLC 630 patients (diameter≤2cm), according to age and lesion type (GGO component ratio) two matching factor of 1: 2 assigned to sub-lobectomy group and lobectomy group.Patients are followed up every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for the other 4 years.</detailed_description>
