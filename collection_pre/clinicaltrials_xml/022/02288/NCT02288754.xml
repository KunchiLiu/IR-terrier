	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to employ genomic detection methodologies to measure the relative amount of tumor nucleic acids in the blood of a cancer patient with diagnosed metastatic disease that is either commencing, currently undergoing or completed cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. More generally, this approach will allow us to develop a quantitative measure of therapy efficacy via the counting of the relative changes in tumor molecules over the course of treatment.</brief_summary>
