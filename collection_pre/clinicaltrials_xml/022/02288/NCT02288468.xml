	<detailed_description>Tremor is the most salient symptom of Parkinson's disease (IPS=idiopathic Parkinson syndrome). Other symptoms are bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. As much as 75% of patients with IPS show resting tremor. Initially, tremor is typically unilateral and only visible in stress situation. In the later stage of the disease it becomes bilateral. The OPINION trial aims at the investigation of a combined approach to thalamic/subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of patients with tremor dominant IPS or patients with equivalent type IPS who perceive tremor to be their dominant symptom. The planned approach will for the first time allow for the direct comparison of each condition in a homogeneous patient population and will furthermore allow an intra-individual comparison of the different stimulation conditions (Ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim/DRT) - Subthalamic nucleus (STN) - Vim/DRT+STN) with the outcome parameter "quality of life". Patients will be registered to the trial and will undergo screening procedures (for eligibility criteria please see Inclusion and Exclusion criteria). If the patient is eligible the Investigational Medical Device (IMD) will be implanted (which is the Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation System manufactured by Boston Scientific). After implantation the IMD will remain OFF for a period of 1 month. 1 month after implantation treatment will be started. Patients will be randomized to one of the following 3 treatment groups: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) or Ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim/DRT) or combined stimulation (Vim/DRT+STN). Patients will undergo all three treatment groups each lasting 3 months. The patient is blinded meaning that study patients will not know what kind of treatment (e.g. mode/region of stimulation) they receive. 10 months after implantation the final visit (end of study visit) will be performed. After end of the trial, further treatment will be performed at the Department of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery in Freiburg (Germany) according to established guidelines. Devices will be monitored 3-6 monthly Patient's medications will be adjusted as to the level of best treatment adjunct to stimulation. Study endpoints (e.g. quality of life) will be evaluated by a blinded rater. In addition, an external video rating will be performed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 35 and ≤ 75 years with a life expectancy of at least 5 years 2. Patients with Parkinson's disease according to the criteria of the British Brain Bank as diagnosed by an in movement disorder specialized neurologist 3. Parkinson patients are included with a medical treatment resistant and disabling resting and/or postural tremor as their major complaint and with a less prominent or absent hypokineticrigid component of their disease. 4. Absence of postural instability (which would be aggravated under STN DBS) 5. Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage 13. After stadium 3 patients will show increased incidence of falling that can be aggravated by (typical) STN DBS 6. Disease duration for at least 2 years and routine DATscan shows clear indication for Parkinsonism and atypical Parkinson syndromes are ruled out by routine glucose (FDG) PET 7. PDQ39 to be completed within 42 days prior surgery 8. Written informed consent 1. Major Depression with suicidal thoughts 2. Dementia (Mattis Dementia Rating Score ≤ 130) 3. Patients with lifetime primary psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder 4. Patients with acute psychosis as diagnosed by a psychiatrist 5. Nursing care at home 6. Unable to give written informed consent 7. Surgical contraindications like deformed or displaced or not discernable target region, scarring after brain disease (infarction), need for continuous anticoagulation that cannot be bridged in order to obtain normal coagulation 8. Patients with advanced stage cardiovascular disease 9. Patients under immunosuppressive or chemotherapy because of malignant disease 10. Patients who had previous intracranial surgery 11. Patients who are already under DBS therapy 12. Patients with aneurysm clips 13. Patients with cochlear implants 14. Simultaneous participation or previous participation within 30 days prior to start of screening in a clinical trial involving investigational medicinal product(s) or investigational medical device(s) 15. Medications that are likely to cause interactions in the opinion of the investigator 16. Known or persistent abuse of medication, drugs or alcohol 17. Persons who are in a relationship of dependence/employment with the sponsor or the investigator 18. Fertile women not using adequate contraceptive methods: female condoms, diaphragm or coil, each used in combination with spermicides; intrauterine device; hormonal contraception in combination with a mechanical method of contraception; 19. Current or planned pregnancy, nursing period 20. Contraindications according to device instructions or Investigator's Brochure: Diathermy: Shortwave, microwave, and/or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy. The energy generated by diathermy can be transferred to the Vercise™ DBS System, causing tissue damage at the contact site resulting in severe patient injury or death. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Patients implanted with the Vercise™ DBS System should not be subjected to MRI. Patient incapability: Patients who are unable to properly operate the Remote Control and Charging System should not be implanted with the Vercise™ DBS System. Poor surgical risks: The Vercise™ DBS System is not recommended for patients who because of their primary disease or additional comorbidities are not likely to benefit from the DBS system implantation.</criteria>
