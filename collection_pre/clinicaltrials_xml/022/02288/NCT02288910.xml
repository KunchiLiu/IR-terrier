	<brief_summary>This project investigates the feasibility of assessing the relative blood volume of carcinomas in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastases from pancreatic or colorectal cancer compared to normal liver from DynaCT acquisitions on an interventional platform.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Volume Assessment of Hepatocellular and Metastatic Carcinomas in the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will enroll patients with non-diffuse liver disease who are candidates for chemo or radioembolization to treat or manage the disease during an image guided intervention. Subjects will undergo a CT perfusion study of the liver prior to the radioembolizaiton mapping procedure or prior to the chemoembolization treatment. During the radioembolization mapping or chemoembolization procedure, 2 DynaCT acquisitions on the interventional C-arm will be acquired (the second during an injection of an iodinated contrast material) and will be processed using Siemens' PBV software to generate blood volume maps. The diagnostic accuracy of the two approaches to assess the vascularity of the tumors will be assessed.</detailed_description>
