	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham injection-controlled study will investigate the exposure-response and safety of lampalizumab administered intravitreally every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 24 weeks in participants with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks. The target sample size is approximately 90 participants.</brief_summary>
