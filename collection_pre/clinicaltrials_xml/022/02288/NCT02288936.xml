	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin tumor diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in Western countries. Between 10-20% of patients are diagnosed at metastatic stage and about half of those diagnosed in early stages will develop metastases. After the clinical benefit of mitoxantrone and the improved survival of 2-3 months provided by docetaxel in first line, the second search is driven to look for effective second lines treatments. In recent years, there are new drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer, revolutionizing the therapeutic sequence and survival. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy, treatment of choice, induces an improvement of symptoms in approximately 70-80% of patients, but it is limited by the development of mechanisms of resistance to androgen deficiency. Docetaxel was the first chemotherapy drug to increase survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The second cytotoxic drug approved in the second line treatment of metastatic CRPC has been cabazitaxel. Enzalutamide improves survival in patients with metastatic CRPC who had progressed to chemotherapy and also in patients who had not received chemotherapy. To date, there are no biomarkers available that allow us to identify which patients from a clinical or molecular view are those that will be able to benefit from the treatment options currently available. The presence of the TMPRSS2-ETS rearrangement has been shown to correlate with efficacy in clinical practice abiraterone. There is scientific and preclinical background that makes one suspect that the molecular alteration may influence the same way enzalutamide antiandrogen activity, but it has not been determined to date. The objective of this study is to determine whether the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide, when administered to patients with castration resistant prostate cancer prior to administration of docetaxel is influenced by the presence or absence of the fusion gene TMPRSS2- ETS.</brief_summary>

Patients who have received an antiandrogen must present disease progression (&gt;=4 weeks since the last dose of flutamide or &gt;=6 weeks since the last dose of bicalutamide or nilutamide). PSA value in screening visit must be &gt;=2 μg/L (2 ng/mL). Soft tissue progression defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria Bone lesion progression defined by PCWG2 criteria, with two or more new lesions in a scintigraphy Metastatic disease with bone lesions detected by scintigraphy, or measurable soft tissue lesions by CT/MR. Patients with ganglionar disease will be suitable if they have at least one ganglionar lesion with smallest diameter &gt; 2,5 cm.
