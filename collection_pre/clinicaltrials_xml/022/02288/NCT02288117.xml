	<brief_summary>The objective of this PMCF is to collect clinical and radiographic outcome information on Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) performed with LINK® SP-CL® Hip Prosthesis Stem under routine conditions. The results collected will be used to clinically confirm the performance and safety of the LINK® SP-CL® Hip Prosthesis Stem in terms of the manufacturer's obligation to perform a PMCF. Furthermore the results can be used for future regulatory processes if needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Clinical 5-year Follow-up of the LINK® SP-CL® Hip Prosthesis Stem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post Market Clinical Follow-ups (PMCF) through observational studies are an important tool to detect infrequent complications or problems, events specific to defined patient populations and long term performance issues under routine conditions [2,3]. Against this background a prospective multi-center outcome study of the LINK® SP-CL® is planned.</detailed_description>
