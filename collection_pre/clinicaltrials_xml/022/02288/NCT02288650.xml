	<brief_summary>At the child, the post-operative vomitings (POV) remain the main post-operative complication in term of frequency. They also represent the first cause of unforeseen hospitalization in day case surgery. The causes of POV are multiple, including in particular the post-operative prescription of opioids. The role of the premature refeeding remains discussed. Up to the age of 4 years, acute pain is difficult to distinguish from other causes of distress (anxiety, anger but also hunger) being able to make prescribe wrongly opioids in post-operative. The main objective of this study is to estimate the POV in pediatric day case surgery after early refeeding with clear liquids in the recovery room or only in the day case wards (usual practice). The secondary objectives are to estimate the time on returning to the day case ward, at home, the post-operative opioid consumption, early refeeding adverse effects (desaturation, swallowing trouble)</brief_summary>
