	<brief_summary>Patients 60 to 70 years of age with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were prospectively randomized between 4 cycles of anthracycline/dexamethasone-based induction chemotherapy (A1) or only 2 x 4 days of dexamethasone (A2). A reference arm included patients who could not be randomized (B). Tandem melphalan 140 mg/m² (MEL140) with autologous transplantation was scheduled for all patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tandem Melphalan and Autolog. SCT in MM Patients 60 to 70 Years of Age With and Without Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In arm A1, patients received 4 cycles of conventional induction therapy with anthracycline/dexamethasone-based regimens. Specified in the protocol were vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (VAD), idarubicin/dexamethasone (ID) and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (CAD). In arm A2, patients were planned to receive only dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1-4 and 8-11 for symptom control before stem cell mobilization. For the patients in arm B, a maximum of 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy was allowed. Following this, the treatment was identical for all patients. For stem cell mobilization, an age-adjusted IEV-regimen with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was recommended. The target dose for stem cell collection was 6 x 10E+6 CD34 (cluster of differentiation 34)-positive cells/kg (2 transplants and one back-up). The standard dose for each transplantation was 2 x 10E+6 CD34-positive cells/kg. High-dose melphalan at a total dose of 140 mg/m² (MEL140) was given in two doses of 70 mg/m² on days -3 and -2. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) was performed on day 0. A second MEL140 course was planned two months after the first. Regular bisphosphonate treatment was recommended.</detailed_description>
