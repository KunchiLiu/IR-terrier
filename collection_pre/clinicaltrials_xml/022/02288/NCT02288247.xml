	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to understand if there is benefit in continued treatment with a medicine called enzalutamide, when starting treatment with docetaxel and prednisolone (a standard chemotherapy for prostate cancer), after the prostate cancer has gotten worse when treated with enzalutamide alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Benefit of Treatment Beyond Progression With Enzalutamide in Men Who Are Starting Treatment With Docetaxel After Worsening of Their Prostate Cancer When Taking Enzalutamide Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in consecutive periods of open label treatment with enzalutamide followed by randomized double-blind treatment with continued enzalutamide or placebo, in combination with docetaxel and prednisolone. Open Label (Period 1) At Week 13, all subjects will be assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and imaging. Subjects with no confirmed PSA response or evidence of radiographic progression will be ineligible for participation in Period 2 and will typically have safety follow up; however, Period 1 treatment may continue for some subjects as long as the investigator considers it to be of clinical benefit (stopping on initiation of any new antineoplastic therapy). Subjects with confirmed PSA response will continue Period 1 until disease progression. Randomization (Period 2) 274 subjects with confirmed disease progression on enzalutamide alone who continue to meet all eligibility criteria may proceed to randomization. Treatment allocation will be in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by disease progression in Period 1 to the following treatments: - Enzalutamide with docetaxel and prednisolone - Placebo with docetaxel and prednisolone</detailed_description>
