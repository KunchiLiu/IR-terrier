	<brief_summary>This is an international multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of single-agent intralesional PV-10 versus systemic chemotherapy or intralesional oncolytic viral therapy to assess treatment of locally advanced cutaneous melanoma in patients who (1) have failed or are not otherwise candidates for targeted therapy and (2) have failed or are not otherwise candidates for at least one immune checkpoint inhibitor. Subjects in the comparator arm will receive the Investigator's choice of dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide (TMZ) or intralesional talimogene laherparepvec as determined by Investigator preference and standard of care in the Investigator's country or region. Effectiveness will be assessed by comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) between all intent-to-treat (ITT) subjects in the two study treatment arms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PV-10 vs Chemotherapy or Oncolytic Viral Therapy for Treatment of Locally Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized using a 2:1 treatment allocation (i.e. two-thirds of the subjects will receive PV-10). Subjects in the comparator arm who have completed at least 1 cycle of study treatment and who meet the study protocol definition of disease progression but do not have evidence of visceral metastases will be eligible to enter the crossover portion of the study and receive PV-10. Subjects crossing over must meet all study inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical laboratories, thyroid function, concurrent or intercurrent illness and pregnancy at the time of crossover. Assessment of progression will be performed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) ver. 1.1 criteria. Events signaling progression include increase in size and/or number of lesions, distant or nodal disease progression, or death. All secondary endpoints involving disease response and progression will be based on the IRC determination. An interim assessment of efficacy and safety will be performed by the IRC when 50% of the events required for the primary endpoint have occurred.</detailed_description>

Thyroid function abnormality ≤ Grade 2 12. Candidate for at least one comparator drug: Subjects must be candidates for at least one of the designated comparator drugs 1. Presence or history of visceral melanoma metastasis 2. Presence of active nodal metastases (e.g., radiologic or clinical evidence of current nodal disease) 3. Presence of more than 50 melanoma lesions 4. Radiation therapy to any Study Lesion within 6 weeks of initial study treatment. 5. Chemotherapy or other systemic cancer therapy within 4 weeks of initial study treatment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin), or regional chemotherapy (limb infusion or perfusion) within 12 weeks of initial study treatment 6. Immunotherapy for cancer within 4 weeks of initial study treatment 7. Local treatment (e.g., surgery, cryotherapy, laser ablation) to any Study Lesion within 4 weeks of initial study treatment 8. Antitumor vaccine therapy within 6 weeks of initial study treatment. 9. Investigational agents within 4 weeks of initial study treatment. 10. Concurrent or Intercurrent Illness: Impaired wound healing or other extremity complications due to diabetes mellitus in subjects whose Study Lesions are located in an extremity Severe peripheral vascular disease in subjects whose Study Lesions are located in an extremity Significant concurrent or intercurrent illness, psychiatric disorders, or alcohol or chemical dependence that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, compromise the subject's safety or compliance or interfere with interpretation of study results. Uncontrolled thyroid disease or cystic fibrosis Clinically significant acute or unstable cardiovascular, cerebrovascular (stroke), renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, immunological, endocrine, or central nervous system disorders 11. Pregnancy: Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating Female subjects who have positive serum pregnancy test taken within 14 days of study treatment Female subjects of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception (e.g., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, double barrier methods such as condoms and diaphragms, abstinence or equivalent measures) 12.
