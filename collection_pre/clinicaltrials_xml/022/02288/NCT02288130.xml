	<brief_summary>Rationale: Laparoscopic myomectomy is increasingly performed over laparotomic myomectomy, because of the many benefits for the patient in terms of pain, hospital stay and recovery. In order to increase the success rate of a laparoscopic procedure pre-treatment to decrease the volume might be beneficial. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are used for this purpose with good results in terms of volume reduction, but sometimes resulting in loss of distinction of the right surgical planes. Ulipristal is a new pre-operative treatment option for symptomatic fibroids, which has demonstrated good results in terms of volume reduction. The effect on cleavage planes is unknown. This study is performed to evaluate if Ulipristal is as effective as GnRHa in terms of surgical outcome. Objective: to investigate if Ulipristal is non-inferior to GnRH in terms of intra-operative blood-loss (primary outcome), surgical time, surgical ease, complications, quality of life and costs. Study design: Double blind randomized controlled multi-center trial. Study population: Premenopausal women in whom a maximum of 2 symptomatic intramural fibroids between 5 and 12 cm in diameter will be removed. Fibroid types 3, 4, 5, 6 and 2-5 will be included. Intervention: Three months of Ulipristal 5 mg once daily combined with a single saline injection at the onset of pretreatment (produced as placebo of Leuproreline) or (comparison) 11.25 mg Leuproreline injections at the onset of pretreatment with placebo tablets (once daily) . Methods: Within 1 month after pre-treatment patients will undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy by experienced surgeons. Operative characteristics will be recorded prospectively. Follow up will be 6 months after surgery mainly for quality of life assessment. A cost utility analysis will be conducted alongside the trial. Main study parameters/endpoints: Ulipristal is non-inferior to GnRHa in terms of blood loss during surgery when the average difference between the two groups is below 150 ml (standard deviation 250 ml). Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Both Ulipristal and GnRHa have been registered for this indication. Safety has been tested and no specific risks apply.</brief_summary>
