	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Lanreotide as Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Non-Resectable Duodeno-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (REMINET)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a European, prospective, multicentre, double-blind randomised study evaluating lanreotide (120 mg every 28 days until disease progression) versus placebo in patients with metastatic/locally advanced, non-resectable, duodeno-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Depending on the phase II results, the study may be continued into phase III. The treatment and follow-up of patients will be the same in phase II and phase III. After the first-line treatment, patients will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to receive either lanreotide or placebo. The study treatment should be initiated within 6 weeks following the confirmation date of stable disease or objective response. Treatment period: For each patient, the investigational products (lanreotide or placebo) will be provided according to a double-blind procedure until disease progression or toxicity, in accordance with the protocol. The estimated average treatment duration for all patients is 12 months. Follow-up period: To evaluate overall survival, patients in phase II will have a minimum follow-up period of 12 months; if the study continues to phase III, these patients will have a maximum follow-up period of 10 years. Phase III patients will have a minimum follow-up period of 5 years.</detailed_description>
