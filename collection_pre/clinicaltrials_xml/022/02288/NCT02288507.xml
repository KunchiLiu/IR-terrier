	<brief_title>Sorafenib Concurrent With Yttrium-90 Transarterial Radioembolization in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies in Asia of unresectable hepatocellular cancer (HCC) demonstrated that sorafenib could be administered safely at 400mg BID when initiated 14 days following radioembolization (RE). However, the ideal sequence of RE and sorafenib may not be completely elucidated, the two treatments given concurrently may be more effective than the sequential approach studied in the Asian trials. Preclinical models have demonstrated that sorafenib acts synergistically with radiation, increasing apoptosis. Furthermore, case reports suggest profound responses in patients who have received sorafenib concurrent with TARE as evidenced by improvement in symptoms, &gt;80% decrease in alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and conversion from unresectable to resectable. Sorafenib concurrent with TARE may take advantage of the synergistic relationship between the two therapies and prove to be a more effective treatment strategy than sequential administration of TARE and sorafenib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC or clinical diagnosis by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria in cirrhotic subjects is required. m) Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B or C. Segmental and subsegmental portal vein thrombosis is allowed. Metastatic disease is allowed if investigator feels liver directed therapy could offer palliative benefit (i.e., minimal extrahepatic tumor burden) No evidence of cirrhosis or cirrhosis grade of ChildPugh class A or B7. Eligibility Have at least one tumor lesion that can be accurately measured according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST v1.1). Consultation with interventional radiologist and deemed an appropriate candidate for TARE. Prior local therapy, such as surgery, hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection or cryoablation is allowed if the index lesion(s) remains outside of the treatment field or has progressed since prior treatment. Local therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline scan. Prior 90Y TARE or sorafenib not allowed Patient must be informed of the investigational nature of this study, sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Age ≥ 18 years. ECOG performance status ≤ 1. Have adequate hematologic function as documented by ANC ≥ 1000/ul, platelet count ≥ 60,000/ul, and hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 mg/dl obtained within 28 days prior to registration. Have adequate hepatic function, as determined by the following tests measured within 28 days prior to registration: serum bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN); SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) ≤ 5 x the IULN. Have adequate renal function, as determined by the following tests measured within 28 days prior to registration: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR a measured creatinine clearance or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. Have a life expectancy of ≥12 weeks Must be able to swallow oral medications. Negative pregnancy test done ≤7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only. Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to sorafenib. Any malabsorption condition. Must not have known brain metastases. No concurrent anticancer chemotherapy or local therapy. No concurrent herbal or unconventional therapy (e.g., St. John's Wort) Pregnant or nursing women No prior radiation therapy to the liver Inability to perform y90 TARE due to: (1) inability to catheterize the hepatic artery, (2) portal vein thrombosis/occlusion without the ability to perform selective infusion, (3) Tc99m MAA hepatic artery perfusion scintigraphy shows unfavorable shunt fraction between the liver and the pulmonary parenchyma as determined by the interventional radiologist, or (4) other contraindication to TARE identified by interventional radiologist. Women/men of reproductive potential unwilling or unable to use an effective contraceptive method No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 3 years. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or symptomatic conduction abnormality within 6 months. Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., active systemic infection, diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the ability of the patient to complete the study.</criteria>
