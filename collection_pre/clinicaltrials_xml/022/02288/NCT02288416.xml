	<brief_summary>This pilot trial studies a video-based intervention in reducing anxiety in patients undergoing lung cancer screening. Giving a video-based intervention to patients prior to lung cancer screening may reduce anxiety and improve the well-being and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Video-Based Intervention in Reducing Anxiety in Patients Undergoing Lung Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test the feasibility and acceptability of the video-based intervention. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe incidence, degree, and duration of screen-related anxiety among individuals scheduled to undergo low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan (LDCT) for lung cancer screening (LCS). II. To describe baseline patient characteristics and pre-screening anxiety levels. III. To describe the preliminary outcomes on screen-related anxiety for patients both not in the intervention group and those in the intervention group. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive standard of care following LCS consisting of routine visits and telephone contact with the LCS program nurse practitioner and coordinator. GROUP II: Patients undergo a video-based intervention prior to undergoing LCS. Patients watch a 5-minute video that focuses on preparing patients for LCS by providing information on the following: program team and contact information; reason to be screened; screening eligibility; how screening is performed; what to expect on the day of screening; what to expect after screening; what to expect if result is positive; what to expect if result is negative; and risks of screening. Patients also receive an educational handbook. Patients with positive scans (a Lung-Imaging Reporting and Data Systems [RADS] 3 or 4) receive additional brochure and nursing support within 1 week after notification of scan results. After completion of LCS, patients are followed up at 1 week and then at 3 and 7 months.</detailed_description>
