	<brief_title>Long-Term Effect of LIAM on Respiratory Performance in NIV Patients Suffering From Neuromuscular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In advanced neuromuscular disorders, respiratory complications represent the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Beside chronic respiratory insufficiency, necessitating a ventilatory support, mostly performed by non-invasive ventilation (NIV), cough is impaired due to the muscle weakness, and respiratory physiotherapy becomes an essential part of the management. Various techniques have been proposed to improve lung recruitment and cough in neuromuscular patients. The assisted techniques based on a positive pressure insufflation maneuver have shown an improvement in physiological variables on the short term, but there is to date no good-quality prospective study allowing to evaluate the long term efficacy of mechanical cough assistance devices in neuromuscular patients. We designed a randomized, cross over, open label study to assess the long-term effect of LIAM (Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver) on respiratory performance in NIV patients suffering from neuromuscular disease.</detailed_description>
