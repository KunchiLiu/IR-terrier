	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate small intestinal remodeling and reprogramming of glucose metabolism in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Our specific goal is to determine if the gene and protein expression levels of GLUT-1 are up regulated in the Roux limb and whether this is a major mechanism for the remission of T2DM following RYGB. The two aims of the study are: 1) to demonstrate that the basement membrane glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) is upregulated in the Roux limb following RYGB, and 2) to demonstrate that the upregulation of GLUT-1 is a major mechanism for the improvement in glycemic control observed in T2DM patients undergoing RYGB.</brief_summary>
