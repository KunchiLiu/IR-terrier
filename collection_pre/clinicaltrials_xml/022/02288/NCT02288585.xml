	<brief_summary>Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with two intervention arms. The study will be conducted in 150 subjects and the primary objective is to show a fasting LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effect of plant sterols in subjects with established type 2 diabetes mellitus and subjects at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Plant Sterols on the Blood Lipid Profile of Subjects With and at High Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of plant sterols on fasting triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. This study also aims to study the effect of plant sterols on fasting total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol concentrations and Lipoprotein (a). Furthermore the effects of plant sterols on fasting blood glucose and insulin will be explored. At last, in a sub-group, at end of intervention the acute, chronic and acute upon chronic effect of plant sterols on postprandial blood lipids, glucose and insulin responses during a mixed meal challenge rich in fat and carbohydrates will be explored.</detailed_description>
