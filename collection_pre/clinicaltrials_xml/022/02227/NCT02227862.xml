History of hypersensitivity to any of the active or inactive ingredients of the insulin/insulin analogue preparations used in the trial, OR history of significant allergic drug reactions. History of use of animal insulin within the last 3 years or use of biosimilar insulin glargine at any time prior. History of use of a regular immunomodulator therapy in the 1 year prior to screening. History of ≥2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia within the 6 months before screening or history of hypoglycemia unawareness (a sample questionnaire is provided in Appendix I), as judged by the investigator. History of ≥1 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or emergency room visits for uncontrolled diabetes leading to hospitalization within the 6 months prior to screening. Serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HbSAg) or hepatitis C (HCVAb) antibodies at screening.
