	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy used in the treatment of primitive tumors of the central nervous system has a particularly important platelet toxicity compared to chemotherapy used for treatment of other tumors. Chemotherapy postponed for toxicity is often due to thrombocytopenia (TP). The TP and/or the other anomalies of coagulation, which can be spontaneous (Rogers, 2004) or induced (Gerber, 2006) can have dramatic consequences: - specifically neurological (intratumoral bleeding with particularly important neovascularization) with a functional aggravation and sometimes involvement of vital prognosis, - digestive (Garcia-Rodiguez, 2001) in patients receiving long term treatment with corticoids (potential gastric toxicity). The encouraging results from the EORTC/NCIC trial by Stupp (median survival among patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is 14.6 months with an estimated 5-year survival of 9, 8%), has changed the standard of care of these patients (Stupp et al., 2009). Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma receive radiotherapy (2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) plus continuous daily Temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant Temozolomide (TMZ) (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The Stupp regimen is currently the treatment of reference for glioblastoma and is used as a basis in various clinical studies with new agents. This study aims to evaluate Romiplostim for the treatment of TP secondary to initial TMZ chemotherapy of glioblastomas.</brief_summary>
