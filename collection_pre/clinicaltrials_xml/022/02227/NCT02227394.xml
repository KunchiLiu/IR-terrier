	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, double dummy two-period crossover study in stable asthma patients treated in accordance with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, will be included. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the products under investigation on Functional respiratory imaging parameters and evaluate the particle deposition with Computational fluid dynamics (CFD).The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the effect of Z7200 and Symbicort® on lung function (spirometry and body plethysmography), on exercise capacity (6MWT)and on dyspnea (Borg CR10 Scale and VAS dyspnea). Furthermore the safety of the 2 products under investigation will be evaluated through monitoring of adverse events throughout the study.</brief_summary>
