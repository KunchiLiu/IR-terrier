	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the ease of use of the U300 pen injector in pen-naïve and insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in a 4-week once-daily dosing regimen with HOE901-U300. Secondary Objectives: To assess in a 4-week once-daily dosing regimen with HOE901-U300 in pen-naïve and insulin-naïve T2DM patients. The safety and usability of the U300 pen injector. The glycemic control with the U300 pen injector. The safety of HOE901-U300.</brief_summary>

Patients receiving only noninsulin antihyperglycemic drugs not approved for combination with insulin according to local labeling/local treatment guidelines and/or sulfonylurea or glinides. Current or previous insulin use except for a maximum of 8 consecutive days and a total of 14 days (eg, acute illness, surgery) during the last year prior to screening. Any contraindication to insulin glargine (Lantus) according to the National Product labeling or any excipients. Any contraindication to the mandatory background noninsulin antihyperglycemic medication according to the respective National Product labeling.
