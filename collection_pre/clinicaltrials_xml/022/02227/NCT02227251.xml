	<brief_title>Study of Selinexor (KPT-330) in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (SADAL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized two-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2b study of the SINE compound, selinexor. High and low doses are given orally to patients with relapsed/refractory de novo DLBCL who have no therapeutic options of demonstrated clinical benefit. Two hundred patients (100 per arm) with relapsed/refractory de novo DLBCL who meet eligibility criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive selinexor until either disease progression or intolerance has occurred. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio of high (100 mg) to low (60 mg) selinexor doses. Enrolled patients will take a fixed milligram dose of selinexor orally twice weekly. Patients will be followed until disease progression and/or death.</detailed_description>
