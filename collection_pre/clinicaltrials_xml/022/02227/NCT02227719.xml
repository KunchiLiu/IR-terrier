	<brief_summary>A single center, randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study is planned to investigate clinical outcomes of horizontal ridge augmentation with simultaneous single implant placement, using the newly designed Ti-membrane. Twenty-four adult subjects who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. They will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups: the customized titanium membrane (Cti-mem) or the collagen membrane (CM) group as a control. The decision of which material to use will be made after an implant is placed. Primary closure of the surgical site will be attempted for 4 months (+/- 1 month), after which the implants will be surgically uncovered and restored. Outcome analyses will be performed until 1-year after the crown will be placed, or 18 months (- 1 or +4 months) from the implant surgery. Clinical and radiographic parameters will be compared between the two experimental groups. The primary outcome is linear increase of horizontal ridge width from direct measurements.</brief_summary>
