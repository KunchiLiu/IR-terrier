	<brief_summary>The purpose of Phase 1b of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PDn) and assess the safety, tolerability and activity of oprozomib in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of Phase 2 of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of oprozomib in combination with sorafenib versus sorafenib alone and to compare the key outcome measures for subjects with advanced HCC.</brief_summary>
