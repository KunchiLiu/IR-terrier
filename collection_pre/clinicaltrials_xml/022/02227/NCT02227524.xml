	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will examine a sample of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) to determine whether their walking function and ability is different depending on which walking assistive device is used. In addition, the investigators will examine the psychosocial impact and amount of fatigue induced by each assistive device. Data collection will consist of a series of assessments via survey and physical performance. The analyses will consist of appropriate comparisons of means to determine if the use of different assistive devices alters any of the outcomes.</detailed_description>
