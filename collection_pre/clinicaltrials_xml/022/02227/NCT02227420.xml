	<brief_summary>In obese individuals cortisol production and secretion is increased but the underlying mechanism is not known. Obesity leads to a pathological activation of the innate immune system partly driven by tissue production of IL-1β. Furthermore, IL-1β is also known to stimulate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). Therefore, the investigators hypothesise that in obese individuals tissue inflammation stimulates ACTH via IL-1β, thereby explaining the observed hypercortisolism.</brief_summary>
