	<brief_summary>This study is being implemented to identify the role of prophylactic use of ethanol lock in adult patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Central catheter related blood stream infection is a major complication in patients on HPN. The investigators hypothesize that the prophylactic use of ELT will decrease the number of catheter related blood stream infections compared to the control group. The investigators further hypothesize that with the introduction of prophylactic ELT, the number of infections will decrease. This will improve the quality of life (assessed using Questionnaire) in HPN patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Ethanol Lock Therapy (ELT) in Patients on Home Parenteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a serious complication for home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients causing morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. CRBSIs may also result in the need for central venous catheter (CVC) removal and replacement. Current literature supports the use of antibiotics locks in patients with repeated CRBSI. There is a growing concern about the increased risk of microbial resistance with the long term use antibiotic locks. Ethanol lock therapy (ELT) has broad spectrum coverage and includes gram negative bacteria, gram positive bacteria, atypical bacteria, and fungi. Compared with antibiotic and other solution locks, which have limitations, ELT has excellent broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal killing action and poses no problems with development of resistance over time. There is a lack of a randomized controlled study to characterize the role of ELT in adult patients on HPN.</detailed_description>
