	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this preliminary study is to investigate whether the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves the cognitive function in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of tDCS for Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS over the left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Patients or their legally responsible caregivers were provided with mobile tDCS device, and were instructed to use it at home. 30-minute session of the stimulation were applied everyday in the morning for 12 weeks.
