	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Pyridostigmine on Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the second neuromuscular disease meet in children. SMA is a genetically transmitted disease inducing muscular weakness predominating on shoulders and hips. Currently, there is no effective therapy to slow the progression of the disease. SMA is due to a neuron motor attempt of the spinal cord and recently it has been demonstrated a neuromuscular junction (NMJ) involvement, according to recent studies. EMOTAS study aim to understand if NMJ abnormalities could have an impact on motor performance and fatigue in SMA type 3 ambulatory patients by electromyogram and to improve by non-invasive therapy quality of life of patients.</detailed_description>
