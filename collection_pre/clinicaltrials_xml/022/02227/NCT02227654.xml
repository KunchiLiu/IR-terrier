	<brief_summary>The present investigation will prospectively evaluate whether serial transvaginal ultrasonography with Morphology Index (MI) can further reduce false positive results by more accurately distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors. If there is no change in the detection of true positive cases, the result will be an increase in the positive predictive value of ovarian cancer screening.</brief_summary>
