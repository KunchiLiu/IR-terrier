	<detailed_description>The "Healthy Habits, Healthy Girls" is a 6-month multi-component school-based intervention developed in reference to Social Cognitive Theory and includes: (1) enhanced physical education classes (2x/week and delivered by a Physical Education teacher), (2) break/lunch-time physical activity sessions (the participating girls will encourage younger girls to make Physical Activity during break and/or lunch-time. This session will only happen after 3 months of enhanced Physical Education classes, so the girls will be able to pass their knowledge for the others), (3) Nutrition and Physical Activity handbooks with 10 health messages (lessons to be done at home and their family); (4) 4 Parent newsletters; (5) Food and Physical Activity diaries for self-monitoring; (6) text-messages using a group application for more interaction and social support; and (7) 10 weekly Nutrition and Physical Activity key messages (delivered by a Nutrition and Dietetics Bachelor degree and/or Physical Education teacher during break).
