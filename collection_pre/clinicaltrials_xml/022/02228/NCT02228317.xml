	<brief_summary>A large part of acutely ill patient's access to the health care system starts by calling the emergency number 1-1-2 and thereby getting in touch with the emergency medical dispatch center (EMDC). In most cases an ambulance is dispatched and the patient is brought to the hospital. These patients are not referred by a physician (eg. a GP) and represent an unselected subpopulation of the acutely ill patients. At present, all non-critically ill patients not evaluated by a pre-hospital physician are normally be transported to hospital as category 2 (without activated emergency lightning and sirens).A part of this patient population, however, is not critically ill and a proportion of these may not need hospital admittance . Emergency medical technicians (EM) are not allowed to treat - and- leave patients without a physician's involvement. If the EMT had 24/7 online access to medical control i.e. in form of a physician present in the EMDC , the number of patients transported to hospital for assessment may be reduced as well as response times for patients actually needing ambulance transportation. This could potentially reduce the workload on the whole healthcare system involved in the management of these patients - thereby potentially reducing costs. The objective of this study is to evaluate if a systematic telemedical assessment by an EMDC-physician of all patients who receive an ambulance but are not critically ill and would have a category 2 transport to hospital can reduce the number of the patients that are transported to hospital and save costs and time.</brief_summary>
