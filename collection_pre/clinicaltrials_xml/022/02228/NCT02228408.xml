	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot study designed to compare the safety and cardiovascular effects of 26 weeks of combination hydralazine/isorsorbide dinitrate therapy with amlodipine therapy in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of chronic hemodialysis (ESRD) patients with a combination of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate compared with amlopdipine is safe and that it will improve heart function as well blood flow/blood vessel supply.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixteen patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis will be randomized to 26 weeks of therapy with combination hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate or amlodipine. Study medications will be titrated to goal dose during the first 4 weeks and maintained at goal dose (as tolerated) between weeks 4-26. A final study visit to assess symptoms after drug discontinuation will occur 4 weeks after drug discontinuation. Study duration-Maximum of 32 weeks with 26 weeks of active therapy. Efficacy Measures -Tissue Doppler echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scanning using radioactive NH3 PET will be assessed at weeks 0 and 26. Safety Measures-Adverse events rates including inter- and intra-dialytic hypotension, hyperkalemia,cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed throughout the duration of the study.</detailed_description>
