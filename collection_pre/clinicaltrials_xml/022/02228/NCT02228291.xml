	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study aims to determine the 6-week and acute effects of daily administration of a citrus flavonoid on cardiovascular and intestinal health as assessed by investigation of endothelial function, blood pressure and heart rate, glucose/insulin metabolism, lipid profile and gut barrier function in overweigh subjects. Futhermore we aim to relate the specific intestinal (microbial) metabolism with final serum levels of specific metabolites of the study product.</brief_summary>
