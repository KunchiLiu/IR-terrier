	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of esketamine compared to placebo on driving performance as assessed by the mean difference of standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) from an on-road driving test in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Effects of Esketamine on Safety of On-road Driving in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither Investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), single-center, single-dose and 3-way crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence) study of esketamine in healthy participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (between 21 days and 1 day prior to the first dose administration), a 3-way crossover double-blind, single dose treatment Phase (45 days) and follow-up Phase (7 to 10 days after last dose administration). The maximum study duration for each participant will not exceed 7 weeks. Participants will receive either Treatment A (esketamine 84 milligram (mg) intranasal and 1 placebo capsule), Treatment B (placebo intranasal and 1 mirtazapine 30 mg capsule) or Treatment C (placebo intranasal and placebo capsule) in each treatment period. Driving performance will be assessed primarily by the mean difference of SDLP from an on road driving test. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
