	<brief_summary>Patients with diabetes who develop low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) in the hospital are at risk for losing the ability to develop symptoms that warn them that they are having a low blood sugar. There is almost no available information investigating how the inability to feel symptoms of a low blood sugar contributes to the risk of this happening when people with diabetes are hospitalized. The purpose of this study is to develop a symptom score model that will help to identify patients at risk for low blood sugars in the hospital and to examine what happens to patients who do experience a low blood sugar in the hospital.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoglycemia in Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who develop recurrent hypoglycemia are predisposed to developing hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF, impaired awareness). There is almost no information investigating the contribution of HAAF as a risk factor for hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients. Our central aim is to develop a validated inpatient hypoglycemic symptom score model to examine HAAF and its correlation with cognitive dysfunction, re-hospitalization rates, inpatient morbidity and mortality. This will be a prospective non-blinded study performed in a tertiary care center that will include non-critically insulin treated patients with Type 1 and 2 Diabetes. We will identify patients who have experienced moderate hypoglycemia (40-70 mg/dl) or severe hypoglycemia (&lt; 40 mg/dl) within the prior 24 hours by daily generated computerized reports. Participants will be asked to complete a Hypoglycemia Symptom Scores Questionnaire and cognitive testing within 24-36 hours post event. Participants will be contacted at 6 and 12 months following the index hospitalization to obtain information regarding recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, need for re-hospitalization, and occurrence of any new diabetes related complications.</detailed_description>
