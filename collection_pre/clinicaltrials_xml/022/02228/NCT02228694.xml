	<brief_summary>An automated dispensing cabinet (ADC) is a computerized drug storage device or cabinet designed for hospitals. ADCs allow medications to be stored and dispensed near the point of care while controlling and tracking drug distribution.This study seeks to obtain quantitative measurements of the impact of the regulated ADC System installed in select high volume units throughout the hospital.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The IMPROVE Study-IMPact of a Regulated ADC System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of the regulated ADC Systems on the medication administration processes. HackensackUMC is specifically interested in measuring the time to first dose administration from scheduled dosing times of the IV antibiotic piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, USP. and we are interested in assessing a reduction in time from scheduled dosage times of first dose to documented administration after the implementation of the regulated ADC system compared to before. Timely administration of antibiotics improves morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay.Early and effective antibiotic therapy is essential in the management of infection in critical illness. The loading dose is probably the most important dose and is a function of the volume of distribution of the drug and the desired plasma concentration but independent of renal function.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects treated at study site in units where regulated ADC System was installed where greater number of medications is administered due to patient volume per nurse assignment or where greater throughput occurs Timesensitive scheduled medications administered on units where administration includes the use of the medication label printer Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, USP (United States Pharmacopeia) All IV antibiotics Insulin Heparin Medication administration data prior to January 1, 2013; Medication administration data after March 31, 2013 through December 31, 2013; Medication administration data after March 31, 2014.</criteria>
