	<criteria>1. Male or female ≥18 years of age. 2. Clinical diagnosis of Idiopathic PD 3. Receiving stable doses of Ldopa +/ other adjunctive PD therapy for at least 4 weeks before study participation. 4. At least one OFF episode per day and a total daily OFF time of &gt; 2 hours duration. 5. Experience predictable OFF episodes in the morning on awakening prior to receiving morning dose of levodopa. 6. Stage I to III on the Hoehn and Yahr scale in the "ON" state. 7.

Able to understand the consent form, and to provide written informed consent. 1. Atypical or secondary parkinsonism 2. Changes in Ldopa or other PD drug dosing regimens 4 weeks before the screening visit. 3. Past treatment with any form of apomorphine within 30 days of Dosing Day 1 (patients who stopped apomorphine for reasons other than lack of efficacy OR tolerability issues may be considered for the trial). 4. Female who is pregnant or lactating. 5. Contraindications to APOKYN or hypersensitive to apomorphine hydrochloride or any of the ingredients of APOKYN (notably sodium metabisulfite), or Tigan®. 6. Participation in any other clinical trial within 14 days of the screening visit. 7. Receipt of any investigational (i.e., unapproved) medication within 30 days of the screening visit. 8. Currently taking, or likely to need to take at any time during the course of the study 9. Currently taking dopamine antagonists or depleting drugs excluding anticholinergics and/or antihistamines with anticholinergic effects. 10. Drug or alcohol dependency in the past 6 months. 11. Clinically significant orthostatic hypotension. 12. Malignant melanoma or a history of previously treated malignant melanoma within 5 years. 13. Clinically significant medical surgical or laboratory abnormality in the judgment of the investigator. 14. Psychiatric disorder, including but not limited to dementia or any disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator requires ongoing treatment that would make study participation unsafe or make treatment compliance difficult. 15. Dementia that precludes providing informed consent. 16. Potential for lack of compliance and followup in the judgment of the investigator. 17. Any other condition, current therapy, or prior therapy (within 30 days of the screening visit), which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study. 18. Previous neurosurgery for PD. 19. Donation of blood or plasma in the 30 days prior to dosing. 20. Presence of cankers or mouth sores.</criteria>
