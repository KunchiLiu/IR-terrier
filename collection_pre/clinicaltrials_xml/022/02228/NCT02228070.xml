	<brief_summary>Measuring ocular motility and alignment is important for diagnosing different causes of strabismus, following patients recovering from cranial nerve palsies, preparing patients for strabismus surgery and follow-up post surgery. The current clinical gold standards for measuring ocular alignment are the Hess screen and the Harms tangent screen. These tests are accurate, but require patient cooperation, and are not objective because the patient has to indicate the position of the light he sees on the screen. Our objective is to develop an accurate and easy to use goggles system to measure ocular alignment and motility using 3D video oculography.</brief_summary>
