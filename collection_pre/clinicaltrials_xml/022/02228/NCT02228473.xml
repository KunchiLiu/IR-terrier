	<brief_title>Effect of Glycopyrrolate and Atropine on Catheter-Related Bladder Discomfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism of catheter-related bladder discomfort is thought to be related to the muscarinic receptor. The adjuncts to reversal agents such as glycopyrrolate and atropine are known to block the muscarinic receptor in different ways. We want to evaluate the efficacy of the glycopyrrolate and atropine for the prevention of catheter-related bladder discomfort.</detailed_description>
