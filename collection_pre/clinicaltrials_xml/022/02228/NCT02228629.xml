	<brief_summary>Foot complications are a common and costly problem for subjects with diabetes. Although Medicare provides a pair of diabetic shoes yearly for subjects with diabetes, many do not wear their diabetic shoes in and around their house. Instead, subjects may wear shoes, such as flip flops or slippers, that provide little to no protection against injuries. While proper house shoe is important in the prevention of diabetic foot complications, this area has not received much attention. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess if CrocsRx Medical silver cloud clogs - a lightweight clog with protective toe box, cushioning soles, and easy to don and doff - offer reduced dynamic plantar pressure magnitude, as compared to conventional house shoes, for subjects with diabetes. A Repeated Measures ANOVA study design will be used to assess dynamic plantar pressure in 2 shod conditions for each subject with the order of shoes randomized.</brief_summary>
