	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the impact of different nicotine levels in cigarettes among non-daily smokers. This research may help inform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on how best to regulate tobacco products in the future, with the goal of improving public health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Very-Low Nicotine Cigarettes and Non-Daily Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of the study is to assess the effects of switching to Very-Low-Nicotine-Content cigarettes (VLNCCs) among non-daily, or intermittent smokers (ITS). This is a two-arm randomized study with an own-cigarette baseline control. After a 2-week baseline period smoking their own cigarettes, 455 ITS will be randomized (double-blind) for 10 weeks to smoke experimental cigarettes, either: (a) normal nicotine content cigarettes (NNCCs; 0.8 mg) or (b) VLNCCs (0.07 mg), each matched to menthol status of subjects' preferred brand. ITS are more likely to be African-American (AA) smokers; thus AA smokers will be oversampled (to one third of the total sample). Change in cigarette consumption is the primary end-point, and biomarkers of smoke exposure and measures of smoking intensity are also assessed.</detailed_description>
