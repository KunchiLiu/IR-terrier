	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center 2-stage study. Stage 1 (Phase I) is open-label with all patients treated with the NT-503-3 ECT implant. Stage 1 (Phase I) patients will undergo explantation at year 2. Those who, in the opinion of the investigator, are still candidates for continued anti-VEGF therapy will be re-implanted with a new NT-503-3 investigational product and followed for an additional 12 weeks before study exit. Stage 2 (Phase II) is a separate, randomized, masked phase during which eligible patients will be randomized to the NT-503-3 group or the control group. Clinical Hypotheses: - NT-503-3 ECT is comparable to EyleaÂ® injected intravitreally every 8 weeks in the prevention of vision loss due to recurrent CNV secondary to AMD - NT-503-3 ECT has an acceptable safety profile</brief_summary>
