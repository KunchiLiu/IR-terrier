Prior treatment with 1 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (imatinib, dasatinib and/or nilotinib) for Philadelphia Chromosome positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Any Chronic Myeloid Leukemia disease phase, as long as the patient is unable to receive treatment with imatinib, dasatinib and/or nilotinib for any reason. Participation in any other clinical studies involving investigational drug(s) within 14 days or within 3 halflives of drug levels in blood (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of bosutinib. Prior treatment with bosutinib. Prior treatment with ponatinib. Known T315I or V299L mutation.</criteria>
