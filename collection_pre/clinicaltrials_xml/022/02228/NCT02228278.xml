	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if health-related text messages sent from healthcare providers to overweight and obese adolescents enrolled at a pediatric lipid clinic will result in increased adherence to their nutrition and physical activity goals and improve their weight loss. The study will also assess if the volume of texts per week impacts outcomes. This will be a small scale pilot study, with plans for a future larger scale study to assess for statistically significant effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healthcare Text Messaging to Improve Diet, Physical Activity and Weight Loss in a Pediatric Lipid Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will recruit 5 participants the from the UF Pediatric Lipid and Obesity clinic for pre-intervention cognitive interviewing to assess acceptability of the intervention and request their input on a representative sample of text messages. Then, 20 participants will be recruited from the same clinic for the intervention (10 controls, 10 intervention participants). Controls will receive current standard care - clinic visits every three months anthropometric assessments and counseling on physical activity and nutrition goals by a healthcare provider, typically with no patient-provider communication between visits. The intervention group will receive the typical clinic visits plus daily text messages in between visits with fitness and nutrition messages to support their health goals. All participants will have anthropometric measurements at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Each participant will complete a Schwartz Diet and Activity History at 0, 3 and 6 month visits, and a post intervention survey will be completed at the 3 month time point.</detailed_description>
