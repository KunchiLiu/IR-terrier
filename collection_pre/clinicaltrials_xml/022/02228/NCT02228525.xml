	<criteria>Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines Age ≥18 years Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes refractory (primary or acquired resistance) to hypomethylating agents(decitabine or 5azacytidine). At least 4 1 month cycles of prior decitabine or SGI110 OR 6 1month cycles of 5azacytidine (IV, subcutaneous, or oral is required unless the patient has progressive disease prior to completing the required number of cycles. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a Myelodysplastic Syndrome, meeting criteria for any subtype in the FAB or WHO classification systems with any IPSS score. Patients with MDS who relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplant are eligible if they received standard dose decitabine or 5azacytidine prior to or after stem cell transplant as defined in inclusion criteria 3. If patient has undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, they must be greater than 100 days post transplant and have ≤ grade 2 graftversushost disease There is no upper limit on the number of prior treatments provided all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 02 Patients receiving erythropoietin (darbepoetin, epoetin alfa) must be on a stable dose and with stable transfusion requirement or hemoglobin level during the 8 weeks prior to study entry. Adequate hepatic function within 21 days prior to C1D1: total bilirubin &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), asparate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5 times ULN and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;2.5 times ULN. Adequate renal function within 21 days prior to C1D1: estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min, calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or postmenopausal. For both male and female patients, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for three months following the last dose. Patients who are pregnant or lactating; Chemotherapy or immunotherapy or any other anticancer therapy ≤3 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1. Hydroxyurea may be continued until 72 hours prior to first dose and at least 24 hours before the baseline bone marrow aspiration is performed; Major surgery within four weeks before Day 1; Unstable cardiovascular function defined as symptomatic ischemia, uncontrolled clinically significant conduction abnormalities (ie: ventricular tachycardia on antiarrhythmics are excluded and 1st degree AV block or asymptomatic LAFB/RBBB will not be excluded), congestive heart failure (CHF) of NYHA Class ≥3, or myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months; Uncontrolled active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within one week prior to first dose; Prophylactic antimicrobials are permitted. Known to be HIV seropositive; Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for HCV RNA or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen); Patients with another active malignancy. Asymptomatic sites of disease are not considered active. Treated or untreated sites of disease may be considered inactive if they are stable for at least 2 months and are not expected to require therapy for 4 months. Patients with significantly diseased or obstructed gastrointestinal tract or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea. Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline (within 21 days prior to cycle 1 day 1). History of seizures, movement disorders or cerebrovascular accident within the past 1 years prior to cycle 1 day 1. Patients with macular degeneration with markedly decreased visual acuity, patients with markedly decreased visual acuity (no specific etiology) or uncontrolled glaucoma. Patients who are significantly below their ideal body weight (BMI &lt; 17).. Serious psychiatric or medical conditions that could interfere with treatment.</criteria>
