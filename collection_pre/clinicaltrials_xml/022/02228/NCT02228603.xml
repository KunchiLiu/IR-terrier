	<brief_summary>Exercise training is a core component in cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise adherence is, however, low after rehabilitation and the transition from supervised to unsupervised exercise is problematic for many patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is important to provide extended services to improve exercise adherence and healthy lifestyle changes. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a time-limited intervention following out-patient cardiac rehabilitation on exercise adherence and cardiovascular risk reduction.</brief_summary>
