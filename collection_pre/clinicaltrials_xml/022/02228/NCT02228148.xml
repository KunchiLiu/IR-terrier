	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the new and simplified fitting method with Cochlear Nucleus Fitting Software (a major component of a suite of tools which form the Clinical Care Innovation) provides Cochlear Implants Recipients with the same hearing outcome as the current and established clinical fitting method with Cochlear Nucleus Custom SoundTM Suite. The Clinical Care Innovation method reduces fitting to simple volume, bass and trebles adjustments, operations which are familiar to anyone who has used an audio player.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Newly implanted subjects with available Nucleus Cochlear Implants compatible with CP900 series sound processors (excluding Cochlear Nucleus Hybrid) Post linguistically deafened adults (≥ 18 years) Unilaterally implanted ≤ 15 years of severe to profound deafness prior to implantation Subjects who are capable and willing to participate in speech perception tests in local language Subjects who are able to provide feedback in form of a written questionnaire (e.g. Speech Spatial Hearing Qualities questionnaire) Subjects willing to give their consent to the study Additional handicaps that would prevent participation in evaluations (e.g. visual impairment, blindness) Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits, risks and limitations that are inherent to the procedure/fitting method Bilateral implantation HybridL (not supported by Nucleus Fitting Software) Subjects who already have hearing experience with a Cochlear Implant (e.g. reimplantation, contralateral Cochlear Implant) Subjects with singlesided deafness Known cochlea malformations Subjects who lost their hearing due to meningitis</criteria>
