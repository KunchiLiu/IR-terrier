	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the proposal are: 1. To develop through a 15-month pilot study, a novel smartphone-based system, Momba Smoking, that can be used in further relapse prevention trials for postpartum smokers. 2. To determine, through a pilot randomized controlled trial, the potential feasibility, acceptability, and methodological parameters that are necessary to design a subsequent, appropriately powered, randomized controlled trial of the Momba Smoking smartphone-based system. 3. To advance discovery and understanding on the use of technology to translate smoking cessation interventions from clinical to community settings through the training of the next generation of scientists.</detailed_description>
