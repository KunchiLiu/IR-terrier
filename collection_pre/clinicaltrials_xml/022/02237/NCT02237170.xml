	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is perform comprehensive immune monitoring studies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving Sipuleucel-T in an effort to better understand the mechanism of action of this treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Monitoring on Sipuleucel-T</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to: 1. Establish the phenotype and frequency of circulating immune cell compartments in patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T. 2. Determine the induction and the quality of prostate antigen-specific T cell immunity in patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T. 3. Correlate whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures with clinical outcomes in patients treated with Sipuleucel-T. 4. Evaluate the cytokine and chemokine milieu in the peripheral blood pre- and post-treatment with Sipuleucel-T.</detailed_description>
