	<brief_summary>Allogeneic human umbilical cord tissue-derived stem cells injected intravenously (IV) once per day for 3 days or once intra-articularly are a safe and will induce a therapeutic effect in osteoarthritis (OA) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Umbilical Cord Tissue Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) for Treatment of Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered to 40 patients with OA. Arm 1 will receive one intra-articular injection of UC-MSC into the knee and Arm 2 will receive IV UC-MSC once per day for 3 consecutive days. The primary objective of the trial is freedom from treatment associated adverse events at 3 and 12 months post treatment. Secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed at baseline, and 3 and 12 months post treatment and will be quantified based on the Western Ontario and McMaster osteoarthritis index (WOMAC).</detailed_description>
