	<brief_summary>The pharmacokinetics study aims to evaluate the safety of Z7200 (budesonide/formoterol) in comparison with Symbicort Turbohaler (budesonide/formoterol), assessing the bioequivalence of the two products. Namely the study will compare the total systemic bioavailability (as an indicator of safety), and it will compare the pulmonary bioavailability (as a possible surrogate indicator of efficacy). This study will be performed in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
