	<brief_summary>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism. The pathophysiological cause is uncertain, but disturbances in the secretion, elimination and effect of glucagon, insulin and the two incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), probably play important roles. Our research group has previously found that dialysis patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a reduced incretin effect and an inability to suppress glucagon after a meal - two early pathophysiological characteristics of patients with T2DM and normal kidney function. The aim of the project is to provide a detailed description of the mechanisms underlying the (patho)physiological effects of the incretin hormones in patients with ESRD. We plan to investigate the above mentioned disturbances during fasting and hyperglycaemic conditions using incretin infusions during glucose clamping. Furthermore, stable isotopic tracers will be used to determine the effect of the incretin hormones on the endogenous glucose handling. We hypothesise that the effects of the incretin hormones in ESRD will be reduced in respect to healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of the Incretin Hormones on the Endocrine Pancreatic Function During Hyperglycemia in End-stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of the incretin hormones on the endocrine pancreatic function in a uremic environment will be explored during fasting and hyperglycemic conditions in three randomised examination days. At a preceding screening day, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be performed to determine glucose tolerance and the distribution of muscle and adipose tissue. The study will be carried out on three separate days differing with respect to the hormones infused: GLP-1, GIP or placebo (saline) which are double blinded. The patients will meet from an overnight fast and an infusion of one of the hormones is initiated. At the same time labeled glucose will be infused to determine the endogenous hepatic glucose production. A glucose infusion is adjusted according to frequent plasma glucose measurements to maintain fasting glucose level. After 2 hours a steady state of the tracer is achieved and a 2 hour hyperglycemic clamp, 3 mmol/l above fasting glucose concentration will be started. The tracer infusions are continued during the hyperglycemia. After the 4 hour clamp an arginine bolus will be administered to measure the ability to increase the secretion of insulin and glucagon.</detailed_description>
