	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the Chocolate PTA Balloon to standard Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) catheters. The investigators will use Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Quantitative Vascular Angiography to evaluate the acute vascular response of vessels treated with the Chocolate Balloon to a standard balloon catheter, with the primary endpoint being luminal gain assessed by OCT lumen volume measurements.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either the Chocolate Balloon catheter or a standard balloon angioplasty catheter. All angioplasty procedures will be conducted with treatment balloon at the full discretion of the physician and according to the standard practice at the hospital and the device Instructions for Use. All patients will undergo baseline OCT imaging in addition to standard angiography. Post-PTA, all patients will then undergo repeat OCT imaging immediately post-procedure and then again at 10-minutes post-procedure to assess for vascular recoil.</detailed_description>
