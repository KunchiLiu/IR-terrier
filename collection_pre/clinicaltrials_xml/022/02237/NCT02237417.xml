	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 4, randomized, open-label, parallel group study designed to assess the clinical and biological effects of 12 months of treatment with long acting intramuscular (IM) aripiprazole (Abilify®) as measured by clinical and behavioral measures, and changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in subjects with schizophrenia compared with SOC oral antipsychotic medications and compared with a healthy control group. It is hypothesized that improved treatment compliance will lead to fewer white matter changes in the brain. Fewer white matter changes will be demonstrated via neuroimaging as increased FA and BPF values in the prefrontal region, and an increase in metabolites in a voxel centered on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as seen with MRS. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the structural and metabolic effects of aripiprazole (Abilify®) once monthly in patients with schizophrenia using MRI techniques and to examine these effects in association with cognitive and clinical measures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for All Subjects Are able to provide written informed consent. Are male and female subjects 18 to 35 years of age, inclusive, at time of informed consent. Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Schizophrenia Have a current diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by DSM IVTR criteria and a history of the illness for at least 1 year prior to screening and at least two prior psychotic episodes based on medical records or a qualified and reliable health care provider. Require, in the investigator's judgment, chronic treatment with an antipsychotic medication. Are able to understand the nature of the study and follow protocol requirements, including the prescribed dosage regimens, tablet ingestion, IM depot injection, and discontinuation of prohibited concomitant medications, read and understand the written word in order to complete subjectreported outcomes measures, and be reliably rated on assessment scales. Are male and female subjects who are surgically sterile (i.e., have undergone orchiectomy or hysterectomy, respectively; female subjects who have been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months; or male and female subjects who agree to remain abstinent or to practice double barrier forms of birth control from trial screening through 30 days (for females) and 90 days (for males) from the last dose of IMP for SOC oral antipsychotics and 150 days for females and 180 days for males for aripiprazole depot. If employing birth control, two of the following precautions must be used: vasectomy, tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pill, birth control implant, birth control depot injections, condom, or sponge with spermicide. Exclusion Criteria All Subjects Presence of any metal implants, pacemakers, unremovable prosthetic device, or other device or situation that may preclude imaging History of a head injury with loss of consciousness &gt; 5 minutes Has a significant medical condition that would expose the subject to undue risk or interfere with study assessments. Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Schizophrenia Has a current DSMIVTR diagnosis other than schizophrenia, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, delirium, dementia, amnestic or other cognitive disorders. Also excluded are subjects with borderline, paranoid, histrionic, schizotypal, schizoid, or antisocial personality disorder. Is considered resistant/refractory to antipsychotic treatment by history (failed two prior antipsychotic medication trials) or response only to clozapine. Has a significant risk of violent behavior or a significant risk of committing suicide based on history or investigator's discretion. Has met DSMIVTR criteria for any significant substance use disorder within 3 months prior to screening, excluding caffeine, nicotine, or marijuana. Is known to be allergic, intolerant, or unresponsive to prior treatment with aripiprazole or other quinolinones, or hypersensitivity to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or clinically significant tardive dyskinesia at screening per the investigator's discretion. Has a history of seizures or any other medical condition that would expose the subject to undue risk or interfere with study assessments. Is involuntarily incarcerated. Has undergone electroconvulsive therapy in the 2 years prior to enrollment in the study. Has used an investigational agent or has participated in a clinical study with aripiprazole IM depot or any other antipsychotic depot preparation within 30 days of screening. Has clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results, vital signs, or ECG results. Requires more than one benzodiazepine beyond screening (e.g., lorazepam and oxazepam). Fails to washout from prohibited concomitant medications, including the use of or CYP3A4 inducers, a second antipsychotic, antidepressants (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors), and mood stabilizers.</criteria>
