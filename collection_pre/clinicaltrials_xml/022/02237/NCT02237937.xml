	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the ABCB1-genotype dependent efficacy of a quick dose-escalation strategy within 28 days of treatment with approved antidepressants that are known substrates of the P-glycoprotein, an efflux pump of the blood-brain barrier expressed by the ABCB1 gene. Moreover, the study evaluates ABCB1-genotype dependent side-effects of approved antidepressants that are known substrates of the P-glycoprotein, an efflux pump of the blood-brain barrier expressed by the ABCB1 gene.</brief_summary>
