	<brief_summary>Background: The wound healing promoting effect of negative wound pressure therapies (NWPT) takes place at the wound foam interface. Implementation of bioactive substances at this site represents a major research area for the development of future NWPT devices. Methods: Wound healing kinetics of pressure ulcers treated by vacuum assisted closure devices with or without the implementation of a thin interface of poly-N-acetyl glucosamine nanofibers (sNAG) was studied in a prospective randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
