	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works in staging patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body. New imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI, may be a less invasive way of predicting the stage and grade of prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion-weighted MRI for pathologic T3 stage prostate cancer using a 3 Tesla (3T) magnet with a surface coil. OUTLINE: Patients undergo diffusion-weighted MRI of the pelvis.</detailed_description>
