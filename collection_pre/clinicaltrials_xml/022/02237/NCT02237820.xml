	<brief_summary>This is the first study assessing the impact of dexamethasone (a glucocorticosteroid with negligible mineralocorticoid activity) as compared to prednisone on short-term outcomes of HF patients hospitalized with exacerbation of COPD. The study may provide important data regarding a simple but potentially robust intervention among large patient population with high rates of hospital admissions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Versus Prednisone in Heart Failure Patients, Hospitalized With Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An Open-label randomized prospective study of HF patients (NYHA grade II-VI), hospitalized with COPD exacerbation. Eighty patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to conventional and intervention testament groups. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior to study enrolment. The conventional therapy group will receive 40mg of oral prednisone daily, while the intervention group will be treated with oral dexamethasone in an equivalent anti-inflammatory dose of 6 mg/day. Glucocorticosteroids will be administered throughout hospitalization and will be continued for 7 days after randomization. Dose changes through this period, as well as subsequent tapering will be on the discretion of the treating physician. All patients will also be treated with short-acting bronchodilators, antibiotics, oxygen, positive pressure non-invasive mechanical ventilation and VTE prophylaxis - based on the GOLD 2013 guidelines and clinical judgment of the attending physicians. An order for low sodium diet will be written. Discharge decisions will be based on the GOLD 2013 discharge criteria list8. Patients will be discharge without steroid tapering regimen unless indicated by clinical judgment. Tapering regimens will include reduction of steroid dose by 5mg every 5 days and by 1mg every 7 days for prednisone and dexamethasone respectively. Patient's demographic data will be documented at baseline (age, sex, GOLD severity stage, data on hospitalizations in the past year, patients' chronic drug therapy). On admission and at 14 day follow-up point, patients' weight, height and oxygen saturation will be measured and blood will be drawn for evaluation of complete blood count, chemistry, NT proBNP levels, troponin, C-reactive protein and venous blood gas. The patients will be asked to complete COPD assessment tool (CAT) questionnaire in order to quantify their health status. In addition, patients will undergo a chest X-ray, ECG, spirometry and two-dimensional echo-Doppler examination. A follow-up visit will be performed 14Â±2 days after enrollment. The following measures will be obtained: weight, laboratory blood tests (please refer to admission blood tests), CAT questionnaire score and documentation of current diuretic dose. In addition, two-dimensional echo-doppler examination and spirometry will be performed. After study completion, each patient will be followed for 30 more days post discharge in order to document further hospitalizations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Age &gt; 40 years. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COPD and evidence of airflow limitation (GOLD severity stage of IIIV). Patients with worsening of their underlying disease or an exacerbation defined as an increase of breathlessness and the presence of at least two of the following symptoms for at least 24 hours an increase in cough frequency or severity, increased sputum volume or purulence, and increased wheezing. Patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (NYHA grade IIIV). Exclusion criteria: Patients with a severe exacerbation on enrollment, based upon arterial PH&lt;7.2 or PaCO2 &gt; 90 mmHg Patients who are currently participating in other studies. Known hypersensitivity to prednisone / dexamethasone. Patients who were treated with systemic corticosteroids one month prior to admission, unless prednisone dosage is 20 mg or less. Patients who are unable to provide an informed consent. Pregnant woman. Patients on Chronic mechanical ventilation. Study drug treatment termination criteria: Hypersensitivity reaction to prednisone / dexamethasone. Any clinical deterioration, which at the discretion of the treating physician and/or study investigators, necessitate change of the study steroid treatment (such as, but not limited to, need to stop oral medication).</criteria>
