	<brief_summary>The bullous pemphigoid treatment is based on corticosteroids continued for several years. Pemphigus causes some patients a psychological impact and sometimes major vulnerability that can occur not only at diagnosis but also at later stages of disease progression. Our hypothesis is that these episodes of vulnerability may be under four kinds of factors that may be connected to the plurality of the history of these patients, and the resources they can mobilize throughout this experience, generating inequality in management and "work" around the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Vulnerability Factors in the Course of Pemphigus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The originality of the project lies in its multidisciplinary approach (dermatology, psychology, sociology). No such study has yet been carried out in the pemphigus who has been the subject of a very small number of works in sociology or psychology. The only studies are studies of quality of life with no longitudinal follow-up. The perspective of qualitative and quantitative data, sociological and psychological approaches, should allow more innovative and adapted to the medico-social and psychological care of patients with pemphigus approaches. The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants leading to moments of vulnerability in the course of patients with pemphigus in order to be able to offer preventive or corrective actions to improve the experience of the disease.</detailed_description>
