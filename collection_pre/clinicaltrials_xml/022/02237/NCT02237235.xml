	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are to study MMFS-202-302 in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 9-week study of its effect on ameliorating cognitive deficits in 60 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with stable levels of positive symptoms. Secondary end points will include changes in positive and negative symptoms. One dose of MMFS-202-302 will be studied and compared with placebo as adjunctive treatment to atypical antipsychotic drug treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of MMFS-202-302 on Cognitive Enhancement in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a problem with specific domains of cognition, even when the positive symptoms have been treated. The primary goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of MMFS-202-302 as augmentation of atypical antipsychotic medication, to improve specific domains of cognitive function, e.g. attention, executive function, declarative memory, etc in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The investigators will also examine the effect of MMFS-202-302 on negative symptoms of schizophrenia, positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and working memory as measured by a neuroimaging paradigm.</detailed_description>
