	<brief_title>Cerebral Oxygenation in Septic Patients Using Vasopressors - the Conscious Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mortality with septic shock is high. Treatment includes antibiotics, intravenous fluid and drugs for circulatory support, especially the vasopressor norepinephrine. Fluids and drugs for circulatory support are to restore adequate organ perfusion. Inadequate oxygenation of the brain can give neurologic damage. Traditionally treatment is guided by surrogate markers like arterial and central venous pressure. Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method which measures cerebral saturation of oxygen, SCO2, and thereby expresses regional cerebral perfusion. By registering cerebral oxymetry on patients treated with vasopressors for septic shock we want to reveal if higher doses of vasopressor correlates with cerebral vasoconstriction and lower cerebral oximetry.</detailed_description>
