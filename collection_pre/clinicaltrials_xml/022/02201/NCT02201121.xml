	<brief_title>Influences of Phenylephrine, Dopamine and Ephedrine on Stroke Volume Variation and Pulse Pressure Variation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) during mechanical ventilation have been shown to be effective parameters to predict preload responsiveness. Although induced hypertension decreases PPV and SVV, the influences of phenylephrine, dopamine and ephedrine on PPV and SVV are unknown.</detailed_description>
