	<brief_title>Triheptanoin Treatment Trial for Patients With Long-chain Fatty Acid Beta-oxidation Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triheptanoin treatment, in patients with long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation defects, could cause not only a great improvement in their quality of life, also could prevent life-threatening signs, reducing symptoms and serious complications of their disease, like cardiomyopathy, Reye-like syndrome episodes and rhabdomyolysis. This result would occur by the effect of propionyl CoA primer on the Krebs cycle and, at the same time, would produce a gluconeogenic effect. This treatment opens the door to be used in other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, glycogen storage disease and other diseases with energy problems. All patients will be followed up until 16 months.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients with any of the following conditions: Longchain 3hydroxyacylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHAD). Very longchain acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD.) Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency (CPT I). Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II). Carnitineacylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACT). Positive skin biopsy: patients were deemed to commence the dietary treatment with Triheptanoin after evaluating the individual response in vitro in cultured fibroblasts. This response is based on the measurement of the production of propionylCoA, the incubation with fatty acids oddchain, compared with control group fibroblasts. The informed consent must be signed by the patient or family, in the case of minors. No patient/family collaboration or the application of dietary treatment. No in vitro test response. Do not meet the inclusion criteria.</criteria>
