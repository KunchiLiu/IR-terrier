	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine the relative bioavailability of two candidate formulations of mosapride citrate 5mg tablets compared the reference product GASMOTIN (mosapride citrate 5mg) from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Company in healthy adult subjects. This will be an open-label, randomised, single dose, three-way crossover, six sequence study. Subjects will receive a single oral dose separated by at least 7 days and no greater than 14 days washout period. This study is required to select a candidate mosapride citrate (GR107719B) formulation for further development and provide data to allow the design of a future pivotal bioequivalence study. The candidate formulations will be compared with the innovator GASMOTIN. GASMOTIN is a trademark of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Company.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index within the range 19 24.9 kg/m^2 (inclusive). A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milliinternational units per milliliter (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per mililiter (pg/mL) [&lt;147 picomole per liter] is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method; Childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing AND; Agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the followup contact visit; OR has only samesex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until the followup contact visit. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Based on single or averaged corrected QT interval (QTc) values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief recording period: QTcF &lt; 450 msec Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent to 8 gram of alcohol: a halfpint (approximately 240 milliliter [mL]) of beer, 1 glass (100 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Gastrointestinal disease or with gastrointestinal surgical history which can affect the absorption of the investigational product. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or prior to dosing. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 90 day period. Lactating females. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 90 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.</criteria>
