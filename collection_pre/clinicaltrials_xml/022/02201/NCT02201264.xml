	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a registry of patients treated with primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this registry is to define the outcomes of patients treated for acute, ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) at community hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery programs that have completed the C-PORT Primary Angioplasty Development program. The primary medical outcome for the registry is the combined incidence of death, recurrent non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary study endpoint is the composite incidence of death, non-fatal reinfarction and stroke 6 weeks after index myocardial infarction. Secondary endpoints include: 1. composite of death, recurrent non-fatal MI and stroke at hospital discharge and at 6 months 2. specific subgroup analyses are planned based on history of diabetes age anterior versus other infarct locations race gender 3. incidence of complications including significant bleeding, need for coronary artery bypass surgery, cardiac arrest</detailed_description>
