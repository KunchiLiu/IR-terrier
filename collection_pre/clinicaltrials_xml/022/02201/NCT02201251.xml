	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of topiramate monotherapy compared with levetiracetam another standard antiepileptic drug (AED), as monotherapy for new-onset or recent-onset epilepsy (seizure disorder) on pediatric growth and maturation, bone mineralization, and kidney stone formation in children aged 2 to 15 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety of the Drugs Topiramate and Levetiracetam in Treating Children Recently Diagnosed With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label, multi-centric (conducted in more than one center) and 2-arm flexible-dose monotherapy study of topiramate compared with 1 another AED (levetiracetam) in pediatric participants with epilepsy. The total study duration will be up to of 1 year and 2 months per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (1 year) and post-treatment (30 days). Safety will primarily be evaluated by percentage of participants with kidney stones and change from baseline in bone mineral density at Month 12.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant with a clinical diagnosis of newonset or recentonset epilepsy characterized by partialonset seizures (POS) (with or without secondary generalization) or primary generalized tonicclonic seizures (PGTCS) in accordance with criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy. The epilepsy diagnosis must be within the previous 2 years before screening Caregivers (parents or legally acceptable representatives) of the participant must be able to accurately maintain the participant takehome record and seizure diary At screening, participant must have weight and height values within the 5th to 95th percentile for chronological age (based on standard Child Height and Weight Charts from the Centers for Disease Control [CDC]) Participant must never have been treated for epilepsy (treatmentna√Øve) or have been treated with no more than 1 standard antiepileptic drug (AED) if temporary or urgent AED use was necessary. Previous AED exposure must not exceed either of the following: 1.)Thirtyone days immediately preceding enrollment, or 2.)A total of 6 months of previous AED exposure in the past if the AED has been discontinued for at least 1 year prior to enrollment Parents (or legally acceptable representatives) of the participant must sign an informed consent/permission document, indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to give permission for their child to participate in the study. Participant 7 years of age and older, capable of understanding the nature of the study, must provide assent for their participation Participant has a surgically implanted and functioning vagus nerve stimulator Participant has a history of seizures as a result of a correctable medical condition, such as metabolic disturbance, toxic exposure, neoplasm, or active infection within 2 weeks prior to the first day of Screening Participant has had uncontrolled seizures while previously taking either topiramate or levetiracetam Participant has a history of nonepileptic seizures within 2 weeks prior to the first day of Screening Participant has myoclonic or absence seizures</criteria>
