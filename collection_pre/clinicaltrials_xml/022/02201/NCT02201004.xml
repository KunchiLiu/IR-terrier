	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: To assess the effects of tofogliflozin on glycemic control in comparison to placebo as an add-on treatment to insulin treatment in terms of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction over a period of 16 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To assess the safety of tofogliflozin in combination with insulin treatment throughout 52 weeks. Secondary Objectives: To assess the effects of tofogliflozin in comparison to placebo on: - Body weight - Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) - Postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) To assess the long term safety and tolerability of tofogliflozin.</brief_summary>
