	<brief_summary>Retinal re-detachment in silicone oil filled eye, especially in the traumatic eye, is a complex retinal detachment with poor prognosis. In this study, the investigators try to apply a modified surgery as Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy to reattach the retina. Here the investigators aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of this new surgical approach</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-electrocoagulation Retinectomy for Retinal Re-detachment in Silicone Oil Filled Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relaxing retinectomy is a useful surgery for retinal re-detachment in eyes with silicone oil filled. However, it has some obvious disadvantages such as the cut of the normal retina surrounding, leaving a large area of retinal deficiency and significant exposure of retinal pigment epithelium and choroid membranes. In this study, we try to apply a modified surgery named Multi-electrocoagulation retinectomy to re-attach the retina. Instead of cutting through the proliferated retina directly, this new surgical approach adopts to cut the retina apart in a honeycomb shape with the help of electrocoagulation. In this way, we not only relax the traction of the proliferative membranes, but also reserve the rest retina to cover the RPE layers. Based on the hypothesis above, we are aiming to explore the safety and efficacy of this new surgical approach</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 560 years, male or female 2. The primary retinal detachment was caused by ocular trauma, and the vitreous body is filled with silicone oil now. 3. The presence of inferior retinal redetachment located among 39 o'clock. 1. The primary retinal detachment was not caused by ocular trauma. 2. Location of the redetached retina is not mainly in the inferior of the eye. 3. The fundus is unobservable because of severe corneal opacity. 4. The contralateral eye is nonfunctional 5.
