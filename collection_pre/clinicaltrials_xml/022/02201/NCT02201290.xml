	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject's guardian and accompanying informed assent from the subject (for children over 6 years old). Subjects must be between 1 year and &lt;18 years of age at Day 1. Subjects must have enrolled in TRA115450/PETIT2 study. Subjects must have completed Part 1 and Part 2 of TRA115450/PETIT2 study. Female subjects of childbearing potential (after menarche) must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of first dose of study treatment; agree and be able to provide a blood or urine specimen for pregnancy testing during the study; agree to use effective contraception during the study and for 28 days following the last dose of study treatment, and not be lactating. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception from 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment until 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Subjects with any clinically relevant abnormality, other than ITP, identified on the screening examination or any other medical condition or circumstance, which in the opinion of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study or suggests another primary diagnosis (e.g. Thrombocytopenia is secondary to another disease). Any subject considered to be a child in care, defined as one who has been placed under the control or protection of an agency, organization, institution or entity by the courts, the government or a government body, acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by law or regulation. This can include a child cared for by foster parents or living in a care home or institution, provided that the arrangement falls within the definition above.
