	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of single doses of insulin glargine given as U200 and U500 with those of a single dose (SD) of Lantus® U100 in a euglycemic clamp setting in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Secondary Objectives: To compare the metabolic activity characteristics of single doses of insulin glargine given as U200 and U500 with those of a single dose of Lantus® U100 in a euglycemic clamp setting in subjects with type 1 diabetes. To assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of U200, U500 and Lantus® U100 in subjects with type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
