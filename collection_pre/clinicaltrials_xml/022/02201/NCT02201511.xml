	<brief_summary>The study is designed to understand the blood concetration of PF-06412562 and its metabolite, PF-06663872, following a single oral dose of a modified release formulation. The study will include two doses of the PF-06412562 modified release formulation to understand the proportionality. Effect of food on absorption of PF-06412562 from the modified release formulation will also be investigated in this study.</brief_summary>
