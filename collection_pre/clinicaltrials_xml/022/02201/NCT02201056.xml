	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating Single Doses of TAK-935</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose and to assess how TAK-935 is processed by the body. This study will look at side effects and lab results in people who take TAK-935 and is designed as a randomized dose-rising study. The study will consist of 6 Cohorts with 8 participants in each Cohort. In each Cohort, 6 participants will receive a single dose of TAK-935 and 2 participants will receive placebo after a 10-hour fast. The starting dose will be 15 mg followed by planned doses of 50, 200, 600, 900 and not to exceed 1350 mg in subsequent cohorts. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 51 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic, including one 7-day period of confinement to the clinic. All participants will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
