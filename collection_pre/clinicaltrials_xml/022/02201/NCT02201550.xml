	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 on the immune system i.e on the regulation of immune cells important in diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The hypotheses are: - Glucagon-like peptide-1 has an immunological effect observed by studying immune cells in the blood - Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 increases the number of immune cells in the blood - Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 leads to a more anti-inflammatory cytokine profile in the blood</brief_summary>
