	<brief_summary>Breastfeeding is recommended for preterm infants. Development of breastfeeding is an important issue, requiring the involvement of medical and paramedical staff in neonatal units. There are few data concerning the fathers of preterm infants. However, the role of the father is identified in the literature as a key factor in the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. In our neonatal unit care, reasons for breastfeeding high rates are not identified but may be related to the father being in close and constant contact with the medical and paramedical staff. In fact, fathers are often first in contact with caregivers. They can be invested in the implementation of nursing care, skin to skin, as well as being asked to support the development of their child in the service and at home. The aims of this study are to: - Analyze the beliefs, social representations and the experience of the fathers of premature infants hospitalized in intensive care unit concerning breastfeeding. - Analyze the factors facilitating and inhibiting the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. - Consider strategies of care and support that can be used for the families of premature infants and of children born at term. - Explore the expectations of medical staff with regards to the management of children and families, their practices, identify the role attributed to the father. - Initiate and facilitate reflexivity of medical and paramedical staff about their respective practices</brief_summary>
