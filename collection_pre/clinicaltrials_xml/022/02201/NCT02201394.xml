	<brief_summary>ACS patients treated with antiplatelet drugs who require CABG surgery have to wait 5-7 days for the effects of the drugs to wean off. This treatment-devoid period leaves the patient vulnerable, therefore any means to shorten this period could be useful. The present study aims to investigate the possibility of reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with the help of fresh donor platelets. Fresh platelets will be added to blood samples of treated patients in varying concentrations at specific timepoints to determine the time and amount of fresh platelets needed to normalize platelet reactivity in the treated samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversing Ticagrelor's Effects With Fresh Platelets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current ACC/AHA guidelines for ACS patients requiring CABG surgery after treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy recommend delaying surgery for 5-7 days after discontinuation of therapy, to allow for the dissipation of its antiplatelet effects. This treatment-devoid waiting period puts the ACS patients at risk for further cardiovascular events. Any means to shorten this vulnerable period would be of critical value. One possibility to speed up the recovery of the inhibited platelets is to administer infusions of fresh platelets. In fact, platelet transfusions are frequently administered to patients during surgery who had received prior antiplatelet therapy. However, the degree to which these transfusions restore platelet function in the recipient subjects' blood and the time from dosing when they are most effective are unknown. The timing is critical in scenarios where urgent surgery is required because infusion of platelets too soon after antiplatelet dosing could render them useless by the residual drug in circulation. The aim of the present study is to investigate the restoration of platelet function of ticagrelor-treated subjects by adding donor platelets to their blood. The study would have 2 arms mimicking different clinical scenarios: 1. Clinical Scenario 1 - Patient given a loading dose (LD) of ticagrelor in the emergency room, requires surgery: A single (180 mg) LD of ticagrelor with aspirin 325 mg will be given to study subjects and platelet testing will be performed after addition of fresh platelets to their blood ex vivo. Donor platelets will be added at 4-, 6-, 24- and 48-hours post-dose, to assess the time required for normalizing subject's platelet function after a LD of ticagrelor. 2. Clinical Scenario 2 - Patient on maintenance dosing (MD) of ticagrelor, requires surgery: Subjects will receive 3-7 days of ticagrelor (90 mg BID) with aspirin (81 mg OD). After the last dose, platelet testing will be performed after addition of fresh platelets to their blood ex vivo, at 4-, 6-, 24- and 48-hours post-dose to assess the time required for normalizing subject's platelet function after a LD of ticagrelor Platelet testing will be carried out using the following methodologies: 1. Platelet Aggregation - VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. 2. Platelet Aggregation - Multiplate Analyzer.</detailed_description>
