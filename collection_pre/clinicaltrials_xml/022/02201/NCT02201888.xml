	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is known to be associated with cognitive dysfunction which increasing evidence suggests has consequences for functional adaptation and which cause difficulties in social re-integration after hospitalization. The investigators propose a large scale, multicentric study (7 centres from the Hermanas Hospitalarias del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús network) aimed at answering outstanding questions concerning the effectiveness of cognitive estimulation therapy for schizophrenic cognitive impairment. Specifically, the study will examine a) issues related to the size of the effect compared to treatment as usual and compared to a control intervention; b) generalizability of improvement to cognitive function and social cognition in daily life; and c) the durability of therapeutic gains after the end of treatment. 192 patients with chronic schizophrenia will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: a computer- assisted cognitive estimulation program (n=64), non-structured time on computer (n=64) and treatment as usual (n=64). A battery of neurocognitive tests of memory and executive function, including 'ecologically valid' measures, will be administered by blind evaluators at baseline, after 6 months of cognitive estimulation, and after 6 months follow-up. Symptoms, social functioning and self-esteem will be also be assessed at baseline, after the treatment and at follow-up.</brief_summary>
