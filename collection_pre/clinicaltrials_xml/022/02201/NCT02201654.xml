	<brief_summary>This research study compares two ways to biopsy lymph nodes in the chest using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration" (EBUS-TNBA). During a EBUS-TBNA procedure, the patient is sedated, and a flexible camera and ultrasound probe is inserted through the mouth into the large airways of the chest, allowing us to see (via ultrasound) and biopsy the lymph nodes in the chest. The purpose of this research study is to determine if the EBUS-TBNA procedure can be made simpler. In today's practice, the biopsy needle has two parts, 1) the needle itself and 2) an inner stylet that runs through the middle of the needle. Because many other biopsy needles (such as the needles used in breast biopsy and different types of lung biopsy needles) do not use an inner stylet, the investigators do not think the use of a stylet is necessary. If this step can be safely eliminated without decreasing the effectiveness of the procedure, this could shorten the procedure (saving time). This study is deigned to formally test the hypothesis that a stylet is not necessary in EBUS-TBNA.</brief_summary>
