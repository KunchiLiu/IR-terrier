	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether roxadustat is effective and safe compared to epoetin alfa in the maintenance treatment of anemia in stable hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis subjects when converted from their existing stable erythropoiesis stimulating agent treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat in the Treatment of Anemia in Stable Dialysis Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of three study periods as follows: 1. Screening Period of up to 6 weeks (8 weeks if on Mircera) 2. Treatment Period: a minimum of 52 weeks, a maximum of up to 3 years. 3. A Follow-up period of 4 weeks. A total of up to 820 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either roxadustat or Epoetin alfa (Active Control) in an open-label manner.</detailed_description>
