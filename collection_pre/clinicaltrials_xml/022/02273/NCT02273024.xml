	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that inactivity during the search for a donor may exacerbate current deconditioned states; subsequently, influencing risk factors for post-transplant complications that hinder the recovery phase. This study is designed to investigate if exercise therapy administered prior to allogeneic hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can influence physical and psychological side-effects associated with HSCT. Approximately 6-weeks prior to HSCT, individuals will be randomized into either an exercise group or usual care group and followed until one year after HSCT.</brief_summary>
