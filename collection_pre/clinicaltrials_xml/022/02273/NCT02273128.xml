	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis and Periodontitis are multifactorial diseases which share common risk factors.The aim of the present study is to ellucidate polymorphisms in Calcitonin receptor gene? in patients with Osteoporosis and Periodontitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Disturbances in Calcitonin Gene in Patients With Gum Disease and Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontitis is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease which includes various modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. The non modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms like metabolism associated genetic polymorphisms ( Vitamin D and Calcitonin). Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. Bone loss is a common feature shared between periodontal disease and osteoporosis. Out of all genetic factors Calcitonin gene polymorphism contributes to the development of both osteoporosis and chronic periodontitis.</detailed_description>
