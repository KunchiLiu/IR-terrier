	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NER1006 compared with MOVIPREP in adult patients requiring bowel cleansing prior to any procedure that requires a clean bowel, using a 2-Day Split-Dosing and 1-Day Morning Split-Dosing regimens. Approximately 810 patients will be randomised with the aim of achieving a minimum of 245 patients in each of the 3 groups.</brief_summary>
