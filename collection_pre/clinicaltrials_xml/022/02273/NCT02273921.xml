	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to construct a large database of EEG recordings from elderly individuals in predefined groups. The purpose of this database is to select groups of EEG recordings from the database in order to compare the electrophysiology, as measured by EEG, of the groups. In the clinical trial part all individuals are treated exactly the same and are therefore considered a single group. The categorization is performed during the data analysis. The groups in the data analysis will initially be based on the following: 1. Healthy controls 2. Mild Cognitive Impairment 3. Alzheimers Disease (AD) 4. Lewy-body Dementia 5. Parkinsons Disease Dementia 6. Vascular Dementia (VaD) 7. Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) 8. Depression Other groups will be added if needed.</brief_summary>
