	<brief_summary>The main objective of this pilot study is to investigate the protein / peptide plasma profiles before and after treatment with a direct anti-Xa (activated Factor 10) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to better understand the mechanisms of action of these molecules and perform exploratory analyses concerning proteins whose concentrations change after starting treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient was correctly informed about the study, its implementation, objectives, associated restrictions and patient rights The patient must have given his/her informed and signed consent The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan The patient is available for 1 month of followup The patient has nonvalvular atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed within the last 3 months. Documentation of atrial fibrillation by a 12lead ECG, an ECG rhythm strip, atrial fibrillation episode lasting at least 30 seconds. The patient has a CHA2DS2VASc score = 1, that is to say the presence of at least one of the following risk factors: (1) congestive heart failure or moderate to severe systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle; (2) history of systolic blood pressure&gt; 160 mmHg; (3) diabetes; (4) history of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism; (5) vascular disease (myocardial infarction, arterial disease); (6) age &gt; 65 years; (7) female. The patient will start Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) at the Nîmes University Hospital The patient is participating in another interventional study The patient has participated in another interventional study within the past three months The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship The patient refuses to sign the consent It is impossible to correctly inform the patient The patient is pregnant, parturient, or breastfeeding Presence of a mechanical heart valve or valve disease Patient who recieved another new direct oral anticoagulant other than Xarelto® in the previous three months</criteria>
