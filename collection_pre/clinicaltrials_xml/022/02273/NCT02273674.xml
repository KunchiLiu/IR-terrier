	<brief_title>TMS in Borderline Personality Disorder Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two protocols of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), the application will be over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) right and left, in patients with borderline personality disorder. 40 ambulatory patients with a borderline personality disorder diagnosis from the National Institute of Psychiatry in MÃ©xico will be included. All Patients will be randomly assigned and will complete a total of 23 sessions rTMS, in any of two groups: 5 Hz Group.- This group will receive rTMS sessions, 5 per week during three weeks (acute treatment phase), and after that, one session a week for the next eight weeks (follow up). The rTMS will be applied over the left DLPFC at 5 Hz, 1500 pulses per session in 100% of Motor threshold 1 Hz Group.- This group will receive rTMS sessions, 5 per week during three weeks (acute treatment phase), and after that, one session a week for the next eight weeks (follow up). The rTMS will be applied over the right DLPFC at 1 Hz, 900 pulses per session in 100% of Motor threshold All sessions will be applied with a "Dantec" transcranial magnetic stimulator. The affective, borderline and anxiety symptoms will be evaluated at baseline, and every 5 TMS sessions during the acute treatment phase, and once at the end of the 8-weeks follow up. In same form for neuropsychological evaluations . Categorical variables will be described by percentages and frequencies. Continuous variables will be described by means and standard deviations. Treatment groups will be compared using Student's T test. Cognitive, anxiety, borderline and affective symptom scale scores between treatment groups will be compared using repeated measures ANOVA</detailed_description>
