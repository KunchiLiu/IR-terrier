	<brief_title>CPAP to Reduce Arterial Stiffness in Non Sleepy, Moderate to Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (STIFFSLEEP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Arterial stiffness, evaluated by pulse wave velocity, is related to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. It has been reported that arterial stiffness is higher in patients with OSA than in healthy control groups, and it is assumed that it decreases after treatment with CPAP. In patients with OSA without daytime hypersomnolence it is not clear if CPAP has some benefits on cardiovascular events and hypertension. This study aims to evaluate the effect of CPAP therapy in an interventional cohort of patients with moderate to severe OSA, in which each patient will be is own control, for ethical reasons; the effect of CPAP therapy on the subcohorts of sleepy and of nonsleepy patients will be compared. The effect of a three months trial of CPAP will be assessed.</detailed_description>
