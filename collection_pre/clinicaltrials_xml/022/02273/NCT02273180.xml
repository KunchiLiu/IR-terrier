	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate non-inferiority of SAR342434 versus Humalog in HbA1c change in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) also using insulin glargine. Secondary Objectives: To assess the immunogenicity of SAR342434 and Humalog in terms of positive/negative status and antibody titers at baseline and during the course of the study. To assess the relationship of anti-insulin antibodies with efficacy and safety including during the safety extension. To assess the efficacy of SAR342434 and Humalog in terms of proportion of patients reaching target HbA1c (&lt;7%) and on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles, and insulin dose. To assess safety of SAR342434 and Humalog.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of SAR342434 to Humalog as the Rapid Acting Insulin in Adult Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Also Using Insulin Glargine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of a: - Up to 2 weeks screening period - 26-week treatment period - 26-week comparative safety extension period - 1-day follow-up period. - The maximum study duration will then be 54 weeks per patient and a 1-day safety follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with T1DM diagnosed for at least 12 months and have been treated with insulin glargine and Humalog or Novolog®/Novo Rapid® (at least 3 times daily before each meal) in the 6 months prior to the screening visit. Written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: At screening visit, age under legal age of adulthood. HbA1c &lt;7.0% or &gt;10% at screening. Diabetes other than T1DM. Status post pancreatectomy. Status post pancreas and/or islet cell transplantation. Pregnancy and lactation. Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective contraceptive method of birth control. Less than 1 year on continuous insulin treatment. Use of insulin pump in the last 6 months before screening visit. Use of glucose lowering treatments other than insulin including noninsulin injectable peptides in the last 6 months prior to screening visit. Use of insulin other than insulin glargine and Humalog or Novolog/Novo Rapid as part of a multiple injection regimen (3 to 4 injections per day) in the last 6 months before screening visit. Liprolog® is a European Union approved insulin lispro and is allowed in those countries where it is marketed. Hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis in the last 6 months before screening visit. Unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy or any other rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy or macular edema likely to require treatment (eg, laser, surgical treatment, or injectable drugs) during the study period.
