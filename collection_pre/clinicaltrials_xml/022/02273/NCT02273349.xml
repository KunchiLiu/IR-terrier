	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil (LVRC) in patients with Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) caused emphysema. The hypothesis is that emphysema in AATD patients shows similar tissue destruction profile was well as symptoms and thus will respond favorably to LVRC treatment, demonstrating improvement in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life relative to their baseline status.</brief_summary>
