	<brief_title>Families Taking Control (FTC): Family-based Problem-solving Intervention for Children With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Families Taking Control-School-age Intervention (FTC) will provide education and problem solving training for disease management and school functioning. In 4 sessions offered over the course of one day, families (patient, caregivers, and school-age siblings) will work together and individually to learn and apply the problem solving skills training model to relevant examples and family-specific problems, culminating in an outline of family goals to target after the intervention. The three booster phone calls will provide support to families in implementing the problem-solving model by addressing and refining goals and trouble-shooting barriers to implementation. Children and caregivers completed measures at baseline (prior to intervention participation) and 6 months later.</detailed_description>
