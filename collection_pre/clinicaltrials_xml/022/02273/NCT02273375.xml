	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive a new drug, MEDI4736, or better to receive no further treatment after surgery (and possibly chemotherapy) for lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung. according to WHO Classification of Tumours (WHO Classification of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart. WHO/IARC Classification of Tumours, 4th Edition, Volume 7). Patients with largecell neuroendocrine carcinomas are not eligible. Patients must be classified postoperatively as Stage IB (≥ 4cm in the longest diameter), II or IIIA on the basis of pathologic criteria. Note: Although T3N2M0 tumours have been reclassified to stage IIIB in the 8th edition of the IASLC staging system, these patients remain eligible (as stage IIIA under the 7th edition criteria). Complete surgical resection of the primary NSCLC is also mandatory. All gross disease must have been removed at the end of surgery. All surgical margins of resection must be negative for tumour. Resection may be accomplished by open or VATS techniques Note: Patients with synchronous primary tumours will not be eligible due to the potential uncertainty regarding their appropriate PDL1 status. Prior Systemic Therapy: Preoperative (neoadjuvant) platinum based or other chemotherapy is not permissible. Patients may have received prior postoperative platinum based chemotherapy as per standard of care. No prior anticancer therapy for treatment of NSCLC other than standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is permissible. Radiation: • Preoperative or postoperative or planned radiation therapy is not permissible. The patient must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1. Hematology: . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L or ≥ 1,500/µl Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L or ≥ 100,000/µl Biochemistry: Total bilirubin* ≤ institutional upper limit of normal Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine Clearance ≥ 40 ml/min * excluding Gilbert's syndrome Creatinine clearance to be measured directly by 24 hour urine sampling or as calculated by Cockcroft Formula: Females: GFR = 1.04 x (140age) x weight in kg serum creatinine in μmol/L Males: GFR = 1.23 x (140age) x weight in kg serum creatinine in μmol/L Patient able and willing to complete the QoL, economics and other questionnaires. The baseline assessment must already have been completed within required timelines prior to randomization. Inability (illiteracy, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason) to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the questionnaires will make the patient ineligible Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate Patients must be accessible for treatment and followup. Investigators must assure themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and followup Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient randomization Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer, or other malignancies curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years following the end of treatment and which, in the opinion of the treating physician, do not have a substantial risk of recurrence of the prior malignancy. A combination of small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer, pulmonary carcinoid tumour or largecell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). History of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, GuillainBarré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis. NOTE: patients with Grave's disease and/or psoriasis not requiring systemic therapy within the last two years from randomization and patients with hypothyroidism (e.g. following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement are not excluded. History of primary immunodeficiency, history of allogenic organ transplant that requires therapeutic immunosuppression and the use of immunosuppressive agents within 28 days of randomization* or a prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) immune mediated toxicity from other immune therapy. Live attenuated vaccination administered within 30 days prior to randomization. History of hypersensitivity to MEDI4736 or any excipient. Patients who have experienced untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions and/or have symptomatic cardiac dysfunction (unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year or cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defects). Patients with a significant cardiac history, even if controlled, must have a LVEF &gt; 50% within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs or anticancer therapy. Patients with active or uncontrolled infections or with serious illnesses or medical conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol. This includes but is not limited to: known clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis; known active hepatitis B infection (positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)). Patients with a past or resolved hepatitis B infection (defined as presence of hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc) and absence of HBSAg) are eligible; known active hepatitis C infection. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RA; known human immunodeficiency virus infection (positive HIV antibodies). known pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis with clinically significant impairment of pulmonary function Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test proven negative within 14 days prior to randomization. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception.</criteria>
