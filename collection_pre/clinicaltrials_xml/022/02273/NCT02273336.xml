	<brief_summary>This research trial studies genomic analysis in tissue and blood samples from young patients with lung cancer. Identifying specific gene mutations (changes in deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) may help doctors tailor treatment to target the specific mutations and help plan effective treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Genomic Analysis in Tissue and Blood Samples From Young Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To perform comprehensive genomic analysis of young lung cancer patients' samples to facilitate delivery of targeted therapies and clinical trial enrollment. II. To characterize the impact of young age at lung cancer diagnosis on the genomic landscape of primary lung cancer. III. To establish a prospective registry of young lung cancer patients for both tumor and germline next generation sequencing. OUTLINE: Tissue and blood samples are analyzed via next generation sequencing and whole exome sequencing. After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>COHORT 1: LUNG CANCER PATIENTS Pathologically confirmed bronchogenic lung carcinoma (small cell lung cancer [SCLC] or nonsmall cell lung cancer [NSCLC] of any stage) at any treatment time point For individuals diagnosed with advanced disease (stage IV or recurrent) enrollment must occur within 2 years of diagnosis For appropriate patients (stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR ) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genotyping performed by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory is recommended prior to participation Provision of written informed consent Willingness to undergo a single blood draw Individuals who are under 18 are eligible for study if they meet the defined criteria for cohort 1; in addition, consent for participation must be given by a legal guardian or parent NOTE: to be eligible for genomics, availability of 10 unstained slides (plus hematoxylin and eosin [H&amp;E] slide) or an adequate formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor block from clinically indicated interventional procedures is required COHORT 2: DECEASED INDIVIDUALS Deceased individuals diagnosed with lung cancer at any age less than 40 may be studied on a case by case basis depending upon Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at a participating institution; inclusion will require availability of adequate archived FFPE tissue and release of tissue and records by next of kin, if available Compromise of patient diagnosis or staging if tissue is used for research</criteria>
