	<brief_summary>The current surgical procedure for breast diseases places an emphasis on the conservation of breast skin in order to provide more optimal reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to use portable, non-contact optical imaging device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute called Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging to detect the changes in a skin during reconstructive surgery procedure and healing process.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Breast Flap Necrosis by Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researchers can use Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging instrument to measure the concentration of blood flow in the skin tissue and can determine of the changes that observed in the properties of the mastectomy flap that may be delay in healing process. The imaging device can determine the change from baseline measurement to the development of skin necrosis, wound infection, or implant extrusion.</detailed_description>
