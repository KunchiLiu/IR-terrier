	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy of Pulsed electromagnetic field PEMF delivered with a wearable device in terms of postoperative pain and quality of healing after mandibular third molar extraction. The sample included 120 patients undergoing unilateral mandibular third molar extraction. The devices were positioned over the area corresponding to the extraction site and wearers were asked to keep them in place for 7 days. All patients were asked to record pain (on a visual analog scale [VAS]), hours of wearing the device (groups T and P), and any use of analgesics. At 7 days, healing complications (dehiscence, tumefaction, pus, local lymphadenopathy, pain on palpation, postoperative bleeding, alveolitis) were recorded blindly.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction: Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is a noninvasive method for delivering pulsed radiofrequency energy to tissues to treat postoperative pain and edema. This randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy of PEMF delivered with a wearable device in terms of postoperative pain and quality of healing after mandibular third molar extraction. Materials and methods: The sample included 120 patients undergoing unilateral mandibular third molar extraction. At the end of the surgical procedure, patients were randomly assigned to a test (T) or placebo (P) group and fitted with enabled or disabled PEMF devices, respectively, or to a control (C) group not fitted with a PEMF device. The devices were positioned over the area corresponding to the extraction site and wearers were asked to keep them in place for 7 days. All patients were asked to record pain (on a visual analog scale [VAS]), hours of wearing the device (groups T and P), and any use of analgesics. At 7 days, healing complications (dehiscence, tumefaction, pus, local lymphadenopathy, pain on palpation, postoperative bleeding, alveolitis) were recorded blindly.</detailed_description>
