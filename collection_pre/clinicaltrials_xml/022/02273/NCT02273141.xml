	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the safety efficacy and tolerability of NER1006 versus a Sodium picosulfate and Magnesium salt solution in overall bowel cleansing using a day before only dosing regimen in adults. It is anticipated that approximately 484 patients will be randomised. Half of the participants will receive NER1006 while the other half will receive Sodium picosulfate and magnesium salt.</brief_summary>
