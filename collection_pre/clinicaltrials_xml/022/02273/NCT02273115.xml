	<brief_title>Foley With Oxytocin Versus Foley no Oxytocin for Induction of Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized study. Women with a singleton, vertex gestation between 24-42 weeks gestations presenting for labor induction will be offered participation in this study. Patients who receive prenatal care at Christiana Care may be approached if an induction of labor is scheduled and consented at their prenatal visit. All indications for induction will be included except those specifically mentioned as exclusion criteria. Any contraindication for vaginal delivery would exclude the subject. After informed consent is obtained, the Foley catheter will be placed and the subject will be randomized to receive oxytocin (study group) or not (control group). After Foley catheter removal or expulsion, the remainder of the induction course was left to the discretion of the primary provider. Prior to randomization, the subject will be placed into the nulliparous or multiparous group.</detailed_description>
