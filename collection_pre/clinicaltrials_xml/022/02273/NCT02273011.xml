	<brief_summary>Combined spinal epidural (CSEA) and single shot spinal anesthesia (SSSA) are both well-established anesthetic methods for caesarean section. CSEA combines the advantages of spinal anesthesia for the surgery, and epidural anesthesia for postoperative pain management. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare analgesia and patient satisfaction with CSEA continuous epidural administration of local anesthetics versus SSSA with oral pain medication in the postoperative period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Combined spinal epidural (CSEA) and single shot spinal anesthesia (SSSA) are both well-established anesthetic methods for caesarean section. CSEA combines the advantages of spinal anesthesia for the surgery, and epidural anesthesia for postoperative pain management. However, it is more time-consuming, and adds potentially risks of both single techniques. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare analgesia and patient satisfaction with CSEA continuous epidural administration of local anesthetics versus SSSA with oral pain medication in the postoperative period.</detailed_description>
