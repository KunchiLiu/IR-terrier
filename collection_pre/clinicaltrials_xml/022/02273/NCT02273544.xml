	<criteria>Healthy male or female subjects as determined by results of screening Signed written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Female subjects are not lactating. Females must use adequate contraception (adequate contraception e.g. sterilization, IUP, oral contraceptives) prior to administration of study medication, during the study until after release from the study. Women must have negative blood pregnancy tests Age &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years BMI &gt;=18.5 and &lt;=29.9 kg/m2 (see abbreviations for formula) Able to communicate well with the investigator and to comply with study requirements Laboratory values within a clinically defined reference range Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic or hormonal disorders Surgery of gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which were deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) (&lt; 1 month prior to administration or during the trial) Use of any drugs, which might influence the results of the trial, (&lt; 10 days prior to administration or during the trial) Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (&lt; 1 months prior to administration (at least 10 times the relevant elimination halflife) or during trial) Having had prescription medication 2 weeks prior to study drug administration or over the counter medication 1 week prior to study drug administration (at least 10 times the relevant elimination halflife) Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day) Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60 g/day) Drug abuse Use of methylxanthinecontaining drinks or foods (coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, chocolate, etc.), grapefruit or grapefruit juice, alcohol, green tea, or tobacco &lt; 5 days prior to administration of study drug Blood donation or loss &gt; 400 mL (&lt; 1 month prior to administration or during the trial) Excessive physical activities (&lt; 5 days prior to administration or during the trial) Any ECG value outside of the reference range of clinical relevance including, but not limited to QTcB &gt; 480 ms or QRS interval &gt; 110 ms History of any familial bleeding disorder Inability to comply with dietary regimen of study centre Inability to comply with investigator's instructions For Female Subjects: Pregnancy Positive pregnancy test No adequate contraception (adequate contraception e.g. sterilization, Intrauterine Pessary (IUP), oral contraceptives) Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period Lactation period During the interval between screening and start of drug administration tobacco and caffeine are restricted to avoid withdrawal when starting medication. As no relevant influence on Pharmacokinetic parameters is known moderate tobacco and caffeine consumption are allowed to facilitate trial participation (up to 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day, and/or up to three cups of coffee respectively). Ovarian hormone substitution and oral contraception are allowed to be continued during the study</criteria>
