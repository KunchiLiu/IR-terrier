	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the best dose of erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how well it works in preventing liver cancer in patients with scarring (cirrhosis) of the liver undergoing surgery. Erlotinib hydrochloride may help to inhibit the development of fibrous tissue and prevent liver cancer from forming in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Preventing Liver Cancer in Patients With Cirrhosis of the Liver Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safe and minimum effective dose (MED) of daily erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) that inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the target organ (liver) as assessed by phosphorylated (phospho)-EGFR staining. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and side effects in participants with cirrhosis. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and immuno-histochemical staining pattern of phospho-ERK, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) in the liver. II. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and gene expression signature associated with prognosis in cirrhosis participants following hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection. III. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and viral load in participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive (+). IV. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and erlotinib plasma level on day of liver resection. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days (depending on the date of surgery, treatment range may be 5-14 days).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PREREGISTRATION INCLUSION: Individuals with a clinical diagnosis fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver (no more than ChildPugh classification A; ChildPughTurcotte score of 6 or less) who have: An indication for surgical liver resection, OR A clinical liver biopsy (with research tissue specimens available for analysis) =&lt; 3 months prior to preregistration Willingness to discontinue smoking during the study two weeks prior to beginning the study and willingness to not smoke while taking study medication Not pregnant or breast feeding; women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately Willingness to use adequate contraception to avoid pregnancy or impregnation until 2 weeks after discontinuing study agent Willingness to provide mandatory blood specimens Able to undergo: Percutaneous or transjugular biopsy of cirrhotic liver at least 7 days prior to liver resection (surgical cohort), OR A biopsy of the cirrhotic liver (nonsurgical cohort) Willingness to authorize collection of tissue from surgicallyresected liver or clinical liver biopsy for analyses Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document REGISTRATION INCLUSION: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 International normalized ratio (INR) =&lt; 1.5 Platelets &gt;= 50 B/L (10^9/L) Total bilirubin =&lt; 3 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 5 × institutional ULN Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 × institutional ULN Nonsurgical cohort only: positive phosphoEGFR assessment (&gt;= 100 stained pixels) from tissue obtained from previous clinical liver biopsy Preintervention biopsy sample collected PREREGISTRATION EXCLUSION: Any prior treatment with erlotinib or other agent whose primary mechanism of action is known to inhibit EGFR Participants with a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Note: an HIV screening test does not have to be performed to evaluate this criterion Participants who regularly (&gt;= 2 times per week) use drugs that alter the pH of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antacids; exceptions: individuals who use prescription PPIs and have approval from their primary health care provider to discontinue for the duration of clinical trial participation may be enrolled; an alternate drug to control gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/peptic ulcer disease (PUD) symptoms will be suggested Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice Use of CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to erlotinib (Tarceva) Participants who cannot have their warfarin, Lovenox, Plavix, or other comparable medications held for percutaneous or transjugular liver biopsy and surgery if so indicated Nonsurgical cohort only: pathology report from clinical liver biopsy (=&lt; 3 months prior to preregistration) demonstrates no histologic abnormalities associated with chronic hepatitis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis REGISTRATION EXCLUSION: Receiving any other investigational agents =&lt; 6 months prior to registration Surgical cohort (cohort A only): percutaneous or transjugular biopsy incomplete or not performed</criteria>
