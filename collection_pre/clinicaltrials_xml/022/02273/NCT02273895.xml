	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the electroencephalography (EEG) responses of three distinct groups of individuals to scopolamine: 1) a group of Alzheimer Dementia (AD) patients, 2) a group of individuals suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 3) a group of controls. The main purpose of this comparison is to discover ways to use these responses to distinguish between the group of AD patients and controls in order to develop a diagnostic tool for AD. The purpose of including the MCI group is to investigate whether this diagnostic tool can predict which member of the MCI group will develop AD later in life.</brief_summary>
