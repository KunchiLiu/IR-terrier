	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WTX101 administered for 24 weeks in newly diagnosed Wilson Disease (WD) patients aged 18 and older with Nonceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) levels within or above the normal reference range at the time of enrollment. Subjects with Wilson Disease who have received either no prior Wilson Disease treatments, or have been treated for up to and including 24 months prior to study enrollment with chelation therapy (e.g. trientine, penicillamine), zinc therapy or combination therapy are eligible to participate, if all other inclusion and no exclusion criteria are met. The purpose of the 12 month Extension Phase is to evaluate the durability, and establish long-term safety and efficacy of WTX101.</brief_summary>
