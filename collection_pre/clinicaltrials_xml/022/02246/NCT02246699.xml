	<brief_summary>The prevalence of overweight and obesity is getting more and more important in developed as well as in emerging countries. It can be defined according to the degree of fat storage by measurement of fat mass. No clinical studies have been conducted so far for that intended use on KiOnutrime®-Cs, a fungal chitosan from the mycelium of non-genetically modified Aspergillus niger. KiOnutrime®-Cs has been recognized as substantially equivalent to animal chitosan. The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if KiOnutrime®-Cs-containing medical device, which is a CE-marked medical device manufactured by KitoZyme, has an effect on body weight reduction after 3 months of intake in overweight and obese men and women. Furthermore, effects on anthropometric measurements, body fat mass percentage, serum lipids and safety parameters will be investigated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration per subject will be 3 months and 1 week maximum. Subjects will be screened at visit V1 and will start a 1-week run-in period, during which subjects will ingest 2 capsules of placebo 3 times a day. The subjects will then be randomized to receive the investigational medical device or placebo (1:1) for a 3 months product intake period.</detailed_description>
