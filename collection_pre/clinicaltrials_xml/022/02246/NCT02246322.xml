	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) is a reliable, safe, and effective technique for obtaining samples from the GI wall lesions and from organs adjacent to the GI tract (pancreas, nodes...).Needles available for EUS-FNA include 25G, 22G and 19G. Some studies have suggested that the 25G needle could be equal or even better than the 22G needle. The BXN system and neddles are is a newly developed for EUS-FNA. This trial is developed for testing the accuracy of the new neddle system for EUS-FNA and for comparing the two needles types, 25G and 22G.</brief_summary>
