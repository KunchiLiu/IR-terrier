	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to identify an effective and conservative approach to treating partial thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCT) that otherwise would end with a surgical correction needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Surgical Treatment for Rotator-Cuff Tears Using Platelet-Rich-Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based off literature and clinical practice, the majority of rotator cuff tears continue to progress to surgical correction despite conservative measures. These include physical therapy, medication management and minimally invasive procedures such as subacromial bursa injections and intra-articular injections with steroids. Recently a popular treatment of common musculoskeletal injuries (including tendinopathies) has emerged throughout the US and has been utilized worldwide for many years with good empiric evidence known as Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections. In partnership with UAB Orthopedics and Radiology, the UAB Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation aims to compare PRP to corticosteroid injections for patients with partial rotator cuff tears or tendinopathy. Outcome measures are ultrasound imaging, pain and disability over the course of 6 months.</detailed_description>
