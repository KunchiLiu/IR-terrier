	<brief_title>Effect of Oasis速 Wound Matrix on Stage III and IV Trunk Pressure Wounds Treated With Negative Pressure Wound Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients being treated with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) will be randomized to receive either: 1. Oasis速 matrix, applied to the wound, OR 2. Standard foam, applied to the wound prior to activation of NPWT. Wounds will be examined weekly for up to 12 weeks. At weeks 4, 8, and 12, the NPWT evacuation canister will be collected for specimen analysis. The aim of this study is to determine the therapeutic effect of using Oasis速 Wound Matrix with NPWT. Outcomes include: a) closure rate of non-healing wounds, and b) levels of growth factors and interleukins in fluid evacuated from the wound.</detailed_description>
