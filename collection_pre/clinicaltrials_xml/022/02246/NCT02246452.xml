	<brief_title>Assessment of the Nutritional Status of Children and Adolescents With Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children and adolescents suffering from malignancies often show malnutrition. Malnutrition, defined as a deficiency or an excess of energy, is associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, reduced survival rates, higher relapse rates, and worse treatment response. The present retrospective study assessed the nutritional status of children and adolescents, suffering from nine different kinds of cancer, based on BMI percentiles and standard deviation scores. Anthropometric data were recorded from clinical charts and an assessment of the nutritional status was made at the beginning of treatment, during the course of therapy and during a follow-up period of two years. The influence of treatment-related characteristics, the duration of therapy, and the occurrence of a relapse or progress during therapy on the nutritional status were examined.</detailed_description>
