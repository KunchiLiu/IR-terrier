	<brief_summary>Our goal is to study self-monitoring of smoking as a means to reduce smoking in pregnant women. Investigators hypothesize that more regular self-monitoring, text messages and feedback as provided by home carbon monoxide monitoring device combined with medical feedback on results will reduce smoking during pregnancy compared to only receiving text message and no self-monitoring by home monitoring device and no feedback by home carbon monoxide monitoring device . The periconceptual period is a life period, where given the immediacy of the fetus and future child, a pregnant woman is willing to try and modify potentially harmful behaviors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide to Enhance Reproductive Outcomes in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Altering unhealthy behaviors, such as tobacco smoking, that increase cardiovascular disease and cancer risk, has proven remarkably difficult in traditional medical practice settings, and successful medical trials have been costly and labor intensive. This proposal aims to utilize a self-monitoring device, i.e., carbon monoxide monitor to foster smoking cessation among pregnant women who smoke. Investigators hypothesize that women who have access to a self-monitoring device more frequently (i.e., at home) and receive feedback about their carbon monoxide level will have greater reductions in smoking as determined by declining serum cotinine levels over the course of the study compared to women who do not have access to a self-monitoring device and do not receive feedback about their carbon monoxide level, but only receive text messages.</detailed_description>
