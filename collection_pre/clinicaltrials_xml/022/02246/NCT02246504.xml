	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate thyroid nodule's volume, structure and vascularisation changes following HIFU therapy assessed by ultrasonography</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry - Use of a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in Patients With Non-malignant Thyroid Nodules.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIFU treatment will be performed under conscious sedation under the supervision / responsibilities of an anesthetist. A maximum of 2 HIFU sessions per nodule will be performed per patient. The decision to retreat the patient will be taken at 1 month post-HIFU or later. Follow-up after HIFU treatment D1 after HIFU session: - Indirect laryngoscopy to check vocal cord mobility. D7 after HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler, M1 after HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler, M3 after HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler Decision for an additional HIFU course to improve volume reduction. In case of a second HIFU session D7b, M1b and M3b will be performed M6 after last HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler - TSH - Free T4 - Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies - Calcemia and PTH (in case of bilateral treatment or in case previous thyroid surgery) M9 after HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler M12 after last HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler - TSH - Free T4 - Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies - Calcemia and PTH (in case of bilateral treatment or in case previous thyroid surgery) M18, M24, M36 after HIFU session - Clinical examination (skin, local symptoms, oedema, voice….), - Ultrasonography and Power Doppler</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patient 18 years or older. Patient presenting with at least one thyroid nodule with no signs of malignancy: 1. Non suspect clinically and at ultrasonography imaging 2. Benign cytological diagnosis at FNAB from the last 6 months 3. Normal serum calcitonin 4. No history of neck irradiation Normal TSH. Targeted nodule accessible and eligible to HIFU Absence of abnormal vocal cord mobility at laryngoscopy. Nodule diameter ≥ 10mm measured by ultrasound. Composition of the targeted nodule(s) : no more than 30% cystic Head and/or neck disease that prevents hyperextension of neck. Known history of thyroid cancer or other neoplasias in the neck region. History of neck irradiation. Macrocalcification inducing a shadow in the thyroid significant enough to preclude the HIFU treatment Posterior position of the nodule if the thickness of the nodule is &lt;15mm Pregnant or lactating woman Any contraindication to IV neurolept analgesia.</criteria>
