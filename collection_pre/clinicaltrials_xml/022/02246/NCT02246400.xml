	<detailed_description>The eCMP is an evidence-based lifestyle intervention using a holistic, mind-body-spirit-based, and multidisciplinary approach, and it will be delivered using existing web and mobile technologies. In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial, participants will be recruited from primary care patients of an integrated ambulatory care system. They will be randomly assigned to receive the eCMP upon completion of baseline data collection (the Immediate Intervention group) or after 3 months (the Delayed Intervention group). All participants will be assessed at 0, 3 and 6 months. Outcomes include common cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., weight, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose), health behaviors (e.g., dietary intake and physical activity), and indicators of eCMP engagement and adherence (e.g., attendance and self-monitoring).</detailed_description>
