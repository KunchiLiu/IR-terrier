	<brief_summary>Our overall objective with this study is firstly to provide a comprehensive assessment of intestinal permeability, mucosal barrier function using existing biomarkers and secondly to explore novel biomarkers for measuring intestinal permeability in patients with constipation predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers for Intestinal Permeability in Patients With Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to determine the differences in permeability in IBS-C in comparison with healthy volunteers, the following will be determined: differences in in vivo small intestinal and colonic permeability, differences in small intestinal and colonic mucosal barrier function, differences in effects of fecal supernatants on barrier function of T84 monolayers, and differences in novel biomarkers for intestinal permeability</detailed_description>
