	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of intermittent positive airway pressure breathing (specific lung expansion technique) to conventional chest physiotherapy chest drainage is effective to accelerate the reabsorption of pleural effusion and consequently decrease the duration of chest tube drainage and respiratory system impairment. These effects would decrease hospital stay lengths and the incidence of pulmonary complications.</brief_summary>
