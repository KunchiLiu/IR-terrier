	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized, prospective, longitudinal study is to evaluate the impact of an exercise intervention on patient-reported anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances outcomes among acute leukemia patients. The study will include 2 groups for a total sample size of 30: n=15 control group and n=15 intervention group. Each patient enrolled in the intervention arm will participate in an exercise program for the duration of their hospitalization, 4-6 weeks on average during the first treatment (induction chemotherapy).</detailed_description>

If any of the exclusion criteria are observed, the patients will be informed and excluded from participating in the study. Participation in this study will involve the same risks as any exercise regimen. Given the potential risks involved, patients will be screened for exclusion based upon the following criteria: Cardiovascular disease (unless the disease would not compromise the patient's ability to participate in the exercise rehabilitation program) Acute or chronic respiratory disease that would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the exercise rehabilitation program Acute or chronic bone, joint, or muscular abnormalities that would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the exercise rehabilitation program Inability to understand and speak English Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent Another active malignancy Patients will also be excluded if they have active bleeding, acute thrombosis, ischemia, hemodynamically unstable, and uncontrolled pain.</criteria>
