	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effect of Roux-en Y reconstruction (study group, DPCDA) versus classical Child reconstruction (DPCUN) in the incidence of VGL in patients for DPC. The hypotesis of the study is that Roux-en Y reconstruction decreases incidence of DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING POSTOPERATIVE MORBIDITY ON RECONSTRUCTION AFTER PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY(PAUDA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pancreaticoduodenectomy (DPC) is the procedure of choice of the tumors of the head of the pancreas, periampullary tumors and intractable inflammatory pathology. The high postoperative morbidity (50%) involve a mean hospital stay of 15 days after surgery. The most common complication is delayed gastric emptying (DGE), defined as the intolerance to solid oral intake by 7th day postoperative. In some severe cases, oral intolerance can occur after the 21th postoperative day. Therefore, the patient requires parenteral nutrition and prolonged hospital stay. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of Roux-en Y reconstruction (study group, DPCDA) versus classical Child reconstruction (DPCUN) in the incidence of VGL in patients for DPC. The hypotesis of the study is that Roux-en Y reconstruction decreases incidence of DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy. A pilot randomized clinical trial has been designed to compare two surgical techniques for reconstruction of digestive tract after DPC in patients treated in our center. The patients are randomized after tumor resection and before the reconstruction througt computer-generated random numbers using a sealed envelope technique. The primary endpoint is the incidence of DGE. Secondary endpoints are postoperative morbidity and specific complications as pancreatic fistula, the hospital stay, and postoperative endocrine and exocrine function.</detailed_description>
