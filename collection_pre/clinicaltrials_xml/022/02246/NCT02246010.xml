	<brief_title>Lactose-free Milk in Infants With Acute Diarrhea in a Developing Country</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute gastroenteritis is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality accounting for 15 % of all childhood death worldwide, and is a major public health burden, especially in developing countries. A recent Cochrane review of 33 randomized or quasi-randomized trials reported a modest reduction in the duration of diarrhea in children younger than 5 years who were on reduced or lactose-free diet. Those trials however were conducted on inpatients in high or middle-income countries. None were from developing countries where diarrheal diseases are severer and result in higher morbidities and mortalities. This study aims at investigating the effect of lactose-free milk on the duration and severity of diarrhea in infants from a developing country, who present with acute gastroenteritis to the Emergency Department (ED) or pediatric clinics. The findings from this study will help provide evidence-based dietary recommendations for infants with acute diarrhea in developing countries who are treated in the ambulatory setting.</detailed_description>
