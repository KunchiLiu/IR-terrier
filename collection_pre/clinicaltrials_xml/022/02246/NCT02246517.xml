	<brief_summary>Important pharmacological agents for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain such as ketamine block NMDA receptors. Nitrous oxide, an inhalant agent used extensively In anesthesia, also have antagonist property of NMDA receptors. The investigators hypothesize that prolonged treatment with N2O can alleviate chronic neuropathic pain of different causes (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia etc.).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Important pharmacological agents for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain such as ketamine block NMDA receptors. Nitrous oxide, an inhalant agent used extensively In anesthesia, also have antagonist property of NMDA receptors. The investigators hypothesize that prolonged treatment with N2O can alleviate chronic neuropathic pain of different causes (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia etc.). In order to examine our theory we Will recruit 40 patients aged 18-65 that suffer from chronic neuropathic pain. The patients will be divided to two groups of which half will receive treatment with N2O and half with placebo (pure O2) as a repeated weekly treatment for 4 weeks. At the beginning of the each session the patient will be asked to fill questionnaires regarding their pain quality and severity</detailed_description>
