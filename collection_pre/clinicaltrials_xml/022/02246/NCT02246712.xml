	<brief_summary>This study aimed to investigate the influence of uncontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on the kinetic disposition, metabolism and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of tramadol enantiomers in patients with neuropathic pain. Thus, nondiabetic patients (control group, n = 12), patients with type 1 DM (n = 9), and patients with type 2 DM (n = 9), all with neuropathic pain and phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) who were treated with a single oral dose of 100 mg racemic tramadol were investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Diabetes on Tramadol Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that effectively relieves acute and chronic pain, including neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. The drug is available in clinical practice as a mixture of the (+)-tramadol and (-)-tramadol enantiomers. Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 to O-desmethyltramadol (M1) and by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A4) and cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) to N-desmethyltramadol (M2). Both tramadol enantiomers and (+)-M1 contribute to the analgesic activity of the drug: (+)-tramadol and the (+)-M1 metabolite act as -opioid receptor agonists; (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake; and (-)-tramadol inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. This study investigated the influence of uncontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on the kinetic disposition, metabolism and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of tramadol enantiomers in patients with neuropathic pain. Nondiabetic patients (control group, n = 12), patients with type 1 DM (n = 9), and patients with type 2 DM (n = 9), all with neuropathic pain and phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, received a single oral dose of 100 mg racemic tramadol. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24 h after administration of the drug for pharmacokinetic study and for the analysis of noradrenaline in plasma. Pain was rated on a visual analog pain scale at the same time as blood sampling. The patients were evaluated for in vivo CYP3A activity using midazolam as a probe drug and genotyped for CYP2B6. Total and unbound plasma concentrations of the tramadol, M1 and M2 enantiomers were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</detailed_description>
