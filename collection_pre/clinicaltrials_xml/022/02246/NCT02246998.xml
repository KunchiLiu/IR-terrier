	<brief_summary>This study is to assess glomerular function before and during administration of stribild (STB; elvitegravir [EVG]/cobicistat [COBI]/emtricitabine [FTC]/tenofovir DF [TDF]) or a regimen containing TDF without COBI as ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) plus truvada (TVD; FTC/TDF) or atripla (ATR; efavirenz [EFV]/FTC/TDF) compared to a regimen containing neither TDF nor COBI as ATV/r plus abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) via determination of actual glomerular filtration rate (aGFR) using iohexol (a probe GFR marker) plasma clearance and estimated (calculated) glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This study will assess tubular function before and during administration of stribild, ATV/r plus TVD, or atripla compared to a regimen of ATV/r plus ABC/3TC. This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), antiviral activity, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the three treatment regimens through 24 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>

Or females with childbearing potential who agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 90 days if taking EFV/FTC/TDF or for 30 days for all other study drugs following the last study drug dose Males who agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse or be nonheterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence from first dose throughout the study period and for 90 days if taking EFV/FTC/TDF or for 30 days for all other study drugs following the last study drug dose. Males who agree to refrain from sperm donation from first dose until at least 90 days if taking EFV/FTC/TDF or for 30 days for all other study drugs following the last study drug dose Body mass index (BMI) of 19 ≤ BMI ≤ 30 kg/m^2 and body weight ≥ 40 kg Life expectancy ≥ 1 year HLAB*5701 allele positive A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and HCV RNA detectable Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance that could potentially interfere with study compliance A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma.
