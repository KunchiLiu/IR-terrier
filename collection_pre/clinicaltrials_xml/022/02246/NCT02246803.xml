	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of progression of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery disease after isolated CABG and CABG combined with pulmonary vein isolation. Hypothesis of the study - patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease after CABG in combination with isolation of the pulmonary veins have a better outcomes for the progression of AF compared with patients undergoing isolated CABG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Assessment of Progression of Paroxysmal AF After CABG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single blinded prospective randomized study involving 72 patients with paroxysmal AF and coronary artery disease. 72 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome measure by 10% in the CABG + pulmonary veins isolation group over isolated CABG group. Patients are divided into two groups, group I - isolated CABG (36 patients), and group II - CABG and pulmonary veins isolation (36 patients). Randomization is conducted by using accidental sampling before operation. The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received coronary artery bypass grafting, but don't know about pulmonary vein isolation. Subcutaneous cardiac monitor is implanted to all patients for cardiac rhythm monitoring.</detailed_description>
