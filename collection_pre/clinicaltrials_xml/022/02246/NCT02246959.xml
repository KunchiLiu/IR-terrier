	<brief_summary>In a 4-arm, randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of improving cholesterol levels among participants who are at high risk of CVD and who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels by testing process versus outcomes financial incentives. Participants will use electronic pill bottles that continuously monitor statin adherence. The primary outcome will be change in LDL cholesterol over 12 months.</brief_summary>
