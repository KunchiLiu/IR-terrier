	<brief_summary>Purpose. Comparison of outcomes in patients underwent CABG combined with left atrial and biatrial radiofrequency ablation of long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. Hypothesis of the study - patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease after CABG in combination with biatrial RFA have a better outcomes for the freedom of AF compared with patients undergoing left atrial RFA during CABG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Ablation of Long-standing Persistent AF During CABG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single blinded prospective randomized study involving 116 patients with long-standing persistent AF and coronary artery disease. 116 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome (freedom fro AF) measure by 12% in the biatrial group over left atrial group. Patients are divided into two groups, group I - biatrial + CABG (58 patients), and group II - left atrial + CABG (58 patients). Randomization is conducted by using accidental sampling before operation. The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received coronary artery bypass grafting, but don't know about kind of surgical ablation. Subcutaneous cardiac monitor is implanted to all patients for cardiac rhythm monitoring.</detailed_description>
