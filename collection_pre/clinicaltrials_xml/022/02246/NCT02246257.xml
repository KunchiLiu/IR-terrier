	<brief_summary>The primary aim of our present study is to evaluate the effect of a targeted, intensified, multidimensional intervention compared to conventional treatment of modifiable risk factors for CVD in patients with early RA. The primary endpoint, a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and re-vascularisation, will be assessed after 5years' follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective randomised open, blinded endpoint trial with balanced randomisation (1:1) conducted in seven outpatient clinics in Denmark. Follow-up visits for patients in the intervention group are scheduled to occur at baseline and then after 2, 4 and 12 weeks and thereafter every third month for 5 years after randomisation. The control group will be monitored for RA disease activity and comorbidity after 2, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and thereafter following national guidelines for RA. Prevention of CVD risk factors in the control group will be treated in general practice according to national guidelines for diabetes (2011), hypertension (2009) and CVD (2013).</detailed_description>
