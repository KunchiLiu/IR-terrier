	<criteria>Subjects were 18 years or older Subjects had osteoarthritis (OA) defined by: Presence of of typical hip and/or knee joint symptoms. Involvement of at least 1 hip or knee joints that had warranted treatment with NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase2 [COX2] inhibitors and/or acetaminophen (APAP) for the last 3 months. Radiographic evidence within the last 6 months of OA in the index joint, with Grade II to IV severity, as illustrated by the Atlas of Standard Radiographs. Subjects were otherwise in generally good health, as determined by the investigator, on the basis of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and screening laboratory results. Female subjects were either physically incapable of childbearing or were practicing an acceptable method of birth control and had a negative pregnancy test result demonstrated before dosing. Subjects had experienced a suboptimal response to APAP and NSAID therapy (including COX2 inhibitor). Subjects had used opioids for OA pain on an as needed (PRN) or occasional basis. Subjects were willing and able to discontinue or modify their current medication used for management of OA pain per protocol. Subjects had steady, not transient, pain and a categorical pain rating of moderate to severe on a scale of none, mild, moderate, or severe. Subjects weighed &gt; or = to100 lbs. If a subject had taken any inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 [CYP450j), these were discontinued and an appropriate washout period (5 halflives) had occurred before entry in the study. Subjects were able to take oral medication and were willing to comply with the protocol. Subjects agreed to abstain from alcohol consumption for the duration of the study. Subjects were able to read, understand, and voluntarily sign the IRB approved consent document before the performance of any studyspecific procedures. Subjects had any clinically significant condition that would, in the investigator's opinion, preclude study participation. Subjects had any other clinically significant form of disease at the index joint (study joint) or had been diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis, gout, pseudogout, Paget's disease, or any other chronic pain syndrome that, in the investigator's opinion, might interfere with the assessment of pain and other symptoms of OA. Subjects had known allergies or previous, significant reactions to opioids. Subjects had any laboratory abnormality at screening that was considered clinically significant by the investigator, or that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have contraindicated study participation. Subjects were known to have positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B antigen, or hepatitis C antibody. Subjects had a history of chronic, scheduled opioid use for OA. Subjects had any signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Subjects had a history of substance or alcohol abuse within 2 years before study entry. Subjects tested positively on a urine screen for drugs of abuse. Subjects had received any steroid therapy (e.g., oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or soft tissue) within 1 month of study entry. Subjects had a condition that would contraindicate the use of opioid analgesia. Subjects had participated in a study of an investigational drug or device, or had donated blood, within 30 days before study entry. Subjects used any medication that the investigator felt would interact unfavorably with the study medication (e.g., potentiation of sedation with tricyclic antidepressants). Subjects had used opioid analgesics for more than 3 days during the 30 days before screening. Subjects had a history of seizures. Subjects were considered by the investigator to be unsuitable for any reason.</criteria>
