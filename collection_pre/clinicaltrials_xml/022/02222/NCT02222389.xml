	<brief_summary>Contingency management (CM) is a type of treatment used in the substance abuse field. Patients' behaviors are rewarded for adherence to a treatment plan. As an approach to treatment, contingency management emerged from the behavior therapy traditions in mental health. By most evaluations, contingency management procedures produce one of the largest effect sizes out of all mental health and educational interventions. The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the ability of a culturally-tailored contingency management (CM) intervention to increase alcohol and drug abstinence among American Indian (AI) tribal members from two rural reservations in the Northwest.</brief_summary>
