	<criteria>1. Healthy males subjects 2. Aged 2165 years 3. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.529.9 kg/m2 inclusive 4. Subjects must demonstrate their ability to swallow an empty size 000 capsule 5. Must be willing and able to participate in the whole study and must provide written informed consent 1. Participation in a clinical research study involving investigational drugs or dosage forms within the previous 3 months 2. Subjects who have previously been enrolled in this study 3. Subjects who have ever sought advice from or been referred to a general practitioner or counsellor for abuse or misuse of alcohol, non medical drugs, medicinal drugs or other substance abuse e.g. solvents 4. Subjects who admit to any current or previous use of Class A drugs such as opiates, cocaine, ecstasy, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and intravenous amphetamines (Subjects who admit to occasional past use of cannabis will not be excluded as long as they have a negative drugs of abuse test and have been abstinent for at least 12 months) 5. Positive drugs of abuse test result 6. Regular alcohol consumption &gt;21 units per week (1 Unit = Â½ pint beer, a 25 mL shot of 40% spirit or a 125 mL glass of wine) 7. Current smokers and those who have smoked within the last 6 months. A breath carbon monoxide reading of greater than 10 ppm at screening 8. Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from the present study, excluding background radiation but including diagnostic Xrays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5 millisievert (mSv) in the last twelve months or 10 mSv in the last five years. No occupationally exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, shall participate in the study. 9. Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology or urinalysis as judged by the Investigator, repeated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartame aminotransferase (AST), gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or Total bilirubin above upper limit normal (ULN) 10. History of gastrointestinal surgery (with the exception of appendectomy unless it was performed within the previous 12 months) 11. History of clinically significant disease such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory, central nervous system (CNS), metabolic and particularly gastrointestinal disease, especially peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease or Irritable Bowel Syndrome 12. History of adverse reaction or allergy to study drug or its excipients, e.g. lactose or rescue medication (if specified by the Sponsor). If subject suffers from hayfever they must not have or be expecting to have symptoms during the study period 13. Acute diarrhoea or constipation in the 7 days before the predicted first study day. If screening occurs &gt;7 days before the first study day, this criterion will be determined on first study day. Diarrhoea will be defined as the passage of liquid faeces and/or a stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will be defined as a failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day 14. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within the previous three months 15. Presence of nonremovable metal objects such as metal plates, screws, etc, in the abdominal region of the body (with the exception of sterilisation clips) 16. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are considered by the Investigator to be at risk of transmitting, through blood or other body fluids, the agents responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other sexually transmitted disease or hepatitis 17. Positive hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) or HIV results 18. Subjects receiving prohibited medication as described in Section 4.2 19. Unwilling to avoid excessive sunlight exposure 20. Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason 21. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong the QT/QTc interval within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial, and CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and repaglinide or CYP2C9 such as warfarin, tolbutamide, phenytoin, losartan, acenocoumarol within 1 month or six half lives (whichever is greater) 22. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms) 23. A history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalaemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)</criteria>
