	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the systemic exposure of BI 1744 BS and CD 1857 XX (the active metabolite of the pro-drug BI 54903 XX) at steady state following inhalation of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of 6.2 μg BI 1744 CL plus 727.3 μg BI 54903 XX (as ethanolic solution for inhalation, EIS) with the systemic exposure following inhalation of the mono compounds of 10 μg BI 1744 CL (as aqueous solution for inhalation, AIS) and 727.3 μg BI 54903 XX (EIS), respectively, when administered once-daily via Respimat® Inhaler (Respimat® A for AIS and Respimat® B for EIS) for 14 days in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were to compare exposure to BI 1744 BS and CD 1857 XX after a single dose of the BI 1744 CL/BI 54903 XX (6.2 μg/727.3 μg) FDC and the mono compounds, respectively; to compare exposure to BI 54903 XX after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses of the BI 1744 CL/BI 54903 XX (6.2 μg/727.3 μg) FDC and the mono compounds, respectively; to compare the safety and tolerability of BI 1744 CL and BI 54903 XX when administered as BI 1744 CL/BI 54903 XX (6.2 μg/727.3 μg) FDC and as the mono compounds, respectively.</brief_summary>
