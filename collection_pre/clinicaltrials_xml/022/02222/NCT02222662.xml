	<brief_title>Parent-delivered Massage for Children With Autism - Ages 6 to 11</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children will be randomly divided into treatment groups and wait-list control groups. The control groups begin treatment five months after the treatment groups begin. All children will be tested on three occasions in the first year: prior to beginning treatment, and five and twelve months later. Results will be shared with parents at the end of each year. Testers will remain blinded as to which group is currently receiving treatment. There is no cost to parents for participation in this research study. Families meeting the eligibility criteria will be accepted into the study on a first-come, first-served basis.</detailed_description>
