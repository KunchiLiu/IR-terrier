Dearth of literature available to prove core strengthening or any form of back exercises improving functional outcomes or balance in chronic back pain patients. No studies focus on balance training in improving balance of low back pain patients. The authors are conducting a randomised trial comparing balance exercises and routine back exercise program in improving pain, functional outcomes and balance of the patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Balance Training in Chronic Low Back Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Balance deficits are common in low back pain. Current literature fail to prove the effectiveness of routine back exercises in improving balance of back pain patients. No study has concentrated on balance training in back pain patients. Objective: Compare balance exercises and routine back exercises in improving balance and other functional outcomes. Procedure: Back pain patients attending physiotherapy department of tertiary care teaching hospitals will be recruited voluntarily. Randomised to either balance and routine program based on simple lottery method. Balance training comprises of 5 exercises - single leg squats, dead lift, single leg raises, lateral step-ups and forward reach outs. Routine back exercises includes 5 sets - pelvic bridges, dynamic dead bug, prone planks, situps, lateral planks. 10Repetition Maximum, 2 Sets/ day, five days a week, 2 weeks. Baseline balance (star Edward, berg balance) and functional test (sit to stand) and pain (Visual analogue score) and post 2 weeks outcome scores will be analysed through paired and unpaired for between and within groups.</detailed_description>
