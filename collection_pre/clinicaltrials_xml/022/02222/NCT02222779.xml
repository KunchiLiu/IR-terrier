	<brief_summary>In this trial, concentrations of transition metals of interest are quantified in surplus cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum samples. Quantification of the transition metals will be performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The treating physicians as well as the patients will not be informed about the results of drug concentrations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Samples used include: Remaining portions of samples collected for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons (paired CSF and blood serum samples). No lumbar puncture will be done specifically for this protocol. The objective of this study is to gain an overview about transition metals concentrations in blood serum and CSF in order to provide preliminary data on patients. The effect of neurodegenerative diseases on metals or the other way round will be assessed if possible.</detailed_description>
