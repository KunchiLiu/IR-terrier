	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To assess the efficacy of vatelizumab compared to placebo as measured by a reduction in new contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs) in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. - To evaluate multiple doses of vatelizumab for a dose-response. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of vatelizumab compared to placebo. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vatelizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Vatelizumab in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of study per patient will be up to 108 weeks, including a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks and a post-treatment safety follow-up period of up to 92 weeks. Patients completing the 12-week treatment period may enter an optional long-term extension study in which all subjects will receive vatelizumab.</detailed_description>
