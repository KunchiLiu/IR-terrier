	<brief_summary>A national, prospective, open-label, non-interventional, multicentre, controlled study designed to evaluate a diagnostic method in patients undergoing hip, knee or shoulder prosthetic removal regardless of whether or not infection is suspected. Serological test results will have no impact on the therapeutic approach. Study objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of an antibody detection kit for the serological diagnosis of bone and joint prosthetic device infections cause by Staphylococci, Streptococci, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and Gram-negative bacteria versus the reference method: the bacterial culture of deep intraoperative samples.</brief_summary>
