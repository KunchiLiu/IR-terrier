	<brief_summary>Resistance type exercise training has been shown to be a potent stimulus to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy men. Furthermore, timed protein intake is also known to affect the muscle adaptive response following exercise. Whether timed protein intake could augment the increase in muscle fiber size and/or satellite cell content following long-term exercise intervention remains to be established. We hypothesize that protein supplementation before sleep, on both training and non-training days, during a 12 week resistance training program further increases type II muscle fibre cross sectional area when compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
