	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of CCX168 in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complement 5a and its receptor C5aR (CD88) is involved in the pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the C5aR inhibitor CCX168 in subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis. The aim of this trial is to test the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of the complement C5a receptor CCX168 in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis or renal limited vasculitis Male and female subjects, aged at least 18 years, with new or relapsed AAV where treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab would be required Use of adequate contraception during, and for at least the three months after, any administration of study medication is required Positive indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test for PANCA or CANCA, or positive ELISA test for antiproteinase3 (PR3) or antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) at screening Have at least one "major" item, or at least 3 other items, or at least 2 renal items on the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) version 3 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â‰¥ 20 mL per minute Severe disease as determined by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, alveolar hemorrhage, hemoptysis, rapidonset mononeuritis multiplex or central nervous system involvement Any other multisystem autoimmune disease Medical history of coagulopathy or bleeding disorder Received cyclophosphamide within 12 weeks prior to screening; if on azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate at the time of screening, these drugs must be withdrawn prior to receiving the cyclophosphamide or rituximab dose on Day 1 Received intravenous corticosteroids, &gt;3000 mg methylprednisolone equivalent, within 12 weeks prior to screening Received an oral daily dose of a corticosteroid of more than 10 mg prednisoneequivalent for more than 6 weeks continuously prior to the screening visit Received rituximab or other Bcell antibody within 52 weeks of screening or 26 weeks provided B cell reconstitution has occurred; received antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment, abatacept, alemtuzumab, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), belimumab, tocilizumab, or plasma exchange within 12 weeks prior to screening</criteria>
