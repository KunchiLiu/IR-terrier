	<brief_summary>The investigators are proposing to use a wearable device, MultiSenseTM, developed by Rhythm Diagnostic Systems, Inc. which has many sensors inside in a "Band-Aid" like strip in order to see if it can help diagnose capabilities in individuals suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea. The MultiSenseTM sensor is a self-contained, reusable, rechargeable, battery-powered, flexible strip, measuring 4 X 1.2 inches that simultaneously tracks and records a number of physiological health related parameters such as ECG, heart rate, pulse synchronized oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, depth of respiration and motion/position. One advantage of this device over current home diagnostic systems is the capability for recording over several nights. The objective is to compare multiple biometric parameters tracked by the MultiSenseTM to gold standard monitoring in an accredited sleep lab using polysomnography. Home monitoring will explore potential findings supportive of sleep apnea while monitoring at home during routine sleep over 5 to 7 nights. Enrolling 10 adults already scheduled for a medically indicated sleep study will help us to make these determinations. Subjects will wear the device, which is the size of a Band-Aid, via adhesive to their chest over a period of 10 days. Subjects will go about their normal daily activities and return the device via mail once completed.</brief_summary>
