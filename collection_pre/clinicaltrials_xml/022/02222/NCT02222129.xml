	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized comparison of bupivacaine to liposomal bupivacaine given by local injection at all the wound sites in patients undergoing robotic-assisted or laparoscopic urologic surgeries in an effort to determine which method reduced postoperative opioid use the most.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Liposomal Bupivacaine Versus 0.25% Bupivacaine for Laparoscopic Urologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liposomal bupivacaine was developed to extend the duration of efficacy of bupivacaine from the typical 6 - 8 hours up to 72 hours. The prolonged duration of liposomal bupivacaine was initially demonstrated in mice in 1994. Two randomized controlled trials using liposomal bupivacaine for bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy resulted in FDA approval for its use in humans. More recently, liposomal bupivacaine has also been found to improve pain control for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Infiltration of a local anesthetic into laparoscopic port sites is a common practice that has been shown in some studies to improve postoperative pain. To compare liposomal bupivacaine and 0.25% bupivacaine for local analgesia following laparoscopic and robotic urologic surgery, a randomized comparison-controlled trial was performed.</detailed_description>
