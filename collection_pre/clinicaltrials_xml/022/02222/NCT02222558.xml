	<brief_title>Oral Testosterone for the Treatment of Hypogonadism in Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of testosterone after administration of TSX-002 (easy to swallow testosterone capsules) to hypogonadal men. This will be determined by blood sampling at specified times during the study. The study is also intended to evaluate the PK parameters of the testosterone metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as the safety and tolerability of TSX-002. The study consists of three (3) periods, for which TSX-002 will be taken orally at various doses. Study duration is approximately 9 weeks.</detailed_description>
