	<brief_summary>Off pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB) still requires myocardial protection owing to intermittent regional ischemic episode. The investigators retrospectively evaluated the cardioprotective and clinical outcomes of propofol versus isoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing OPCAB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volatile Versus Propofol Anesthesia in OPCAB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several experimental and clinical researches have suggested that volatile anesthetics may reduce mortality in cardiac surgery owing to its preconditioning induced cardioprotective effect. Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB) surgery still requires cardioprotective strategies due to coronary hypoperfusion during anastomosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible cardioprotective effect and clinical outcomes of propofol versus isoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing OPCAB using propensity matching.</detailed_description>
