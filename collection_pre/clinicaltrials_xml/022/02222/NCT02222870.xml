	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the 2014-2015 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, administered in a 1- or 2-dose schedule, in accordance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age. Objective: - To describe the safety of the 2014-2015 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, administered in a 1- or 2-dose schedule, in accordance with ACIP recommendations, in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age. Observational objectives: - To describe the immunogenicity of the 2014-2015 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, administered in a 1- or 2-dose schedule in accordance with ACIP recommendations, in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age. - To submit available sera from each subject to Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for further analysis by the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support formulation recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Among Healthy Children Receiving Fluzone® Quadrivalent, Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be assigned to the appropriate age group based on the age at the time of enrollment. Participants will receive a dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine, those for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per ACIP guidance, will receive a second dose during Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1). Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited AE information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2, or to Visit 3 for those subjects receiving 2 doses. Serious adverse event (SAE) information will be collected the study. Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all participants prior to vaccination and at Day 28 after the final vaccination.</detailed_description>

Known systemic hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken proteins, or any of the vaccine components, or a history of a lifethreatening reaction to Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances (the complete list of vaccine components is included in the Prescribing Information). History of serious adverse reaction to any influenza vaccine. Receipt of any vaccine within 30 days before receiving study vaccine, or plans to receive another vaccine before Visit 2 for subjects receiving 1 dose of influenza vaccine or Visit 3 for subjects receiving 2 doses of influenza vaccine. Participation in another interventional clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 30 days preceding the first study vaccination or during the course of the study unless no intervention for the other study occurred within the 30 days prior to the first study vaccination and none are planned before the subject would complete safety surveillance for the present study. Prior vaccination with any formulation of 20142015 influenza vaccine. Bleeding disorder or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, which may be a contraindication for intramuscular vaccination, at the discretion of the Investigator. Thrombocytopenia, which may be a contraindication for intramuscular vaccination, at the discretion of the Investigator. Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a health risk to the subject if enrolled or could interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine. Personal history of GuillainBarré Syndrome. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months). Personal history of clinically significant developmental delay (at the discretion of the Investigator), neurologic disorder, or seizure disorder. Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion. Known seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided. Receipt of immune globulins, blood, or bloodderived products in the past 3 months. Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or an employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
