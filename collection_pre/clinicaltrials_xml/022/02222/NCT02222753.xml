	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer incidence is increasing at an alarming rate in China. Recent reports concluded aberrant immunological function was associated with colorectal cancer outcome, however, the influence of immunocyte subgroup and immunologic factors on cancer outcome in colorectal cancer survivors is largely unknown.The investigators will explore the impact of immunocyte subgroup and immunologic factors on colorectal cancer disease-specific, disease-free and overall survival. The investigators will recruit approximately 5,000 patients as a prospective study cohort. During follow up, the investigators will explore the association of these factors with outcome of patients. The investigators believe that this project will improve the understanding of the impact of immunocyte subgroup and immunologic factors on colorectal cancer outcome.</brief_summary>
