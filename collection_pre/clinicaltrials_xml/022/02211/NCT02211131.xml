	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Talimogene Laherparepvec Neoadjuvant Treatment Plus Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label study to estimate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec as a neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery compared to surgery alone in subjects with completely resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a melanoma. Arm 1: Talimogene laherparepvec for 6 doses followed by surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s). Arm 2: Immediate surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) Following surgery, adjuvant systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy may be administered at the investigator's discretion and per the institutional standard of care. Subjects will be followed for safety approximately 30 (+15) days after surgery and for disease recurrence, subsequent anticancer therapy, and survival every 3 months (±30 days) for first 3 years after the end of the safety follow-up period and then every 6 months (±30 days) until death, subject withdraws full consent, or up to 5 years after the last subject is randomized.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB, IIIC or IVM1a melanoma eligible for complete surgical resection. Prior systemic, regional and radiation anticancer therapies for melanoma must have been completed at least 3 months prior to randomization. Subject must have measurable disease and must be a candidate for intralesional therapy with at least one injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion (≥ 10 mm in longest diameter) or with multiple injectable lesions that in aggregate have a longest diameter of ≥ 10 mm. Subject must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and must have a serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≤ 1.0 X upper limit of normal and adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal, and coagulation organ function Other criteria may apply Subject must not have primary ocular or mucosal melanoma, or history or evidence of melanoma associated with immunodeficiency states (eg, hereditary immune deficiency, organ transplant, or leukemia). Subject must not have history or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other symptomatic autoimmune disease. Subject must not have evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression or active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV1) infection (eg, herpetic keratitis or encephalitis) and must not require intermittent or chronic systemic treatment with an antiherpetic drug (eg, acyclovir), other than intermittent topical use. Subject known to have acute or chronic active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus infection will also be excluded. Subject must not have been treated previously with talimogene laherparepvec or tumor vaccine. Other criteria may apply</criteria>
