	<brief_summary>A thin tube, called a ureteral stent, is inserted into the ureter and is commonly used as treatment of urinary stone disease. Stents are designed to help provide drainage of the kidney in the setting of an obstructing stone, or postoperative swelling of the ureter. Though their presence is only temporary, stents are associated with a significant amount of patient discomfort and bother, which can negatively impact overall satisfaction. Over the past decades, there have been refinements in stent technology and usage philosophy. Smaller and softer stents are now available for use in patients, though studies evaluating the relative benefits have been conflicting. The investigators aim to evaluate the effect of stent size and composition upon outcomes after the treatment of stone disease, including patient comfort and satisfaction.</brief_summary>
