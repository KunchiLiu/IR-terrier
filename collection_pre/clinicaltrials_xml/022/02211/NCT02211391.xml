	<brief_summary>Single macronutrients will be consumed before sleep by obese men. Overnight lipolysis will be measured with the microdialysis technique by measuring glycerol concentration and blood flow in abdominal adipose tissue. Morning fat oxidation will be measured with indirect calorimetry. The investigators hypothesize that carbohydrate intake will blunt the overnight lipolysis rate compared to casein protein and a non-caloric placebo. The investigators also hypothesize that casein and placebo will not be significantly different from each other in terms of overnight lipolysis.</brief_summary>
