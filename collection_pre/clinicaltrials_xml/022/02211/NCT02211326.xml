	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the international pharmacogenetic algorithm is better than the standard initiation dosing and whether the two algorithms are suitable for Chinese elderly patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genotype-guided Warfarin Individualized Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study protocol is a multicenter, randomized, patient-blinded and controlled trial, comparing two approaches among 864 enrolled AF(atrial fibrillation) or DVT(deep venous thrombosis) patients for guiding warfarin initial anticoagulation in Chinese elderly patients: the intervention group using the algorithm of International Warfarin Pharmacogenetic Consortium and its dose revision, and the control group using a standard initiation dose (2.25 mg).The study hypothesis is that the intervention group relative to the control group will increase the percentage of time in therapeutic INR (international normalized ratio) range during the first 3 months.This trial is the first prospective large-scale randomized controlled trial for elders in China. It is of great significance for promoting special crowd individualization of anticoagulants at home and abroad.</detailed_description>
