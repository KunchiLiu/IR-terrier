	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of a Home-based Physical Activity Intervention for Family Caregivers of People With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Families play an essential role in the care of people with advanced cancer and usually undertake caregiving responsibilities for patients at home. While caregiving is often rewarding, the physical and emotional demands of caregiving have significant impacts on caregivers' health, including a wide range of emotional responses and high levels of fatigue. Caregivers' own health is important and their ability to continue to provide care also necessitates that their self-care needs are met. However, few supportive interventions have been developed specifically to address these needs. One way of doing so may be increasing physical activity. The physical and psychological benefits of physical activity are well documented. A lifestyle approach to physical activity can be tailored to the needs, preferences, and circumstances of the individual and is therefore a logical way to address some of the self-care needs of caregivers within the context of their personal caregiving situation. The main objectives of this pilot study are to develop an individually tailored home-based physical activity intervention for family caregivers of people with advanced cancer and assess the feasibility of a future randomized controlled trial to test the effect of this intervention on caregivers' positive and negative affect, fatigue, and overall self-rated health.</detailed_description>
