	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the study is to determine if there is a difference in pain levels following the use of low level laser therapy versus placebo and control after placement of elastomeric orthodontic separators in pediatric patients. To test this, the investigators will assess the patient's pain levels immediately following separator placement and 24 hours post-operatively but having patients rate their pain on a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: treatment, placebo, and control. The aim of this study is to establish whether or not low level laser therapy can be used to reduce pain in pediatric patients following separator placement.</brief_summary>
