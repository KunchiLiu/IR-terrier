	<brief_summary>Dapagliflozin is a highly selective, reversible and potent inhibitor of the sodium-glucose-linked Transporter 2 (SGLT2), which was successfully investigated for its use as a treatment option in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect of dapagliflozin is an increased glucosuria, and it was shown that mean blood glucose concentrations and postprandial glucose excursion in special were significantly reduced in type 2 diabetic patients. Due to its mechanism-of action it seems likely that also type 1 diabetic patients will benefit from dapagliflozin. The present study is focused on the effects of dapagliflozin on fasting glucose homeostasis and postprandial glucose excursion in male type 1diabetic patients. Participants will subsequently receive 10 milligrams of dapagliflozin and placebo for 3 days (equals 2 x 30mg per cross-over period) in a double-blind, randomised, cross-over design. The effects will be measured via euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies (fasting glucose homeostasis) and euglycemic oral glucose tolerance clamp tests (postprandial glucose excursions).</brief_summary>
