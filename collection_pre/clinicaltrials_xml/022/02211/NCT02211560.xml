Male or female with a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) 3. Male or female with a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as defined by Peterson, according to The following: 3.1 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale total score (CDR) ≤0.5, and score of each one of the six categories ("box scores") ≤ 1. 3.2 Mini Mental State Exam &gt; 24 3.3 Verbal PairedAssociated Learning test score according to the following ages: Ages 6570 less than or equal to 18 Ages 7185* less than or equal to 17 *Eligibility of subjects aged between 70 and 71 (i.e., 70.1) will be evaluated according to 7185 age group score. 4. Adequate vision, hearing, and literacy ability to allow for neuropsychological testing. 5. Able and willing to perform all study procedures. 6. Ability to provide written consent signed by the subject 1. Any significant neurological condition or disorder (e.g., seizure disorder, epilepsy, brain tumors, stroke, etc.) that could cause cognitive deterioration other than suspected MCI. 2. Any medical condition or disorder that could produce cognitive deterioration (i.e., renal, respiratory, cardiac, and hepatic disease, diabetes mellitus, endocrine, metabolic or hematological disturbances) unless well controlled for at least 3 months. 3. Clinically significant abnormal serum TSH and/or B12 and/or folic acid levels below the normal range. 4. History of any infective or inflammatory brain disease including viral, fungal or syphilitic etiologies. 5. Head trauma or injury immediately preceding cognitive deterioration, unless over 2 years have passed since full cognitive and functional recovery. 6. Depression at screening as assessed by Geriatric Depression Scaleshort version (score ≥5) 7. Current suicidality at screening by Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale. 8. Dementia by DSMIV criteria. 9. Concomitant use of medications with potent psychotropic properties (e.g. antipsychotics, ADHD treatments, lithium carbonate, antiepileptic drugs such as Gabapentin). Sedating antihistamines are allowed if administered last dose is administered at least 12 hours before cognitive testing. Usage of prescription or nonprescription antidepressant agents, lipid lowering medications, and antihypertensive medications with a stable dosage for more than 2 months prior study entry is permitted. 10. Concomitant use of any medications approved for the symptomatic treatment of dementia due to AD (e.g., NMDA, acetyl choline esterase inhibitors) 11. Use within 3 weeks prior to study entry of any medications with any anticholinergic effect (e.g. Atropine, Scopolamine, Tolterodine, Hyoscyamine, Biperiden, Benzatropine, Trihexyphenidyl, Oxybutynin). 12. Use within 4 weeks prior to the study entry of dietary supplements containing DHA, EPA, Phosphatidylserine, Phosphatidylcholine (e.g. Krill oil, Lecithin), or alphaglycerphosphocholine (GPC). 13. Use within 4 weeks prior to the study entry of medical foods indicated for cognitive or memory impairment [e.g. Axona, Cerefolin, CerefolinNAC, Souvenaid]. 14. Concomitant use of any supplements containing ingredients with nootropic or vasodilator properties (e.g., Ginkgo Biloba, Vinpocetine, Piracetam, high energy supplements). 15. Use of an investigational drug within the last 30 days. 16. Allergic reaction or sensitivity to marine products (fish/seafood) and/or soy. 17. Any known condition which in the opinion of the investigator may be possibly causing cognitive impairment other than AD (mania, alcohol or substance abuse, mental retardation, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, major psychiatric disorder preceding dementia onset or affecting brain function, major surgery ) and/or limits the successful trial completion</criteria>
