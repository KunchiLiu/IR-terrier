	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TRV734 given as a single dose (Part A) and as multiple ascending doses (Part B) in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability, PD and PK Study in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be conducted in two-parts enrolling a total of approximately 72 healthy volunteers. - Part A will assess the safety, tolerability, PD and PK of a 125mg dose of TRV734 in an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover study in which subjects are fasted, fed a standard meal, or fed a high-fat meal. - Part B of the trial will assess the safety, tolerability, PD and PK of multiple ascending doses of TRV734 in a double blind, double dummy, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled, adaptive study. Oxycodone immediate release (IR) 10 mg will be used as a benchmark.</detailed_description>
