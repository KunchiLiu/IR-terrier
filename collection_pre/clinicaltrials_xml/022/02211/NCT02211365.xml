	<brief_summary>The Registro Campania Salute Network (RCSN) is a prospective registry aimed at improving the management of essential hypertension by integrating the activity of general practitioners (GPs) with that of the hypertension specialist. It involves selected GPs homogeneously allocated in the regional area, and the Hypertension Clinic of the Federico II University in Naples, which served as co-ordinating centre. Through the RCSN system it is possible to store clinical data detected at each visit between the peripheral units and the co-ordinating centre and to support scientific analysis of the dataset.</brief_summary>
