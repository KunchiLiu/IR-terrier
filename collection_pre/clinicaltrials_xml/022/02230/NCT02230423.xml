	<brief_summary>This study investigates wether patients with increased trigeminal perception threshold and low expression of TRP channels have more often nasal blockage despite functionally successful nasal surgery (TRP channel = transient receptor potential channel).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trigeminal Endonasal Perception: A Predictor for Septoplasty Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to find out wether patients with high trigeminal perception threshold (=decreased intranasal sensibility) and low expression of TRP channels of the mucosa suffer more often from impaired nasal breathing after surgery. This could lead to the identification of prognostic factors and therefore prevention of nasal surgery with bad outcome. Further, differences between patients with empty nose syndrome and asymptomatic patients after extended intranasal surgery, concerning trigeminal perception and TRP channel expression will be investigated.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergoing a primary septoplasty and/or turbinoplasty Patients suffering from empty nose syndrome after measurably successful nasal surgery Patients with removed turbinates and/or septum, not suffering from ENS (i.e. tumor patients) Patients with known neurologic disorders that could compromise perception threshold measurements Patients with known allergies/intolerance to test agents that are used to measure perception thresholds (Cineol=Eucalypt; Menthol, CO2= Carbon Dioxide) Inability to judge or understand the testing or the informed consent</criteria>
