	<brief_summary>This is an open-label phase I/II multi-center study consisting of two parts. Part A of this study is designed to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lapatinib combined with trametinib in patients with metastatic KRASm and PIK3CA wild-type (PIK3CAwt), CRC, NSCLC, or pancreatic cancer. Part B is designed to perform a randomized comparison of the lapatinib-trametinib combination versus standard of care therapy in patients with metastatic KRASm/PIK3CAwt CRC, NSCLC or pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
