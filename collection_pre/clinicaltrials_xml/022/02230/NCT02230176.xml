	<brief_summary>This study is the first randomized, open-label, national, multicenter, phase II study assessing the efficacy and safety of OCLU in subjects with pretreated progressive pancreatic, inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, well differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (WDpNET). Subjects must have experienced documented progression of disease within 1 year prior to the start of the study. The control group of patients receiving Sutent will be used as internal control to assess the hypothesis of 12 months PFS equal to 35% in patients receiving Sutent.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically proven and reviewed well differentiated malignant pancreatic sporadic NET Metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection At least 2/3 of RECIST lesions, including measurable and non measurable lesions should be positive (grade of uptake at SRS ≥ 2 : equal to the liver or more) at somatostatin receptor scintigraphy within 24 weeks prior to enrollment. Post first line whatever the type of systemic therapy: cytotoxic chemotherapy or everolimus or somatostatine analogs. In case Sandostatine LAR or Somatuline therapies were given for anti tumoral purpose, attempt should be made to demonstrate the progression under sandostatine LAR 30 mg or Somatuline LP 120 alone. Evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix 2) Progressing disease within 12 months prior to randomization according to RECIST 1.1 criteria ; ECOG performance status 02 (appendix 9) Life expectancy ≥ 6 months as prognosticated by the physician Age ≥ 18 years, no superior limit Adequate bone marrow reserve (Hb &gt; 8, neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm³ and platelets ≥80.000/mm^3) Effective contraception in premenopausal female and male patients during and for at least 6 months posttreatment. Patient´s signed written informed consent Ability to comply with the protocol procedures Ability to take oral medication Patient affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same. Large or small cellpoorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor according to WHO 2010 classification Any patient receiving treatment with shortacting Octreotide, which cannot be interrupted for 24 h before and 24 h after the administration of 177LuDOTA0Tyr3Octreotate, or any patient receiving treatment with Octreotide LAR, which cannot be interrupted for at least 6 weeks before the administration of 177LuDOTA0Tyr3Octreotate, unless OctreoScan® imaging during continued Octreotide treatment is in accordance with the inclusion criteria n°2. More than one line of cytotoxic chemotherapy (a patient who received the same molecules of cytotoxic chemotherapy at several times during therapeutic management is considered to have benefit from one single line of cytotoxic chemotherapy) Prior external beam radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow Urinary incontinence History of prior malignancy, except for cured nonmelanoma skin cancer, cured in situ cervical carcinoma, or other treated malignancies with no evidence of disease for at least five years. Severe renal (measured GFR according to MDRD &lt;50ml/mn or nephrotic syndrome) or hepatic insufficiency (ALT / AST &gt; 2.5 x ULN or ALT/AST &gt;5 x ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to the underlying malignancy and/or total serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN) Serum albumin &lt;3.0 g/dL unless prothrombin time is within the normal range. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by a fasting blood glucose above 2 ULN Decompensated heart failure (ejection fraction &lt;45%), myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism or revascularization procedure,unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, and clinically significant bradycardia during the last 12 months. Hypertension that cannot be controlled despite medications (&gt;=160/95 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy) Abnormal cardiac function with 12 lead ECG. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTC grade 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the QTc interval to &gt;470 msec for males or &gt;480 msec for females. Brain metastases (unless these metastases have been treated and stabilized for at least 24 weeks, prior to enrolment in the study. Patients with a history of brain metastases must have a head CTscan with contrast or MRI to document stable disease prior to enrolment in the study.) Pregnancy or breast feeding (see appendix 6) Previous treatment with the drugs under study. Prior systemic treatment with any tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antiVEGF angiogenic inhibitors. Current treatment with another investigational drug. Treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers within 7 and 12 days, respectively prior to study drug administration. Concomitant treatment with therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. Low dose warfarin (Coumadin) up to 2 mg PO daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed as well as heparinbased anticoagulation Prior treatments with chemotherapy or immunotherapy or somatostatine analog therapy drug (except in case of functioning syndrome for somatostatine analogue therapy) or thoracic radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to start of treatment Major surgery for any cause or local radiotherapy within one month prior to start of treatment Liver embolisation therapy within the last 3 months prior start of treatment except if progression is demonstrated and embolised lesion not used as targets Unrecovered toxicity from any kind of therapy Active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled disease that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration,or which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study</criteria>
