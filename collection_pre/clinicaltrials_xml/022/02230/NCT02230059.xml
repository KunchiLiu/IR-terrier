Additionally, participant's demographic and clinical characteristics, skeletal-related events, criteria used to define CRPC, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and pain related to disease and overall survival will be observed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Treatment Patterns in Metastatic Castration-Resistance Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational (study in which participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes), longitudinal (correlational research study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time) and retrospective (study looking back over past experience) study to describe the treatment patterns in mCRPC. Treatment patterns will be assessed by collecting medical charts from participants diagnosed with mCRPC in or prior 2009. Primarily, percentage of participants who received therapy as first line treatment will be assessed. All adverse events associated with the use of Sponsor drugs will be reported.</detailed_description>
