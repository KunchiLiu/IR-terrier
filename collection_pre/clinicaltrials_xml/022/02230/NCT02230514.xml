	<brief_summary>The present study evaluates the effect of XCEL-MT-OSTEO-ALPHA in non-union fractures (pseudoarthrosis) of long bones in comparison to the standard treatment of autologous iliac crest. XCEL-MT-OSTEO-ALPHA is a tissue engineering product composed by "ex-vivo" expanded autologous mesenchymal stromal cells fixed in allogenic bone tissue, produced by Xcelia (Blood and Tissue Bank of Catalonia). The working hypothesis proposes that the tissue engineering is a valid and useful technique to achieve bone regeneration up to consolidation of non-union fractures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A phase IIa, single center, prospective, randomized, parallel, two-arms, single-dose, open-label with blinded assessor pilot clinical trial to assess ex vivo expanded adult autologous mesenchymal stromal cells fixed in allogeneic bone tissue (XCEL-MT-OSTEO-ALPHA) in non hypertrophic pseudoarthrosis of long bones.</detailed_description>
