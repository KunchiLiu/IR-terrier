	<brief_summary>This protocol describes a single site mechanistic study to investigate microRNAs (miRNAs) that are differentially expressed in the airway epithelium of patients with asthma at baseline and in response to allergen challenge. We hypothesize that allergen exposure enhances airway smooth muscle contractility and epithelial cell mRNA/miRNA production as a consequence of locally increased T-cell derived cytokine production. The study will involve three visits over the course of approximately 14 days. At Visit 1, participants will be characterized in detail with lung function testing, methacholine challenge testing, and allergen skin prick testing. At Visit 2, participants will undergo bronchoscopy with segmental allergen administration of either cat or dust mite standardized allergen extract. At Visit 3 (either 24 hours later or 7 days later), bronchoscopy will be performed to collect airway samples including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), epithelial brushings and endobronchial biopsies. Sample analysis will include measurement of miRNA and mRNA expression in epithelial brushings (RNAseq and qPCR); analysis of cell surface markers on BAL cells and blood cells; and collection of endobronchial biopsies for immunostaining of immune cells localization, immunoblotting of smooth cell protein phosphorylation, analysis of mucin content and smooth muscle cell subculture. A total of 38 subjects (26 asthmatics with stable or well-controlled asthma, 6 allergic non-asthmatics and 6 non-allergic non-asthmatics) will complete the study.</brief_summary>
