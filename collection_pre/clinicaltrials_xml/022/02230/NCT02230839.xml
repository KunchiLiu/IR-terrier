	<brief_title>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Aging (Mirage)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives: 1. To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without the addition of exercise on mitochondrial biogenesis and energetic capacity, cellular redox state and insulin resistance. 2. To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without the addition of exercise on intramyocellular lipid profiles. 3. To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without exercise on skeletal muscle proteins mediating a program of autophagy and either loss or maintenance of muscle mass.</detailed_description>
