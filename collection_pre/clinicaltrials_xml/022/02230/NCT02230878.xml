	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time), dose-proportionality, accumulation, urinary excretion, pharmacodynamics (the study of how drugs act on the body) and sedative effects of JNJ-42847922 in healthy male and female participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-42847922 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, double blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participants is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo controlled, multiple ascending dose study. The study will consist of 3 parts: a Screening period (Days -21 to -2), a Double-blind treatment period (Day -1 to Day 11), and a Follow-up period (within 7 to 14 days after last dose administration). In double blind treatment period, participants will be randomly assigned to 5, 10, 20, and 40 milligram (mg) or placebo. Number of participants with any clinically relevant changes (adverse events [AEs], laboratory results,electrocardiogram [ECG], Vital signs, Physical and neurological, sedation &amp; concentration) and columbia suicide severity rating (CSSR) scale will be evaluated as primary outcome measure. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Women should not be of child bearing potential due to either tubal ligation or hysterectomy or who are postmenopausal (no spontaneous menses for at least 2 years Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) inclusive (BMI=weight/height^2) Participants must be healthy / medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, retesting of an abnormal lab value(s) that may lead to exclusion will be allowed once during the screening phase Nonsmokers (not smoked for 6 months prior to screening) Participant must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis at screening or admission Clinically significant abnormal physical or neurological examination, vital signs or 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or admission History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematological disease, lipid abnormalities, bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, infection, or any other illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies Subjects with a relevant history of a suicide attempt or suicidal behavior. Any recent suicidal ideation within the last 6 months (a level of 4 or 5), or who are at significant risk to commit suicide, as judged by the investigator using the columbia suicide severity rating score (CSSRS)</criteria>
