	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Denmark, and ischemic heart disease accounts for the bulk of it. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether a mechanical method of remote ischemic conditioning in the form of short-term obstruction of the blood supply to the arm, can improve the heart's blood supply in patients with ischemic heart disease. This will be attempted through experiments on patients with ischemic heart disease and experimental animal studies with simulated cardiovascular disease. This study will help to clarify whether remote ischemic preconditioning can be used to treat patients with ischemic heart disease.</brief_summary>
