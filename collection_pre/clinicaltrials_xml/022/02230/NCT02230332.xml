	<brief_summary>Beta-2-agonists are effective in reducing airway narrowing in asthma and protecting against stimuli that produce bronchoconstriction. The combination of long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has become the most commonly used asthma controller medication class in the United States, but unfortunately, even when LABAs are added to ICS and used regularly, 58-81% of patients with asthma fail to achieve total control. Regular use of beta-agonists, both short and long-acting, reduces the ability of these agents to protect against the airway narrowing that occurs in asthma in response to bronchoconstrictor stimuli. We refer to this reduced effect as loss of bronchoprotection. In this proof of concept trial we aim to determine if alendronate, which diminishes beta-2 adrenergic receptor internalization, can reduce the loss of bronchoprotection that occurs with regular use of LABAs, even when used in combination with ICS.</brief_summary>
