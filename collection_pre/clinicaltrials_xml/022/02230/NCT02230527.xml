	<brief_summary>This is a single center, prospective, randomized, unblinded, open-label, active controlled pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin versus clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with Rutherford Stage IV to VI PAD that have undergone a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the lower extremities in the past 2 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrollment into the study will require severe symptomatic CLI without wounds (Rutherford Stage IV) or CLI with concomitant vascular insufficiency wounds (Rutherford Stage V-VI PAD). Potential participants will be identified and screened prior to discharge or at the time of the first out-patient visit (within 2 weeks after discharge) after a percutaneous lower extremity arterial angiography with arterial intervention (stent or balloon angioplasty) for the presence of lower extremity vascular insufficiency. Participants will be classified as Rutherford Class IV - VI (with or without ulcerations). A total of 60 patients will be randomized into 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (ticagrelor to clopidogrel). Patients are placed on clopidogrel after their arterial intervention per standard of care. They will remain on clopidogrel up to the time that randomization occurs. For patients that are randomized to ticagrelor, the clopidogrel will be stopped. Patients will be randomized to either ticagrelor 90mg by mouth twice daily or clopidogrel 75mg by mouth daily.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adults age 18100 years with Rutherford Classification Stage IV through VI PAD with a recent percutaneous lower extremity arterial angiography with arterial intervention in the past 2 weeks 2. Willingness to sign informed consent 3. Ability to return for follow up visits 4. A female patient of childbearing potential who is sexually active must agree to use adequate contraception from screening until 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as those who have surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or who are post menopausal (defined as at least 2 years since last regular menses). The female patient should not be lactating and must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Patients will be ineligible for this study if they meet any one of the following criteria: 1. Intolerance to thienopyridines 2. Hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or any component of the product. 3. Concomitant use of oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonist, factor Xa inhibitor, or direct thrombin inhibitor 4. History of intracranial hemorrhage 5. History of severe hepatic impairment defined by baseline transaminase greater than or equal to 3x ULN or any elevation in bilirubin 6. Active bleeding 7. Allergy to aspirin 8. Baseline TcPO2 &lt; 10 mmHg post angiography 9. Resting, pre procedure heart rate &lt;50 beatsperminute without a permanent pacemaker and not on an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent 10. Severe COPD on home oxygen therapy</criteria>
