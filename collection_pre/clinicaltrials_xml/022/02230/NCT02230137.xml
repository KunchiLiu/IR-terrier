	<brief_title>Text Message for Adolescents With Poorly Controlled Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2010, the number of children with type 1 diabetes in France is estimated at 12,000 with 60% of them aged 12 to 17 years. Compliance is a major issue during adolescence. Mobile text message is one of the strategies to enhance adherence. The main aim of this study is to assess HbA1c reduction after a 6 month SMS support among adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Adherence and quality of life will also be assessed at the end of the trial. This study is a prospective randomized monocentric trial. Sixty adolescents with type 1 diabetes and HbA1c equal or higher than 8.5 % will be randomized according to the method of Zelen in two groups : standard treatment versus standard treatment plus support by SMS. The patients will receive one SMS before each injection of insulin.</detailed_description>
