	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Drain Removal After Pancreatectomy: A Randomized Prospective Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to analyze the association between the time of removal of drain after pancreatic resection and incidence of intra-abdominal complications, such as intra-abdominal infection and pancreatic leakage. We design a prospective randomized study. Patients with pancreatic and periampullar tumors who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) are recruited to the study if amylase value in drain(s) is less than 5000 U/L on postoperative day (POD) 1. After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients are randomly allocated to early or late drain removal group on POD 3. In the group A, drain(s) are removed on POD 3, whereas in group B drain is removed on POD 4 or beyond. The primary outcomes are the incidence of intra-abdominal infection and pancreatic fistula; the secondary outcomes include intra-abdominal bleeding, delayed gastric emptying, pulmonary complications, and length of hospital stay.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age: &gt;18yr, &lt;75yr Patients with pancreatic diseases (including tumor and inflammatory disease) or nonpancreatic tumors (biliary duct cancer or ampullary tumor) who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) The amylase value in drain(s) is less than 5000 U/L on postoperative day 1 and 3. Reconstruction of the pancreatic remnant by pancreaticogastrostomy Intraabdominal hemorrhage within 72 hours after operation Biliary fistula (output of biliary fluid from at least 1 abdominal drain) within 72 hours after operation Chylous leakage (milky water) within 72 hours after operation The volume of drain effluent (ascites) is greater than 300 ml within 72 hours after operation.</criteria>
