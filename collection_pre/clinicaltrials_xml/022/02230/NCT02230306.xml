	<criteria>Signed informed consent Histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (Stage IV), carrying BRAF V600mutation Melanoma must be documented to contain a BRAFV600 mutation by a CLIA approved laboratory At least one measurable intracranial target lesion for which all of the following criteria are met: 1. previously untreated or progressive according to RECIST 1.1 (equal to or greater than 20% increase in longest diameter on baseline scan) after previous local therapy (SRS and/or craniotomy) 2. immediate local therapy clinically not indicated or patient is not a suitable candidate to receive immediate local therapy (SRS and/or craniotomy) 3. largest diameter of ≥ 0.5cm but ≤ 4 cm as determined by contrastenhanced MRI Prior therapies for extracranial metastatic melanoma including chemo, cytokine, immuno, biological and vaccinetherapy will be allowed but prior BRAF or MEK not allowed ECOG PS 02 Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks Age 18 years or older Adequate bone marrow function as indicated by the following: 1. ANC &gt; 1500/µL 2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL 3. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate renal function, as indicated by creatinine =/&lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) Adequate liver function, as indicated by bilirubin =/&lt; 1.5 x ULN AST or ALT &lt; 3 x ULN (patients with documented liver metastases: AST and/or ALT =/&lt; 5 x ULN) Able to swallow pills Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in premenopausal women. Women of nonchildbearing potential may be included without serum pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intrauterine devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) Active infection Prior therapy with BRAFi and/or MEKi Leptomeningeal disease Symptomatic brain metastases requiring immediate local interventions such as craniotomy or SRS Increasing corticosteroid dose in 7 days prior to administration of first dose of study drug. Symptomatic patients that have stable or decreasing corticosteroid use in the past 7 days will be allowed Current use of therapeutic warfarin Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI v4.0) [NCI, 2009] Grade 2 or higher from previous anticancer therapy, except alopecia Conditions that will interfere significantly with the absorption of drugs Inability to undergo MRI secondary to metal, claustrophobia, Gadolinium Contrast allergy Pregnant, lactating, or breast feeding women Prior radiation therapy within the last 14 days Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last 5 years, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Unwillingness or inability to comply with study and followup procedures The following foods/supplements are prohibited at least 7 days prior to initiation of and during study treatment: 1. St. John's wort or hyperforin 2. Grapefruit juice History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration Uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressures &gt; 21mmHg Serum cholesterol ≥ Grade 2 Hypertriglyceridemia ≥ Grade 2 Hyperglycemia (fasting) ≥ Grade 2 History of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction, including the following: 1. Current unstable angina 2. Current symptomatic congestive heart failure of NYHA class 2 or higher 3. History of congenital long QT syndrome or mean QTcF &gt; 450 msec at baseline or uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities 4. Uncontrolled hypertension ≥ Grade 2 (patients with a history hypertension controlled with antihypertensives to ≤ Grade 1 are eligible) 5. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 50% 6. Uncontrolled Arrhythmias 7. Myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the previous 6 months</criteria>
