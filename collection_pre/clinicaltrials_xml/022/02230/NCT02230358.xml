	<brief_title>Cardiac Output and Duplex Sonography in Carotid Endarterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will investigate the differences between the cardiac output and the cerebral blood-flow between a regional anesthesia (RA) and a general anesthesia (GA) in a randomized, controlled, single center study at the Medical University Innsbruck, Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine. For this purpose patients with the need of a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) will be included and randomized either to the regional anesthesia (RA) or the general anesthesia (GA) group until a patient number of 45 in each group is achieved. The cardiac output and cerebral blood-flow via trans-cranial Doppler (TCD) will be measured at 6 time points: - T0 Baseline (after insertion of an arterial line) - T1 After induction of anesthesia, but before surgical start - T2 Two minutes after clamping the carotid artery - T3 Two minutes after shunt insertation of the carotid artery - T4 After reperfusion - T5 After completion of the skin suture</detailed_description>
