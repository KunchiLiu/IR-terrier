	<brief_summary>This clinical study will use the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) to generate allergic rhinitis symptoms in participants under controlled conditions, to collect well-characterized biological samples (urine and blood) before and after they develop these symptoms. The EEU provides the ability to control the timing, duration and levels of allergen exposure, and also other outside environmental factors, yielding ideal biologic samples for analysis with novel, cutting-edge molecular techniques. Results from the analysis of these unique allergic rhinitis samples should help determine if the technique of urine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis could be a useful diagnostic tool in allergic rhinitis. IgE testing will be done on blood samples and compared to spin prick testing and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant is a healthy, ambulatory male or female volunteer 18 to 55 years of age. Participant has a history of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis due to ragweed for the last two consecutive ragweed seasons. Participant has a positive response (wheal diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm larger than diluent control) to a skin prick test to short ragweed allergen at screening or within 12 months of screening visit. Participant is a female that is pregnant, lactating or actively trying to become pregnant. smokers Participant is unable to comply with the washout periods for prohibited medications. Participant is currently receiving allergen specific immunotherapy injections.</criteria>
