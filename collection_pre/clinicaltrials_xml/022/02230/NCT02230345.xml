	<brief_summary>The important role played by the GI tract microflora on the metabolic health of an individual are increasingly recognized. In this respect, the initial studies of Metchinkoff that suggested a role of fermented food (specifically yoghourts ) to modulate the gut microflora have evolved into the concept of "probiotics". Probiotics are living microorganisms that bring a benefit to the host when administered in sufficient quantity (WHO/FAO, 2001). Here the investigators will study, in normal young male volunteers, the potential to modulate post-prandial metabolic and inflammatory responses by the administration of a yoghourt containing the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Probiotics on the Health of Normal Young Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind and cross-over study designed to evaluate the potential of a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus) to modulate the post prandial metabolic and inflammatory response of normale healthy individuals. After a wash out period during which volunteers will have to follow a diet devoid of all milk or milk-derived products, they will receive, in random order, either a daily dose of the probiotic, or a daily dose of acidified milk (control) for a total of three consecutive weeks. At the end of each of these period, they will be submitted to a day of investigation, during which their metabolic and inflammatory profile will be studied following the ingestion of a standard test meal. The potential for the probiotic to modulate the metabolic and inflammatory parameters will be evaluated. The test meal will provide 1004Kcal under the form of 45.4g proteins (17%), 69g total fatty acids (62%), and 52.6g glucids (21%) as previously published (Schwander et al, J Nut 2014).</detailed_description>
