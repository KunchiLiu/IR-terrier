	<brief_title>PE PREMIER CHINA CLINICAL TRIAL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate clinical and peri-procedural angiographic outcomes for the Promus PREMIERTM Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in the treatment of subjects with atherosclerotic lesion(s) ≤34 mm in length (by visual estimate) in native coronary arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by visual estimate)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical Inclusion (CI) Criteria CI1. Subject must be at least 18 75 years of age CI2. Subject (or legal guardian) understands the trial requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any trialspecific tests or procedures are performed CI3. Subject is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) CI4. Subject has symptomatic coronary artery disease with objective evidence of ischemia or silent ischemia CI5. Subject is an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) CI6. Subject is willing to comply with all protocolrequired followup evaluation CI7. Subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;30% as measured within 60 days prior to enrollment Angiographic Inclusion (AI) Criteria (visual estimate) AI1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥2.25 mm and ≤4.0 mm AI2. Target lesion(s) length must be ≤34 mm ( Target lesion(s) length must be ≤28 mm for reference vessel diameter (RVD) = 2.25 mm Target lesion(s)) (by visual estimate) AI3. Target lesion(s) must have visually estimated stenosis ≥50% and &lt;100% with thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow &gt;1 and one of the following (stenosis ≥70%, abnormal fractional flow reserve (FFR), abnormal stress test or imaging stress test, or elevated biomarkers) prior to procedure AI4. Coronary anatomy is likely to allow delivery of a study device to the target lesions(s) AI5. The first lesion treated must be successfully predilated/pretreated Note: Successful predilatation/pretreatment refers to dilatation with a balloon catheter of appropriate length and diameter, or pretreatment with/or rotational coronary atherectomy, or cutting/scoring balloon with no greater than 50% residual stenosis and no dissection greater than National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI) type C. Clinical Exclusion (CE) Criteria CE1. Subject has clinical symptoms and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with Acute MI (include STEMI and Non STEMI ) within 1 week CE2.

Subject is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy within 30 days before or after the index procedure CE5. Planned PCI (including staged procedures) or CABG after the index procedure CE6. Subject previously treated at any time with intravascular brachytherapy CE7. Subject has a known allergy to contrast (that cannot be adequately premedicated) and/or the trial stent system or protocolrequired concomitant medications (e.g., platinum, platinumchromium alloy, stainless steel, everolimus or structurally related compounds, polymer or individual components, Clopidogrel , or aspirin) CE8. Subject has one of the following (as assessed prior to the index procedure): Other serious medical illness (e.g., cancer, congestive heart failure) with estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) Planned procedure that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound data interpretation CE9. Subject is receiving chronic (≥72 hours) anticoagulation therapy (i.e., heparin, coumadin) for indications other than acute coronary syndrome CE10. Subject with out of range complete blood count (CBC) values that are determined by the study physician to be clinically significant. CE11. Subject has documented or suspected liver disease, including laboratory evidence of hepatitis CE12. Subject is on dialysis or has baseline serum creatinine level &gt;2.0 mg/dL (177µmol/L) CE13. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions CE14. Subject has had a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months CE15. Subject has an active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding CE16. Subject has signs or symptoms of active heart failure (i.e., NYHA class IV) at the time of the index procedure CE17. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device clinical trial that has not reached its primary endpoint CE18. Subject intends to participate in another investigational drug or device clinical trial within 12 months after the index procedure CE19. Subject with known intention to procreate within 12 months after the index procedure (women of childbearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use a reliable method of contraception from the time of screening through 12 months after the index procedure) CE20. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or nursing (a pregnancy test must be performed within 7 days prior to the index procedure in women of childbearing potential) CE21.Target vessel has been treated with any type of PCI (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 12 months prior to the index procedure Angiographic Exclusion (AE) Criteria (visual estimate) AE1. Planned treatment of more than 3 lesions. AE2. Planned treatment of lesions in more than 2 major epicardial vessels AE3. Planned treatment of a single lesion with more than 1 stent AE4. Subject has 2 target lesions in the same vessel that are separated by less than 20 mm (by visual estimate) AE5. Target lesion(s) is located in the left main AE6. Target lesion(s) is located within 3 mm of the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery or left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery by visual estimate. AE7.
