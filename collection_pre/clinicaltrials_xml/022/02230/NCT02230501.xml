	<brief_summary>Formerly, the investigators demonstrated in an uncontrolled proof-of principle study (NCT 01680926) that protein-rich meal replacement (PRMR) was successful in reducing daily insulin demand, HbA1c and weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients injecting &gt;100 IE insulin/day. The aim of the present study was to investigate in a randomized-controlled trial if PRMR is also effective in T2DM patients treated with oral antidiabetic medication or insulin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients had been randomized into two groups. During the 1st week the intervention group with stringent diet regime replaced 3 main meals by 50 g PRMR (Almased-Vitalkost, Almased Wellness GmbH, Bienenbüttel, Germany) each (=1100 kcal/day). In 2nd-4th week 2 meals were replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed. In 5th-12th week only dinner was replaced. The control group with moderate diet regime replaced breakfast and dinner for 4 weeks and then only dinner during the next 8 weeks. Clinical parameters were determined at the study center at baseline, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was reduction of HbA1c, secondary endpoints reduction of weight and antidiabetic medication.</detailed_description>
