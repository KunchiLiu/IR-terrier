	<brief_summary>This study will use a special type of x-ray called radiostereometric analysis (RSA) imaging to determine whether patient-specific instrumentation for total knee arthroplasty (replacement) has an effect on implant loosening compared to conventional instrumentation. Secondary objectives will include assessment of post-operative implant alignment, patient satisfaction, operative time and surgical instrument use, cost, and environmental impact.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Conventional and Patient-specific Instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial which will enroll 50 patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery. All study patients will undergo an MRI prior to surgery. Half (25)of these patients will be randomized to have their MRI used to develop a patient-specific instrument to be used during their surgery. The other half (25) will have conventional instrumentation (CI) used for their knee replacement surgery. All patients will have the same type of knee implant used for their total knee replacement (Genesis II posterior stabilized (Smith &amp; Nephew). Patients will not know which group they have been randomized to. For patients randomized into the patient-specific randomization group, If the surgeon is not happy with the patient-specific instrumentation, they have the option to switch to conventional instrumentation at any time during the surgery. • Length of operation, number of instruments used, amount of OR room waste and number and type of adjustments to the patient specific instrumentation will be tracked. During the surgery, all patients in the study will have tantalum marker beads placed in the bone surrounding their knee replacement. These beads will be used as markers to measure implant fixation over the next two years. All patients will undergo a special type of x-ray imaging called RSA imaging to quantify implant fixation over time. RSA examinations will occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years at the Robart's Research Institute after their standard of care visit with orthopaedic surgeon. Model based RSA software used to measure motion of implant components relative to bone markers. All patients will complete our standard outcome measures in the form of surveys completed at their follow-up visits after surgery. •</detailed_description>
