	<brief_summary>Skin reactions as a result of continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion occur frequently and interfere with the absorption of apomorphine. The histopathology of apomorphine-induced skin reactions is poorly understood. Therefore treatment options are limited and suggestive. Objective: to investigate the efficacy of four treatments including massage, dilution of apomorphine, treatment with topical hydrocortisone and pre-treatment with subcutaneous administered hydrocortisone, in Parkinson's disease patients with apomorphine-induced skin reactions.</brief_summary>
