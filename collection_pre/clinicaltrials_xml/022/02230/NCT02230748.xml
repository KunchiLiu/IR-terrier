	<detailed_description>LAARGE aims to show the care reality of patients whose left atrial appendage (LAA) is closed by an implantable medical device. In particular the following questions should be answered: - Indication: For which reasons is the indication for implantation of LAA-Occluder put for patients with atrial fibrillation? - Safety: How save is the implantation of LAA-Occluders (procedural, in hospital and in the long term course)? How frequent are bleeding complications and what is the relation of observed and expected bleeding complications (according HAS-BLED score)? - Effectiveness: How effective is implantation of LAA-Occluders in daily clinical practice (in hospital and in the long term course)? How frequent are strokes and what is the relation of observed and expected strokes (according CHADS-VASC score)? - Concomitant treatment: Which concomitant treatment is prescribed for patients with LAA-Occluder?</detailed_description>
