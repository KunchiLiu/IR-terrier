	<brief_summary>This is an open labeled, multiple centers, two countries (Taiwan and Korea) non-comparative phase I/II trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In phase I part, a maximum of 33 patients will be recruited in this study. By utilizing a Simon optimal two-stage design, up to 69 patients will be enrolled into this study, while considering the 20% drop-out rate, in order to target 19 response-evaluable patients for the first stage and additional 36 response-evaluable patients for the second stage in phase II part study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Telomelysin (OBP-301) in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screening, each eligible patient will undergo a treatment of OBP-301 within 14 days and will automatically enter follow-up period. The follow-up period is up to 12 weeks after the last injection in the phase I part, and 24 weeks after the last injection in the phase II part. Each patient will return for follow-up visit weekly in the first month after the last injection, and then every 4 weeks up to the end of follow-up period of each phase.</detailed_description>
