	<criteria>1. Male or female patient aged 18 years or more 2. Definite or probable CIDP according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)/Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) guidelines 2010 clinical and neurophysiological criteria Pure motor CIDP, provided that a diagnosis of multifocal motor neuropathy has been ruled out CIDP associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), provided that antiMAG antibodies titer is lower than the used technique's negativity threshold (1000 BTU for Bühlmann ELISA technique) LewisSumner syndrome 3. Score of at least 2 on the adjusted INCAT disability scale 4. Patient who either : 1. has never been previously treated with Ig (Ignaive patient) Or 2. was previously treated with Ig but is in clinical relapse following treatment withdrawal. In the latter case, the last Ig course shall have been administered no less than 3 months prior to screening 1. History of IgA deficiency, unless the absence of antiIgA antibodies has been documented 2. History of cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III/IV), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, unstable ischemic heart disease, or uncontrolled hypertension 3. History of venous thromboembolic disease, myocardial infarction or, cerebrovascular accident 4. Risk factor for blood hyperviscosity such as cryoglobulinemia or haematologic malignancy with monoclonal gammopathy 5. Body mass Index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m² 6. Glomerular filtration rate &lt;80 mL/min/1.73m² measured according to the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) calculation 7. Any other ongoing disease that may cause chronic peripheral neuropathy, such as toxin exposure, dietary deficiency, uncontrolled diabetes, hyperthyroidism, cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective tissue diseases, infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), Lyme disease, multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia, amyloid, and hereditary neuropathy 8. Woman with positive results on a urine pregnancy test or breastfeeding woman or woman of childbearing potential without an effective contraception. 9. Any other serious medical condition that would interfere with the clinical assessment of CIDP or use of I10E or prevent the patient from complying with the protocol requirements 10. Increasing dosage or introduction of a corticotherapy within the last 3 months prior to screening, with oral or systemic corticosteroids at a dose higher than 10 mg daily prednisolone or equivalent. Topical corticosteroids are permitted 11. Treatment within 12 months prior to screening with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant agents (including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, interferonalfa, interferonbeta1a, antiCD20, alemtuzumab, aziathioprine, etanercept, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and haemopoetic stem cell transplantation) 12. Plasma exchange, blood products or derivatives administered within the last 3 months prior to screening 13. Administration of another investigational product within the last month prior to screening</criteria>
