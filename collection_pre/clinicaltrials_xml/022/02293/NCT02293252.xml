	<brief_title>CardioBBEAT - Randomized Controled Trial to Evaluate the Health Economic Impact of Remote Patient Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between January 2010 and June 2013, 621 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% were enrolled and randomly assigned to two study arms comprising usual care and a home telemonitoring group. The 302 patients enrolled in the intervention group are supported by an interactive bi-directional home telemonitoring system (Motiva®) that collects and transfers patient's vital sign data to a dedicated telemedicine data centre. All patients were to remain in the study for one year with an examination at the beginning and both, after 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
