	<brief_summary>American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises minimally invasive methods in gynecological surgery to ensure increased benefits to the patient and reduce potential hospitalization costs. Laparoscopic hysterectomy has become the standard approach in gynecological benign disorders. During laparoscopic hysterectomy, vaginal cuff can be closed with different sutures, techniques and approaches, which is one of the challenges of this surgery. Data is limited on potential impact of different sutures, techniques and approaches for vaginal cuff closure on female sexual function in relation to vaginal length. Various studies in the literature evaluated different approaches (abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted laparoscopic). In addition, for cuff closure, different techniques (interrupted, continuous) and sutures (barbed, Vicryl) were compared. Measures like operation time, cuff healing, complications, cost effectiveness, etc. were usually measured. However, there is no prospective randomized clinical study in the literature that compares laparoscopic approach with vaginal route for cuff closure in terms of female sexual function in relation to vaginal length.</brief_summary>
