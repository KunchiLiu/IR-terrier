	<criteria>A patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this study: 1. The patient has a definitive diagnosis of MPS IIIB, as determined by either of the following: 1. Documented deficiency in alphaNacetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme activity or 2. Documented functionallyrelevant mutations in both alleles of the NAGLU gene. 2. The patient is at least 1 year of age (biological age). 3. The patient or the patient's parent provides informed consent. 4. The patient is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements to the extent that may be expected of a patient with cognitive impairment. In addition to the eligibility criteria above, a patient must meet all of the following criteria for Component 2: 1. The patient meets criterion a or criterion b below. a. The patient is considered to be at risk of rapid disease progression based on at least one of the following criteria: i. The patient has documented mutations of the NAGLU gene that are reported to be linked to rapid disease progression (e.g., disease onset before 6 years of age), or ii. The patient has a sibling, or other first or seconddegree relative with rapidly progressing MPS IIIB (e.g., disease onset before 6 years of age). b. The patient had disease onset prior to 6 years of age (biological age), as defined by: i. cognitive delay evaluated by Bayley Scales of infant development, Third edition (BSIDIII) or Kaufman Assessment Battery for children, second edition (KABCII), or ii. language delay, plateauing or regression of language skills as determined by the investigator (eg. patient uses isolated words, associated words such as two word combination, sentences, poor or reduced language and/or difficult to understand. 2. The patient has an age equivalent of â‰¥1 year on the Vineland II. A patient who meets any of the following exclusion criteria will be ineligible for this study: 1. The patient has visual or hearing impairments sufficient to preclude cooperation with neurodevelopmental testing. 2. The patient has a history of poorlycontrolled seizure disorder. 3. The patient is currently receiving medication which, in the Investigator's opinion, would be likely to substantially confound interpretation of the results (eg. the patient has been on the current dose of psychotropic medication for less than 3 months). 4. The patient is receiving a newly increased dose of melatonin (eg. less than 3 months on current dose). 5. The patient has previously received an investigational therapy for MPS IIIB (with the exception of high dose Genistein &gt;150mg/kg/day, which will require a minimum of 3 months washout before entering the study) or has had hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 6. The patient has any other prior or ongoing medial condition that may present a safety risk, interfere with study compliance, or confound data interpretation.</criteria>
