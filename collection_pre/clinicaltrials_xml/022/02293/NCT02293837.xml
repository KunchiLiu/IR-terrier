	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease. Based on previous research, study doctors think that giving medicines to affect the immune system soon after diabetes is diagnosed may stop, delay or decrease the destruction of beta cells, resulting in better glucose control. Researchers believe that tocilizumab could have some effect on the cells in the immune system that are thought to be involved in the development of type 1 diabetes. This study will test whether tocilizumab can help preserve or delay destruction of remaining beta cells in people recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tocilizumab (TCZ) in New-onset Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Staggered enrollment is planned for this trial. Prior to initiating the study in the pediatric age group (6-17 years old), 30-99 eligible adults (ages 18-45 years) will be randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab or placebo, respectively. Once the first thirty adult participants have completed 12 weeks of treatment, the FDA and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review available data (e.g., interim analysis) to weigh potential risks and benefits before opening the trial to pediatric participants. Current status: enrollment restricted to eligible adults (ages 18 - 45 years).</detailed_description>
