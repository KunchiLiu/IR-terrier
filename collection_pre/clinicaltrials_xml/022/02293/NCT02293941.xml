	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects given daily doses of JKB-122 for 3 months who have been nonresponsive to, intolerable to, or relapsed from prior interferon-based therapies (pegylated or standard) either alone or in combination with ribavirin or other anti-HCV therapies including direct-acting anti-viral agents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Is HCV positive (documented by HCV RNA testing at Screening). Chronic hepatitis C is defined as a) Positive for antiHCV antibody, HCV RNA, or an HCV genotype at least 6 months before screening, and positive for HCV RNA and antiHCV antibody at the time of screening; or b) Positive for antiHCV antibody and HCV RNA at the time of screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (or a liver biopsy performed before enrollment with evidence of CHC disease, such as the presence of fibrosis), according to "Guidance for Industry. Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection: Developing DirectActing Antiviral Agents for Treatment". Has previous results from HCV genotype testing. If previous results are not available, such testing should be performed at Screening. Has had a liver biopsy or Fibroscan™ within 3 years and the severity of hepatic dysfunction is limited to the following: Metavir Stage 0 to stage 3 fibrosis (according to liver biopsy) or Fibroscan™ results ALT and AST values not exceeding 5 x ULN (Baseline value for each parameter will be calculated as the average of 3 values obtained 7 days apart Normal total bilirubin, and prothrombin time/INR values Has elevated liver test results (ALT) at least 1.5 x ULN and not exceeding 5 x ULN (Baseline value for each parameter will be calculated as the average of 3 values obtained 7 days apart Is refractory or null responder, intolerable, relapser, or partial responder. Null responder is defined as less than a 2 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA after 12 weeks of treatment with standard or Peg Interferon/ribavirin or other antiHCV therapies; Relapser is defined as HCV RNA undetectable (or negative, per site's definition) at the end stage of treatment with a standard or pegylated interferonbased regimen or other antiHCV therapies, but HCV RNA detectable during posttreatment followup; The intolerable is defined as HCV patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of previous interferonbased therapies or other antiHCV therapies, or who were not suitable for interferonbased therapies or other antiHCV therapies; Partial responder is defined as achieved more than 2 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA by Week 12 (± 1 week) during a prior pegIFN/RBV treatment course or other antiHCV therapies but failed to achieve HCV RNA undetectable at the end stage of treatment. 1. Has history of allergy to JKB122 or related compounds 2. Has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or is hepatitis B positive 3. Is with a current diagnosis of cirrhosis, both compensated and uncompensated ChildPugh A, B or C 4. Has positive urine drug screen at Screening 5. Is currently consuming greater than 30 g of alcohol per day (eg, 2 highballs with 1 shot each, or 2 beers) or has consumed greater than 2 glasses of alcohol per day within 3 months prior to the first screening visit (Day 28) 6. Is being treated with any prescription narcotic drug (including transdermal delivery systems) 7. Has a known or suspected central nervous system disorder that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold 8. Has unstable and uncontrollable hypertension (&gt;180/110 mmHg) 9. Has received other therapies for HCV infection (interferon, pegylated interferon, ribavirin, or others) in the last 4 weeks prior to the first screening visit (Day 28) 10. Requires concomitant use of or treatment with opioids or other excluded drugs such as hepatotoxic medications 11. Has received other investigational agents within 30 days prior to the first screening visit (Day 28) 12. Has a disease that would require chronic use of prescription corticosteroids 13. Has either autoimmune or genetic liver disease 14. May be chronically or latently infected with microbial agents other than HCV 15. Has impaired renal function 16. Has BMI&gt; 30 or BMI &lt;18 17.
