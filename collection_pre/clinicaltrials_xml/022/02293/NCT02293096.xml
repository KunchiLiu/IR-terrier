	<brief_summary>The investigators will prospectively follow a population of patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure beginning metoprolol succinate therapy to determine the drug effect in an observational clinical trial. The investigators will determine each individual's genotype for both CYP2D6 and Adrenoceptor Beta 1 (ADRB1). Metabolomic markers will be identified to determine if specific metabolites are associated with drug response. The investigators' overall objective is to determine if genetics predicts metoprolol succinate response better than clinical factors such as age, race, body mass index, dose, and medication co-ingestion.</brief_summary>
