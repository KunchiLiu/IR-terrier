	<brief_summary>To determine the safety profile of CAP-1002 administered by multi-vessel intracoronary infusion in subjects with DCM. The study will further explore safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints of CAP-1002.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dilated cardiomYopathy iNtervention With Allogeneic MyocardIally-regenerative Cells (DYNAMIC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects will undergo sequential intracoronary infusion of CAP-1002 or placebo in up to three coronary arteries supplying three major cardiac territories to the heart (anterior, lateral, inferior/posterior). After completion of the screening procedures, Phase Ia subjects will receive CAP-1002 administered via intracoronary infusion in a dose escalation, stepwise manner. Phase Ia subjects will be followed at Week 2 and at Months 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 after CAP-1002 infusion. The first fourteen (14) subjects will receive intracoronary infusion of CAP-1002 in an open-label fashion (Phase Ia). Once all 14 subjects in the Phase Ia have reached the primary safety endpoint (1 month visit), the DSMB will conduct a review of the Phase Ia data and recommend whether to proceed with enrollment of the next 28 subjects in the Phase Ib.</detailed_description>
