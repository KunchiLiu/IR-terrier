	<criteria>Patients will be considered eligible if they are poor ovarian responders according to the Bologna criteria (Ferraretti et al., 2011). Two out of three of the following criteria are essential in order to classify a patient as poor ovarian responder: advanced maternal age (≥40 years) or any other risk factor for poor ovarian response; a poor ovarian response (≤3 oocytes with a conventional stimulation protocol); or an abnormal ovarian reserve test (antral follicle count, &lt;7 follicles or antiMullerian hormone, &lt;1.1 ng/ml).</criteria>
