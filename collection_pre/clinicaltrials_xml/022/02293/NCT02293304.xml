	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the 18-month clinical performance of a multimode adhesive (Scotchbond Universal Adhesive, 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) in primary molars after partial carious removal. This randomized clinical trial will include subjects (5-10 year-old children) selected at two university centers (UFSM and FOUSP). The sample will consist of 132 primary molars presenting active cavitated carious lesions (with radiographic involvement of the outer half of the dentin), located on the occlusal and occlusal-proximal surface. The sample will be randomly divided into two groups according to bonding approach: etch-and-rinse or self-etch strategy. The restorations will be clinically followed every 6 months for up to 18 months using the USPHS modified criteria for clinical evaluation. Survival estimates for restoration longevity will be evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</brief_summary>
