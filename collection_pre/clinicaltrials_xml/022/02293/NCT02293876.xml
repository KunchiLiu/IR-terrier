	<detailed_description>Critically ill patients are at higher risk for corneal injury and the mechanisms responsible for ocular lubrication and protection can be compromised. However, the literature diverges on which is the best clinical practice for treatment. There is a scale for assessing the risk for corneal injury. Thus, the general objective of this study was to evaluate the risk for developing corneal injury in critically ill patients and the effectiveness of three types of interventions: eye gel, eyedrops and polyethylene film, compared to the control group in its prevention. The specific objectives were: verify the most effective intervention for the prevention of corneal injury from the available literature and provided by: eye gel, eyedrops and polyethylene film compared to the control group who received eye care through randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients and methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial to determine the best care for the prevention of corneal injury from those available on the market (eye drops, eye gel and polyethylene film), compared to a control group (eye care) in the period from 09/07/2013 to 03/15/2014 .</detailed_description>
