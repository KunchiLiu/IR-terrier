	<brief_summary>This will be a non-drug interventional cross-sectional study, where the screening visit and study visit can occur on the same day. Investigational product will not be administered. Approximately 790 subjects with severe asthma will be screened to achieve a total of at least 750 evaluable study subjects. The study will not include a run-in or follow-up period. This study will provide a more reliable description of the severe asthma patient landscape with respect to the potential eligibility for treatment with mepolizumab, omalizumab, and reslizumab. This study aims to estimate the potential overlap of patients eligible for treatment with mepolizumab and those eligible for treatment with omalizumab and/or reslizumab. Additionally, the current study will also ascertain and describe reslizumab eligibility with respect to both mepolizumab and omalizumab, in the severe asthma patient population.</brief_summary>
