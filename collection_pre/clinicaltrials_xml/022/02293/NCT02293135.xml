	<brief_summary>The action of one Stendo pulsating suit session will be evaluated on 16 type 2 diabetic patients referred on the diabetic consultations. The effects of one Stendo pulsating suit session system will be assessed on the peripheral cutaneous microcirculation and on endothelial functions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Stendo Pulsating Suit on Microcirculation and Endothelial Function in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role of the endothelium in micro-vascular system is mediated by synthesis and release of numerous substances that act on the smooth muscle fibers. The release of these products is modulated, in turn, by various circulating molecules, by autonomic nervous system and by local mechanical factors such as shear stress. The type 2 diabetes leads to early vascular redesign with the onset of endothelial dysfunction and the worsening of the arterial stiffness. These anomalies, well correlated with the cardiovascular risks, are currently investigated in the department of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Nutrition at the Jean Verdier Hospital. The analysis methods allow identifying early modifications in response to various drugs, nutritional or physical stimuli. The aim of this study is therefore to evidence a peripheral microcirculation and endothelial function improvement in type 2 diabetic patient in comparison to a cross-over control session.</detailed_description>
