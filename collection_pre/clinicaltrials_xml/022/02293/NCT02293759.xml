	<brief_summary>Patients presented for BPH surgery at our out patient clinic will be assessed for abnormal bleeding profile. Patients with bleeding tendency will be offered either HoLEP or Greenlight laser PVP based on prostate size cut off point of 80ml Larger prostates will be treated with HoLEP Smaller prostates will be treated with greenlight PVP</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of HoLEP vs. PVP in Treating BPH in Patients With Bleeding Tendency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly patients with bleeding tendency either secondary; 1. Strict antiplatelet intake 2. Strict anticoagulant intake 3. uncorrected natural bleeding tendency e.g; patients with liver cell failure are at higher risk of perioperative bleeding when subjected to prostate surgery. Laser prostate surery was introduced to overcome this difficulty. However, till now there is no head to head comparision of different types of laser procedures in treating this subset of patients In the current study patients presented for BPH surgery in a tertiarry referral prostate unit will be assessed for bleeding tendency and will be treated either by Holmium laser enucleatiuon of the prostate or Greenlight laser vaporization of the prostate Single surgeon will perform all cases</detailed_description>
