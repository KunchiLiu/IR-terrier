	<brief_summary>Patients with a ureteral (the tube that leads from the kidney to the bladder) stone often also have small stones in the kidney (frequently visible on CT). If these small kidney stones are determined to be asymptomatic (not causing any problems or pain), then most urologists will simply remove the symptomatic ureteral stone and leave the additional stones in the kidney above. However, the investigators know that the ureteral stone started in the kidney. This means that the small stones remaining in the patient's kidney may cause problems later. The purpose of our research is to test if removing small stones from the kidney prevents future stone episodes</brief_summary>
