Primary null hypothesis: There are no statistically significant factors associated with extensor lag between 4 weeks and 4 months after immobilization is discontinued for a mallet finger among demographic, injury, and treatment factors. Secondary null hypothesis: There are no statistically significant factors associated with PROMIS upper extremity function between 4 weeks and 4 months after completion of immobilization for a mallet finger among demographic, psychological, injury, and treatment factors.</brief_summary>
