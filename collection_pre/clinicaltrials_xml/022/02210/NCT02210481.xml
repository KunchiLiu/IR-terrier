	<brief_summary>Comparison between intravitreous glucose rate and macular thinning measured by Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) at 3 months post vitrectomy for retinal detachment or epimacular membrane. Hypothesis : Association between post-operative macular thickness and intravitreous glucose rate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Intravitreal Glucose in Macular Thinning Following Surgery for Retinal Detachment or Epimacular Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparison between intravitreous glucose rate and macular thinning measured by OCT at 3 months post vitrectomy for retinal detachment or epimacular membrane. The cohort is divided in 2 groups, one with the thinnest macular measurement under 190µm, and the others above 190µm. We are looking for a correlation between increasing glucose rates and decreased macular thickness.</detailed_description>
