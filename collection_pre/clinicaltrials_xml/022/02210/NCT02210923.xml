	<brief_summary>Carotid baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) by the RheosÂ® system produces a sustained fall in blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. Since the activation electrodes are implanted at the level of the carotid sinus, it is conceivable that the nearby located carotid body chemoreceptors are stimulated as well. Physiological stimulation of carotid chemoreceptors not only raises respiration, but it also increases sympathetic activity which may in part counteract the effects of BAT. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is evidence for concomitant carotid chemoreflex activation during BAT. We hypothesized that there is no clinically relevant co-activation of the carotid body chemoreceptors during BAT in patients with resistant hypertension.</brief_summary>
