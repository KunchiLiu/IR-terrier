	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the avascular root surface area as a prognostic identification criterion for gingival recessions and to compare the predictive value of the Miller classification and avascular root surface area (AERSA) calculation on the final root coverage outcomes.</brief_summary>
