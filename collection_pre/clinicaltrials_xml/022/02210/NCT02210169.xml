	<brief_summary>Babies aged 0 to 90 days with a suspected infection requiring treatment with vancomycin will be recruited. They will be randomised to receive vancomycin as an intermittent infusion (over 1 hour) or as a continuous infusion (over 24 hours). The hypothesis is that administering vancomycin as a continuous infusion will result in improved attainment of target concentrations in blood at steady state (when the drug is in equilibrium) compared to intermittent infusion.</brief_summary>
