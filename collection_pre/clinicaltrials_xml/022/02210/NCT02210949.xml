	<brief_summary>Pre-treatment of patients with erythropoietin subcutaneously and iron supplement intravenously, in order to create a clinical pathway to minimize transfusion of red blood cells in a selected group of cardiac patients with an increased risk for blood transfusions in our cardiac surgery program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-operative Treatment With Erythropoietin and Iron Supplement in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion is identified as an independent predictor of early mortality after Coronary artery bypass grafting operations In addition, female gender, lower body surface area (BSA), low preoperative Hemoglobin (Hb), previous cardiac surgery, emergency operation and low preoperative creatinin clearance were found to be independent risk factors for receiving Red Blood Cells (RBC) units. We create a clinical pathway to reduce transfusion of red blood cells by pretreating patients with erythropoietin and iron to determine the reduction of number of patients who receive blood transfusion perioperatively. Also we want to investigate the decrease in the mean number of RBC units received per patient in the perioperative period.</detailed_description>
