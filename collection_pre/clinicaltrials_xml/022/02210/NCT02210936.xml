	<brief_summary>Brandeis University and University of South Carolina (USC) have joined together to develop the South Carolina Opioid Safety Initiative - Military (SCOSI-M), to develop an academic detailing (medical education) intervention for physicians and evaluate its effectiveness in a pilot study. The goal of the intervention is to increase the use of safe prescribing and prescription monitoring practices among primary care physicians. The research team will design and pilot an educational intervention for physicians who treat military personnel, veterans, and their families with prescription opioids. The overall aim of SCOSI-M is to prevent the onset or progression of prescription drug problems among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, military members, and their families who are at high risk for developing problems if their treatment involves long-term use of an opioid.</brief_summary>
