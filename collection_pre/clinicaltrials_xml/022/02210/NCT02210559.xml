	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of FG-3019 administered with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Trial of Gemcitabine Plus Nab-paclitaxel With or Without FG-3019 as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced, Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject may receive up to six cycles of treatment (each treatment cycle is 28 days). Tumor tissue will be collected during resection for biomarker analysis. EUS core tumor biopsies will be collected pre/post treatment at participating centers. Tumor response will be evaluated by changes in CT scan, FDG-PET, CA 19-9, and NCCN® guidelines. Subjects who complete 6 cycles of treatment will be evaluated for surgical exploration for possible R0 resection. Subjects who undergo surgery will be evaluated for surgical complications for an additional 30 days following discharge from surgery. All subjects will be followed for safety for 28 days following their last dose with study drug. Blood samples will be collected periodically for the assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). All subjects, including those who discontinue from the study during the treatment period without evidence of disease progression, will be followed for at least 28 weeks post End of Treatment for disease progression, survival, and follow-on treatment for pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
