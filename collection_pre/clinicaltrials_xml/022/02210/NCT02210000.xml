	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial designed to confirm the symptomatic effects of camicinal treatment vs. placebo, on gastroparesis symptoms in type 1 and 2 diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if a low-dose of camicinal (25 milligram[mg]) for 12 weeks of repeat administration improves gastroparesis symptoms as measured by the Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index - Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) in approximately 120 subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) who have documented abnormally slow gastric emptying and have symptoms consistent with gastroparesis. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either camicinal or placebo. The study will consist of a screening/baseline period of up to 35 days, a 12 week treatment period, a 2-week post-treatment assessment of symptoms and a 14 day (+/- 2 days) post treatment safety follow-up visit.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Gastroparesis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (acetylated hemoglobin A1 [HbA1c] &lt;=11.0%) Male or female between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive. Patient has gastroparesis at screening. A patient is eligible if one of the following criteria are met: Gastric halftime of emptying &gt;upper limit of normal as determined by Carbon13 radioisotope (C13) oral breath test; % C13dose recovered &lt; lower limit of normal at 90 or 120 minutes Patient must report a &gt;=3 month history of relevant symptoms of gastroparesis (e.g., chronic postprandial fullness, early satiety, postprandial nausea). Patients will have a mean of the daily scores over a minimum of 7 days indicating &gt;= mild (2) severity for the fullness/early satiety subscale as assessed using the GCSIDD during the screening period prior to randomization. A female patient is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 milli international units per milliliter [mIU/mL], or a value consistent with the local laboratory standard value, is confirmatory) or is of childbearing potential and agrees to use contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female patients must agree to use contraception for at least 5 days following the last dose of study medication. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;18 and &lt;=42.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive). QTc &lt;450 millisecond (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec in patients with Bundle Branch Block based on single or average QTc value of triplicate values obtained over a brief recording period. The QT correction formula (Bazett's, Fridericia's, etc) used to determine inclusion and discontinuation should be the same throughout the study. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase &lt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Patient has acute severe gastroenteritis Patient has a gastric pacemaker Patient is on chronic enteral (e.g., feeding tube) or parenteral feeding Recent (last 6 weeks) history of poor control of diabetes e.g. hypoglycaemia requiring medical intervention, diabetic ketoacidosis, admission for control of diabetes or complications of diabetes Patient has evidence of severe cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (e.g. history of recurrent syncope in the last 6 months) Patient has a history of eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, binge eating, bulimia) Use of medications potentially influencing upper gastrointestinal motility or appetite at least 1 week prior to screening (e.g., prokinetic drugs, macrolide antibiotics [erythromycin], glucagonlike peptide1 [GLP1] mimetics) Patient has had intrapyloric botox injections. A patient would be eligible if the botox treatment was in the past (&gt;6 months previously) and was not being repeated. Patient has had a gastrectomy, or major gastric surgical procedure or any evidence of bowel obstruction or strictures within the previous 12 months Dosage of any concomitant medications has not been stable for at least 3 weeks, except for routine adjustments in daily insulin treatments. Estimated (or measured) glomerular filtration rate &lt;=30 mL/minute. Daily opiate use at screening Use of prohibited medications that potentially influence upper gastrointestinal motility or appetite, or medications that may interfere with the methods of measuring gastric emptying e.g., prokinetic drugs, macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, azithromycin), GLP1 mimetics, anticholinergics, chronic/regular use of opiates History or presence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease (including liver disease or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities, with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or other condition that would in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in this clinical study. Concurrent enrollment in any other interventional study/(ies) involving a novel (i.e. unapproved or experimental) chemical or biopharmaceutical entity. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GlaxoSmithKline Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Lactating or Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin test (from the first urine of the day) at screening or prior to dosing. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening</criteria>
