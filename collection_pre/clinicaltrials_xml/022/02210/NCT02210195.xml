	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the supplemental study is to provide POC testing of aprepitant as a treatment for comorbid alcohol and cannabis dependence. The data analysis plan specified in the parent grant will likewise be applied to the supplemental project to test for effects of aprepitant vs placebo on measures of alcohol and cannabis use and protracted withdrawal. The primary hypothesis is that subjects treated with aprepitant will have significantly less alcohol and marijuana use than subjects treated with placebo.</brief_summary>
