	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to patients who have had a stem cell transplant. Researchers also want to learn if these cells can help to control CMV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Third-Party Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs) for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CTLs: CTLs are made at MD Anderson from healthy donor blood cells. The healthy donors were donating blood stem cells for other stem cell transplant patients. The cells are from a donor who at least partially matches you and your donor. All donors have been screened in the same way as routine blood donors. CTL Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the CTLs by vein. You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You will remain in the clinic for at least 1 hour after the CTL infusion so that you can be checked on. Your oxygen level will be measured by pulse oximetry. For this test, a clothespin-shaped clip will be placed on your finger for at least 30 minutes. If the infection partially responds, gets worse, or stays the same, or does not respond to the CTLs, you may receive another infusion of CTLs at least 2 weeks after your first infusion. Study Visits: Within 72 hours before the infusion: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On the day of the infusion, and then about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the infusion, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check the status of the virus, to check your immune system, and to see how well the transplant has taken. If blood is being drawn for other reasons at these timepoints, then extra blood will be drawn and used for these tests. In that case, you will not have to have another needlestick on those days. At about 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and about 3, 6, and 12 months after the infusion: - You will have a physical exam. During the physical exam, you will be checked for possible reactions to the study drug, including graft versus host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted donor tissue attacks the tissues of the recipient's body) at Months 3, 6, and 12 after the infusion. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the doctor thinks it is needed, part of this blood will be used to check the status of the virus. During the Week 4 visit, part of this blood sample will be used to check for HAMA immune system reactions. At Months 2, 4, 5, and 7-11 after the infusion, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the virus if the doctor thinks it is needed. At Month 9 after the infusion, you will be checked for GVHD. If you have 2 CTL infusions, these study visits will restart after the last infusion. Starting at Week 1, you can have blood drawn for the study at a local lab or clinic that is closer to your home. The results will be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will end after your last follow-up visit 12 months after your last infusion. You will be taken off study early if you are unable to receive the first CTL infusion, if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse or comes back, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. The use of CTLs to treat infection is not FDA approved or commercially available. CTLs are currently being used for research purposes only. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with any type of autologous or allogeneic HSCT with CMV infection will be included. 2. Persistent CMV infection despite optimum antiviral therapy. a. Patients with CMV disease: defined as the demonstration of CMV by biopsy specimen from visceral sites (by culture or histology) or the detection of CMV by culture or direct fluorescent antibody stain in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the presence of new or changing pulmonary infiltrates OR b. Failure of antiviral therapy:defined as the continued presence of DNAemia (defined as &gt;/=137 copies/ml by PCR) for at least 2 weeks of CMV antiviral therapy OR 1) Optimum therapy is defined as at least 14 days of therapy with Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, Cidofovir, or Valganciclovir for patients with disease or CMV viremia. 2) Relapse while on CMV antiviral therapy defined as recurrence of DNAemia while being on at least 2 weeks of antiviral therapy; OR c. Patients who cannot tolerate standard antiviral therapy and cannot continue antiviral treatment due to side effect profile will be eligible independent of antiviral therapy duration. 3. Prior myeloablative or nonmyeloablative autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using the marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or single or double umbilical cord blood. 4. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids equal to or less than 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone. 5. Patients with chronic GVHD if on prednisone equal to or less than 0.5 mg/kg and not receiving secondline GVHD treatments like Pentostatin, Infliximab, Etanercept, etc. 6. Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian. 7. Negative pregnancy test in female patients of childbearing potential. 8. All ages. 1. Patients receiving prednisone &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day at time of enrollment, or have received ATG, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or Campath within 28 days of enrollment. 2. Patients with other uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72 hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive systemic antifungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week prior to enrollment. Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection. Patients with ongoing viral infections are excluded. 3. Patients with active acute GVHD grades IIIV. 4. Active and uncontrolled relapse of malignancy.</criteria>
