	<brief_summary>This study represents the first randomized trial comparing traditional inpatient induction with a transcervical foley catheter versus outpatient induction with immediate removal of a transcervical foley catheter. The immediate removal technique allows the induction process to begin in the hospital setting, but allows the patient to go home without a foreign body in situ. The investigators hypothesize the outpatient group will spend less time hospitalized prior to discharge. Additionally, the investigators will explore the vaginal delivery rates and maternal/neonatal safety profiles between groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outpatient Labor Induction With the Transcervical Foley Balloon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients who are candidates for labor induction and meet inclusion criteria will be identified in the obstetrics clinic when they are being scheduled for induction of labor, or at a later clinic date. If they agree to participate, patients will be randomized and enrolled in the study at that time. Those who consent will be randomized into Group A (Experimental Group) and Group B (Control Group). No stratification criteria will be used. Patients randomized to the control group will undergo induction of labor using the standard foley bulb and Pitocin method. Participants will be placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, an 18 French Foley catheter will be placed transcervically and its balloon filled with 60mL of sterile saline. One of two methods will be used to place the transcervical foley based on provider preference and determination of which method will offer the greatest chance for successful placement. Method A is placement of the foley "blindly" by palpation of the cervix. Method B utilizes direct visualization with sterile speculum placement. Method will be documented in the data collection forms. The catheter will be left in place and IV oxytocin will be started per protocol. The foley catheter will be removed after 12 hours if not spontaneously extruded. Patients randomized to the experimental group will undergo outpatient induction of labor. Either of the above two described methods will be used to place an 18 French Foley catheter transcervically and its balloon filled with 60mL of sterile saline. The catheter will be deflated and removed within 10 minutes of placement. The patient will then undergo a non-stress test (NST). If the patient has a reactive NST with no late or variable decelerations or uterine tachysystole, the patient will be discharged home with clear return precautions and instructions to return to the triage area in 24 hours. When the patient returns to the hospital, a sterile vaginal exam will be done and Bishop score documented. The patient will then be admitted to L&amp;D for inpatient continuation of induction with IV oxytocin per protocol. In accordance with the Friedman curve and current LAC+USC practice, primigravid participants will be given 20 hours of maximum Pitocin (22 mU/ min) to achieve active labor and multigravid participants will be given 14 hours before a failed induction is diagnosed. Cesarean delivery will be recommended for arrest of dilation, arrest of descent, or any obstetric indication as decided by the on-duty house staff. Finally, at patient request, intravenous or regional anesthesia will be made available at any time during the labor and delivery process.</detailed_description>
