	<brief_summary>The study aims to determine the better device to facilitate intubation in patients with a limited neck movement and small mouth opening. This may help anesthesiology as well as emergency medicine practitioners and departments to decide when choosing between these two conceptually similar device. The hypothesis to be tested is that the C-MACÂ® is more superior when compared to the Bonfils Intubation Fibrescope in success of intubation, time to intubation and complication rate in patients with a fixed cervical collar.</brief_summary>
