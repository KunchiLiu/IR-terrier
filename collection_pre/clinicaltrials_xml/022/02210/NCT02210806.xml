	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy, dose-ranging and safety profiles of A006, an Albuterol dry powder inhaler (DPI), in the dose range of 110 to 220 mcg per dose in comparison to a DPI Placebo Control and an Albuterol metered dose inhaler (MDI) Active Control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Albuterol DPI (A006) Clinical Study-B3:Efficacy, Dose-ranging and Safety Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of A006 and to assist in identifying the optimum dose of A006 for future clinical studies. Proventil® HFA MDI, a currently marketed Albuterol MDI product, will be used as an Active Control. The study also employs a Placebo Control DPI, which has the same configuration as the A006 DPI except that it contains no active ingredient.</detailed_description>
