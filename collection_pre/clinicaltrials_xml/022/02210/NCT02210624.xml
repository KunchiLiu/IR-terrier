	<brief_summary>The purpose of study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells therapy in patients with anaerobic (hypoxic) brain injury. Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative treatment modality in incurable and intractable neurological disorders. This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of stem cells in anaerobic brain injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Assessment of Autologous Bone-marrow Derived Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Patients With Anoxic(or Hypoxic) Brain Injury Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various treatment modalities to minimize the neurological deficits of anoxic brain injury, including lower consciousness, abnormal movement disorders, and abnormal behavior, have been tried, but so far there have been no effective proven method for chronic patients. This study is the investigator initiated trial to verify the safety and feasibility of stem cells therapy in patients with anoxic brain injury.</detailed_description>
