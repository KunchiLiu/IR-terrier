	<brief_summary>It has been shown that patients complaining of gas-related symptoms significantly improve on a diet low in fermentable residues. However, other studies suggest that some non-absorbable, fermentable meal products (prebiotics) that serve as substrate to colonic bacteria, produce beneficial effects to the host, including improvement of abdominal symptoms. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of a diet low in fermentable residues versus a diet suplemented with prebiotics on intestinal microbiota composition, microbiota activity (intestinal gas production) and digestive symptoms.</brief_summary>
