	<brief_summary>Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a most frequent complication of hemodialysis (HD) and may contribute to cardiovascular events and high mortality. The etiology of IDH is multifactorial; therefore, it remains a challenging problem in the management of HD patients. Because moxibustion (MO) at specific points can influences hemodynamics, we hypothesize that Tianjiu (auto-MO) at the traditionally used meridian points will reduce the severity of hypotension in patients who undergo HD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Preliminary Randomized Study of Tianjiu (Auto-moxibustion) Effects in Patients With Intradialytic Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this clinical trial, 45 patients had IDH were divided randomly into two (auto-MO therapy and control) groups for 4 weeks. In the Tianjiu (auto-MO) group, the patients were applied at 3 points (Conception Vessel 4, and Kidney 1) for 3-4 h during HD sessions. All number of episodes complicated by symptomatic IDH during HD sessions and the number of IDH-related nursing interventions (Trendelenburg position, manual reduction of ultrafiltration rate, infusion of isotonic saline or hypertonic fluid, lowering of dialysate temperature) in a session were recorded. Pre- and post-dialysis systolic and diastolic BP, pre- and post-dialysis body weights, interdialytic weight gain, percentage of target ultrafiltration achieved, patient's subjective assessment of the degree of fatigue after dialysis (scale from 0 to 10; 0, not at all, 10, extremely) and recovery time from fatigue after dialysis were measured at the 0, 2nd, 4th and 6th week.</detailed_description>
