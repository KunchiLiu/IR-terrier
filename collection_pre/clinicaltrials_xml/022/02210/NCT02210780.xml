	<criteria>Key 1. Male or female adults ages 18 to 64 years with Chronic AD (according to the American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, [Eichenfeld 2004])that has been present for at least 3 years before the screening visit 2. Patients with documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response to a sufficient course of outpatient treatment with topical AD medication(s), or for whom topical AD therapies are otherwise inadvisable (e.g., because of side effects or safety risks). 3. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥16 at the screening visit and the baseline visit 4. Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 (on the 04 IGA scale) at the screening and baseline visits 5. ≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the screening and baseline visits Key 1. Prior treatment with dupilumab (REGN668/ SAR231893) 2. Patients needing &gt;10 mg of daily prednisone (including equivalent doses of other steroids) or high dose systemic corticosteroids (≥2 mg/kg) for 14 days or longer during the 16 week treatment period of the study 3. History of GuillainBarre syndrome 4. History of severe allergic reaction to either vaccine or to vaccine components including alum, thimerosal, phenol 5. Patients with a severe reaction to natural rubber latex products (some packaging components of the vaccines contain rubber latex and may cause a reaction in susceptible individuals) 6. Treatment with biologics within 4 months of baseline visit 7. Chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics, antifungals within 4 weeks before screening visit or superficial skin infections within 1 week of screening visit The information listed above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial and not all inclusion/ exclusion criteria are listed.</criteria>
