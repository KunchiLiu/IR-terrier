	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Thoracic Paravertebral Block for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Operations in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was performed after approval of Ethics Committee and parents written consent. Between the ages 1-5, planned percutaneous nephrolithotomy due to kidney stones 40 patients were enrolled in this study, and patients were randomly divided into two group. All patients were performed general anaesthesia. The Group I patients was given ultrasound guided thoracic paravertebral block with 0.5 ml/kg bupivacaine %0.5 after giving prone position and the Group II patients was given 15 mg/kg of paracetamol as postoperative analgesia. In the period of postoperative, if the FLACC &gt; 4; it was planned to dose 1 mg/kg of tramadol. Patients' hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation, sevoflurane concentration were recorded 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes intraoperatively. Patients' hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation, pain scores (FLACC), satisfaction of parents, the number of patients who additional analgesic requirements and side effects (nausea,vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, respiration problems etc) were recorded in the postoperative period. Primary outcome measures was pain scores using FLACC scale.</detailed_description>
