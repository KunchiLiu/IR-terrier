	<brief_summary>In this prospective, observational study the investigators assess the perioperative course of right ventricular function in combination with the venous return in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. The study aims to investigate if patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery develop an impairment of right ventricular function and/or venous return. Furthermore, the study evaluates if an impairment of right ventricular function and/or venous return is associated to left ventricular function, arterial side of the circulation and to postoperative clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
