	<brief_title>Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation in Articular Cartilage Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human articular cartilage has limited repair potential.Cell-based strategies have explored chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with extensive basic science and preclinical studies.However the concept of autologous chondrocyte implantation is not ideal,so the focus in cartilage repair is shifting toward mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for articular cartilage defects, 20 patients will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.</detailed_description>
