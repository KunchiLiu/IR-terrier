	<brief_summary>The Objectives of the current research is to evaluate whether psychological flexibility influences psychotherapy outcomes in patients with adjustment disorder and depression. If indeed this is the case, we would be able to identify risk factors for low adjustment- such as low psychological flexibility, and develop psychotherapy that would try to enhance this ability.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be recruited from the Psychiatric daycare center at the Tel-Aviv Souraski Medical Center, serving the broader Tel-Aviv municipal area. Referrals to the department will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study according to the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria would be adjustment disorder as the referral cause, age ranging from 20 to 65 years old and Hebrew speaking. Patients with major depression, a psychotic disorder, alcohol or drug dependence will be excluded. All participants will sign a written informed consent. The diagnosis of adjustment disorder will be conﬁrmed by an open clinical interview followed by a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV SCID-IV (Shalev et al. 1994; First et al. 1995). Before starting the psychotherapy treatment, the patients will fill a psychological flexibility questionnaire (PFQ) and well-being questionnaire (MHI), in order to evaluate their psychological flexibility and well-being baseline. At the end of the psychotherapy treatment, they will fill the questionnaires again. Also, their therapists will evaluate the patients' levels of adjustment disorder or depression before and after the therapy.</detailed_description>
