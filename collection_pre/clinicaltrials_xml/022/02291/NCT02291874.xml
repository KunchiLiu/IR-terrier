	<brief_title>Post-Marketing Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Ipragliflozin in Combination With GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Japanese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label study in patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control with GLP-1 receptor agonists for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Week −6). Patients on monotherapy with Victoza® or on combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and sulfonylurea (SU) are eligible. Patients on combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-SU hypoglycemic agents can also be included; however, these patients must undergo washout of the non-SU hypoglycemic agents administered with GLP-1 receptor agonists.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject has a diagnosis of T2DM that was determined at least 12 weeks (84 days) before providing informed consent. The subject has been receiving the same GLP1 receptor agonist at a fixed dose and mode of administration for at least 6 weeks (42 days) prior to Visit 1. If on therapy with a concomitant SU, the subject has been receiving the same SU at a fixed dose and mode of administration for at least 6 weeks (42 days) prior to Visit 1. The subject has HbA1c levels of ≥7.5% but ≤10.5% at Visit 2, and the difference in HbA1c levels between Visit 1 and Visit 2 is within ±1.0%. The subject has a BMI of ≥20.0 kg/m2 but ≤45.0 kg/m2 at Visit 2. If on therapy with a concomitant SU, the subject has fasting plasma glucose levels of ≥126 mg/dL at Visit 2. The subject has T1DM. The subject has symptoms of dysuria, anuria, oliguria, or urinary retention. The subject has proliferative retinopathy. The subject has a history of clinically significant renal diseases such as renovascular occlusive disease, nephrectomy, or renal transplant. The subject has a history of pancreatitis. The subject has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (≥3 episodes within 24 weeks before providing informed consent). The subject has a symptomatic urinary tract infection or symptomatic genital infection. The subject has a chronic disease that requires the continuous use of adrenocortical steroids and immunosuppressants (oral, injectable, or inhalational medications). The subject has a history of cerebral vascular attack, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, vascular intervention, or serious heart disease (NYHA Class IIIIV) within 1 year (52 weeks) prior to Visit 1, or the subject has heart disease or cerebral vascular disease that, as per the judgment of the investigator or subinvestigator, may interfere with the treatment with ipragliflozin or safety evaluation of this study. The subject has an unstable psychiatric disorder. The subject is a female who is currently pregnant or lactating or could be pregnant. The subject is unable or unwilling to practice an appropriate contraception method during the study. The subject has severe infection, perioperative or serious trauma. The subject has drug addiction or abuses alcohol. The subject has a history of malignant tumors (except when he/she has been free from treatment for at least 5 years before providing informed consent and is not considered to have any recurrence). The subject has a history of allergy to ipragliflozin or similar drugs that have an SGLT2 inhibitory action. The subject has participated in a clinical study of an investigational product or medical device or postmarketing study within 12 weeks (84 days) before providing informed consent or is currently participating in any of these studies. The subject is unable or unwilling, or does not agree, to comply with the study requirements, including the hospital visits, dose instructions, and the subject's responsibilities.</criteria>
