	<brief_title>Effect of an Anti-spasmodic Suppository to Improve Comfort After Urologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Belladonna and opium suppositories are administered postoperatively to relieve bladder discomfort usually caused by bladder spasms. The onset of action of the suppository is 30-60 minutes. Bladder spasms are more likely to occur following uteroscopy procedures. The spasms result in a felt desire to void, even when there is no urine in the bladder. The spasms can produce pain or a sense of severe urgency. By administering a belladonna and opium suppository at the beginning of surgery, it is hoped that there will be a decrease in the incidence of bladder spasms, increased comfort and less need for additional medications.</detailed_description>
