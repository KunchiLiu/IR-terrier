	<brief_summary>This study will look at measuring the activity of natural killer (NK) cells using the in vitro diagnostic device NK Vue in subjects being screened for colorectal cancer using colonoscopy. The NK Vue diagnostic test for natural killer cell activity uses the principle of stimulation of whole blood with a proprietary cytokine followed by the quantitative detection of interferon gamma using an immunoassay. NK Vue is intended to be used for the monitoring of the immune status of individuals. Measurement of NK cell activity could be a useful tool for assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or diseases where NK cell activity has been shown to be reduced, such as colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
