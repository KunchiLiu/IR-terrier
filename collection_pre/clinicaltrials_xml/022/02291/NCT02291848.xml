	<brief_summary>This study is for patients that have a cancer called Multiple Myeloma. This research study uses special immune system cells called tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a new experimental therapy. The proteins that investigators are targeting in this study are called tumor associated antigens (TAAs). These are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell.They either do not show or show up in low quantities on normal human cells. In this study we target five common TAAs called NY-ESO-1, MAGEA4, PRAME, Survivin and SSX. On a different protocol, patients have been treated and so far this treatment has shown to be safe. Investigators now want to try this treatment in patients with multiple myeloma. These TAA-specific CTLs are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of TAA-specific CTLs, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to 390 mL (78 teaspoons) of blood will be collected from the patient on one to three occasions over a two month period. Under certain conditions related to the patient's health, the blood may need to be collected using a process called apheresis. Apheresis is the process where blood is passed through a machine that separates out the components of the blood that is needed. The remainder of the blood is then returned to the patient's body. Investigators will use this blood to grow T cells. They will first grow a special type of cells called dendritic cells which will cause activity in the T cells. Once these are made the investigator will load them with small pieces of protein called peptides taken from the TAAs that they want to target. This helps to train the T cells to kill cells with TAAs on their surface. Then the investigators expand these TAA-specific CTLs. The cells will be infused by intravenous (IV) infusion into the patient over 10 minutes. The patient may be pre-treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Initially, two doses of TAA-specific CTLs will be given two weeks apart. The patient's disease will be assessed pre-infusion and then 6 weeks after the second infusion. If after the second infusion there is a decrease in the patient's disease or it remains stable, the patient can receive up to six (6) additional doses of the TAA-specific CTLs at monthly intervals. All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist Hospital. In between the first and second infusions and for 6 weeks after the last infusion, the patient is asked not to receive any other anti-cancer treatments, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy, with the exception of lenalidomide, thalidomide, pomalidomide, or immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as CTLA4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. If they do receive any other therapies in-between the first and second infusion of cells, the patient will be taken off treatment and will not be able to receive the second infusion of cells. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 4 different levels) of TAA-specific CTLs. Once that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 4 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the TAA-specific CTL infusions will be stopped. Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests: - Physical exam. - Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function. - Measurement of the patient's multiple myeloma by blood tests and bone marrow biopsy (within 4 weeks before the CTL infusion) - Measurements of the patient's tumor by routine imaging studies. - Pregnancy test (using a blood sample) if the patient is a female who can have children. Medical Tests During and After Treatment: - Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function. - Measurement of the patient's multiple myeloma by blood tests and bone marrow biopsy (at 4-6 weeks and 8-12 weeks post 1st CTL infusion). Imaging study 8 weeks after the 1st CTL infusion. To learn more about the way the TAA-specific CTLs are working in the patient's body, an extra 20-40 mL (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each infusion, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6. Afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the last infusion. The investigators will use this blood to see how long the TAA-specific CTLs last, and to look at the immune response to the cancer. Patients will then be contacted once a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) to evaluate their disease response long-term.</detailed_description>
