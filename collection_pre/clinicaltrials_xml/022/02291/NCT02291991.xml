	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of GX-E2 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GX-E2 when given as single dose (GX-E2 8 ug/kg) to healthy male subjects. Additionally, Immunogenecity will be evaluated to investigate antibody production.</detailed_description>
