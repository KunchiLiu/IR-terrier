	<brief_summary>Adequate calcium absorption is essential for reducing one's risk of developing osteoporosis. However, postmenopausal Thai women consume diets which are habitually low in calcium due to lactose intolerance and dietary patterns which typically do not include milk-based products. The primary goal of this study is to measure the fractional calcium absorption from milk and a commonly ingested green leafy vegetable (cassia) in postmenopausal Thai women with habitually low calcium intakes. The secondary objective is to determine associations between calcium absorption and biomarkers which impact vitamin D status and bone metabolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Absorption in Postmenopausal Thai Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postmenopausal Thai women (n=22) will be recruited from the community surrounding Bangkok and Nakhon Pathon, Thailand. They will be invited to participate in an isotope study comparing the fractional calcium absorption from milk and cassia. Upon arrival, a fasting blood sample will be drawn on the morning of the absorption study to analyze serum markers of vitamin D and bone metabolism (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25OHD], parathyroid hormone [PTH], and beta-crossLaps) and to determine their impact on calcium absorption. Following this blood draw, women will receive a stable calcium isotope (42Ca) intravenously. Then for breakfast and lunch respectively, the women will be randomly assigned to orally ingest a stable calcium isotope from either the milk (44Ca) or cassia (43Ca) test meals. On day two, women will receive a breakfast, snack, and lunch meal. Urine samples will be collected over the entire 28 hour period and the 24-hr urine collection will be used to measure urinary calcium concentration and to calculate fractional calcium absorption.</detailed_description>
