	<brief_summary>Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGvHD) is a potentially lethal disorder. A variety of second line immunosuppressive agents have been investigated but no optimal treatment has emerged. There is therefore a need for novel treatment strategies. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exhibit immunomodulatory properties and a recent pilot study suggests a response rate of 70% in steroid- refractory patients. In the present randomized study the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment will be further studied in patients with cGvHD.</brief_summary>
