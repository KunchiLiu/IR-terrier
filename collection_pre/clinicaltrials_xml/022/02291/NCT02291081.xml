	<brief_summary>The HIV/HEART study (HIVH) is an ongoing, prospective, multicentre trial that was conducted to assess the incidence, the prevalence and the clinical course of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in HIV-infected patients. The study population includes outpatients from specialized HIV-care units of the German Ruhr region, who were at least 18 years of age, were known to have a HIV-infection and exhibited a stable disease status within 4 weeks before inclusion into the trial. From March 2004 (Pilot phase) to May 2014 (7,5 year Follow-up) 1481 HIV+ patients were recruited in a consecutive manner. The standardised examinations included a targeted assessment of medical history and physical examination. Blood was drawn for comprehensive laboratory tests including HIV specific parameters (CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA levels) and cardiovascular items (lipid concentrations, BNP values and renal parameters). Furthermore, non-invasive tests were performed during the initial visit, including additional heart rate and blood pressure measurements, electrocardiogram (ECGs) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Examinations were completed in accordance with previously defined standard operating procedures. CVD were defined as coronary, cerebrovascular, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure or cardiac vitium.</brief_summary>
