	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to compare the relative bioavailability between two peppermint oil formulations, namely a colon-targeted-delivery capsule (Tempocol-ColoPulse®) and an enteric-coated capsule (Tempocol®). This study is conducted as part of a future multicenter randomized controlled trial that will assess the therapeutic effect of the new peppermint oil formulation in IBS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing a 182mg Colon-targeted-delivery Peppermint Oil Capsule (Tempocol-ColoPulse®) and a 182mg Enteric-coated Peppermint Oil Capsule (Tempocol®), a Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Peppermint oil has shown to be effective in the treatment of IBS symptoms in several meta-analyses. However, the level of evidence is moderate and peppermint oil remains relatively under-used in IBS. Therefore the investigators plan to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial to investigate the possible beneficial effects of peppermint oil in IBS. To improve efficacy and to reduce side effects, the investigators aim to study the use of a new peppermint oil formulation (Tempocol-ColoPulse®) that will slowly release the oil in the (ileo-) colonic region specifically. In order to demonstrate differences in pharmacokinetics, the subsidizing party, ZonMW, requested an additional pilot study (described in the present protocol) in which the investigators will investigate surrogate markers for local colon bioavailability, tolerability and side effects of the new Tempocol-ColoPulse®. Study design: a randomized, double blind, two-period, two-treatment crossover study with a wash out period of at least 14 days. Intervention: All study volunteers will receive a single dose of 182mg of both Tempocol-ColoPulse® and Tempocol®, each on a different test day. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Subjects may be confronted with certain inconveniences and minor risks. They are required to visit the MUMC+ 5 times, once for the screening and two times per test day for various non-invasive measurements (questionnaires, blood pressure and heart-rate measurement, urine and fecal sampling, pregnancy test in women in fertile ages, general physical exam) as well as for minor invasive venous blood sampling, after which a small haematoma can occur. Total time investment is +/- 30 hours, subjects will not benefit from participation.</detailed_description>
