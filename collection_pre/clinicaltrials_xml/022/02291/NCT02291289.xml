	<brief_summary>This randomized, multi-center, active-controlled, open-label, parallel-group study will investigate the efficacy and safety of biomarker-driven maintenance treatment for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients with mCRC are eligible for entry, and cannot have received any prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. The entire study duration is anticipated to be approximately 6 years.</brief_summary>

The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids is allowed.</criteria>
