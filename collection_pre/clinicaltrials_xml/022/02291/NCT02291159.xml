	<brief_summary>Introduction: Stroke is a neurological deficit caused by a decrease in cerebral blood flow. The DNHS ® (Dry Needling for hypertonia and Spasticity) technique is a dry needling technique to reduce spasticity and hypertonia and improve function in patients with CNS injury. The main objective of this trial is to analyze the therapeutic effect of DNHS® technique in motor function in patients between 45 and 80 in a chronic state after a stroke. Methods: Double-blinded randomized clinical trial. There will be an intervention group (DNHS® technique) and a sham control group. The intervention will be 2 sessions, one per week, in biceps brachii, brachialis, flexor digitorum superficialis nad profundus, adductor pollicis and first dorsal interossei. The Fugl Meyer Assessment Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale and Stroke Impact Scale will be used as outcome measures. The data will be expressed as mean ± (Standard Deviation). The standardized difference or effect size (ES, 90% confidence limit) in the selected variables will be calculated.</brief_summary>
