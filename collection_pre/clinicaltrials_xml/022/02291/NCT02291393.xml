	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy can be difficult. The 80 lead ECG may increase the specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing this potentially life threatening inherited cardiac condition. This pilot would form the basis of a much larger clinical trial to test the utility of this novel diagnostic tool.</brief_summary>
