	<brief_summary>Objectives: Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of NEM速 versus placebo in improving joint pain and stiffness in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthiritis Index (WOMAC)), Likert Scale, Range of Motion (ROM) evaluation and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS Scale) will be used as joint pain and stiffness scales for efficacy. Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of NEM速 treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study: 1. Subjects must be 40 years of age or older. 2. Subjects must be applied to the Physical Treatment and Rehabilitation clinics with knee pain complaints and the subjects must be diagnosed as knee osteoarthritis exactly with routine laboratory and XRAY degeneration detection methods. Subjects must have 2nd or 3rd grade knee osteoarthritis diagnose according to the Kellgren Lawrance criteria as a result of the knee graph determined with Anteroposterior (AP) graph method while standing on referencing American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or The European Leauge Aganist Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010. 3. Male or female subjects can be included to the study. 4. Subject must not have been diagnosed with a joint or connective tissue (JCT) disease other than osteoarthritis (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudo gout, paget.) by a licensed physician prior to enrollment evaluation. 5. Subject must have mild to moderate persistent joint pain lasting for at least 3 months with a score of at least 15 mm on a Patient's Assessment of Joint pain WOMAC Osteoarthitiris Index and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). 6. Subjects must have disease complaints for at least 15 years. 7. Subject must diagnosed with 2nd or 3rd grade knee osteoarthritis according to Kellgren Lawrance criteria. 8. Body mess index of the subjects must 35 or below. 9. Subject must be available for and willing to attend all evaluation visits. 10. Subject must be able and willing to give informed consent. 11. Subject must be willing to take NEM速 or placebo and to stop taking all prescription medications, overthecounter (OTC) treatments, or dietary supplements that might be considered analgesic or antiinflammatory (i.e. Non Steroidal Anti Imflammatory Drugs NSAIDs) or that might confound the study results, as judged by the clinical investigator. Examples of these types of medications are: aspirin (excluding 300 mg and over),paracetamol, ibuprofen, naproxen, oxycodone, propoxyphene, diclofenac, celecoxib, glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM (Methyl Sulfonylmethane) , white willow bark, turmeric or curcumin, Boswellia, etc. a. Washout Periods: Subjects are eligible to participate in the study following a 7day washout period for narcotics, a 14day washout period for analgesics &amp; NSAIDs, and a 90day washout period for steroids or JCT dietary supplements (i.e. glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, etc.) 12. Subjects must be willing to use only paracetamol as rescue pain medication, provided as part of the study. Subjects presenting with any of the following exclusion criteria must not be included in the study: 1. Subject has Grade IV (4) osteoarthritis (KellgrenLawrence) as judged by the clinical investigator 2. Subject is currently receiving therapy with remissioninducing drugs (i.e. methotrexate, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha blockers, steroids and glucosamine condtroitin) or any investigational drug. 3. Subject has been diagnosed with any confounding inflammatory disease or condition that would interfere with the assessment of the study treatment, as judged by the clinical investigator (i.e. pseudo gout, Paget's disease, chronic pain syndrome etc.). 4. Subject has been enrolled in a study to evaluate a JCT treatment in the past 6 months. 5. Subject has known allergy to eggs or egg products. If any subject becomes sensitive during the study, they will immediately be excluded from continuing in the study. a. Such sensitivity may be realized as a reaction to inoculations wherein the inoculate is derived from or contains egg components (i.e., influenza vaccine). 6. Subject body mess index greater than 35. 7. Pregnant and breastfeeding women. 8. Subject has severe persistent joint pain lasting for at least 3 months with a score of 80 mm or more on a Patient's Assessment of Joint pain WOMAC OA Index and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). 9. Subject is unwilling to forgo use of prescription, overthecounter (OTC) treatments, and/or dietary supplements for the duration of the study. 10. Subject is involved in any other research study involving an investigational product (drug, device or biologic) or a new application of an approved product, within 30 days of screening.</criteria>
