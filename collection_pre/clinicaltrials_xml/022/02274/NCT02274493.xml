	<detailed_description>If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, and you agree, your screening, reconstructive surgery, and follow-up appointments will be scheduled over multiple visits, as listed in this consent form. All procedures will be performed on days in which standard of care procedures would already be performed. If it is determined that you are eligible, the following will be performed before the surgery: - The study doctor or a member of the research team will review your medical information and ask you questions about your medical history and demographic information. - You will have a physical exam. - You will be evaluated by a Physical Therapist to test your range of motion and strength. - You will complete a questionnaire about pain, as well as your shoulder, arm, and hand range of motion. This information will be used to compare with the results after the surgery. This will take about 5 minutes to complete. - Photographs and/or videos of the surgical site will be taken. - If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test. To take part in this study, you must not be pregnant. Surgery Study Visit (2): At this visit, your reconstructive surgery will be performed using a robot, called the Da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System. The reconstructive surgery is considered to be standard of care. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form that discusses the possible benefits and risks of the standard of care surgical procedure in more detail, including information about any anesthetic you will be given for the surgery. A standard muscle harvest procedure takes about 2 hours. A muscle harvest procedure with the robotic system is expected to take longer than the standard surgery. The total procedure time will vary for each patient depending on the type of muscle harvest procedure and other factors in the operating room. The total time to complete the muscle harvest and reconstruction will take about 4 hours. Photographs and/or videos of the surgical site will be taken. You will remain in the hospital for 3-4 days after the surgery is complete for observation. After you are discharged from the hospital, you will need to return within 2 weeks for your first follow-up examination. Follow-Up Study Visits (3-6): After you have been discharged from the hospital, you will have 4 follow-up visits. The first follow up visit will take place within two weeks after you are discharged . The second follow-up visit will be between 2-4 weeks, the third follow up visit will be between 1-3 months and the fourth follow up will be between 3-6 months after you are discharged. The following tests and procedures will be performed at each follow-up visit: - The study doctor will check the surgery site(s). - Your overall health status will be checked. - You will be evaluated by a Physical Therapist to test your range of motion and strength. - Photographs and/or videos of the surgical site may be taken. - You will complete the questionnaire about pain and your shoulder, arm, and hand range of motion. This information will be used to compare with the results from before the surgery. Length of Study Participation: Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. This is an investigational study. The use of the Da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System for surgery in the thorax (part of the upper body) is FDA approved and commercially available at this time. However, the system has not been FDA cleared specifically for use in latissimus dorsi muscle harvest procedures. The use of the DaVinci Robotic Surgical System for this type of reconstructive surgery has not been performed in live humans and is what researchers are investigating for this study. Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. The subject must be equal to or greater than 18 years of age. 2. The subject must be willing and able to provide informed consent. 3. The subject is willing and able to comply with the study protocol. 4. The subject is undergoing one of the following reconstructive procedures that requires latissimus dorsi muscle harvest: a. Postmastectomy breast reconstruction procedure (either nipple or skin sparing) in which a female subject needs additional muscle coverage over an implant, but does not need additional skin (i.e., patient is a candidate for a pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle flap procedure); b. Scalp reconstruction procedure in which the subject needs a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap for wound coverage; c. Upper extremity reconstruction procedure in which the subject needs a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap for wound coverage; or, d. Lower extremity reconstruction procedure in which the subject needs a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap for wound coverage. 5. The subject agrees to followup examinations out to 6 months posttreatment. 1. The subject has a BMI &gt; 35. 2. The subject has a history of significant bleeding disorders. 3. The subject is diabetic. 4. The subject is known or suspected to be pregnant or lactating. 5. The subject has a history of peripheral vascular disease. 6. The subject is a current smoker (has smoked within 4 weeks prior to surgery). 7. The subject has had prior back or axillary surgeries which could compromise the blood supply of the flap.</criteria>
