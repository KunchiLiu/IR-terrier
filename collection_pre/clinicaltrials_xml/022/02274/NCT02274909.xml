	<brief_title>Pilates and PNF Methods Induces Similar Strength Gains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty healthy elderly women were randomly divided into 3 groups: Pilates group (PG), PNF group (PNFG) and Control group (CG). Pilates and PNF groups underwent one-month (three times per week) training program with Pilates and PNF methods, respectively. CG received no intervention along the one month. The maximal isometric force from knee extension and flexion, as well as the EMG signal from quadriceps and biceps femoris were recorded before and after the one-month intervention period. A two-way analysis of variance (3 groups x 2 measures) was used to compare the results from EMG signal, isometric force and force variability and force spectrum. A one-month training program with Pilates and PNF methods induces similar strength gains from knee flexors and extensors, without differences between methods, but PG exhibited greater low gamma drive (i.e., 30-60 Hz band) after the training period. Both Pilates and PNF methods were efficient to improve the muscle strength, but with different neuromuscular adaptations in elderly women. These results give support to the recommendation these methods to older age groups, since the increment of lower limb muscle strength is important for gait, postural stability and performance of daily life activities of this population.</detailed_description>
