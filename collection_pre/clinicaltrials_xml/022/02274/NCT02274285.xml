	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates (Hib antigen (PRP), Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis antigens (PT and FHA), and polio types 1, 2 and 3 antigens) of investigational arm (Group A: DTaP-IPV/Hib) versus control arm (Group B: DTaP-IPV and Hib vaccines administered at separate sites), one month after the primary vaccination (all antigens). Secondary objectives: - To describe immune responses against all vaccine antigens with no pre-specified hypothesis, and at all time points (pre-dose 1, post-dose 3, pre-dose 4 and post-dose 4) in the two study groups (Group A and Group B). - To describe the safety after each dose of each vaccine in the two study groups (Group A and Group B). - To describe immune responses against all vaccine antigens with no pre-specified hypothesis, and at all time points (pre-dose 1, post-dose 3, pre-dose 4 and post-dose 4 (Group C)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be enrolled in two steps (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Step one will enroll Cohort 1 made of 40 participants randomized in two groups with a 1:1 ratio. After review of the local and systemic adverse events occurring during the 7 Days following the first dose administered in these subjects, 2nd vaccination of Cohort 1 participants will resume and enrollment of the participants of Cohort number 2 will start. Step two will enroll Cohort 2 made of subjects randomized in two groups with a 1:1 ratio. A sub-study Group C will be enrolled and will receive the vaccine by intramuscular route.</detailed_description>
