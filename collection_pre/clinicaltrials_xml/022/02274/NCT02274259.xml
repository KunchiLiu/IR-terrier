	<brief_title>Comparing Injection Frequency Between Aflibercept and Ranibizumab in Patients With CRVO With a Treat&amp; Extend Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty patients diagnosed with a new central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) of a maximum duration of 6 months will be recruited to the study. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with aflibercept ot ranibizumab. all patients will receive 3 initial monthly injections. There after injections will be given att every visit according to a treat and extend schedule. If no macular edema is seen on the Ocular coherent tomography (OCT) examination the next treatment will be after 6 weeks. If the macula is dry after 6 weeks a new injection is given and the next visit is scheduled for another 8 weeks. If edema is seen on the OCT after 8 weeks the time to next injection is reduced to 6 weeks. Patients cannot receive an injection more often than every 4 weeks. All patients will receive an injection at least every 12 weeks. Primary outcome: the number of needed injections over a 18 month period comparing ranibizumab and aflibercept. Secondary outcome: Change in visual acuity, change in macular thickness. A subgroup of patients will also be evaluated with OCT angiography. A possible relationship between the Visual acuity and the foveal avascular zone will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
