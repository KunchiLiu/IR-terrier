	<detailed_description>Background：Based on animal studies, intake of probiotic bacteria was suggested to improve insulin sensitivity by reducing inflammation. Objective ： The objective of this study was to determine the effects of supplementation with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri ADR-1(ADR-1) and Lactobacillus reuteri GMNL-263 (GMNL-263) over six months on metabolic profiles, intestinal microbiota profiles and biomarkers of inflammation in type 2 diabetes patents. Methods ： This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 120 diabetic patients. Subjects were divided into 3 groups: 40 subjects in the group A received placebo, 40 subjects in the group B received ADR-1 (4 x 109 colony-forming units/d), and 40 subjects in the group C received GMNL-263. (2 x 1010 cells/d) for 6 months. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles and biomarkers of inflammation including C reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha( TNF-α). The intestinal microbiota profiles were detected in stool samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).</detailed_description>
