	<brief_title>Bayston Multicenter Antimicrobial PD Catheter Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this clinical investigation is to establish the safety of the Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter in ESRD patients initiating CAPD. The Bayston catheter is not expected to cause any safety related complications or reactions other than those described for not-impregnated peritoneal dialysis catheters. Thus the objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate whether the Bayston catheter causes any unanticipated serious adverse device effects (USADE). The primary hypothesis for this study is that the Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter is a safe catheter for peritoneal dialysis. No claims regarding efficacy will be verified during this clinical investigation. This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center study involving patients suffering from end stage renal disease who are eligible for treatment with peritoneal dialysis. Forty-three (43) patients will be enrolled who will be followed up to 6 months after implantation of the Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter.</detailed_description>
