	<brief_title>Cognitive Motor Interference Rehabilitation in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Walking and cognitive impairments are common in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Approximately 85% of persons with MS report walking as a major limitation, whereas 65% experience cognitive dysfunction. Traditionally, walking and cognition have been viewed as unrelated, but there is evidence of cognitive-motor interference (CMI). CMI is believed to stem from damage to common neural tracts. Recent evidence supports cognitive-motor interference in persons with MS. For example, there is evidence that walking performance declines when performed in conjunction with a simultaneous cognitive task (i.e., dual task cost [DTC] of walking) and this decline in walking performance is greater in persons with MS compared to healthy controls. This elevated cognitive-motor interference during walking is mainly associated with walking performance in persons with MS although cognitive function does play a role. Cognitive-motor interference during mobility tasks is of practical and clinical importance because it has been linked to decreased community mobility and a greater risk of falls in other clinical populations. Despite the adverse consequences of elevated CMI there is ambiguity concerning prevention and rehabilitation strategies for cognitive-motor interference in individuals with MS. This study seeks to examine whether single and/or targeted dual task rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on CMI in individuals with MS. The results of this investigation will provide the foundation for future rehabilitation-based randomized control trials seeking to improve walking and cognitive function in persons with MS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Physician diagnosed MS, relapse free for 30 days, self reporting problems with multitasking We will exclude all individuals with risk factors contraindicative for undertaking strenuous exercise. Participants will verbally respond to a health history questionnaire. Those individuals who are asymptomatic and meet no more than one risk factor threshold including family history of coronary heart disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle will be considered at low risk and included for participation.</criteria>
