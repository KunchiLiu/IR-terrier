	<brief_summary>NovellusDx technology identifies tumor-specific driver mutations, but unlike sequencing-based tests, NovellusDx has a functional assay that detects dis-regulated translocation of mutated signaling proteins to the nucleus. This allows NovellusDx to identify functionally-impactful driver mutations regardless of whether the mutation has previously been described or linked to a tumor type.</brief_summary>
