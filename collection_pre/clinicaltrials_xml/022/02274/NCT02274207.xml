	<criteria>The patient above 20 years and has type I, II of diabetes mellitus foot ulcer Infected ulcer has one of below. 1. clinically infection symptom in ulcer area : warmth, erythema, tenderness/swelling induration, purulent discharge etc. 2. Confirmed case of bacteria in wound culture. 3. Conformed case of abnormal range of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)/Creactive protein(CRP) level in lab. Has to be applied NPWT because suture is impossible in ulcer area. The patient voluntary agreed to this protocol. In the opinion of investigator, It is suitable to participate in this study. Infection in bone so patient need amputation Female with childbearing, lactating or not agree to prevent pregnancy. Has Sepsis, Osteomyelitis Has Connective tissue disease of disturbance of healing of wound Ex) Rheumarthritis,systemic lupus erythematosus(SEL), myalgia. The patient to diagnosis of Sickle sell disease or Charcot's joint. The patient stability treated chronic wasting disease. Malignant tumor or history of malignant disease. (Not diagnosis of complete recovery.) The patient treated chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunesuppressants therapy,adrenocortical hormones therapy. Although necrosis tissue is removed, the target ulcer did not heal because of gangrenous, necrosis tissue or purulent pyorrhea. Has ulcer with cardiac arrhythmia thrombus, venous insufficiency, diabetic necrobiosis lipoidic. In case of using prohibited concomitant medications during study. a. Oral system steroid b. Immunesuppressive drug c. Unfractionated heparin infusion d. improper drugs in the opinion of investigator. Hypersensitivity with applicators. (NPWT, Silver) The patient participated in other clinical trials within 30 days In the opinion of investigator, the patient is not suitable to participate in this study.</criteria>
