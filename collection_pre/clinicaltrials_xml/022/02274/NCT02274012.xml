	<brief_summary>The investigators are doing this research program to find out if the investigational drug, afatinib which is a medication known to block the function of the ErbB2 protein might help standard chemotherapy, in particular paclitaxel, work better. Afatinib (GILOTRIF) is a highly potent, irreversible inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2. On July 12, 2013 the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved afatinib for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors had specific EGFR gene mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 i.e. L858R substitution mutations) as detected by an FDA approved test. Paclitaxel is a standard, anti-cancer medicine that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of lung cancer. The combination of Afatinib and Paclitaxel are considered investigational when used in this research program. An investigational drug is a drug that is not approved by the FDA for its indication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Afatinib in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel in the Second Line Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard Procedures: Subjects are offered second line chemotherapy with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Experimental Procedures: In addition to the standard chemotherapy, afatinib 40 mg orally once daily will be administered starting on the first day of paclitaxel. Translational studies to assess circulating tumor cells at the start of therapy and then at several later time points, including at the time of progression. These studies will assess the correlation of circulating tumor cell numbers with radiographic response and pilot studies will also be conducted to assess HER2 expression, HER2 genomic amplification, HER2 pathway activation and secondary genetic changes in the HER2 coding sequence as well as other pathway components.</detailed_description>

Willingness to consent to the use of baseline diagnostic tumor specimen for correlative studies. Squamous cell carcinoma. History of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities within 6 months. Baseline (less than 1 month before treatment) cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction of less than 50 percent measured by multigated blood pool imaging of the heart (MUGA scan) or echocardiogram.

Prior treatment with afatinib or any other HER2 inhibitor other than trastuzumab. Frontline chemotherapy that did not contain trastuzumab. Active central nervous system disease (CNS) metastases. Planned concurrent anticancer therapy while taking investigational treatment. Unresolved or unstable, serious toxicity from prior cancer treatment (any toxicities greater than grade 2). Peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater Concurrent disease or condition that would make the subject inappropriate for study participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's safety. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.
