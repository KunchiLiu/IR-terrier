	<brief_summary>The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects between 10% to 25% of the adults. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the chosen treatment in moderate and severe OSA. However, the adherence to CPAP varies, and the interface between patient and the CPAP may interfere with adherence, comfort and efficiency. Objectives: (1) to determine which is the preferred airway flow in oral and nasal breathers, (2) to analyze the role of body position on the nasal mucosa and the airways after one night CPAP titration, (3) the effects of nasal and oronasal CPAP on the nasal epithelium and airways, inflammation in nasal lavage and miRNA changes in blood and (4) CPAP adherence after 12 months. Population: 20 patients with moderate/severe OSA recruited at Sleep Laboratory of Heart Institute - Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Type of Breathing and CPAP on Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After agreement with the written informed consent, 40 volunteers (10 healthy volunteers and 20 OSA patients) male and female, aged &gt;21 years will be recruited in the Laboratory of Sleep of the Clinics Hospital and int the School of Medicine. The volunteers will be evaluated in the laboratory of Sleep (Incor) seven times (T). First Phase: volunteers will be assessed for breathing route and assigned to two groups: Group Nasal Breather and oral or oronasal breather. Second: CPAP titration. Third phase: use of CPAP during 30 days after CPAP titration.</detailed_description>
