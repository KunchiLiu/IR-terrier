	<brief_summary>AML 18 is the replacement trial for AML16 intensive. This 1600 patient trial is primarily designed for patients over the age of 60 who are considered fit enough for an intensive chemotherapy approach and will aim to test the effects of adding 1 of 2 new treatment agents to commonly used chemotherapy combinations in order to improve patient survival and treatment regimes. The AML18 Trial is available to any patient who has primary or secondary AML as defined by the WHO Classification (excluding Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia), or high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (i.e. &gt;10% marrow blasts) over the age of 60. AML18 is a randomised controlled Phase III trial using a factorial design for maximum efficiency to evaluate two induction options followed by treatment with a small molecule post course 1 and dose intensification for suitable patients. There are four randomisation comparisons within the trial: The first randomisation will compare standard the chemotherapy schedule Daunorubicin/AraC (DA) combined with 1 or 2 doses of Mylotarg in course 1. Patients not suitable to receive Mylotarg may have DA alone. Following recovery from course 1 patients who fail to achieve CR or are MRD positive by centralised flow cytometry will be randomised to one of three options, either DA chemotherapy, DA chemotherapy plus Cladribine or Flag Ida for up to 2 courses of therapy. Patients who achieve CR after course 1 will be randomised to 1 or 2 further courses of DA chemotherapy. At course 2 all patients will also enter a randomisation to receive AC220 versus no AC220 with or without maintenance, or Ganetespib verses no Ganetespib for a maximum of 3 cycles. Patients will be eligible for a non-intensive allogeneic stem cell transplant if a suitable HLA matched donor is available.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>They have one of the forms of acute myeloid leukaemia, except Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia as defined by the WHO Classification (Appendix A) this can be any type of de novo or secondary AML or high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome, defined as greater than 10% marrow blasts (RAEB2). They should normally be over the age of 60, but patients under this age are eligible if they are not considered eligible for the MRC AML17 trial. They have given written informed consent. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN (upper limit of normal) Patients eligible for the Mylotarg randomisation must have Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 × ULN and bilirubin ≤2.× ULN In order to be eligible to receive cladribine, serum creatinine must be within the local ULN to enter that randomisation. Patients for whom this is not the case can be randomised between the remaining options. Sexually mature males must agree to use an adequate and medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study if their sexual partners are women of child bearing potential (WOCBP). Similarly women must agree to adequate contraceptive measures. In both males and females these measures must be in place for at least 30 days after the last administration of ganetespib and 6 months after the last administration of Cladribine. ECOG Performance Status of 02 Patients are not eligible for the AML18 trial if: They have previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML [Hydroxycarbamide, or similar lowdose therapy, to control the white count prior to initiation of intensive therapy, is not an exclusion] They are in blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) They have a concurrent active malignancy excluding basal cell carcinoma They are pregnant or lactating They have Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Patients with AST or ALT more than 2.5 times the local upper limit of normal, or bilirubin more than twice upper limit of normal, are not eligible for the Mylotarg randomisations. In addition patients are not eligible for the AC220 or Ganetespib randomisation if they have: Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including: A myocardial infarction within 12 months Uncontrolled angina within 6 months Current or history of congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4, unless an echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) performed either within 1 month prior to study screening or during screening results in a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that is ≥ 45% (or institutional lower limit of normal value) Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome. Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes [TdP]); any history of arrhythmia will be discussed with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor prior to patient's entry into the study Prolonged QTcF interval on preentry ECG (≥450 ms) this will be the average of 3 readings within a 2 hour period Any history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if the patient currently has a pacemaker) Heart rate &lt; 50/minute on preentry ECG Uncontrolled hypertension Obligate need for a cardiac pacemaker Complete left bundle branch block Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels should be at least within institutional normal limits, and every effort should be made to keep potassium at institutional normal limits, and every effort should be made to keep magnesium concentrations above 4.0 mEq/dL, and serum calcium at normal concentration.</criteria>
