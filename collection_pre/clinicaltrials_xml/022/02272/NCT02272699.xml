	<brief_summary>Esophageal cancer is one of common malignant tumors in China and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the dominant pathological type, accounting for more than 95% of all cases. One of our phase Ⅱ study introduced a combination treatment of an anti epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) agent, nimotuzumab, with paclitaxel and cisplatin as first-line treatment in unresectable or metastatic ESCC. The results showed that the overall response rate was 51.8% (29/56) and disease control rate was 92.9% (52/56). As a median follow-up of 24 months, the median progression-free survival for patients with metastatic disease and local advanced disease were 8.2 months and more than 23 months respectively. The overall survival for patients with metastatic disease was 13.9 months. It implied that as first-line chemotherapy, an addition of nimotuzumab to chemotherapy was a more active treatment option compared to other regimens published in previous studies. Investigations by Liang, J. and Ling, Y. also suggested that nimotuzumab in combining with radiotherapy or chemotherapy also showed anti-tumor activities and limited toxicities. Therefore, we initiated this phase Ⅱ to Ⅲ clinical trial in which combining neoadjuvant treatments of nimotuzumab with chemotherapy or nimotuzumab with radiotherapy are compared with surgery alone for resectable stage Ⅱa to Ⅲ middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. We hope to explore if these neoadjuvant combination treatments could bring survival benefit for ESCC patients.</brief_summary>
