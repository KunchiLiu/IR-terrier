	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe (xenon) gas MRI for regional assessment of lung function in a normal population of children and adults and in adults and also in children with respiratory compromise due to a variety of diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Hyperpolarized Xenon Gas for Lung Imaging in Children and Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe will be produced, by trained staff, using a polarizer housed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Individual imaging sessions will be done on a single day and will involve administration of (maximum) 1 liter doses (less for children) for up to four MRI scans. Subject will inhale hyperpolarized xenon gas and hold breath for up to 16 seconds during the MRI scans. In addition to 129 Xe MRI, a series of anatomical conventional proton MR images may also be collected. Follow up phone calls will be done one day and 30 days from the MRI date.</detailed_description>
