	<brief_title>Progesterone Amplifies Estrogen-stimulated Growth Hormone Secretion in Older Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The systemic availability and orderly secretion patterns of GH and sex steroids decline in healthy aging men and women. The combined changes have substantial clinical implications to aging-related physical frailty, diminished aerobic capacity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance, and reduced psychosocial wellbeing. Whereas androgen is considered the main trophic (anabolic) sex steroid, recent data demonstrate that certain tissues respond principally to GH and testosterone-derived estradiol, Estrogen (E2) (e.g. bone, brain, liver and pituitary). In principle, frailty may thus be associated with dual GH and sex-steroid deficiencies. Additionally, young, but not older healthy women secrete significant amounts of progesterone for approximately 14 days during the luteal phase of every menstrual cycle. When GH levels rise nearly two fold, the investigators hypothesize that progesterone potentiates the GH response to E2. This hypothesis arises from scattered indirect studies often using synthetic progestins with partial androgen agonism, instead of progesterone per se. Because there is no basis for estimating statistical power for this novel paradigm, 40 women, 10 each in 4 groups, will be studied. The pilot data will be used to calculate statistical power for a definitive R01-based investigation of gender-specific distinctions in estrogen-regulated pituitary-hormone secretion.</detailed_description>
