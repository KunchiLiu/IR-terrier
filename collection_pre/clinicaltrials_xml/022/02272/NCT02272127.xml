	<brief_summary>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are exquisitely sensitive to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) which is widely used in advanced patients. Whether treatment with EGFR-TKIs improves outcomes in patients with resected NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations is still under investigated. This study aims to observe and compare the efficacy and safety of intercalated combination of chemotherapy plus icotinib in patients undergoing resection of EGRF mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer stagingⅠB (with high risk factor) to ⅢA.</brief_summary>
