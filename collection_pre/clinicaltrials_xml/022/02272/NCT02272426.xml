	<brief_summary>It is estimated that 2 out of 3 patients with a stroke have some problems with their memory, difficulties performing certain tasks, making decisions and learning new things. In addition, many stroke patients do not get regular exercise and are often sedentary. Both physical and cognitive exercise have the potential to improve quality of life, cognition, and overall health, but the safety and tolerability of such interventions is not clear in stroke patients. The investigators will examine these outcomes by allocating stroke survivor participants to one of three groups: an exercise program, a combined exercise and cognitive training program and a sham control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Tolerability of an Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Program With or Without Cognitive Training Post-stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is well recognized as the leading cause of disability in the United States. Cognitive deficits after stroke are common, even in those without dementia prior to the event, and stroke patients with worse cognition on hospital admission have worse outcomes. Cognitive deficits contribute to stroke-related disability and mortality. Evidence suggests an interaction between cognitive deficits and physical limitations, and cognitive rehabilitation may improve functional outcomes post stroke. Recent data also suggest that both cognitive training and exercise interventions improve cognition in stroke patients, but few randomized trials of these interventions, alone or in combination, have been conducted. We will study the effects of a Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training (CARET) program, and the combination of the CARET and CTI interventions on the primary outcome of safety, feasibility, and adherence among ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke survivors with mild to moderate disability. We hypothesize that these interventions are safe and tolerable, and that they will lead to improvements in our secondary outcomes of cognitive performance and quality of life. We will also explore the role of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor in cognitive changes related to the physical exercise intervention.</detailed_description>
