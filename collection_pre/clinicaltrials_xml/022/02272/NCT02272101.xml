	<brief_summary>A study of the role of vitamin D in elderly subjects with perennial and/or nonallergic rhinitis. The hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation will improve rhinitis symptoms and rhinitis related quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rhinitis in the Elderly: The Role of Vitamin D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhinitis in the elderly is poorly understood as this group of patients has been ignored in almost all rhinitis studies. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common, especially in the elderly. Vitamin D may play an important role in respiratory disease as shown by studies in asthma. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study. The investigators will look for the effect of vitamin D 4,000 I.U/day vs. placebo for six weeks on symptom scores and rhinitis related quality of life. This study will be performed in the period Nov. 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014, to try to avoid seasonal fluctuations of serum vitamin D due to sun exposure. The investigators will also look for possible associations between serum vitamin D at baseline and study subjects demographics, treatment, and symptom scores.</detailed_description>
