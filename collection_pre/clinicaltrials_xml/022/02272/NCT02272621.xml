	<brief_summary>This is a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement (AVR) at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden will be eligible. Twenty patients will be randomly assigned to either partial upper sternotomy (20 patients) or full sternotomy AVR (20 patients). Inclusion criteria is severe aortic stenosis referred for medically indicated isolated aortic valve replacement. Exclusion criteria are left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.45, previous cardiac surgery, or urgent/emergent surgery. CE-marked and FDA-approved mechanical and bioprosthetic (stented or sutureless) aortic valves will be implanted. Cytokine release will be repeatedly assessed preoperatively and postoperatively (at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours, and 3 days after surgery). Clinical characteristics will be registered. Clinical postoperative ouytcomes will be registered. Routine blood sampling will be performed pre- and postoperatively. All available data will be collected prospectively. Informed consent will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion criteria before the initiation of any study-specific procedures.</brief_summary>
