	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test a standard mailed intervention (SI) versus a novel decision support and navigation intervention (DSNI). Working with patients and stakeholders, this randomized trial will include 400 Hispanic men and women who are 50 to 75 years of age, patients in community based primary care practices, and are eligible for CRC screening. We will consent, survey, and randomize participants either to the SI Group (n=200) or the DSNI Group (n=200). Study specific aims are to: (1) Assess intervention (DSNI versus SI) impact on overall CRC screening adherence; (2)Assess intervention (DNSI versus SI) impact on CRC screening decision stage; (3) Assess intervention (DNSI versus SI) impact on test-specific CRC screening adherence; and (4) Assess intervention (DNSI versus SI) impact on CRC and knowledge and perceptions.</brief_summary>
