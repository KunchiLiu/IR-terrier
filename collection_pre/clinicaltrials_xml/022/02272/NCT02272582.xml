	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Use of SOMVC001 (GALA) Vascular Conduit Preservation Solution in Patients Undergoing CABG (STEPS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Saphenous vein (SV) harvesting will be performed using an open or endoscopic vein harvesting technique. Once harvested, the SV will be divided into segments and these vein segments from each patient to be immersed in one of two blinded solutions: SOMVC001 or heparin dosed saline. The patients will then be randomized and SVG segment allocations will be defined and grafted to the assigned target regions. Imaging, using 64-slice or better MDCT, will be completed 4-6 weeks and 3 months post surgery (CABG) procedure.</detailed_description>
