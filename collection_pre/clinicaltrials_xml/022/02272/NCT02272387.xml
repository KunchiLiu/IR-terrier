	<brief_summary>Our primary aim is to evaluate whether Vitamin D deficiency causes depressive symptoms in antepartum and postpartum depression and whether early correction of Vitamin D deficiency improves these symptoms. Our secondary aims evaluate maternal and fetal outcomes including antepartum, intrapartum, and immediate postpartum complications. We are also evaluating the effectiveness of a common vitamin D treatment regimen used outside of pregnancy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Vitamin D Insufficiency and Deficiency Associated With Antepartum and Postpartum Depression?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study recruitment will be at a single center in our pregnant private and clinic population. We will recruit eligible pregnant women 20 weeks 0 days or less. On study entry, patients will complete a demographic survey, vitamin D exposure survey, and an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS) questionnaire. Baseline vitamin D levels will be obtained using a 25 OH D (vitamin D) assay. Women found to be vitamin D deficient/insufficient will be approached for randomization to vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU/week x 8 weeks + prenatal vitamin versus placebo + prenatal vitamin. A repeat 25 OH D sample plus a vitamin D exposure and EPDS questionnaires will be obtained between 24-28 weeks gestation upon completing treatment. All patients will then be kept on maintenance vitamin D until delivery (total vitamin D 800IU/day which includes prenatal vitamin). Delivery 25 OH D samples will be collected on all women. At delivery, these women will also complete vitamin D exposure and EPDS questionnaires. Maternal and fetal outcome data will be collected on all patients. As for vitamin D sufficient patients, they will be followed with vitamin D exposure and EPDS questionnaires at 24-28 weeks and delivery. A 25 OH D sample will be obtained at delivery for these women. Maternal and fetal outcome data will be obtained. For vitamin D deficient women declining randomization, they will be given vitamin D repletion based on their preference after counseling. We will continue to follow their questionnaires and outcomes similarly to the vitamin D sufficient group.</detailed_description>
