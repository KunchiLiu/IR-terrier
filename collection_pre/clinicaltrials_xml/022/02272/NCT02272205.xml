	<brief_summary>Infection is a serious complications after undergoing total hip replacement. It occurs in about 1% of cases. The optimal treatment of these infections is discussed. The team validated by international publications change strategy of the infected prosthesis at a time. Antibiotic prophylaxis has significantly reduced the infection intraoperative contamination in orthopedic surgery rates. It must be conventionally administered before the surgical incision. In response to infection, it is typically recommended to start this antibiotic after the completion of the deep bacteriological samples, so as not to negate the risk of these samples by the prior administration of antibiotics. This attitude, however, is not formally validated by the scientific literature. In contrast, two recent publications challenge this practice, and suggest the use of a conventional antibiotic prophylaxis even in septic interventions. Our multidisciplinary team opted for a few months for this new strategy. We wish to evaluate the influence of this new approach results in the treatment of infection in total hip or knee.</brief_summary>
