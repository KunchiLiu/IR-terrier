	<brief_summary>Study part 1 will consist of sensory evoked cortical potential (SEP) measurements of the lower urinary tract (LUT) in healthy subjects using different stimulation frequencies from 0.25 to 3Hz to find the most effective frequency in regard to acquisition time for reliable SEP response rates. Study part 2 will consist of a series of consecutive SEP measurements in patients with LUT symptoms during low bladder volume and maximum cystometric capacity to assess reliability of measurements and influence of potential concomitant LUTS treatments.</brief_summary>
