	<brief_summary>In this randomized controlled phase III study the investigators will evaluate whether TIL infusion preceded by non-myeloablative chemotherapy and followed by high dose bolus interleukin-2 can result in an improved progression free survival when randomly compared to ipilimumab in 168 stage IV melanoma patients. A health technology assessment (HTA) will be performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational processes and cost-effectivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing TIL to Standard Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized controlled phase III study the investigators will evaluate whether TIL infusion preceded by non-myeloablative chemotherapy and followed by high dose bolus interleukin-2 can result in an improved progression free survival when randomly compared to ipilimumab in 168 stage IV melanoma patients. A health technology assessment (HTA) will be performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational processes and cost-effectivity. This will be done via questionnaires at baseline, just after treatment and during follow-up. Also healthcare providers will be interviewed after 6 months after starting the trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed unresectable AJCC stage III or stage IV melanoma Patients must have metastatic melanoma with a resectable metastatic lesion(s) of sufficient size (≥ 23 cm in total) and must be willing to undergo such a resection for experimental purposes. Patients should have received maximum one line of systemic therapy (except for ipilimumab) for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.[ Patients must be ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years of age and must have measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria (in addition to the resected lesion). Patients must have a clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice a highly effective method of birth control during treatment and for four months after receiving the preparative regimen. Patients must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent document. Life expectancy of less than three months. Patients with metastatic ocular/ mucosal or other noncutaneous melanoma. Adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab within 6 months prior to randomization. Requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive drugs within the last 3 weeks prior to randomization. Patients who have a more than two CNS metastases. Patients who have any CNS lesion that is symptomatic, greater than 1 cm in diameter or show significant surrounding edema on MRI scan will not be eligible until they have been treated and demonstrated no clinical or radiologic CNS progression for at least 2 months. All patients' toxicities due to prior nonsystemic treatment must have recovered to a grade 1 or less. Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures or focal palliative radiotherapy (to nontarget lesions) within the past 4 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant. Any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical illnesses. Any autoimmune disease</criteria>
