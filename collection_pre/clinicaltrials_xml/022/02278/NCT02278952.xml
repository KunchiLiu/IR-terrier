	<brief_summary>This is a non-interventional cohort study to assess a novel assay to detect excessive or insufficient immunosuppression from the drug tacrolimus in lung transplant recipients. The assay measures mean residual expression (MRE) of genes downstream of NFAT, a transcription factor regulated by tacrolimus. The investigators will assess whether MRE levels identify subjects at risk for rejection (insufficient immunosuppression) or infection (excessive immunosuppression).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: The study will include lung allograft recipients within 2 months of transplantation at UCSF. Exclusion criteria: Subjects will be excluded who are (a) unable to provide consent of (b) if treating clinicians do not anticipate subject will start on tacrolimus. Recruitment and enrollment in this study are targeted equally between women and minorities and the study will not exclude and gender or racial/ethnic group.
