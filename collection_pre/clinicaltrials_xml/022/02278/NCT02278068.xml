	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to collect information about a new treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), using a medical device called the Metabolic Neuromodulation System which is intended to help regulate blood glucose levels in patients whose (T2DM) is not well controlled despite treatment with multiple medications. The medical device delivers low-level radiofrequency energy through the wall of the blood vessel to the liver to disrupt the nerves that lead to the liver. Previous research has shown that disrupting these nerves may lead to a lowering of blood sugar levels.</brief_summary>
