	<brief_summary>During fthe first postoperative days, physiotherapists supported patients with knee replacement in orthopaedics of Saint-Junien's and Limoges' hospitals. This support includes movements of the leg in active and non active motions, without any help and with an arthromotor, and involves walking rehabilitation. The investigators would like to complete the physiotherapist's support with manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) using a specific method based on pressure of finger splayed (PFS). This might have a positive impact on time recovery of joint range, on postoperative oedema resorbtion and on patient's pain during rehabilitation classes. French National Authority for Health specifies there is not a single study assessing massage effects on knee replacement, according to current bibliography. The investigators purpose is the establishment of a prospective, controlled, randomised trial referred as a "superiority" trial. A total of 98 patients divided in 2 parallel groups will be created. The study will be in an open-label manner for both patient and physiotherapist involved in walk rehabilitation but will be conducted as a blinded study for the investigating physiotherapist. Inclusion period will be 17 months and the following period will be 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
