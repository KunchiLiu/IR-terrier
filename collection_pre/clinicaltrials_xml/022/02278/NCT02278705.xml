	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify whether specific clinical practices—including, body-mass-index (BMI) screening, identifying weight-related conditions (such as high blood pressure), and scheduling follow-up visits to reassess progress—will improve the weight status of overweight school-age children at one-year follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Care Clinical Practice Elements and Improving Overweight Children's Weight Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to identify specific clinical practice elements in pediatric primary care that predict improvement in weight status among overweight school-age children. Pediatricians are well-suited to regularly assess and treat school-age children who are overweight. Well-child visits present an important opportunity to assess and treat overweight children. Strategies are needed to maximize the effectiveness of this opportunity. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses recommendations by the United States Preventive Services Task Force that clinicians screen for overweight, assess medical/behavior risk, and use a staged treatment approach that includes frequent reassessment, it is unclear whether these practices, when used in primary care, impact whether children make lifestyle changes or improve their weight status. It is essential to identify specific clinical practice elements and communication strategies associated with weight-status improvement in overweight children, to maximize the effectiveness of primary-care weight-management interventions. The investigators hypothesize that conducting BMI screening, assessing weight-related comorbidities (including elevated blood pressure, acanthosis nigricans, and elevations in fasting blood glucose, lipids, and liver enzymes), and scheduling one or more interim visits to reassess progress (with a weight-related diagnosis among the top three diagnoses or by referring to a weight-management specialist or nutritionist) in overweight, 6-12 year-old primary care patients will predict improvement in weight status (assessed as decrease in BMI standard deviation score [BMI z-score]) at one-year follow-up.</detailed_description>
