	<brief_summary>Low back pain (LBP) is a complex and common problem with major societal repercussions. Clinical evaluations, and especially functional assessments, are necessary for proper diagnosis and decisions on the most appropriate treatment. The assessment of lumbar kinematics has been frequently described. For instance, measures of range of motion (ROM), angular velocities and acceleration of the total lumbar spine (TLx) have demonstrated some differences between healthy subjects and LBP patients. However, recent evidence has suggested that models evaluating the TLx are insufficient. In fact, regional differences in kinematics have been described between the upper lumbar spine and the lower lumbar spine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in spinal kinematics between healthy subjects and LBP patients using a multi-segment model of the spine that allows regional analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Spinal Kinematics Between Asymptomatic Subjects and Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A case-controlled study will be performed to compare asymptomatics subjects and patients with low back pain. ROM, angular velocities and coordination of the spine will be collected in a laboratory with a camera-based system (VICON). Subjects will have to perform normal ROM assessment in the three anatomical planes, as well as different functional activities such as sit to stand, step and walking. The measurement session will occur on one occasion for each participant.</detailed_description>
