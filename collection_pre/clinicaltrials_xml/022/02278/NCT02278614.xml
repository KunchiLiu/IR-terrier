	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of T2347 (Latanoprost 0.005% + Timolol 0.5% unpreserved eye drops) versus Xalacom® in ocular hypertensive or glaucomatous patients initially treated, stabilised by Xalacom® or generics (fixed combination Latanoprost 0.005% + Timolol 0.5% preserved eye drops).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed and dated informed consent, Male or female aged &gt; 18 years old, Both eyes with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension already treated and controlled by Xalacom® or generics (fixed combination Latanoprost 0.005% + Timolol 0.5% preserved eye drops) since at least 2 months. IOP ≤ 18 mmHg in both eyes History of IOP insufficiently controlled with firstline monotherapy based on the investigator judgement (e.g. non reaching the target IOP) History of an addon IOP reduction with Xalacom® or generics (fixed combination Latanoprost 0.005% + Timolol 0.5% preserved eye drops) in comparison with firstline treatment Corneal thickness ≥ 500 μm and ≤ 600 μm in both eyes. Ophthalmic exclusion criteria (in either eye) Fundoscopy, VF not performed or not available within the 6 months before inclusion visit. Significant worsening according to the two last VF (minimum 6 months between these 2 VF) Advanced stage of glaucoma: Best far corrected visual acuity ≤ 1/10. History of trauma, infection, clinically significant inflammation within the 3 months before inclusion visit. Ongoing or known history of ocular seasonal and perennial allergy (SAC, PAC) and/or uveitis and/or viral infection. Presence of at least one severe objective sign among the following: Hyperaemia (Grade 5) Superficial punctate keratitis (Grade 3) Blepharitis (Grade 3) Severe dry eye (defined by severe epithelial erosions of the cornea and/or use of dry eye medication with a frequency exceeding 8 instillations / day). Corneal ulceration. Palpebral abnormalities not related to medical treatment study and incompatible with a good evaluation. History of corneal refractive surgery. Any abnormality preventing accurate assessment e.g. reliable tonometry measurement, visual field examination. Systemic/non ophthalmic exclusion criteria Noncontrolled diabetic patient. Reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, sinoatrial block, second or third degree atrioventricular block not controlled with pacemaker, overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock.

Any medical or surgical history, disorder or disease such as acute or chronic severe organic disease: hepatic, endocrine, neoplastic, haematological; immunosuppressive, infectious diseases, severe psychiatric illness, relevant cardiovascular abnormalities, etc… and/or any complicating factor or structural abnormality, judged by the investigator to be incompatible with the study. Specific exclusion criteria for women Pregnancy, lactation. Childbearing potential woman who is not using a reliable method of contraception Exclusion criteria related to general conditions Inability of patient to understand the study procedures and thus inability to give informed consent. Noncompliant patient Participation in another clinical study with investigational drug within the last 3 months. Already included once in this study.
