	<brief_title>A Comparison of the Neurocognitive and Metabolic Effects of Fructose, Glucose, High Fructose Corn Syrup and Sucrose at Normal Population Consumed Levels in Adults Ages 20-60 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed description (Why and How?) Fructose is known to be metabolized differently than the other common monosaccharides. In addition to the well know lipogenic effects, more recent evidence has shown that the acute changes in hormones and metabolic parameters that control appetite and energy regulation when with fructose consumption may promote caloric overconsumption and, in the long-term, weight gain and deteriorations in insulin sensitivity. However, fructose is rarely consumed in isolation, but instead is consumed in combination with other sugars (with glucose in the case of the two most common sources of fructose: high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose, or as part of a mixed macronutrient meal. As such, the practical significance of these short-term findings of isolated monosaccharide consumption is limited. AIM 1: investigate the response to ten weeks of daily consumption of typical levels of different fructose containing sugars and glucose on measures of glucose and insulin metabolism. AIM 2: To investigate whether ten weeks of daily consumption changes the fat content of the liver, skeletal muscles or abdomen.</detailed_description>
