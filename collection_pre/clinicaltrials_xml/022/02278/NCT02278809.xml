	<brief_title>Promoting Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors in Schoolchildren: an Online Video Intervention for Parents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current project aims to develop, test and implement online videos to teach effective parenting skills to parents of primary schoolchildren. This way we want to achieve health profit by stimulating PA en healthy diet, and reducing SB in children. The online videos, based on existing literature and focus group research, show parents via modeling how they can react in difficult parenting situations related to PA, SB and healthy diet. In the current study, these videos will first be tested in an effect and process evaluation study. 300 families with at least one primary schoolchild will be recruited and randomized into an intervention/control group. By using a survey at the pre-, post- and follow-up test, we will examine if parenting practices become more effective, if related parental self-efficacy enhances and if children perform more healthy behaviors after their parents watched the videos.</detailed_description>
