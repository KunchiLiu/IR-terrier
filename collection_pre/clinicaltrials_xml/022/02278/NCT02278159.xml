	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate which home dialysis modality pattern (home hemodialysis [HHD], peritoneal dialysis [PD] or a combination of both, e.g. PD and then HHD) allows for the longest home dialysis survival, as defined by the time dialysed in a home environment. The investigators hypothesize that patients transferred from one home modality to another will have a longer home dialysis survival compared to patients treated only with PD or HHD.</brief_summary>
