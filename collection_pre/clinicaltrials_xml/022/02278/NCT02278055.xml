	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if Radium-223 is effective in reducing cancer pain within 12 weeks of treatment. In order to see if Radium-223 is effective, the patient's level of pain will be followed throughout the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males aged 18 years of age and above Histological or cytological proof of prostate adenocarcinoma Castrate serum testosterone level: ≤50 ng/dL (≤1.7 nmol/L) Patients who have experienced disease progression despite initial hormonal therapy, either by orchiectomy or by using a GnRH agonist in combination with an antiandrogen, must first progress through anti androgen withdrawal prior to being eligible. The minimum time frame to document failure of antiandrogen withdrawal will be four weeks. Patients on secondline (or beyond) hormonal maneuvers, and patients who had no PSA decline on combined androgen blockade as first line therapy, need not progress through AAW in order to be eligible. Known progressive castrationresistant disease, defined as: Serum PSA progression defined as two consecutive increases in PSA over a previous reference value within 6 months of first treatment, each measurement at least one week apart. Serum PSA at screening ≥ 2 ng/mL or Documented appearance of new lesions by bone scintigraphy ECOG Performance Status of 02 2 or more bone metastases demonstrated on bone scintigraphy Pain at baseline as measured by a BPI worst pain score average of ≥ 3. The BPI worst pain score average will be based on the worst pain scores completed by the patient in the 7 consecutive pretreatment days. A minimum of 4 days of pain scores must be completed by the patient in the 7 day window in order to calculate the average worst pain score. The investigator will optimize the subject's pain regimen prior to study entry. Normal organ function with acceptable initial laboratory values: WBC ≥ 3 x 109 /L ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109 /L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Albumin &gt; 25 g/L All acute toxicities as a result of any prior treatment must have resolved to NCICTCAE v4.0 Grade 1 or less at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) [Note: Ongoing grade 2 neuropathy as a result of treatment with a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen is permitted] Life expectancy of at least 6 months Willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the release of personal health information NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be either included in the informed consent or obtained separately Willing and able to comply with the protocol, including followup visits, examinations as well as having the ability to selfreport pain and fatigue using a Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument Willingness to use adequate methods of contraception beginning at the signing of the ICF until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug Prior exposure to Radium223 Received an investigational therapy within the 4 weeks prior to registration or is scheduled to receive one during the treatment period Received a new anticancer agent within 4 weeks prior to registration Received external beam radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior registration Received systemic therapy with radionuclides (e.g. strontium89, samarium153, rhenium186 or rhenium188) for the treatment of bone metastases Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to registration Symptomatic nodal disease, i.e. scrotal, penile or leg edema. Visceral metastases (including cerebral metastases) from CRPC (&gt;2 lung and/or liver metastases [size ≥2cm]; Lymphadenopathy exceeding 6 cm in shortaxis diameter or any size pelvic lymphadenopathy if it is thought to be a contributor to concurrent hydronephrosis), as assessed by CT, MRI or chest Xray within the 8 weeks prior registration. Concurrent chemotherapy. Patients may be on other nonchemotherapy anticancer treatments, per FDA labeling of Radium223, provided that these are not changed during the primary pain assessment period Major surgery within 30 days prior to registration. Imminent spinal cord compression based on clinical findings and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment should be completed for spinal cord compression. Patients with a, "currently active," second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers or noninvasive bladder cancers or other insitu or noninvasive malignancies. Patients who have completed therapy for a prior malignancy and are free of disease for ≥3 years are eligible. Any other serious illness or medical condition, such as but not limited to: Any infection ≥ National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) version 4.03 Grade 2 Cardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Bone marrow dysplasia Fecal incontinence Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for trial participation NOTE: Any patient found to be ineligible prior to treatment initiation will require rescreening.</criteria>
