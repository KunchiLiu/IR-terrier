	<criteria>Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months). Diagnosis of recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Histologic or cytologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required. Patients must have measurable disease defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter (LD) greater than or equal to 10 mm using CT, MRI, or caliper measurements or greater than or equal to 20 mm with xray. Patients must have at least one target lesion to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1. Prior therapy: Patients must have had at least one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing Carboplatin, Cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound. This initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents (including antiangiogenesis agents) or extended therapy (i.e. maintenance therapy) administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment. Patients are allowed to have previously received, but are not required to receive, one or two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent disease. Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinum based regimen for management of primary disease), must have a platinumfree interval of at least 6 months. Patients must not have received any noncytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease, except hormonal based therapy is allowed. Patients are allowed to have previously received, but are not required to have received noncytotoxic therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen. ECOG score of 01. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function Patients who have progressed during initial platinumbased therapy in the upfront setting, who have persistent disease after this initial platinumbased therapy, or who have recurrence less than 6 months from adjuvant chemotherapy are excluded. Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days before start of study medication. Patients who have received wide field radiotherapy less than or equal to 4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy Patients who have received any continuous or intermittent small molecule therapeutics (excluding monoclonal antibodies) greater than or equal to 5 effective halflives prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy. Patients who have received chemotherapy or targeted anticancer therapy greater than or equal to 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycinC, and 1 week for hormone therapy) prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy. Active concurrent primary malignancy or prior malignancies occurring within 3 years (except cervical carcinoma insitu, treated basal cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumor. Use of any investigational drugs, biologics, or devices within 28 days prior to study enrollment. Prior use of regorafenib. Strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and therapeutic anticoagulation with VitaminK antagonists (e.g. warfarin) or with heparins and heparinoids Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg or diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive diagnosis with a CD4 count of &lt;100 mm3 or detectable viral load within the past 3 months, and is receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Active or clinically significant cardiac disease Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Any hemorrhage or bleeding event â‰¥ NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior to start of study medication. Subjects with thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial events, such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of start of study treatment. Patients with pheochromocytoma Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors. Ongoing infection Presence of a nonhealing wound, nonhealing ulcer, or bone fracture Patient's with a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria must have less than Grade 3 proteinuria per NCI CTCAE v4.0 at screening. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g. active or uncontrolled infection) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of drug (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).</criteria>
