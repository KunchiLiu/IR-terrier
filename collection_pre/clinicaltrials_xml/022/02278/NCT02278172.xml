	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to identify if vitamin D3 supplementation influences VO2max in athletes. Secondary aims are to determine if vitamin D3 supplementation impacts on measures of muscle function, lung function, body composition, immune function and the self-reported incidence of upper respiratory tract infection. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial is of parallel design and will aim to recruit a total of 50 athletes randomised into either a placebo or treatment group for a 12-week intervention.</brief_summary>
