	<brief_summary>In this investigator-initiated study, we will compare changes in brain cognitive biomarkers assessed by diffusion tensor imaging over 2.5 years among 12 patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) receiving rasagiline, 20 IPD patients not receiving MAO-B inhibitors and 25 age-matched healthy controls. Will also compare the changes in Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with changes in brain cognitive biomarkers in all IPD patients and HC over 2.5 years.</brief_summary>
