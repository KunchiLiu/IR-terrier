	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of single-agent VX-803 administered twice-weekly (BIW) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This investigation is a three part study examining VX-803 alone and in combination with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and cisplatin to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part A: Subjects with one histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant advanced solid tumor, for which no standard therapy is available which may convey clinical benefit Part B: Subjects with one histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant advanced solid tumor, for which no standard therapy is available which may convey clinical benefit and/or subjects must have progressed after at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting, and for which carboplatin (for Part B1), gemcitabine (for Part B2), or cisplatin (for Part B3) would be considered standard of care. Part C: Subjects with advanced (locally advanced incurable or metastatic) histologically or cytologically confirmed highgrade serous ovarian cancer (high nuclear Grades 2 or 3). Subjects should have either platinumrefractory (disease progression during initial platinum therapy) or platinumresistant (disease progression &lt;6 months after completion of platinum therapy) disease. Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1) WHO performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks Hematological and biochemical indices within acceptable ranges at Screening. Radiotherapy, unless brief course for palliative therapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy during the 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and MitomycinC, and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products) or 4 drug halflives before first dose of study drug, whichever is greater Part B: More than 6 cycles of prior therapy with carboplatin Parts B1, B3, and C: During prior platinum therapy, requirement for dose reduction or discontinuation of carboplatin or cisplatin for toxicity or lack of tolerability Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the investigator should not exclude the subject a. Any known history of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with any prior chemotherapy regimen Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, treated, stable, and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug Female subjects who are already pregnant or lactating, or plan to become pregnant within 6 months of the last dose of study drug are excluded. Female subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to contraception guidelines. Female subjects will be considered to be of nonchildbearing potential if they have undergone surgical hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or have been amenorrheic for over 2 years with a screening serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females. Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must agree to adhere to contraception guidelines. Men with pregnant or lactating partners or partners who plan to become pregnant during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study drug are excluded. Major surgery ≤4 weeks before first dose of study drug or incomplete recovery from a prior major surgical procedure Serious comorbid medical conditions, including clinicallysignificant cardiac disease</criteria>
