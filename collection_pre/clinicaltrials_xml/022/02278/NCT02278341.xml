	<brief_summary>This study is conducted to explore a new therapy for anemia in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Anemia is a reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin (which contains iron) is important for the transport of oxygen in your blood. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if roxadustat is effective and safe in the maintenance treatment of anemia in ESRD patients on stable dialysis. Roxadustat will be compared to epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, commercially available medicines for treatment of anemia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Inclusion: Subject is on stable hemodialysis (HD), hemodiafiltration (HDF) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment with the same mode of dialysis for ≥4 months prior to randomization. Subject is on IV or SC epoetin or IV or SC darbepoetin alfa treatment for ≥8 weeks prior to randomization with stable weekly doses (during 4 weeks prior to randomization). Mean of the subject's three most recent Hb values, as measured by central laboratory, during the Screening Period. Subject's alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are ≤3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin (TBL) is ≤1.5 x ULN. Main Exclusion: Subject has received a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 8 weeks prior to randomization. Subject has a known hereditary hematologic disease such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, pure red cell aplasia, or other known causes for anemia other than Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Subject has had a myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, seizure, or a thrombotic/thromboembolic event (e.g., deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Subject has had uncontrolled hypertension, in the opinion of the investigator, within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Subject has a history of malignancy, except for the following: cancers determined to be cured or in remission for ≥5 years, curatively resected basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, cervical cancer in situ, or resected colonic polyps. Subject has had any prior organ transplant (that has not been explanted), or subject is scheduled for organ transplantation.</criteria>
