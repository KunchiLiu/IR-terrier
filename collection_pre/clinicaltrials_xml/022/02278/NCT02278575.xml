	<brief_title>Atenativ Effect on Uterine Blood Flow and Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be an open controlled pilot study of 6 patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. Patients will receive Atenativ in addition to conventional therapy The patients will be followed up within the study until three days after delivery. In addition to conventional therapy, i.v. administration of Atenativ will be given in a dosage aimed to raise the plasma level of AT initially to 120% (1.2 kIU/L) The goal is to achieve and maintain plasma activity of about 100% during two weeks. The dose of Atenativ is based on the actual plasma level of AT measured 2 hours before the dose. During the first two days of treatment plasma samples will be drawn for the measurement of AT activity twice a day, once before and 12 hours after infusion in order to monitor the dosage. Thereafter and until study discontinuation AT will be measured once a day. The treatment will continue for two weeks if plasma AT III is below 100% (1.0 kIU/L).Uterine blood flow is measured before, during and after the AT infusion. Demographic data, medical history and other background data (age, weight, height, gestational week, smoker or not, gravidity, parity, previous hypertension, previous medication etc) will be recorded in order to ensure that the inclusion criteria are met and to verify patient identity and inclusion status. The week of gestation when the patient is included in the study as well as the week of gestation at delivery is recorded. The type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean section as well as planned or acute) will also be recorded.. General haemostatic parameters are to be analyzed before start of treatment and then every day during treatment and thereafter at least twice a week. Special haemostatic parameters are Placental growth factor, S-Flt-1, VEGF and Syndecan-1. They will be sampled before start of treatment and during treatment once a week. The samples will be collected and frozen and not analyzed before the termination of the study.</detailed_description>
