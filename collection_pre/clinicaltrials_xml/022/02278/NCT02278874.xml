	<brief_summary>The objectives of the clinical study are to demonstrate the accuracy of our proprietary algorithm method to determine the genetic health of the developing fetuses in a multiple gestation pregnancy from a maternal blood sample. The long term goal of this study will be the development of a method of minimally invasive prenatal diagnosis that has a higher sensitivity and lower false positive rate in the intended population (e.g. multiple gestation pregnancies) than other currently available screening tests. This will result in fewer unnecessary amniocenteses and CVS procedures, which are associated with a risk of miscarriage.</brief_summary>
