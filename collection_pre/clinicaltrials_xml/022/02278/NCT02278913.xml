	<brief_title>Basal Bolus Versus Human Insulin in Hospitalized Patients With Diabetes in Paraguay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few randomized intervention inpatient trials have been conducted in Latin America to determine optimal treatment regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes. In the absence of regional guidelines, most international societies in Latin America recommend following international guidelines for the management of hospitalized patients with diabetes. However, hospital resources, admission cause and inpatient glycemic control differ among countries. In the US, the leading cause of admission to the hospital in patients with diabetes is cardiovascular disease, whereas infections and acute complications of diabetes are more common than cardiovascular disease in some countries. The safety and efficacy of insulin regimens in non-ICU setting in Latin countries have not been determined. Objective: to compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus regimen using insulin analogs with glargine once daily plus glulisine before meals to human insulin with NPH twice daily and regular insulin before meals in medicine patients with type 2 diabetes Outcome measures. To determine differences in glycemic control between groups as measured by mean daily BG concentration during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included differences between treatment groups in any of the following measures: number of hypoglycemic events (BG &lt;70 mg/dL and &lt;40 mg/dL), total daily dose of insulin, length of hospital stay, hospital complications and mortality.</detailed_description>
