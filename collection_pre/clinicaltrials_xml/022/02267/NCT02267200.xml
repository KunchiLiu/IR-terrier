	<brief_title>The Screening and Analysis of Plasma Biomarkers in Irreversible PAH-CHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>predict to recruit 100 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)associated with CHD，under the commitment of the children's parents，take 3-4ml central venous blood before the corrective surgery，then calculate the number of the circulating endothelial cells by flow cytometer AND detect the expression of micro RNAs to screen out the biomarker，through the 6 months follow-up, separated the reversible and irreversible PAH,then to carry on the statistics.</detailed_description>
