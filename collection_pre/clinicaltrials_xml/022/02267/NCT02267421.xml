	<brief_summary>Individuals with Cirrhosis have been shown to have a low aerobic capacity. While supervised exercise training has been shown to be an effective intervention to remedy this, there is currently no data on home based exercise interventions in this population. This study will evaluate the effects of a home based exercise program on the aerobic capacity of enrolled early stage liver cirrhosis patients, as well as changes in quality of life, thigh muscle thickness, and thigh muscle oxygen consumption.</brief_summary>
