	<brief_summary>This project will bring together a multidisciplinary team of pediatric rheumatologists, neurologists, metabolic geneticists and exercise physiologists to determine the effect of creatine (CR) supplementation on muscle function and muscle metabolism in children with Dermatomyositis (DM). The investigators propose using well-established exercise testing techniques as well as new, powerful exercise imaging protocols in order to better delineate the effects of CR on muscle pathophysiology in a non-invasive way. Evidence from this study will provide information regarding the effect of creatine supplementation on muscle function in DM. Improvements in muscle function and fatigue through CR use may also contribute to an improvement in quality of life and have significant clinical implications for the treatment of children with DM.</brief_summary>
