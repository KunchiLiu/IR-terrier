	<brief_summary>The study has the objective to compare two different methodology of application the antiseptic on the oral biofilm will be formed during 48h in situ on a specific device. The first one using the immersion in the antiseptic solution, as much of the authors did in the past. And the second way doing a active mouthwash, as the manufacturer recommends. The study will compare two different antiseptic solutions, the chlorhexidine (0.2% Oraldine Perio) and the essential oils (Listerine Mentol) with the two different application and compared the bacterial vitality, thickness and covering grade between solutions and with a basal sample.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>15 healthy volunteers, between 20 and 45 years old, will use during 48 hours two specific oral devices with 3 glass disks each. After this period, one of the disk will be drawn from the device and it will be immersed in Live/Dead BacLight solution for 15 minutes and then the disk will be analysed by the Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM). Immediately, another disk will be removed from the intraoral device and immersed in the antiseptic solution, being analysed by the CLSM as well. After that, the volunteers will do the mouthwash with the antiseptic solution (as stated in the specific protocol) and the last disk will be drawn from the device and will be analysed by the CLSM following the same protocol. The other 3 disk will undergo the same protocol of baseline, immersion and mouthwash, but with the other antiseptic solution. The CLSM data will be analysed and the bacterial vitality, thickness and covering grade will be calculated. Finally the statistical analysis will be applied (Pairwise comparisons, with the Bonferroni adjustment).</detailed_description>
