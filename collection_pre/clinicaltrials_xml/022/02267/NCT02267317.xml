	<criteria>Subjects capable of giving informed consent. lean (BMI &lt;26 kg/m2) with normal glucosetolerant subjects without a family history of type 2 DM obese (BMI 3037 kg/m2) with normal glucosetolerant subjects Type 2 DM subjects base on ADA criteria, who have HbA1c &lt;8.5% and control with diet or sulfonylureas. Both genders. (50% males) Age = 1865 years. Older subjects are excluded because aging is a proinflammatory state. All ethnic groups Premenopausal women in the follicular phase, nonlactating, and with a negative pregnancy test. Postmenopausal women on stable dose of or not exposed to hormone replacement for &gt;=6 months. Lab: Hematocrit &gt;=34%, serum creatinine &lt;=1.4 mg/dL, normal electrolytes, urinalysis, and coagulation tests. Liver function tests up to 2x normal range. Stable body weight (+/1%) for &gt;=3 months. One or less sessions of strenuous exercise/wk for last 6 months. Current treatment with drugs known to affect glucose and lipid homeostasis. Subjects on a stable dose of statin (&gt;3 months) are eligible. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or systemic steroid use for more than 1 week within 3 months. Current treatment with anticoagulants (warfarin). Aspirin (up to 325 mg) and clopidogrel will be permitted if these can be held for seven days prior to the biopsies. History of heart disease (New York Heart Classification greater than class II; more than nonspecific STT wave changes on the ECG), peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease, smokers. Poorly controlled blood pressure (systolic BP&gt;160, diastolic BP&gt;90 mmHg). Active inflammatory, autoimmune, infectious, hepatic, gastrointestinal, malignant, and psychiatric disease.</criteria>
