	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the clinical outcome of Medial PatelloFemoral Ligament (MPFL) reconstruction with and without tibial tubercle transfer for recurrent patellar dislocation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MPFL Reconstruction With or Without Tibial Tubercle Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>70 patients with recurrent patellar instability were randomly assigned to undergo MPFL reconstruction with or without tibial tubercle transfer. Follow-ups were performed at 12 and 24 months postoperatively, and computed tomography (CT) was performed immediately after the operation and at follow-up. The knee function was evaluated preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively using Lysholm,Tegner and Kujala scales. Redislocation or multiple episodes of patellar instability were considered failures.</detailed_description>
