	<brief_title>Phase II of Efficacy and Toxicity of Maintenance Sub. Rituximab After Induction in Relapsed MCL and Non-eligible HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II trial evaluating the role of maintenance with subcutaneous Rituximab in patients with stage II-IV relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma with complete or partial response after the administration of a salvage regimen with R-GemOx-D. Before the study start and in order to standardize the results, the same R-GemOx-D salvage regimen will be used: Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 on day 1, Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 on day 2 (over 30 minutes) and Oxaliplatin: 100 mg/m2 on day 2 (over 3 hours), Dexamethasone 20 mg on day 1-3. Cycles should be repeated every 14 days, up to 8 cycles. Patients who present a complete or partial response, after the salvage therapy, will start the study receiving subcutaneous Rituximab maintenance at dose of: 1400 mg every 2 months for 2 years; the study treatment will start 6-8 weeks after finishing the salvage therapy. Patients will be evaluated every 2 months during treatment study phase and every 4 months in the follow up phase. More details in Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments)</detailed_description>
