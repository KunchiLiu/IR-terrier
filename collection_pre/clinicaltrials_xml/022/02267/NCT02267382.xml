	<brief_summary>VT-1161 is a novel, oral inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase (CYP51). In vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies have demonstrated that VT-1161 is highly active against Candida albicans and also non-albicans Candida species that cause vulvovaginal candidiasis. VT-1161 is highly selective for fungal CYP51, and data suggests that it may avoid the side-effect profile that limits the use of commonly prescribed antifungal agents for the treatment of recurrent yeast infections.</brief_summary>
