	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to discover if people of different demographic levels are more or less attentive to changes in calorie information vs. changes in price information on a restaurant menu. The investigators will record whether the calorie/price change was noticed or not, as well as how quickly the calorie/price change was noticed, depending on condition and individual differences.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast Food Photo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants complete a short study regarding their ability to detect "mistakes" in a printed version of a fast food restaurant menu. We ask participants to identify the differences between the menu board and a typical menu board at that location. Individuals list the differences that they find and have a chance to win a prize if they identify the most mistakes among participants recruited that day. The differences created will remain constant (e.g., featuring Pepsi products instead of the typical Coca-Cola offerings, including items from other restaurants on the menu), including changes to calorie labels and price labels. Additionally, we recruit participants in a variety of locations to test for differences between demographics (e.g., income groups, education levels, and BMI levels).</detailed_description>
