	<brief_summary>The research team has developed an automatic blood pressure monitor to be used for the monitoring and diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, particularly in low-resource settings where current monitoring is limited. 90 adult volunteers will be enrolled by researchers at Rice University. The participant will be seated in a comfortable chair with arm at heart level. Arm circumference will be measured and a blood pressure cuff will be placed on the arm. The cuff will be inflated and blood pressure measurements will be taken by a commercially available device and by test monitor. Blood pressure measurements from both devices will be recorded. The participant's blood pressure will be measured up to 9 times with a waiting period of 45-60 seconds between each measurement. The results of this study will be used to optimize the blood pressure detection algorithm and thus further develop the device.</brief_summary>
