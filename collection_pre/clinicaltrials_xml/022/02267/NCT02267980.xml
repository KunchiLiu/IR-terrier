	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluate the effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine, administered as an adjunct to sevoflurane, on duration of seizure activity, hemodynamic profile and recovery times during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of the Addition of Ketamine to Sevoflurane Anesthesia in Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will randomly allocate, to either a sevoflurane-ketamine (Group SK), sevoflurane-saline (Group SS) receiving group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) will record prior to anesthetic induction (T1); following anesthetic induction (T2); and 0, 1, 3, and 10 min after the seizure has ended (T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively). Motor and EEG seizure durations will be recorded.</detailed_description>
