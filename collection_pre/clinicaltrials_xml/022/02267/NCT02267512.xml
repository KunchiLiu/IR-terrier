	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Two Anti-T-lymphocyte Immune Globulin (ATG-F) Induction Regimens in Anew Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the efficacy and safety of ATG-F induction regimen using a single dose of ATG-F compared with a five-day dose regimen of ATG-F in de novo kidney transplant recipients. The primary analysis of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the two regimens with regard to efficacy, defined as failure rate. The secondary objective of the study is the assessment of safety and further efficacy parameters in terms of incidence of acute rejections, graft/patient survival, DGF(delayed graft function) and renal function</detailed_description>
