	<brief_summary>Study AFF011 is a randomized controlled parallel Group phase I study to investigate the safety and tolerability of two doses of the vaccine AFFITOPE® PD03A given to patients with early Parkinson's disease. In total 36 patients will be enrolled in 3 independent groups (2 treatment groups, 1 Placebo group), each consisting of 12 patients. The patients will be randomized to either receive 15µg or 75µg AFFITOPE® PD03A formulated with adjuvant or the reference substance without active component (Placebo). Over a study duration of 52 weeks, the study participants receive 4 injections as basic immunization in a 4-weekly interval and 1 boost immunization 36 weeks after the first injection. Male and female patients aged 45 to 70 years can participate in the trial. 2 study sites in Austria (Innsbruck and Vienna) will be involved. AFF011 is part of a project SYMPATH funded by the European Commission (FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1 project; N° HEALTH-F4-2013-602999).</brief_summary>
