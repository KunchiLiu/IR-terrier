	<brief_summary>McGrath videolaryngoscopy avoids the use of Magill forceps for nasotracheal intubation, thereby reducing intubation time and complications, especially in patients with a difficult airway. This study was performed to investigate whether McGrath videolaryngoscopy is superior to Macintosh laryngoscopy for routine nasotracheal intubation in expected normal airways, as judged by the time to intubation and ease of intubation.</brief_summary>
