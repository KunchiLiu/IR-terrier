	<detailed_description>The proposed pilot randomized controlled clinical trial (RCCT) will provide preliminary data to examine the effect of a novel intervention to promote brain health after mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The study will implement a randomized controlled clinical trial of a 6 week exercise intervention (STEP) for participants with persistent mTBI symptoms, comparing STEP to standard of care practice in the controls. We will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the STEP intervention. We hypothesize that STEP will lead to meaningful improvement on objective measures of self-reported mTBI symptoms, formal neuropsychological performance, and postural stability.</detailed_description>
