	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of OrthoPulse™, an intra-oral LED (Light Emitting Diode) photobiomodulation device, on orthodontic treatment time. This is a double-blinded RCT with half the patients receiving treatment from a sham non-functional device, serving as controls, and the other half receiving light therapy treatment from a functional OrthoPulse™. Orthodontic treatment time for the sham-control patients are compared to that of the OrthoPulse™ patients.</brief_summary>
