	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain activity and fine motor skills in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to healthy controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Fine Motor Skills in Parkinson's Disease: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot study will involve a double-blind, sham controlled cross-over design where participants will receive anodal and sham tDCS stimulation in a randomized order. Differences in brain activity and fine motor skill performance between groups and after tDCS stimulation will be compared.</detailed_description>
