The objective of the infant study is to describe medical events that require emergency room visit or hospitalization in 6 months following MenACWY-CRM vaccination in children 2-23 months of age in a health maintenance organization in the United States. Outcomes include medical events that require emergency room visits or hospitalizations in children 2-23 months of age following any dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccination. Events with a history of the same diagnosis prior to the first dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccination will be excluded as a pre-existing condition.</brief_summary>
