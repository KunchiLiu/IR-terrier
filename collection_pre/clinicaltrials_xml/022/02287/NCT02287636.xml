	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works compared to PET/computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing younger patients with cancer. PET/MRI and PET/CT are procedures that combine the pictures from a PET scan and an MRI scan or a CT scan. The PET and MRI scans or PET and CT scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself. It is not yet known whether PET/MRI works better than PET/CT in diagnosing younger patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/MRI and PET/CT in Diagnosing Younger Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the diagnostic accuracy of PET/MRI as compared to the standard of reference PET/CT in lesion detection and lesion characterization. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Obtain quantitative measurements in various body regions of standardized uptake values (SUV) in normal tissue and foci of pathologic tracer uptake in PET/MRI of pediatric patients with oncologic disease using various magnetic resonance attenuation correction (MRAC) methods and compare those to respective SUV based on CT attenuation correction. II. Assess the potential for radiation dose reduction with PET/MRI when eliminating CT radiation dose. III. Assess time efforts and workflow improvement with PET/MRI compared to sequential PET/CT plus MRI. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT followed by PET/MRI.</detailed_description>
