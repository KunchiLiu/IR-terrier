	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess analgesic efficacy of a supraclavicular nerve block, suprascapular nerve block, or interscalene nerve block in a population undergoing shoulder arthroscopy with rotator cuff repair. The investigators hypothesize that subjects from all three arms will receive equal analgesia since these blocks are routinely performed to treat post-operative pain after shoulder surgery.</brief_summary>
