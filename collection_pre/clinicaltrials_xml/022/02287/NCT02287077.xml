	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Milking for Neonates With Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a brain injury in neonates due to inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the neonatal brain. Umbilical cord milking can potentially improve brain injury in neonates with HIE. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of performing umbilical cord milking in neonates who are depressed at birth. The investigators hypothesized that umbilical cord milking is feasible and safe in neonates who are depressed at birth. The investigators also hypothesized that umbilical cord milking will increase stem cells in neonatal blood circulation and improve short term outcomes in neonates with moderate and severe HIE.</detailed_description>
