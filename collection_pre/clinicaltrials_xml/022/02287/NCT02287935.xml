	<brief_title>Limberg and Karydakis Flap in Recurrent Pilonidal Sinus Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus is common in young men and may recur overtime after surgery. It was investigated whether there is a factor that can aid determination of the preferred technique by comparing the early Limberg flap and Karydakis procedure techniques for the treatment of recurrent pilonidal sinus.</detailed_description>
