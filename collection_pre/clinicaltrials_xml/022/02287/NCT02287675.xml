	<brief_summary>To compare the kinetics and efficacy of two functionally different diagnostic agents, Lymphoseek (CD206 receptor targeted) and 99mTc-SC (Sulfur Colloid non-specific mapping agent) in intraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Findings in Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center, blinded, randomized, parallel-group, comparative study of Lymphoseek and 99mTc-SC in the preoperative and intraoperative detection of lymph nodes in subjects with known breast cancer. All subjects will receive a single dose of 50 Î¼g Lymphoseek radiolabeled with 0.5 mCi Tc 99m or 0.5 mCi of 99mTc-SC. Subjects may also receive up to 1 mL of vital blue dye (VBD) as a companion ILM agent. All radio-labeled agents will be administered in a single intradermal injection.</detailed_description>
