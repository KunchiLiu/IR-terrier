	<brief_summary>The study aims to analyze the genetic variance between thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) patients and pure hyperthyroidism individuals. Meanwhile, the investigators also intended to evaluate the morphological difference in effected skeletal muscles and investigate their relation with genetic variance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic and Morphological Analysis of Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chinese males of their third and forth decades are extremely predisposed to periodic paralysis when they are hyperthyroid. Due to their imbalanced predilection to the disease, genetic variance is considered to be critical to the pathogenesis. In addition, since proximal limb skeletal muscles are the major sites of target, and they are also believed to play a role in the disease generation. Thus, we intend to analyze the genetic and morphological variances between TPP patients and pure hyperthyroidism patients and simultaneously the relation between genetic variance and morphological difference. In this way, we hope to provide evidence for a better understanding of the disease.</detailed_description>
