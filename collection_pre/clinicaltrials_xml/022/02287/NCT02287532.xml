	<brief_summary>The aim of the TELESAGE study is to demonstrate 1. the superiority of follow up with the DIABEO system (software alone) versus usual follow up in terms of improvement in HbA1c after 1 year in DM1 or DM2 patients treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen. 2. the superiority of follow up with the DIABEO system (software + telemonitoring) compared to usual follow up in terms of improvement in HbA1c after 1 year in DM1 or DM2 patients treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen. The DIABEO software alone is an electronic diary system incorporating an immediate automatic aid to calculating the insulin dose according to the prescription given by the doctor, and a data processing, automated analysis message and secure internet data transfer system. The DIABEO software added by paramedical telemonitoring is the electronic diary combined with remote paramedical monitoring of data (telemeonitoring)</brief_summary>
