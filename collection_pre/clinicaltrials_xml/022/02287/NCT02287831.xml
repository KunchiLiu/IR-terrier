	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Injection for Diabetes Secondary Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is a common chronic disease with significant morbidity and mortality. One devastating complication of diabetes is peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which may result in limb loss.In our study,patients were divided into 3 dose treatment groups (6.29 × 107,9.43 × 107 and 14.15 × 107 cells/m2)。After 4 and 8 weeks, patients were injected the same number of cells. Follow-up index include: efficacy (pain,cold, numbness, Intermittent claudication distance, skin temperature，limb cyanosis area， area and depth of ulcers, gangrene range，ankle-brachial index, Transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen ,lower limb amputation rate and , blood perfusion, Digital subtraction angiography) and safety (infection of the injection site, and tumour generation).</detailed_description>
