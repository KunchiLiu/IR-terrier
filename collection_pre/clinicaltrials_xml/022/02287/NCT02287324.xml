	<brief_title>Effects of Cervical Spine Manipulation on Gait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers in this study will be asked to do the following: 1) complete a series of questionnaires about health status and undergo physical screening of neck to make sure that manipulation will not be harmful; 2) walk in socks or bare feet across a computerized mat under 3 conditions - normal walking pace, walking while looking up and down repeatedly; and walking while looking left and right repeatedly; 3) have one of 2 manual therapy interventions to the neck; 4) repeat the walking across the computerized mat under those same 3 conditions. The 2 randomly assigned interventions are: cervical manipulation, or cervical contact. If assigned the manipulation, volunteers will lie face up and the trained therapist will move the joints in the neck in a gentle, but short and sharp manner which may produce a slight 'pop' or 'click'. If volunteers are assigned the cervical contact, they will lie on their back and the trained therapist will gently hold the head and neck for 45 to 60 seconds as they quietly relax.</detailed_description>
