	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of Roledumab 300μg IM / IV in RhDnegative pregnant women carrying an RhD-positive foetus. And to assess the safety of Roledumab in RhD-negative pregnant women and in RhD-positive foetus and newborns. In addition the efficacy of Roledumab 300μg IM and IV to prevent RhD alloimmunisation in RhDnegative pregnant women carrying an RhD-positive foetus and the immunogenicity of Roledumab will be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed and dated informed consent form provided by the subject prior to proceeding with any studyrelated procedure, At least 18 years old, Pregnancy between 12 and 27 weeks gestational age as confirmed by early ultrasound, Pregnant RhDnegative woman carrying a RhDpositive foetus confirmed by a noninvasive foetal RhD genotyping test Negative serology: hepatitis B and C, HIV (1 and 2), except for positive results due to vaccinations, Covered by healthcare insurance in accordance with local requirements. RhD alloimmunised subject, Positive for ADA Test, Multiple foetuses, Occurrence of a documented potential sensitizing event in this pregnancy before the antenatal IMP administration, Prior administration of antiRhD immunoglobulin during the current pregnancy, Known clinically relevant maternal or foetal abnormality (e.g., as determined by ultrasound or genetic testing), such as placenta previa, History of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to immunoglobulin of any origin, Current diagnosis of an immune disease which by itself or its treatment could impair the safety and/or efficacy evaluation of Roledumab in this study. These diseases are: All immune deficiencies, particularly those requiring IVIg supplementation or other systemic treatment / connective tissue and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis) requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment / allergic and inflammatory diseases requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Clinically significant medical history contraindicating the participation in the study according to the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor, Clinically significant laboratory (haematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis) parameters, Transfusion of RhDpositive blood or blood derived products within the 6 months prior to enrolment, Anticipated poor compliance with the study procedures, Subject within exclusion period further to her participation in a clinical study, For the IM arm only, subject with coagulation disorders contraindicating intramuscular injection (patient will still be considered for the IV arm)</criteria>
