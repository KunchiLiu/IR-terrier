	<brief_title>Biomechanical Changes After Trabeculectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior to trabeculectomy corneal biomechanics are measured with the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA, Reichert) and the Corvis st (Oculus). Both instruments work with an air-puff which deforms the cornea. Intraocular pressure is measured like in non-contact air-puff tonometry. The ORA also measures corneal hysteresis (CH) and the corneal resistance factor (CRF) which are qualitative measures of corneal biomechanics. The Corvis is a high-speed Scheimpflug-camera (4330 frames/sec) that records the quantitative movements of the cornea. At least 6 month after uncomplicated trabeculectomy the measurements are repeated.</detailed_description>
