	<criteria>Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing elective transfemoral TAVR with a balloon expandable transcatheter heart valve 1. Considered at increased surgical risk by the Multidisciplinary Heart Team. 2. Informed written consent 1. Non cardiovascular comorbidity reducing life expectancy to &lt; 3 years 2. Any factor precluding 1 year followup 3. Inadequate CT image acquisition to perform areabased annular CT sizing, exclude adverse root features, and determine a coaxial valve deployment angle (CT is not required for valveinvalve procedures) 4. Predicted inability to perform uncomplicated percutaneous vascular access and closure 5. Iliofemoral diameter &lt; 6 mm for SAPIEN XT or &lt;5.5 mm for SAPIEN 3 (measured at or above the midfemoral head) 6. Inpatient (unless clinically stable, mobilizing at baseline, and primarily in hospital for logistical reasons. 7. Significant communication barrier(s) that interfere with ability to follow periprocedural and discharge instructions 8. MMSE &lt; 24/30 (unless language barrier or limited formal education), 5metre gait &gt; 7 seconds (unless chronic mobility impairment not affecting ability to perform ADLs), and ADL &lt; 6/6 9. Insufficient social support to facilitate next day discharge 10. Airway unfavourable for emergent intubation 11. Inability to lay supine without conscious sedation or general anesthetic 12. Not receiving a balloon expandable transcathter heart valve</criteria>
