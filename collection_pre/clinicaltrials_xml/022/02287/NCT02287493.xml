	<brief_summary>In a prospective, non-interventional, monocentric observational study the pharmacokinetic properties of selected antiinfective drugs during sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) will be analyzed. Plasma specimens will be quantified using high Performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Primary endpoint: Plasma levels of antiinfectives during SLED Secondary endpoints: - 28-day-mortality - length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital - clinical and microbiological cure of infections Inclusion criteria: - age: &gt; 18 years - patients under SLED - antiinfective treatment exclusion criteria: - missing informed consent</brief_summary>
