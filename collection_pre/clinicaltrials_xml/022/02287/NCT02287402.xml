	<brief_summary>The purpose of open-label study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AO-128 (Voglibose) 0.6 mg/day in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who had been non-responsive to diet therapy and exercise therapy, and follow up the progress after the end of treatment in patients who was assessed as normoglycemic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postmarketing Clinical Study on AO-128</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Î±-glucosidase inhibitor voglibose was developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd and is one of the most commonly used oral antidiabetic agents in Japan. Voglibose is used as first-line treatment for improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic patients with inadequate response to diet and exercise therapy and as add-on treatment to other oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin. In 2009, voglibose was approved in Japan for the management of prediabetes (IGT). This study was a single-group, multi-center, open-label study. The study period consisted of a screening period of 1 week or less, a treatment period of 96 weeks or more, and a follow-up period of 48 weeks. However, if a patient was assessed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus or normoglycemia, the treatment period was to be ended, and only those assessed as normoglycemic were to proceed to follow-up. Follow-up was also to be terminated if patients were assessed as having IGT or type 2 diabetes mellitus during follow-up.</detailed_description>
