	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is: - To assess the efficacy and safety of dose regimens of ALX-0061 monotherapy administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The secondary objectives of this study are: - To assess the effects of ALX-0061 on quality of life, the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of ALX 0061 and to explore potential dose regimens for ALX 0061 monotherapy, based on safety and efficacy, for further clinical development. - To obtain parallel descriptive information concerning the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) s.c. in the same clinical trial RA population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of RA (according to the 2010 EULAR/Americal College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria) for at least 6 months prior to screening, and ACR functional class IIII. Received previous or current treatment with methotrexate (MTX), and is considered intolerant to MTX, or for whom continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate or has contraindications for MTX use. Subjects must not have received MTX for at least 4 weeks before first administration of the study drug. Have active RA with at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints(66/68 joint count) at the time of screening and baseline Others as defined in the protocol Have been treated with DMARDs(Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs)/systemic immunosuppressives during the 4 weeks, or 12 weeks for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or leflunomide (except when an adequate washout procedure for leflunomide was completed), prior to first administration of study drug. Have received approved or investigational biological or targeted synthetic DMARD therapies for RA (including tumor necrosis factor alphainhibitors, abatacept, rituximab, or Janus kinase [JAK]inhibitors) less than 6 months prior to screening. Have a history of toxicity, nontolerance, primary nonresponse or inadequate response to a biological therapy, or targeted synthetic DMARDs (including JAK inhibitors), for RA. Have received prior therapy blocking the interleukin6 (IL6) pathway, at any time. Others as defined in the protocol.</criteria>
