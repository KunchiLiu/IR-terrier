	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of this project is to explore whether associations exist between metrics obtained from PET/MRI incorporating advanced MRI sequences and features of bladder cancer, including grade, stage, and treatment response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Investigation of Advanced PET/MRI Metrics for Bladder Cancer Characterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will assess an advanced non-Gaussian diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) model termed diffusion kurtosis imaging, multi-echo T2 mapping, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI using a motion-robust high-temporal and high-resolution radial acquisition scheme employing compressed sensing, and simultaneously acquired 18-fluoro (18F)- fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG) data. Preliminary data demonstrates the investigators ability to execute and evaluate all of these techniques at the investigators center. The investigators hypothesize that these techniques will be sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of bladder cancer cases and will improve upon the performance of current imaging protocols in bladder cancer characterization. Moreover, the investigators believe that these techniques will provide complementary information, such that they may be combined in a synergistic fashion for bladder cancer evaluation.</detailed_description>
