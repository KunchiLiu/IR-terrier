	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Via Binasal Prong vs Nasal Mask: a Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: To determine that affect the rate of (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) BPD and death of NCPAP therapy with nasal prongs or nasal mask as the initial treatment for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). METHODS: Inborn preterm infants of gestational age 26-32 weeks, with respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in this single-centered, unblinded randomized prospective controlled trial. They were stabilized with T-piece device in delivery room. Immediately after admission of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), infants were randomly assigned to receive NCPAP with either nasal prongs or mask. NCPAP was continued by setting at PEEP as 5 to 8 cm H2O . RESULTS: 160 infants were assessed for eligibility 149 infants were randomized. Finally 75 infants in Group I (nasal prong) and 74 in Group II (nasal mask) were analyzed. Mean gestational ages were 29.3±1.6 vs 29.1±2.0 weeks (p=0.55) and birth weights were 1225±257 vs. 1282±312 grams (p=0.22) respectively in Group I and Group II. The frequency of NCPAP failure within 24 hours of life was higher in Group I compared to Group 2 (respectively 8%, %0 , p=0.09) but difference was not significant. The outcomes of BPD and death rates did not differ among the groups ( Group I 9.3% vs. Group II 9.4 %; p=0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Applied nasal mask is a feasible method to deliver NCPAP and as effective as nasal prongs for the initial treatment of RDS in preterm infants.</detailed_description>
