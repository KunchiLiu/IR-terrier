	<brief_title>Quantification of the Time and Effort Required for Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection -The European Perspective</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non interventional study will consist of two parts: I. Retrospective study: A medical record review will be conducted covering 200 patients file undergoing peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in some European centers. II. Prospective study :Time/Motion evaluation of actual apheresis - 20 events each center The actual apheresis events will be measured in consecutive patients scheduled to be candidates for peripheral blood stem mobilization in the apheresis area of the hospital. Each apheresis will be considered as one event . Should the patient receive more than 1 apheresis, each apheresis will be considered as one different event.</detailed_description>
