	<brief_summary>Epithelial cancer of the ovaries is the most severe form of gynecologic cancer; a significant proportion of ovarian cancers originate from the Fallopian tube. Guidelines therefore now recommend systematically associating prophylactic salpingectomy to benign hysterectomy. The principal objective of the present study is to assess the impact of salpingectomy on ovarian reserve by anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) assay and calculating the Doppler index of vascular resistance in the ovarian vessels. The secondary objective is to compare ovarian reserve results between two coagulation techniques used in salpingectomy: bipolar electric energy versus ultrasound. The study design is single-center, prospective, before-and-after, with open randomization between two groups defined by coagulation technique.</brief_summary>
