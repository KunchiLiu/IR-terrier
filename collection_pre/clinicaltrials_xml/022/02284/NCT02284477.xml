	<brief_summary>- Phthalate is an endocrine disrupting chemical, which works as an anti-androgenic agent. - Phthalate is mainly used as PVC plasticizer and easily found in commonly used products such as electronic device, paint, lubricant, surfactant, medical supplies, spray etc. Especially, PVC blood bag used for blood transfusion have been reported to have high level of phthalate concentration. - Previous studies reported that urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites and HOMA (Homeostatic model assessment, indicator of insulin resistance) has positive association. - Previous studies also reported negative associations between urinary phthalate concentration and pulmonary function. - Exposure to phthalates occurs mainly through oral route. Food wrapping with phthalate containing package material is expected to be one of the major contributor for phthalate exposure. - In this present trial, the investigators are to examine whether increased phthalate exposure by consuming beverage stored in PVC containing packing materials actually effect insulin resistance, pulmonary function and epigenetic feature. - For this aim, the investigators will conduct a cross-over trial.</brief_summary>
