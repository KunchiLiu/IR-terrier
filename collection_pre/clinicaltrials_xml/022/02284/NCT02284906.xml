	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone at 24 months compared with placebo on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study [NCT01931566] with an adjudicated diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AD-4833/TOMM40_303 Extension Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Pioglitazone to Slow Cognitive Decline in Participants With Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called pioglitazone. This study is designed to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pioglitazone on cognitive function in participants who have completed the AD-4833/TOMM40_301. This study will look at the effectiveness of pioglitazone on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The study is anticipated to enroll approximately 316 participants, but is dependent on how many decide to continue treatment in an extension phase after completing the main (301) study. Participants will continue to receive the same study medication they received during the pivotal AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study, either: - pioglitazone 0.8 mg tablets or - placebo (this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient). All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study. This multi-centre trial, like its precedent pivotal trial, will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is minimum 2 years and a maximum of 7 years depending on when subjects roll over from the 301 study. Participants will make approximately 2 visits per year to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 3 months after each treatment visit for a follow-up assessment, and 2 weeks after the final visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Completed the pivotal AD4833/TOMM40_301 study with an adjudicated diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) without ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) from AD4833/TOMM40_301. 2. Is male or female and is at least 65 years of age at the time of the Baseline Visit. 3.

Project partners participating in the pivotal AD4833/TOMM40_301 study are encouraged to participate in this extension study in this capacity. 1. Completed the pivotal AD4833/TOMM40_301 study with an adjudicated diagnosis of AD dementia. 2.

Has a disease or takes medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability, or efficacy, or prevent the participant from adequately participating in the study or continue for the anticipated duration of the study. 10. Has received any investigational compound, with the exception of treatment during the AD4833/TOMM40_301 study, within 30 days prior to Baseline or 5 halflives prior to Baseline or is currently participating in another study that entails the administration of an investigational or marketed drug, supplement, or intervention including, but not limited to diet, exercise, lifestyle, or invasive procedure. 11. Has any cancer that has been in remission for less than 2 years from the extension study Baseline Visit. Participants with basal cell or stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the skin will be eligible.
