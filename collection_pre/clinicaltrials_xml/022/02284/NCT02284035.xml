	<criteria>1. Eligible patients will be males or females at least 18 years of age. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days prior to randomization into the study. 2. Patients seropositive for HIV1 using standard diagnostic criteria. 3. Patients virologically suppressed during at least 12 months prior to inclusion (viral load &lt;50 copies/mL). 4. Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (at least 2 antiretroviral drugs) for at least 12 months before being randomized in this study. 5. Patients who are clinically stable in the opinion of the investigator at study entry (clinical status and chronic medication must not have not been modified at least 14 days prior to randomization). 6. Patients who have signed informed consent to participate in the study. 1. Pregnancy, lactation, or planned pregnancy during the study period. 2. Previous failure to an integrase inhibitorcontaining regimen. 3. Previous failure to a 3TC or FTCcontaining regimen. 4. Resistance mutations to 3TC or integrase inhibitor if any resistance test had been previously performed. 5. Any disease or history of disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to patient treatment. 6. Chronic hepatitis B.</criteria>
