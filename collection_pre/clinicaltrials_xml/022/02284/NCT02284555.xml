	<brief_summary>This study will assess the nasal eradication of SA in healthy subjects following treatment with mupirocin 2% (Bactroban 2% Nasal Ointment) twice daily for 5 days, by means of a broth enriched culture microbial assay. The sensitivities of broth enrichment and plating assay methods will be compared. The safety and tolerability of Bactroban 2% Nasal Ointment will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
