	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness of Rehabilitation Services for Survivors of Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will seek to answer three questions: 1. What are the person- and system-level factors associated with use of rehabilitation services following acute ischemic stroke? 2. Among stroke survivors discharged to short-term inpatient rehabilitation, are high-intensity services performed at an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) more effective than lower intensity services performed at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), at improving patient outcomes at 3 and 12 months? 3. Among stroke survivors discharged home, is early follow-up with a physician more effective than follow-up after 7 days at 3 and 12 months?</detailed_description>
