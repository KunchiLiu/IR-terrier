	<brief_title>Spinal Bupivacaine/Morphine in Laparoscopic Gastro-intestinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We expect that in laparoscopic gastro-intestinal surgery, a single shot spinal with bupicavaine/morphine will result in a better analgesia in hte first 48 hours. Herby the patients will require less systemic opioids, which will decrease the side-effects. Furthermore, we expect the patients to recover quicker and show an earlier mobilisation and a shorter hospital stay. The objective of this study is to determine if a single spinal shot of morphine can decrease post-operative opioid-use, and thereby decrease opioid side-effects and lead to a quicker recovery after surgery.</detailed_description>
