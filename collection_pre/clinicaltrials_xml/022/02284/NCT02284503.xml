	<brief_title>Exploring Efficacy of Intensive Rosuvastatin Treatment Peri-PCI in Chinese Patients With Non ST-segment Elevated Acute Coronary Syndrome(NSTE-ACS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non ST-segment elevated acute coronary syndrome(NSTE-ACS) is increasing rapidly, and is more frequent than ST-segment elevated acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) now. NSTE-ACS patients sent to early PCI procedure is large and increasing rapidly in China.Quite a few trials have focused on high loading dose statin before PCI to improve cardiovascular outcomes in ACS. In Asian, high loading dose statin therapy showed different outcome. Rosuvastatin (RSV) is one of the most potent statins.Nowadays, quite a few experts think ACS patients undergoing PCI not only need loading dose statin, but also post PCI intensive statin treatment is rather important. Chinese consensus and western guidelines recommend intensive statin treatment in these patients. However, Chinese consensus referred to the western study as there's no relevant intensive statin treatment peri-PCI study in China until now. Thus this study is designed to explore the efficacy of intensive statin treatment peri-PCI (early loading dose-RSV 40 mg or 20mg before PCI and subsequent 20mg post PCI) in periprocedural myocardial injury and 30 days MACE reduction in Chinese NSTE-ACS patients and explore efficacy of 30-day RSV 20 mg post-PCI treatment in lipid profile, inflammatory factors compared with baseline.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. 1880 year old males and nonchildbearing period females. 2. Clinical diagnosed with NSTEACS, including unstable angina or nonSTsegment elevation myocardial infarction(NSTEMI). For unstable angina, the diagnose should meet all below: Clinical onset features: angina for at least 20 min when resting; initial onset angina pectoris(new onset within one month) manifests spontaneous angina or labor angina (CCS grade II or III); Symptoms of original stable angina pectoris aggravate in one month and at least achieve CCS grade III (accelerated angina pectoris); angina onset within one month after MI. ECG: At least twice in one month: ST depression or elevation &gt;0.1millivolt (mv) or Twave inversion ≥0.2 mv in 2 or more contiguous electrocardiographic leads when onset and the STT changes recovered after remission of chest pain. Myocardial damage marker do not elevate or reach the MI diagnostic level. For NSTEMI, the diagnose should meet all below ischemia symptoms(ischemic chest pain lasting more than 30 min and cannot relief significantly by sublingual NTG) ECG change: new STT dynamic development (new or transient ST depression ≥0.1mv or Twave inversion≥0.2mv). Myocardial damage marker level is normal or elevated to the MI diagnostic level. 3. Received early (within 48 h) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention(PCI). 4. Should be statin naïve(last 3 months). 5. Only receive drugeluting stents. 6. Sign the Informed Consent Form(ICF) Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study: 1. Diagnosis as STEMI; 2. NSTEACS with highrisk features warranting emergency coronary angiography; 3. Receive only medical therapy or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft(CABG) 4. Active liver disease or dysfunction including agnogenic serum transaminase sustained elevation or higher than 3 times upper limit of normal(ULN); 5. Left ventricular ejection fraction＜30%; 6. Previous or current treatment with statins; 7. Patients with myopathy or serum creatine kinase &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal not caused by myocardial injury; 8. Severe renal function damage (creatinine clearance rate&lt;30 ml/min); 9. Severe anemia (haemoglobin&lt; 6g/L); 10. Diagnosed with malignancy within 5 years; 11. Concurrent use ciclosporin； 12. Investigator evaluated as not appropriate for statins.</criteria>
