	<brief_summary>This study is a collaboration between NYP-Columbia and NYP-Cornell that seeks to evaluate the use of topical vancomycin and its reduction on surgical site infection (SSI) in neurosurgical procedures. Adult patients undergoing neurosurgery at either institution will be eligible for participation in this randomized control trial. Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive 2g of vancomycin applied as a powder or paste to the wound site and/or bone flap. Subjects in the control group will receive the current standard of care without topical vancomycin. All subjects will undergo swabbing of the anterior nares and the surgical site prior to surgery, once 10-14 days following the operation and 90 days following the operation. The primary outcome measure will be surgical site infection, assessed daily throughout the hospital stay, at the first follow-up visit, and by telephone at 30 days. Secondary outcomes will include length of hospital stay, length of intensive care stay, rate of reoperation and patient mortality. In addition, systemic vancomycin levels will be assessed at 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively in each patient. Patients who have an external ventricular drain in place will have vancomycin levels assessed daily. In patients who have cranial drains placed, vancomycin concentrations will be analyzed from daily in wound drainage. Skin and nasal flora will be analyzed to assess the impact of topical vancomycin on the patient microbiome. Although there has been a decrease in the incidence of infections following craniotomy secondary to prophylactic intravenous antibiotics, proper sterile techniques, and other interventions, SSIs continue to significantly impact morbidity, mortality, and cost burden. Although never studied in neurosurgical procedures other than instrumented spine, the application of topical vancomycin to the surgical site prior to wound closure has demonstrated a reduction in SSIs in spine, cardiac and ophthalmologic procedures. The benefits of using prophylactic vancomycin topically, as opposed to intravenously, include reduced systemic levels of the drug, and therefore, a decreased probability of adverse events related to the drug, such as inducing resistance among native flora. The investigators propose a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of topical vancomycin in reducing SSIs rates following neurosurgical procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Vancomycin for Neurosurgery Wound Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical-site infections (SSIs) occur in up to 500,000 patients per year in the United States. Patients with SSIs require significantly longer hospital stays and higher healthcare expenditures. In fact, it is estimated that SSIs are responsible for almost 4 million excess hospital days and billions of dollars in added hospital charges every year. Additionally, SSIs are a significant source of morbidity and mortality for surgical patients (5,8). Thus, prompt and definitive measures are necessary in order to redress this significant public health concern. Over the past few decades, the implementation of a number of preventative measures—including improved techniques in preoperative skin antisepsis and antibiotic prophylaxis —have led to significant reductions in the rate of SSIs. Studies have demonstrated that approximately half of all SSIs are preventable with the proper use of prophylactic antibiotics. Despite these dramatic improvements, SSIs remain a tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, routine use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not without risks, as it may lead to rapid development of antibiotic resistance, and also exposes patients to undesirable systemic drug effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of topical vancomycin to reduce surgical site infections after neurosurgical operations.</detailed_description>
