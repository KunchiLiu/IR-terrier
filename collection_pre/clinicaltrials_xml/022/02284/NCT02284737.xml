	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by premature death mainly because of progressive and severe right ventricular failure. Target drugs are reported to be associated with significant improvement of clinical outcome for PAH patients. However, previous studies using those target drugs focused on the change of 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and or hemodynamic responses. As 6MWD has weak correlation with clinical outcome (time to clinical worsening, TTCW), benefits from targets for PAH patients are not clear. We previously reported the safety and efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) for treatment of PAH who were unresponsive to target drugs. However, there is a lack of a randomized study to identify the effect of PADN on PAH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Efficacy of PADN to Improved Functional Capacity and Hemodynamics in Patients With PAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to compare the effect of PADN on PAH patients. Based on the previous studies, the rate of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-related event was around 29% after 6-month treatment using target drugs. And our previous data showed that this PAH-related event at 6-month after PADN procedure was 15%. As a result, a total of 370 PAH patients was required, with 185 patients/per group at a ratio of 1:1 randomization.</detailed_description>
