	<brief_summary>This study is undertaken to determine if ticagrelor augments adenosine-induced coronary flow reserve (CFR), ameliorates clinical symptomatology and exercise tolerance in patients with MVA</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Ticagrelor on Adenosine-Induced Coronary Flow Reserve in Patients With Microvascular Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considering the reduced CFR and increased platelet aggregability in patients with MVA, together with the augmented effect on adenosine-mediated coronary blood flow and potent antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor, we speculate that ticagrelor can promisingly ameliorate the coronary microvascular function in patients with MVA.</detailed_description>
