	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial of Pneumatic Compression Device for the Treatment of Venous Ulcers and Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation is a randomized clinical trial of a prospective cohort of an estimated 140 subjects with venous ulcers, with an observational cohort of 50 subjects with lymphedema. Venous ulcer subjects will be randomized into two arms: Randomization Arm 1: 70 subjects with venous ulcers will receive pneumatic compression with the FlexitouchÂ® for the duration of one month in addition to routine care of venous ulcers and lymphedema. A pre- and post-PCD treatment CIVIQ-2 quality of life questionnaire will be administered to the subjects. For subjects with venous ulcers, wound area pre- and post-treatment will be recorded. Randomization Arm 2: 70 subjects with venous ulcers will receive routine care of venous ulcers and lymphedema. A quality of life questionnaire will be administered at enrollment and again after one month. For subjects with venous ulcers, wound area pre- and post-treatment will be recorded. Observational Arm 3: 50 subjects with lymphedema will ALL receive PCD treatment. A pre-and post- PCD treatment CIVIQ-2 QOL questionnaire will be administered to all subjects at enrollment and again after one month of treatment.</detailed_description>
