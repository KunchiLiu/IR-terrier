	<detailed_description>Specific objectives of the study are: 1. To determine perceived levels of disability and baseline levels of walking activity in a sample of those with chronic low back pain (CLBP) 2. To determine the uptake and adherence to a pedometer-driven walking program for people with CLBP 3. To test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a walking programme to improve outcomes for CLBP compared to a standardized back care education package 4. To test the feasibility of a walking programme in a sub-sample of rural Saskatchewan farmers/agricultural workers.</detailed_description>
