	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (presurgery): 1. Subject has signed an independent ethics committee (IEC)approved informed consent document 2. Subject is undergoing hepatic wedge resection or anatomic resection of 1 to 5 contiguous hepatic segments, and/or other hepatic surgery, any of which may be combined with other surgical procedures involving the gall bladder or intestines 3. Subject age is &gt;18 years at time of consent 4. If female and of childbearing potential, subject has negative pregnancy test during screening and is not breastfeeding 5. If subject is a sexually active male or a sexually active female of childbearing potential, subject agrees to use a medically accepted form of contraception from the time of consent to completion of all followup study visits Inclusion Criteria (during surgery): 6. Presence of mild to moderate bleeding/oozing when control by conventional surgical techniques, including but not limited to suture, ligature and cautery is ineffective or impractical 7. Absence of intraoperative complications other than bleeding which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or safety 8. Approximate TBS surface area of â‰¤ 100 cm^2 1. Subject has known hypersensitivity to Fibrocaps or any of its components 2. Subject has known allergy to porcine gelatin 3. Subject has known hypersensitivity to Tachosil or any of the excipients included in Tachosil 4. Subject is unwilling to receive blood products 5. Subject is having hepatic surgery due to emergencytraumatic event 6. Subject requires extrahepatic bile duct resection (common bile duct resection or resection of the bile duct which leads to performing an anastomoses between the bile duct and small bowel) and biliary anastomosis, and/or pancreatic resections 7. Subject has any clinicallysignificant coagulation disorder that may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or pose a safety risk to the subject according to the investigator, or baseline abnormalities of international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2.5 or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt; 100 seconds during screening that are not explained by current drug treatment (e.g., warfarin, heparin) 8. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100 x10^9 PLT/L during screening 9. Subject has medical, social or psychosocial factors that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact safety or compliance with study procedures 10. Subject is currently participating or has participated in another clinical study involving another investigational agent within 4 weeks of the planned date of surgery or is planning participation in another clinical trial within 6 weeks after surgery</criteria>
