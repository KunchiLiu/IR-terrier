	<brief_summary>Aim: To evaluate the efficiency of the modified Sims position versus maternal free positions in the rotation of persistent foetal occipito-posterior position intrapartum in pregnant women with epidural anaesthesia. Design: An open, randomised, controlled and parallel clinical trial will be conducted at the Delivery Room of the Area Materno-Infantil, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain. Method: Fifty-six pregnant women with persistent foetal occipito-posterior position will be selected. Each woman will be assigned to a control or experimental group via an opaque envelope at a 1:1 ratio. The control group will deliver in free intrapartum positions, and the experimental group in a modified Sims position. Correction of foetal position is the key study variable, and delivery type the secondary variable. Statistical analyses will be made with the SPSS v.20 program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Intrapartum Sims Position-related Efficiency in Correction of Persistent Foetal OP Positions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: To evaluate the efficiency of the modified Sims position versus maternal free positions in the rotation of persistent foetal occipito-posterior position intrapartum in pregnant women with epidural anaesthesia. Background: There is a theoretical basis for the possible effects of maternal positions on foetal positions. Despite all the studies published in recent years, conclusive trials providing significant scientific evidence are lacking. Design: An open, randomised, controlled and parallel clinical trial will be conducted at the Delivery Room of the Area Materno-Infantil, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain. Method: Fifty-six pregnant women with persistent foetal occipito-posterior position will be selected. Each woman will be assigned to a control or experimental group via an opaque envelope at a 1:1 ratio. The control group will deliver in free intrapartum positions, and the experimental group in a modified Sims position. Correction of foetal position is the key study variable, and delivery type the secondary variable. Statistical analyses will be made with the SPSS v.20 program. Discussion: If the modified maternal Sims position proved to correct persistent foetal occipito-posterior positions and being a non-invasive, low-cost, non-prejudicial method for both mother and foetus, maternal and foetal morbidity problem would be reduced</detailed_description>
