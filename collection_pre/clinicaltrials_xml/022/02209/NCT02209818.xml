	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low level laser therapy (LLLT) on pain management in people commencing orthodontic treatment. The study design is a randomized controlled trial. Participants' pain will be dealt with by laser irradiation in one side of the jaw randomly, and the other side will be treated by a placebo procedure. Pain assessment will be measured using Visual Analog Scales (VAS). The hypothesis of this study is that laser irradiation decreases the amount of pain following the insertion of orthodontic separators.</brief_summary>
