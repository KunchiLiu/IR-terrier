	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation. The effect of inhaled corticosteroids (IC) on inflammation in COPD is controversial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids in the Systemic Inflammation Induced by Exercise in Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical exercise produces a systemic inflammatory response, both in the healthy individual and in the COPD patient (Rabinovitch et al ERJ 2003; van Helvoort et al Respir Med 2005; Davidson WJ et al. J Appl Physiol). Nevertheless, although it has been described that some of the systemic biomarkers related with COPD (Protein C-Reactive (PCR), interleukin [IL]-8) are associated with a lower tolerance to exercise in COPD patients (García-Río et al. Respir Res 2010), the role of IC on systemic inflammation triggered by exercise in COPD patients remains unknown. This study explores the hypothesis that the inflammatory response induced by exercise in COPD patients could be with IC treatment.</detailed_description>
