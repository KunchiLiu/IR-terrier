	<brief_title>Effects of Massage on Post-operative Pain in Urologic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-operative pain for Urology patients can be an anxiety-provoking and distressing recovery process. Massage therapy for post-operative pain has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety levels in various surgical patients however no study has assessed massage therapy effect on post-operative pain in patients who have gone through urological procedures. This study will investigate the effects of hand massage interventions during the post-operative period of Urology patients. Perception of pain and anxiety levels will be assessed, as well as vital signs before and after massage therapy will be measured. These findings may lead to both subjective and objective improvements in patients undergoing urological surgeries and procedures.</detailed_description>
