	<brief_summary>Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting nearly 16% of the general population. Its physiopathology remains unclear. Based on gene-environment studies and epigenetic studies, a main hypothesis proposed that the major depressive episode (MDE) results from the convergence of multiple factors including biological factors such as multi-genic vulnerability, hormonal and immunological variations as well as environmental factors. As a consequence, mRNA could define a biological signature of the MDE.</brief_summary>
