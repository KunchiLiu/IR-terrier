	<brief_summary>Autologous MMSCs will be isolated from oral mucosa biopsy sample and expanded in vitro.Tissue engineered construction will be created using synthetic tricalcium phosphate and autologous MMSCs. Patients will undergo sinus lift procedure with implantation of created tissue-engineered construction. This is a single arm study with no control. All patients receive cell therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Safety of Method of Maxilla Alveolar Process Reconstruction Using Synthetic Tricalcium Phosphate and Autologous MMSCs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with verified diagnosis partially edentulous maxilla and alveolar bone atrophy will undergo oral mucosa biopsy and autologous MMSCs will be derived and expanded in vitro during 3-4 weeks. After that tissue engineered construction will be created using synthetic tricalcium phosphate and autologous MMSCs. Patients will undergo sinus lift procedure with implantation of created tissue-engineered construction. Six months later patients will undergo dental implant installation. Biopsy of bone tissue at the site of sinus lift will be performed as a part of dental implant installation with subsequent histological analysis of bone specimen.</detailed_description>
