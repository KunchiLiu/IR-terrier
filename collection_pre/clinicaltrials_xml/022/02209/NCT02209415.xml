	<brief_summary>Follow-up after successful operative treatment of cancer in the esophagus, stomach or pancreas in order to detect recurrent disease is a controversial topic. This is because the methods and the consequence of following these patients is unknown. Therefore the investigators will randomize these patients in to two groups: 1. One group of patients will be offered visits with a specialist surgeon in a outpatient setting for a clinical evaluation every 3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months after surgery, as is the current standard at our department. 2. The other group will be offered Endoscopic UltraSound, EUS, and PET/CT with the same intervals as the first group.</brief_summary>
