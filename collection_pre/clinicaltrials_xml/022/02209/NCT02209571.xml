	<brief_summary>Exploratory comparative evaluation of exhaled breath composition in cystic fibrosis patients with age and gender-matched healthy adults in order to identify a disease-specific exhaled breath pattern as well as to gain insight into pathophysiological and microbial contributions to exhaled breath composition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breath Analysis in in Adults With Cystic Fibrosis (CF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although there is some evidence that breath composition reflects aspects of CF pathology, so far a disease-specific molecular breath profile has not been identified. Real-time, whole breath analysis incorporating all of the thousands of potentially relevant volatile compounds is needed in order to identify reliable CF-specific breath patterns. These may be used in future clinical applications to greatly enhance cost-effectiveness and simplicity of diagnostic testing for CF.</detailed_description>
