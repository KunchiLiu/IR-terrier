	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of MLN3126 in Healthy Japanese and Non-Japanese Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MLN3126 is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in healthy people and to assess how MLN3126 is processed by the body. In total, approximately 64 participants will be enrolled in the study. This study is composed of 2 parts: Part A healthy non-Japanese participants and Part B healthy Japanese participants. Each part will consist of 4 Cohorts with 8 participants in each Cohort. In each Cohort, 6 participants will receive MLN3126 and 2 participants will receive matched placebo within 30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast. The starting dose will be 100 mg followed by doses of 300 mg, 800 mg, and a dose to be determined during the study. Progression to the next dose level will only occur if the previous dose level was considered to be safe and well tolerated. This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 20 days. All participants will be contacted by telephone 7 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Due to toxicology findings from a long-term animal study, Takeda made the decision to terminate this study. No clinically significant safety and/or tolerability issues have been observed or reported in participants exposed to MLN3126.</detailed_description>

Is a male or female adult, 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and study drug dosing. 4. Is a healthy adult male or female participant as evidenced by their medical history, complete physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and safety laboratory evaluations. 5. Weighs at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m^2 inclusive at Screening. 6. A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after last dose. 7.

A male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after the last dose. 7. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to routinely use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study to their next postconfinement menstruation. In addition, participants must be advised not to donate ova during this period. Part A (Healthy nonJapanese participants) and Part B (Healthy Japanese participants): 1.
