	<brief_summary>Purpose: The incidence of stroke in low-to-middle income countries is increasing .Balance impairment and falling negatively impact function of stroke patients. Mobility is based on successful postural control and about 30% of individuals with stroke are unable to ambulate without assistance.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a new promising tool for motor recovery in neurological disease.This can be addressed through a tDCS intervention. Objective:The objectives of this study is to examine the efficacy of anodal tDCS combined with Biodex balance training on postural control in chronic stroke patients using laboratory and clinical assessments. The following essential treatment components; a) active tDCS stimulation paired with Biodex balance training, b)sham tDCS paired with Biodex balance training program. To identify combinations effects of tDCS stimulation plus balance training . Hypothesis: Anodal tDCS targeting leg motor area (CZ) for 5-days plus Biodex balance training, will significantly improve stroke clients' balance and functional mobility. Double blinded sham -controlled randomized tDCS stimulation Arms Assigned Interventions Experimental: Arm 1 tDCS brain stimulation and simultaneous balance training Participants underwent Active tDCS brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days. No Intervention: Arm 2 Sham tDCS brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants underwent tDCS(2mA) brain stimulation (20 minutes) and simultaneous balance training(20 minutes) for 5 consecutive days, All outcome measures will be measured in 4 time points: pre-test, post-test after 10 sessions of intervention, and after 1 week and 1 months post intervention as follow ups.</detailed_description>
