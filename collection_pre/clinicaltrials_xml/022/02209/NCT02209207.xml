	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of interval walking training versus continuous walking training in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients will be recruited during a 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program and will be randomized to one of the two intervention groups. All walking training sessions will be performed on the same treadmill. Walking intensity in the continuous walking group will be 60 percent of the average speed of the 6-minute walking test. Patients in the interval training group will perform high intensity intervals at 120% of the 6-minute walking test speed for 60 seconds alternating with 60 seconds of rest. The total exercise duration will be progressively increased from 10 to 32 minutes.</brief_summary>
