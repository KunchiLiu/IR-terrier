	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that for people with moderate to severe multiple sclerosis postural balance and walking improve and the risk of accidental falls are reduced after participating in a specific training intervention of 7 weeks. The hypothesis is also the the effect remain a further 7 weeks post training. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is disease affecting the central nervous system. Walking and postural balance are often affected early in the course of the disease. The risk of falls is large. Many persons with MS have decreased trunk stability compared to healthy persons . In an earlier study including people with mild to moderate MS we found that a period of core stability exercises reduced the risk of falls. In this study the training concept will be applied for persons with more severe walking limitations.</brief_summary>
