	<brief_summary>There is a large gap between the care seriously ill patients want and the care they receive. Advance directives (ADs) offer an opportunity for patients to express specific end-of-life preferences to avoid unwanted care. As promising as ADs may be for improving the quality of care near the end of life, rates of AD completion remain low and previous efforts to encourage their completion have had limited success. Principles of behavioral economics, such as the effects of defaults and other framing effects, may offer a novel approach to bridge the gap in end-of-life care. The goal of this study is to test whether the framing effect of expanding choice sets can increase the completion of and specification of choices within advance directives.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choice Sets for Advance Directives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has been designed as two sequential randomized trials to test two separate expanded choice set interventions, with the second randomization enrollment being contingent on results from the first. All enrolled subjects will be asked if they would like to complete an advance directive and will have been randomized to receive either an expanded answer choice set or a standard answer choice, as described in detail elsewhere. Only those subjects who express a desire to complete an advance directive from both arms will then be randomized again in a stratified fashion to receive either a standard advance directive or one with an expanded choice set for the decisions regarding life-sustaining therapy, as described in detail elsewhere.</detailed_description>
