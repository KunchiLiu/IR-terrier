	<brief_title>A Ph1 Study in Healthy Male Japanese and Caucasian After Single and Multiple Doses of D5884(Omega-3-carboxylic Acids)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, single-centre study that plans to enrol 3 cohorts in 3 study arms (Study Arms A, B and C). Study Arms A and B will be comprised of cohorts of healthy male Japanese subjects in randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose parallel studies and Study Arm C will be comprised of a cohort of healthy male Caucasian subjects in a single and multiple dose open-label study. Two dose levels, 2 and 4 g D5884, will be investigated in healthy male Japanese subjects. Up to 18 healthy male Japanese subjects aged 20 to 45 years, inclusive, will be enrolled in 2 cohorts (Study Arms A and B) and up to 6 healthy male Caucasian subjects will be enrolled in a 3rd cohort (Study Arm C). Each subject will participate in 1 cohort only. Following a screening period of a maximum of 42 days, subjects will reside at the study facility for 18 nights starting from the day before dosing (Day -1) to Day 18 (day of discharge). The follow-up period after dosing will be 8 (±2) days after last dose. Dose administration in all 3 study arms will be done in the following sequence: a single dose of D5884 or placebo will be administered; this will be followed by a 2-day washout period; after the washout period, multiple doses of D5884 or placebo will be administered, once daily for 14 consecutive days. The 1st cohort (Study Arm A) will receive 2 g D5884 (n=6) or placebo (n=3), the 2nd cohort (Study Arm B) will receive 4 g D5884 (n=6) or placebo (n=3) and the 3rd cohort (Study Arm C) will receive 4 g D5884 (n=6). The PK analysis included all evaluable PK data appropriate for the evaluation of interest (eg, with no major protocol deviations or violations thought to significantly affect the PK of the drug) from all subjects who received D5884.</detailed_description>
