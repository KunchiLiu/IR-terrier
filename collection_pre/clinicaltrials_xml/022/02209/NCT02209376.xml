	<brief_summary>An Open-Label Phase 1 Pilot Study to determine the safety and feasibility of CART-EGFRvIII (autologous T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express a chimeric antigen receptor specific for EGFRvIII) in the treatment of patients with EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma who have had their first recurrence as determined by standard imaging or have have residual disease after initial resection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathological criteria: Glioblastoma (GBM) that is histologically confirmed by pathology review of surgically resected tissue. Tumor cells from resected tissue must be available for EGFRvIII testing. Patients who have previously been treated with an EGFRvIIItargeted therapy and recurred, must have a tumor sample obtained after their recurrence available for EGFRvIII testing. Age greater than 18 years. If the patient is on dexamethasone, the anticipated dose must be 4 mg/day or less for at least 5 days prior to apheresis. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Documented negative serum HCG for female patients of childbearing potential. Participants with adequate organ function as measured by: White blood count greater than or equal to 2500/mm^3; platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL; without transfusion or growth factor support AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal Coagulation tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits, unless the patient has been therapeutically anticoagulated for previous venous thrombosis. Provide voluntary informed consent for Tissue Screening and Apheresis Inclusion Criteria Step 2: 1. Subject met all Step 1 Eligibility Criteria. 2. Tumor cells test positive for EGFRvIII expression (by RTPCR, next generation sequencing, or immunohistochemistry) and a CART EGFRvIII product has been manufactured and formulated. Patients who have previously been treated with an EGFRvIIItargeted therapy and recurred are only eligible if a tumor sample obtained after their recurrence tests positive for EGFRvIII. 3. Stage of disease: Cohort 1: Patients with first relapse of previously diagnosed primary glioblastoma. Recurrence may be determined by imaging and clinical criteria alone. Cohort 2: Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with a less than 95% resection or greater than or equal to 1 cm^3 of residual disease on the postoperative MRI (typically postoperative day 1). 4. If the patient is on dexamethasone, the dose must be 4 mg/day or less prior to CARTEGFRvIII infusion. 5. It is anticipated that all patients in Cohort 2 will have completed standard of care external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) at the time of the preinfusion safety visit. 6. Life expectancy less greater than 3 months 7. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 9. Participants with adequate organ function as measured by: White blood count greater than or equal to 2500/mm^3; platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL; without transfusion or growth factor support AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal Coagulation tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits, unless the patient has been therapeutically anticoagulated for previous venous thrombosis. Adequate cardiac function (greater than EF 55%) 10. Provide voluntary informed consent for study treatment. 11. Female subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use a reliable method of contraception. Exclusion Criteria Step 1: Female subjects of reproductive potential who are pregnant or lactating. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test as part of Step 1 eligibility confirmation. Uncontrolled active infection. Active or latent chronic hepatitis B [detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)] or active hepatitis C (positive serology [HCV Ab]) infection. HIV infection. Previous treatment with any gene therapy products. Known addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40) Exclusion Criteria Step 2: Female subjects of reproductive potential who are pregnant or lactating. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within two weeks prior to CARTEGFRvIII cell infusion. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not known. Uncontrolled active infection. Use of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, MMF, tacrolimus, or rapamycin within 4 weeks of enrollment on Step 2. A minimal dose of corticosteroid (dexamethasone up to 4 mg/day) is permitted. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. Previous treatment with any gene therapy products. Subjects or their physicians anticipate use of any of the following concurrent treatment or medications including: a. Radiosurgery (except for the Standard of Care Fractionated External Radiation therapy is a part of the protocol regimen in Cohort 2) b. Chemotherapy (except for the Standard of Care Temozolomide therapy in Cohort 2) c. Interferon (e.g. IntronAÂ®) d. Allergy desensitization injections e. Any ongoing investigational therapeutic medication. f. Bevacizumab Participants who have another cancer diagnosis with history of visceral metastases at the time of preentry evaluation. The following diagnoses are examples that will be allowed: squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis basal cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or LCIS) carcinoma in situ of the cervix prostate cancer with only PSA recurrence any cancer that has not required systemic therapy (other than hormonal therapies) for the past three (3) years. Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as outlined. Unstable angina and/or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening Known addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40)</criteria>
