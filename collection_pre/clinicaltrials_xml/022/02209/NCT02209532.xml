Subjects with FIGO Clinical Stage IA cervical cancer ≤ 2 cm in size undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy, trachelectomy, or conization with lymph node mapping. Subjects with clinical Stage IA1 cervical cancer without lympho vascular space involvement (LVSI) and negative margins on cone biopsy are not to be included. Subjects with negative nodal status (N0) Subjects with negative metastatic involvement (M0). Have had prior dissection and/or radiation in pelvis. Advanced cervical or endometrial cancer, T3/T4 lesions Diagnosis of cervical cancer with a tumor size greater than 2 cm. Locally advanced or inflammatory cervical or uterine cancer Metastatic cervical or uterine cancer. Known allergy or history of adverse reaction to ICG, iodine or iodine dyes. Known allergy or history of adverse reaction to Blue dye (Isosulfan blue) or triphenylmethane. Hepatic dysfunction defined as MELD Score &gt; 12. Renal dysfunction defined as serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl. Subjects who have participated in another investigational study within 30 days prior to surgery. Pregnant or lactating subjects. Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, have any medical condition that makes the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure, or interferes with the interpretation of study results.</criteria>
