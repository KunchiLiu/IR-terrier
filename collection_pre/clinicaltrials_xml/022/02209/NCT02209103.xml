	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine whether a citrus flavonoid or a citrus flavonoid formulation can improve objective sleep duration and/or quality, and/or improve perceived sleep quality and feelings of rest. Participants will complete a total of 9 test nights, which consist of sleeping with the sleep monitoring system after ingestion of the test product or a placebo, and filling out sleep-related questionnaires. The study has a crossover design, meaning that all participants receive all three interventions (citrus flavonoid, citrus flavonoid formulation, placebo) three times, in a randomized order.</brief_summary>
