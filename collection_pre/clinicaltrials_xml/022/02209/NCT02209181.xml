	<brief_title>A Dental Pain Study to Test the Effectiveness of a New Pain Reliever Medicine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of JNJ-10450232, administered as a single dose in capsules (250 or 1000 mg), over a 24 hour period after molar extractions. Subjects will stay at the research center for ~24 hours after administration of study drug. Healthy male subjects, ages 18 to 45 years inclusive, will be screened by medical history, vital signs, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests. Eligible subjects will return to the clinic on the day of surgery and complete baseline vital signs and clinical laboratory tests. They will undergo dental extraction of a minimum of three third-molars and, if qualified, will be randomly assigned to one of four study treatments for pain.</detailed_description>
