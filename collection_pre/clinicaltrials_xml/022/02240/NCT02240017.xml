	<brief_summary>This is a phase II/III, multicenter, randomized study which includes 420 patients on six years + 3 years follow up. 92 patients will be included during the phase II ; additional 328 patients will be included. Patients with an advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with impaired renal function will be randomized in one of the two following chemotherapy arm: - Fractionated Cisplatin + Gemcitabine. - Carboplatin + Gemcitabine. The main objective of the part II study will be to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a chemotherapy with a doublet platinum salt compound/Gemcitabine with fractionated Cisplatin or Carboplatin in this population. The main objective of the part III study will be to compare the efficacy in terms of overall survival of a chemotherapy with a doublet platinum salt/Gemcitabine with fractionated Cisplatin or Carboplatin in this population.</brief_summary>
