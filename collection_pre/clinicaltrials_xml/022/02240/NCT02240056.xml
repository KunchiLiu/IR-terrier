	<brief_summary>Certain cardiac and neurologic diseases influence each other via a still poorly understood "brain-heart axis". Subarachnoidal bleedings are well known to cause ECG alterations resembling those of myocardial infarction, along with a reduction of systolic myocardial function ("neurogenic stunned myocardium"). Alterations of the right insula region by a stroke or intracranial hemorrhage go along with a sympathetic activation (increased circulating catecholamine levels, tachycardia, arterial hypertension). In contrast, alterations of the left insula region often cause vagal reactions such as bradycardia, arterial hypotension. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a just recently recognised subform of heart attacks, often caused by psychological or physical stress (death of a beloved one, divorce, job loss, infection, preoperative state). In more than 90% of cases, TTC affects postmenopausal women. Functional MRT enables imaging of activated brain regions, either without ("resting state") or with specific stimuli. The investigators speculate that there is a specific involvement of the insula region during TTC.</brief_summary>
