	<brief_summary>A recombinant AAV vector has been generated to carry the codon-optimized acid alpha-glucosidase (coGAA) gene expressed from a human desmin enhancer/promoter (DES). The proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants (18 years old or older) Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrolling in this study will entail participating in 8 months of study-related visits. Patients will be asked to come to the Clinical and Translational Research Building at the University of Florida for a series of onsite study visits, including a baseline visit, two injections of the gene transfer and two post-injection visits. All the visits, including the injections, will last two days and will be performed as outpatient procedures at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) and at other facilities at the University of Florida. Overnight observation will not be needed, however, patients will be asked to stay overnight in a hotel near the University of Florida. During the first 4 months after each injection, patients will be asked to perform outpatient laboratory work at a laboratory facility convenient for them. In addition, during this study patients will be asked to take medications that will modulate the ability of their immune system to react against foreign agents including the gene transfer agent. The purpose of these medications is to improve the activity of the GAA within the body. Patients will need to take one medication (Rituximab) 15 days prior the first injection of the study agent and the day before each injection. Rituximab will be repeated at 2nd injection only if his/her body is producing antibody (B cells counts). Rituximab will be delivered by infusion that may last 2-6 hours. Patients will need to take another medication (Sirolimus) every day starting 3 days before the first injection of the study agent until one month after the second injection of the study agent. The following discusses what will occur at each visit: Baseline Baseline Evaluation and first Rituximab infusion - Day -15/-14 - Medical history:Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire about his/her medical history. - Blood and urine tests: These tests will be used for evaluating the safety of the gene transfer agent. - Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT): This test finds out how strong the patient's leg muscles are. - Balance test: Balance will be tested by Nintendo Wii-fit board, which will acquire the oscillation of the patient's body in the standing position. - Gait analysis: Gait will be tested with Gait Mat II, which will record the spatial and temporal parameters of his/her walk such as cadence, speed and distance between your feet. - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS): MRI and MRS testing will be done inside a large magnet that lets the study doctors measure the size and health of the patient's muscles. These tests are done at the same time. MRI and MRS testing will require the patient to stay very still for up to an hour. - Muscle Biopsy: Tissue samples obtained will be used for evaluation of muscle glycogen and GAA activity in the injected muscle. - Magnetic stimulation of the common fibular nerve: The common fibular nerve, which is the nerve that controls the injected muscle, will be stimulated with a magnetic field to test the impact of the gene transfer agent to the nervous system. - Single-fiber Electromyography (EMG): Single-fiber EMG test consists of introducing a small recording needle in the muscle to record the activity of the muscle fiber during stimulation or voluntary contraction. - The patient will receive the first Rituximab infusion. It might last between 2 and 6 hours. Rituximab infusion and 1st Injection - Day 0/1 - The patient will receive the 2nd Rituximab infusion the day before the gene transfer agent. It might last between 2 and 6 hours. He/she will receive the gene transfer agent in 1 injection (a total of about 1 teaspoon) into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of one leg. The other leg will receive a pharmacologically inactive solution. An ultrasound will be used to detect the proper location of injection. A photograph of the injection at the injection site may be taken. If the patient agrees to this, he/she will be asked to sign a consent form for this procedure. Outpatient lab work - Day 5/15/30/60 - Blood and urine tests Onsite visit - Day 89/90 - Medical history - Blood and urine tests - Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT) - Balance test - Gait analysis - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) - Muscle Biopsy - Magnetic stimulation of the common fibular nerve - Single-fiber EMG Rituximab infusion and 2nd Injection - Day 120/121 - The patient will receive the 3nd Rituximab infusion the day before the gene transfer agent only if his/her body is producing antibody (B cells counts). It might last between 2 and 6 hours. The patient will receive the second gene transfer agent injection in the leg that previously received the inactive solution. The leg that previously received the study agent will receive the inactive solution. The injection procedure and the amount of study agent injected will be the same as the first injection. Outpatient lab work - Day 125/ 135/ 150/ 180 - Blood and urine tests Onsite visit - Day 209/210 - Blood and urine tests - Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT) - Balance test - Gait analysis - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) - Muscle Biopsy - Magnetic stimulation of the common fibular nerve - Single-fiber EMG</detailed_description>
