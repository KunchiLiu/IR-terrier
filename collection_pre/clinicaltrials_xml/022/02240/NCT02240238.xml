	<brief_summary>In the dose escalation phase (Part 1), this study will determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 (RPII) dose of NC 6004 in combination with gemcitabine. In the expansion phase of the study (Part 2), study will evaluate the activity, safety, and tolerability at the RPII dose identified in Part 1 in patients with squamous NSCLC, biliary tract, and bladder cancer.</brief_summary>

(Part 2 only) Cohort 3: Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or locally advanced TCC of the urinary tract (bladder, urethra, ureter, renal pelvis) (T3bT4 N0 M0, Tany N1N3 M0, or Tany Nany M1) and are not candidates for surgery. Have measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1.

Have received prior cisplatin and gemcitabine concomitantly within the last 6 months or are refractory to cisplatin and gemcitabine. Unresolved toxicity from prior radiation, chemotherapy, or other targeted treatment, including investigational treatment Have evidence suggesting pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial pneumonia. Have a history of thrombocytopenia with complications Have known hypersensitivity to platinum compounds or gemcitabine. Have uncontrolled diabetes or have hypertension requiring more than 3 medications for control of hypertension. Have preexisting alcoholic liver injury or significant liver disease.
