	<brief_title>Kappa Opioid Receptor Imaging in Anorexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-year study involving n=7 women with anorexia nervosa - recovered (AN-REC) from restricting subtype that have achieved a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 18.5 in the past year, are medication free, range in age from 18-55 years and n=7 healthy (medical and psychiatric statues) age- and weight-matched controls who are invited to participate in a medical and psychiatric evaluation, neuroendocrine assessments, one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study and one positron emission tomography (PET) study kappa opioid receptor (KOR) 11-carbon (11C) [11C]PKAB and PET. Subjects will be asked to provide written informed consent after full explanation of all study procedures and risks and benefits related to study participation. On the screening day a full medical evaluation including blood work, urine analyses, toxicology, electrocardiogram (ECG) and physical exam will be performed.</detailed_description>
