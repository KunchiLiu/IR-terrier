	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion in elderly without hypothalamic-pituitary disease using the glucagon stimulation test (using Glucagen® Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) and evaluate some parameters such as sarcopenia, nutritional state, bone mineral density, frailty criteria with secretion of GH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Growth Hormone Evaluation in the Elderly People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>subjects over 65 years old were recruited from the geriatric ambulatory unit of our hospital to voluntarily participate in a research study concerning the GH and ACTH axis in the elderly, which included the realization of the glucagon stimulation test as the first phase of the study. The GST (Glucagen® Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) was the chosen test to assess both ACTH and GH release because of its few known contraindications and mild side effects. It is a provocative test to evaluate GH and ACTH axis, i.e, a diagnostic test, without therapeutic effects.</detailed_description>
