	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate how tozadenant is absorbed, distributed, broken down and eliminated from the body. The compound to be administered will be radiolabeled. This enables the investigator to trace the compound in blood, urine, feces, expired air and track what happens to it.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Absorption, Distribution, Break Down and Elimination and the Safety of 14C-Labeled Tozadenant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PD0026 is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single-dose study to investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of 14C-labeled tozadenant. The primary objective is to determine the mass balance and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of total radioactivity in 6 healthy male subjects following a single oral dose of 14C-labeled tozadenant. Secondary objectives are to determine the PK of Tozadenant, to identify and quantify metabolites of tozadenant, and to gain further information on the tolerability and safety of tozadenant. The variables related to the radiocarbon activity include the total radioactivity concentration in whole blood and plasma; the total radioactivity excretion in urine, feces, and expired air; and the corresponding PK parameters. The concentrations and the corresponding PK parameters of tozadenant over time will be determined in plasma, urine, and feces. In addition, the metabolites of tozadenant will be identified and quantified. The safety and tolerability variables include adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examination, standard 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, and clinical laboratory results. The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 20 days (Days -21 to -2) and a Study Period of 15 days. Therefore, the maximum duration of participation from Screening until discharge from the clinic for a subject is 35 days.</detailed_description>

Subjects with isolated laboratory test results that are outside the reference ranges will be allowed to enroll at the discretion of the Investigator, so long as these results are deemed by the Investigator to be clinically nonsignificant Subject has Blood Pressure (BP) and pulse rate within normal range in supine position after 5 minutes rest (SBP: 90 to 140 mmHg, DBP: 50 to 90 mmHg, pulse rate: 45 to 100 bpm). Subjects with vital sign results that are outside the specified ranges and that are deemed clinically nonsignificant will be allowed to enroll at the discretion of the Investigator Subject has regular intestinal transit, in the opinion of the Investigator, determined on the basis of absence of any history or current symptoms of recurrent constipation, diarrhea, or any other gastrointestinal diseases. The mean stool frequency should be at least once every 2 days Subject confirms that, during the study period and for a period of 3 months after the final dose, when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, he will use a barrier contraceptive (eg, condom) AND that the respective partner will use an additional contraceptive method. Subject should also agree not to donate semen during this period of time Subject has previously participated in this study or another tozadenant study Subject is currently participating in or has participated in another study of an investigational medicinal product or medical device in the last 3 months or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) Subject has a history of exposure to ionizing radiations (except radiography) or has participated in another Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) study with a radiation burden &gt;0.1 mSv in the period of 1 year before Screening Subject has a history of, or present, medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to participate in this study The subject has a known hypersensitivity to any components of the tozadenant formulation or to similar drugs (A2a antagonists), or has a history of drug or other relevant allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or UCB Study Physician, contraindicates their participation Subject has a known clinically relevant allergy or known severe adverse reaction to any drug, or known or suspected clinically relevant drug hypersensitivity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to participate in this study Subject has a history or presence of drug or alcohol dependency or tests positive for drugs or alcohol (urine tests) at Screening or Day 1 Subject consumes more than 28 units of alcohol per week (330 mL of 5% alcohol by volume beer=2 units; 125 mL of 12% wine=1.5 units; 50 mL of 40% spirits=2 units). Subject consumes more than 600 mg of caffeine/ day (1 cup of coffee contains approximately 100 mg of caffeine, 1 cup of tea contains approximately 30 mg of caffeine, and 1 glass of cola contains approximately 20 mg of caffeine) Subject has a diet that deviates notably from the "normal" amounts of protein, carbohydrate, and fat, as judged by the Investigator (eg, vegans) Subject has received any prescription or nonprescription medicines, including enzyme inhibitors or inducers, overthecounter remedies, vitamins outside the recommended daily dose limits, herbal, and dietary supplements (including St. John's Wort) within 14 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to administration of study medication.
