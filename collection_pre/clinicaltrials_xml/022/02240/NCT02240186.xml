	<brief_summary>This study will assess if the functional performance and musculoskeletal outcome of transfemoral amputees are improved after receiving a Microprocessor Knee (MPK) compared to a Non-Microprocessor Knees (NMPK).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Between Microprocessor Knees and Non-Microprocessor Knees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design is a reversal design whereby only the prosthetic knee joint will be changed. Each subject will be tested using their current NMPK, fit and tested with a MPK, and then tested again with their NMPK. MPK prostheses from all manufacturers will be considered appropriate for testing. Each MPK to be used in this study is FDA approved. The foot will be in the L5981 class, e.g. flex foot or equivalent. The same socket, suspension, and foot will be used throughout the study in order to eliminate these confounding variables. All prosthesis fittings will be performed by the subject's own certified prosthetist according to manufacturers' fitting guidelines.</detailed_description>
