	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of a multi-peptide immunotherapy (BB-MPI-03) at three peptide+adjuvant dose levels. The peptides stimulate cytotoxic T-cells targeting oncofetal antigen (OFA). Subjects with AML, MM, sMM, or MDS who are off treatment and with stable disease or better, or who are not eligible for or refuse allogeneic HSCT are to be enrolled. The study will be conducted at 2 to 4 study centers in the US.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of an Oncofetal Antigen Multi-Peptide Immunotherapy in Subjects With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study designed to evaluate safety, immunogencity, and potential anti-tumor activity of BB-MPI-03 at three peptide plus adjuvant dose levels. Subjects with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are off treatment and with stable disease or better or who are not eligible for or refuse allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are to be enrolled. The study will be conducted at 2 to 4 study centers in the United States (US). The study employs a sequential group, open-label, 3+3 dose- escalation design to determine the safety and MTD of BB- MPI-03.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria a. History of morphologically confirmed AML w/ classification other than WHO Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (FAB M3), based on bone marrow examination. i. not a candidate for allogeneic HSCT or no intention to move to HSCT at time of enrollment. ii. Patient's AML could be in morphologic CR or no further cytotoxic chemotherapy is currently being considered. iii. Completed consolidation chemotherapy, if available and/or appropriate for patient. iv. Can have history of allogeneic HSCT transplant, but must be off immunosuppression for at least 2 wks. before enrollment and w/o GVHD and/or toxicities from HSCT. b. Diagnosed in past 5 years w/ smoldering MM at high risk of progressing to symptomatic MM. i. Diagnosis defined as: Bone marrow infiltration with plasma cells (PCs) ≥10% and presence of a monoclonal component, Ig G ≥3 g/dl or IgA ≥2 g/dl or BenceJones proteinuria &gt;1 g/dl and absence of lytic lesions on skeletal survey, absence of hypercalcemia (corrected calcium &lt;11 mg/dl), absence of renal failure (creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN), and absence of anemia (hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl or not 2 g/dl below LLN). ii. Must meet one of following: ≥10% PCs in bone marrow and IgG ≥3 g/dl or IgA ≥2 g/dl, ≥10% PCs in bone marrow and serum FLC ratio (involved : uninvolved) &gt;100 in blood, or IgG ≥3 g/dl or IgA ≥2 g/dl and FLC ratio (involved: uninvolved) &gt;100 in blood. c.

Stable disease or better per IMWG based on 2 subsequent assessments at least one month apart d. history of morphologically confirmed MDS i. previously received at least one treatment for MDS, including but not limited to chemotherapy or hypomethylating agent(s). Subjects may be previously untreated if they refuse treatment with or are not appropriate candidates for chemotherapy or hypomethylating agent(s) in the investigator's opinion. ii. intermediate, high, or very high risk MDS by IPSSr iii. No curative intent option of allogeneic HSCT or refused consideration for allogeneic HSCT iv. Could have history of allogeneic HSCT transplant and relapsed, but must be off immunosuppression for at least 2 weeks before enrollment and without GVHD and/or toxicities from HSCT. 2. Low, moderate, to high levels of OFA expression by IHC analysis of tumor specimens. 3. HLAA*02 haplotype. 4. ECOG performance status 0 to 2. 5. 18 years or older. 6. life expectancy ≥3 months. 7.
