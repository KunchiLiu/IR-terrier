	<brief_summary>The study aimed at comparing the evolution of renal function in patients showing a hypertension treated by various therapeutic strategies. Due to the contract research organisation (CRO) decision in September 2000, the database was locked and not accessible for Boehringer Ingelheim France. Consequently it was decided to stop the study and not proceed to the analysis. Thus, only safety data were processed in the safety database.</brief_summary>
