	<brief_summary>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) could be a useful tool for real-time diagnosis of brain lesions (initial diagnosis or follow-up post resection to check for residual dysplasia) and real-time assessment of resections margins during surgery. Probe-based CLE using the CELLVIZIOÂ® has never been used for glioma surgical guided resection. Before assessing the potential of this technique in improving surgical resection outcome, a feasability study has to be performed.</brief_summary>
