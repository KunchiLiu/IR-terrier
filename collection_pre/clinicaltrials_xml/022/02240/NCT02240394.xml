	<brief_summary>Increased intracranial pressure is a cause of disease progression in patients with brain disease, a common cause of poor prognosis. Intracranial pressure monitoring is the observation of the disease, treatment, evaluation and important way to improve the prognosis. Non-invasive intracranial pressure monitoring can be used to stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, brain trauma, encephalitis and other patients. Ophthalmic artery originated from the internal carotid artery, the optic canal into the orbit, the entire process can be divided into intracranial optic tube segment and orbital segment. investigators' preliminary experiments show that when intracranial pressure, intracranial ophthalmic artery segment velocity increases with increasing velocity difference orbital segment. Accordingly, the investigators speculate, may be judged by the level of intracranial pressure intracranial and orbital velocity difference between the ophthalmic artery segment, and accordingly calculate the specific values of intracranial pressure. The investigators will collect brain trauma surgery, performed invasive intracranial pressure monitoring cases, the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocity and different segments of the ophthalmic artery pulsatility index, the invasive intracranial pressure and comparing the measured values to calculate the the critical value of the ophthalmic artery segment intraorbital and intracranial velocity difference when intracranial pressure, thus fitting Based on projections of mathematical formulas intracranial pressure. This study will provide a non-invasive intracranial pressure monitor new approach.</brief_summary>
