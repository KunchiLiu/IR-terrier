	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of afuresertib and paclitaxel in subjects with recurrent HER2-negative gastric cancer, and further assess safety and preliminary efficacy of combination at the RP2D. Afuresertib had showed synergistic activity when combined with paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo models of gastric cancer. Dose escalation will continue until the MTD is established. The dose schedule is once daily (QD) dosing for afuresertib and intravenous (IV) infusion for paclitaxel Dose escalation in Part 1 will follow the 3 + 3 cohort design. A sequential approach will be conducted to explore the optimal paclitaxel regimen (weekly or 3weekly schedule) when combined with afuresertib. The dose escalation will be started from Cohort A (afuresertib combined with weekly paclitaxel regimen at 80 milligram (mg)/meter (m)^2 day1, 8,15, every 4 weeks (q4w). The starting dose in Cohort A will be 125 mg afuresertib QD. Once its MTD is identified, and then the study will move to dosing Cohort B (afuresertib combined with 3 weekly paclitaxel regimen at 175 mg/m^2 day1, every 3 week (q3w). The starting daily dose of Cohort B will be 25 mg less than the MTD dose from Cohort A for afuresertib. If it is tolerated, then the dose escalation schedule will be followed in Cohort B until the MTD in this Cohort is reached. If the starting dose is not tolerated, then dose de-escalation will be explored until the MTD in this Cohort is reached. Once two dimensions of the MTD are achieved, then the optimal regimen for paclitaxel and MTD for afuresertib combined with paclitaxel based on the toxicity profile will be identified. The combination regimen at the RP2D selected following Part I will be further investigated in its efficacy and safety in the Part II Expansion Cohort. Once a combination dose regimen for Part 2 has been determined, at least 20 and up to 40 subjects will be enrolled at the dose regimen selected following Part I. Overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated using a Green-Dahlberg design. The design consists with one interim analysis. If less than 3 responses are observed in the initial 20 subjects, enrollment will be terminated due to futility; otherwise, the study will continue to meet the planned sample size of 40 subjects.</brief_summary>

Abstinence, defined as sexual inactivity consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable disease. Subjects must have received firstline platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet regimen for advanced gastric cancer and now exhibit progressive disease (PD), and must have recovered from any treatmentrelated toxicity. Note: prior XELOX, XP, FOLFOX, or SP (S1+cisplatin)) treatment could be eligible, but priortaxane are ineligible. Note: if patient is refractory or disease progression within 6 months of adjuvant treatment, then his previous treatment would be considered as first line treatment rather than adjuvant treatment, and then this patient could be enrolled into this study if other inclusion/exclusion criterion meets. Subjects shall have at least one measurable disease (i.e., present with at least one measurable lesion) by RECIST version1.1 History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been diseasefree for 3 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.
