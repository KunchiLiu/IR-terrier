	<brief_title>Symptoms and Clinical Signs of Hypogonadism in Testicular Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies have shown that metabolic syndrome is common among testicular cancer. Patients with low levels of testosterone appear to be at higher risk of metabolic syndrome. A substantial number of testicular cancer survivors might be in a state of "compensated hypogonadism" with testosterone levels low in the normal range due to an increased LH-drive from the pituitary gland. Whether this specific groups of testicular cancer survivors are at increased risk of cardio-vascular disease and might benefit from testosterone substitution is yet to be clarified.</detailed_description>
