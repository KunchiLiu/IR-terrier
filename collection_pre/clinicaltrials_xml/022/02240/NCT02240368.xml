	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how Bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy EEG monitors agree between themselves and with end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane (ETsevo) in relationship with the age in the pediatric surgery setting. Bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy EEG monitors performance and utility is well established in adult general anesthesia. Their utility is yet undefined in the pediatric population as age seems to affect their ability to track the cerebral hypnotic state in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation of the Depth of Anesthesia Monitors in Pediatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients monitored applying standard device for blood pressure, electrocardiogram and pulse oximeter for routine monitor of anesthesia in pediatric surgery. Bispectral VISTA monitor and Entropy monitor applied for monitoring the depth of anesthesia. The investigators will not assign any specific interventions to the subjects of the study.</detailed_description>
