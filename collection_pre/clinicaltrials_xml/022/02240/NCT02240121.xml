	<brief_title>One Year Study of Rifaximin Delayed Release (DR) Tablets in Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RECD3125 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, multiregional, 52-week study to assess the efficacy and safety of rifaximin DR tablets for the induction of clinical remission and endoscopic response at 16 weeks followed by clinical and endoscopic remission after 52 weeks of continuous therapy in subjects with active moderate Crohn's disease. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to rifaximin or placebo at the beginning of the treatment period and will maintain treatment assignment throughout the duration of the study. Ileocolonoscopy will be performed on all subjects at baseline, between Weeks 16 and 17 (end of the Induction Phase), and following completion of the 36-week Long Term Treatment Phase (Week 52).</detailed_description>
