	<brief_summary>We would like to investigate our hypothesis of a higher prevalence of nasal fracture in the history of idiopathic rhinitis (IR) patients compared to healthy controls. Therefore a retrospective analysis of 310 patients with a nasal fracture in the past would be useful to investigate the incidence of IR in this cohort afterwards (5-10 y later).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Possible Manifestation of Rhinitis After Nasal Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population will be recruited by sending patient questionnaires (form in addendum) to patients who suffered a nasal fracture five to ten years ago (time period 2005-2013) with nose reposition afterwards under general anaesthesia in the chirurgical day care centre (CDC) of university hospital (UZ) Leuven. The control population (HC) will be recruited by sending a slightly adapted questionnaire (form in addendum) to patients who had surgery of the vocal cords under general anaesthesia in the CDC of UZ Leuven in the same period as the patient group. The control group will be age and sex-matched with the patient group.</detailed_description>
