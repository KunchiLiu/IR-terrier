	<brief_title>Combining Placing a Synera Patch With Propofol/Lidocaine Mixture to Decrease Pain With IV Propofol Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Commonly, anesthesiologists inject Propofol, a sleeping medication, intravenously to induce general anesthesia.Propofol injection is commonly associated with burning pain. In a previous onsite study we concluded that placing a Synera patch at least 30 minutes before placing the IV decreased the pain associated with the Propofol injection. Also,a study documented that adding Lidocaine to the Propofol decreases the pain associated with propofol injection. In our study here we are trying to evaluate if combining the use of both the Synera patch and the Propofol-Lidocaine mixture will further decrease the pain associated with the IV Propofol injection. All children will receive a Synera Patch, it will be placed on the dorsum of both hands for at least 30 minutes.All Children will be Sedated with P.O Versed. 22 g IV will be started either in the holding area or in the OR. Children will be randomized into groups using a computer generated randomization list:- Group 1 will receive Propofol -Lidocaine mixture. Group 2 will receive Propofol-Saline mixture. An independent blinded observer and an anesthesia member will independently evaluate pain on Propofol injection according to pain scale. 1. No pain. 2. Mild Pain (associated with facial expression of pain). 3. Moderate Pain(Pulling the arm). 4. Severe Pain (screaming).</detailed_description>
