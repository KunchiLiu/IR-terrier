	<brief_title>MSCs With or Without Peripheral Blood Stem Cell for Treatment of Poor Graft Function and Delayed Platelet Engraftment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many hematologic diseases. However, about 5-27% of patients would suffer from poor graft function (PGF) and more recipients might develop delayed platelet engraftment (DPE) after allo-HSCT. These complications are associated with considerable mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF and DPE usually involves hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or second transplantation, but these methods have dismal effect or even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs might be effective in the treatment of PGF. However, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF or DPE is unsatisfactory in our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF or DPE after allo-HSCT.</detailed_description>
