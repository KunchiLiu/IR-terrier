	<brief_summary>This study examines a training program for clinicians who work in mental health clinics that serve children with OCD. We will provide clinician training in conducting exposure-based treatments for children with OCD. The purpose of the project is to test the use of a new tool to enhance training in exposure-based treatments for clinicians. Therapists will receive training and oversight from the researchers regarding the treatment procedures and use of the new tool. All children enrolled in the study will receive treatment by clinicians who are participating in this study. Therapists and youth will be recruited separately for the study and will be assigned to work together.</brief_summary>
