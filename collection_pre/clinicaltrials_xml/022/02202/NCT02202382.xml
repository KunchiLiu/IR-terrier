	<brief_summary>Objective: Several in vitro studies report positive effects of ginseng on spermatogenesis. However, no controlled human clinical study of the effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on spermatogenesis has been performed. This study was performed to investigate the effects of KRG on semen parameters in male infertility patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Methods: A total of 80 male infertility patients with varicocele were recruited from April 2011 to February 2012. The subjects were then divided into the following four groups: non-V + P group, placebo; V + P group, placebo and varicocelectomy; non-V + KRG group, 1.5-g KRG daily; V + KGR group, 1.5-g KRG daily and varicocelectomy. Semen analysis was performed and hormonal levels were measured in each treatment arm after 12 weeks.</brief_summary>

The exclusion criteria were as follows: A history of vasectomy or obstructive azoospermia Chromosomal abnormalities Hypogonadism or pituitary abnormalities Anatomical abnormality of the genitals Significant hepatopathy (liver enzymes elevated 2 3fold higher than the normal range) Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) Medical treatment for infertility during the past 4 weeks</criteria>
