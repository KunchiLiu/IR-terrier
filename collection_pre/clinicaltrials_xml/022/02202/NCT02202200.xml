	<brief_summary>An open label multicentre, phase I-II study with tumour molecular pharmacodynamics (MPD) evaluation and pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 added to vemurafenib in patients suffering metastatic melanoma with BR. The main objective is to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PD-0332991 when added to standard vemurafenib therapy (960 mg BID). The estimated MTD is defined as the dose of PD-0332991 combined with vemurafenib that will be associated with a prespecified proportion of patients experiencing a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), ie, 1/3.</brief_summary>
