	<brief_summary>This is a single cohort, prospective post approval study conducted on patients with COPD in Canada. The study will enroll patients that have not responded to their current treatment of tiotropium alone, or who are on the fixed dose combinations fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Only patients for whom the physician has decided to change treatment due to lack of efficacy will be eligible to be enrolled in the study. Also will evaluate the real-life effectiveness of QVA149 (indacaterol 110 mcg/glycopyrronium 50 mcg) in the management of patients.</brief_summary>
