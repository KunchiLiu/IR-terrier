	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK) for colorectal cancer (CRC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adoptive Cell Therapy Plus Chemotherapy and Radiation After Surgery in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 patients with stageⅠ~ Ⅲ CRC, who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue, will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) or group B (just receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of autologous tumor lysate pulsed DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks) and 4 cycles chemo-radiotherapy. Patients in group B will receive only 4 cycles chemo-radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
