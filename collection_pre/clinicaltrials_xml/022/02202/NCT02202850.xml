	<brief_title>Defining Remission With Etanercept in AS in Real Life Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on a logistic regression defining the dependent variable as the remission at Month 12 and the 6 independent variables as ASAS partial remission, ASAS 5/6, ASAS60, ASAS40, BASDAI50 and ASDAS inactive disease status. This analysis will be conducted in each arm of the study as well as after a pooling of both patient groups. In this context it seems reasonable to ensure the completion of the study by a total approximate number of 100 patients (approximately 50 patients per arm). In order to ensure 50 completers in each arm, 70 patients will be recruited at baseline, taking into account a drop-out rate of 30% over 1 year period.</detailed_description>
