	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how behaviors and the effects of the body's internal clock (called the circadian pacemaker) affect the control of the heart and blood pressure. People with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) are hypothesized to have altered circadian amplitudes in certain key indices of cardiovascular (CV) and an abnormally advanced circadian phase in some of the same key indices of CV risk. The investigators hypothesize that such changes, taken together, may explain the different timing of heart attack and sudden cardiac death in OSA.</brief_summary>
