	<brief_summary>Two thirds of all strokes happen in developing countries like Pakistan. There is a serious lack of health literacy regarding survival after stroke. We hypothesize that our set of 5 minute videos that teach important skills to stroke survivors and their caregivers , that can be replayed in cell phones for extended learning, will increase their adherence to Medications after stroke and improve the control of blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and glucose in the participants getting cell phone based educational videos.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using 5 Minute Videos for Numeracy and Literacy Challenged Stroke Survivors to Improve Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 80% of patients with stroke, further events may be prevented by altering lifestyle behavioral risk, and increasing adherence to medications to control hypertension, diabetes, lipids. Yet, there exists a huge science to implementation gap to adopt these widely recognized beneficial medicines and lifestyle changes. Those most in need remain unable to actualize the benefits of science, due to lack of knowledge, perceived complexity, literacy challenges, limited time by poorly communicating doctors in crowded clinics and essentially, failure by regional scientists to translate Western science in creative resonant ways that enable wider uptake. In this randomized double blind translational implementation study, we will study the effectiveness of the implementation tactic of delivering enabling stroke education and risk reduction to literacy and numeracy challenged Pakistani stroke survivors and their caregivers, via short films teaching stroke recognition, healthy habits, medication adherence and self-care. These 5 minute films , using a 'show me not tell me ' approach, will be replayed in tablets, and shown to all stroke patients in the intervention arm. The primary objective of this study is to answer the research question - Does video based education given to stroke patients (with mild to moderate disability) and their caregivers before discharge, and during follow up, improve adherence to therapy and control of three major risk factors (Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia) at twelve months post index stroke?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult men and women, &gt; 18 years of age 2. Resident of Karachi and planning to live in Karachi to complete long term follow up 3. Able to understand Urdu (language of the videos) 4. Admitted with first ever stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) 5. Modified Rankin score &lt;3 ( Mild strokes) 6. Have at least one vascular risk factor that requires medical intervention 7. Consent to participate in the study and follow up, both stroke and caregiver. 8. Have a stable surrogate caregiver at home who is responsible for appointments, followups, overall care, e.g., wife, daughters, daughter in law, etc. 1. Serious aphasia, visual hemi neglect, short term memory loss in the patient precluding understanding, visualization or retention of the video material, despite overall "a small stroke", this would be a cognitively critical stroke. 2. Serious aphasia, visual hemi neglect, short term memory loss, dementia in the caregiver precluding understanding, visualization or retention of the video material. 3. Iatrogenic stroke, stroke due to nonatherosclerotic vascular disease and rare causes e.g. moya moya, carotid dissections, gunshot to neck, post Coronary Artery Bypass surgery etc. 4. Serious concurrent medical illnesses, like cancer, renal failure, acute liver disease in past 6 months (that precludes use of statins), chronic liver disease, that exclude the use of stroke preventive medications, or require non standardized therapy. 5. Any use of off label, nonguideline medications, due to patient unique comorbid conditions that interfere with medication compliance to antihypertensive, statins, antiplatelet agents and diabetes control.</criteria>
