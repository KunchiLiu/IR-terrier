	<brief_title>Study of Changes of Lymphocyte Subsets in Chemotherapy Course of Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer who received first chemotherapy in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University were collected, and the percentage of lymphocyte subsets at 9 time points before, during, and after chemotherapy was detected by flow cytometry method.We will investigate the changes of patients' lymphocyte subsets in chemotherapy courses. The correlation of the percentage of lymphocyte subsets and age, gender, pathological type, clinical stage, surgery or not, clinical efficacy assessment will be further analyzed.</detailed_description>
