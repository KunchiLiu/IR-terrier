	<brief_summary>Defining Which Remission Criterion at Month 6 Predicts Remission at Month 12 in a Real Life Clinical Practice, in a Cohort of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with Etanercept</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study With Etanercept Focusing on Remission and Predictability of Remission in Real Life Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on a logistic regression defining the dependent variable as the remission at Month 12 and the 5 independent variables as CDAI, SDAI, DAS28, DAS28 and Ultrasound, and EULAR Boolean definition for clinical practice and clinical studies. This analysis will be conducted in each arm of the study as well as after a pooling of both patient groups. In this context it seems reasonable to ensure the completion of the study by a total approximate number of 100 patients (approximately 50 patients per arm). In order to ensure 50 completers in each arm, 70 patients will be recruited at baseline, taking into account a drop out rate of 30% over 1 year period.</detailed_description>
