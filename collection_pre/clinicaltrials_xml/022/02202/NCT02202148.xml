	<brief_summary>This study is complementary to the main study "Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Serum Levels Evolution During the Six Months After Alcohol Withdrawal " NCT01491347. Liver stiffness variation is one of the major somatic effect of chronic alcohol consumption. It is a consequence of numerous mechanisms, including inflammation. Liver stiffness seems to depend on alcohol consumption in alcohol dependent patient, more precisely on the time after the last alcohol consumption. This is very few documented after alcohol withdrawal, and has never been explored during several months after withdrawal as a function of alcohol consumption and abstinence. Brain Derived neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) seems to play a major role in general homeostasis and also liver function. We propose here to analyse the serum BDNF levels variations after withdrawal according to liver stiffness levels and alcohol consumption status. We will also measure liver stiffness using FibroscanÂ® in alcohol dependent subjects included in the main study to search for a link with serum BDNF levels and abstinence at day 0, 14, 28 and months 2, 4, and 6.</brief_summary>
