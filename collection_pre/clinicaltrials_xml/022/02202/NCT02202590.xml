	<brief_title>Using Spectrally Encoded Confocal Microscopy (SECM) to Image the Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>36 subjects including healthy volunteers, patients with a suspicion of having Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) and patients with a clinical diagnosis of EoE will be recruited and asked to swallow the SECM capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis. As the capsule progresses, multiple 2-dimensional cross sectional images of the esophagus are acquired. Images are analyzed at a later stage.</detailed_description>
