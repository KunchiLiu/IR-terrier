	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the study is to use an iterative process to develop and refine a skill-based cooking intervention to decrease the consumption of energy from foods prepared away from home for evening meals, decrease energy intake, and promote a healthy weight in parents and children aged 3-10 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skill-based Cooking Intervention to Reduce Eating Out</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I. Conduct 2-4 focus groups with 6-10 caretaker, who report eating foods prepared away from home ≥3 times per week, per group to gain insight into current eating behaviors of foods prepared away from home, current perceptions about a home prepared evening meal, and barriers to preparing evening meals at home. Information gathered during Phase I will be used to inform intervention development in Phase II. Phase II. Develop, refine, and manualize a skill-based cooking intervention for overweight/obese caretakers of a child aged 3-10 years. The aim of Phase II is to test the feasibility of a skill-based cooking intervention to reduce the consumption of foods prepared away from home for the evening meal (e.g., pre-prepared frozen foods, restaurant foods, fast food, take-out), energy intake from evening meals, and promote a healthy weight in parents and children. Information collected during Phase I will inform the development of the skill-based cooking intervention. Once developed, the intervention will be refined with 6 primary caretakers of a child, who meet criteria for being overweight/obese during a testing phase. Conducting the intervention with at least six families will provide the opportunity for further refinement of intervention procedures. The results will be important to demonstrate feasibility for a future pilot randomized controlled trial that will test the impact of a skill-based cooking intervention compared to a standard cooking demonstration where recipes are simply provided to families.</detailed_description>
