	<brief_summary>School based educational intervention to educate on bone health among Hispanic, Asian or non-Hispanic white girls between 10-13 years with end points of knowledge gained, calcium intake and bone density in . The hypothesis was that the educational program would increase knowledge, improve dairy food and calcium consumption and enhance bone health in this population. A secondary hypothesis was that lactose maldigestion would be an impediment to improved dairy food consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Bone Health in Adolescence Through Targeted Behavioral Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A targeted behavioral intervention to improve calcium intake and bone mass was conducted at middle schools in 6 states. The primary outcomes of bone mass and dietary calcium were assessed among Asian, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white girls between 10 -13 y. Lactose maldigestion (LM) was determined by a breath hydrogen test (BHT). Perceived milk intolerance (PMI) and calcium intake were assessed by questionnaires and bone mineral content (BMC) was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Data from 473 girls were used in a multiple linear regression to examine the impact of the intervention while accounting for PMI and LM and adjusting for covariates.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Middle schools within onehour driving time of one of the designated DXA measurement sites were eligible to participate in ACT if their student population had a higher proportion of Asian or Hispanic students than the respective state's average. Girls recruited for evaluation measures were limited to those being at least 75% Asian, Hispanic or nonHispanic White based on the race/ethnicity of their biological parents.</criteria>
