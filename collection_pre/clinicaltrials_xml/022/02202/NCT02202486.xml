	<brief_summary>Substudy 1 Blood-brain barrier breakdown has been proposed in migraine patients. Our hypothesis that we will test in this study is that the blood-brain barrier breaks down during migraine attacks but not out side attacks using MRI. Substudy 2 Altered cerebral resting-state functional connectivity networks have been reported in migraine patients outside migraine attacks. What happens during migraine attacks has never been investigated. The hypothesis we will test is that pain related networks are affected during spontaneous attacks using functional MRI. Substudy 3 Old studies report that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is altered in patients with migraine with aura, but not in those without aura. We hypothesize that CBF is altered regionally during attacks, which we will investigate in this study using arterial spin labeling (ASL). Substudy 4 Structural changes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of the brain have been suggested but never investigated during migraine attacks. Our hypothesis is that pain related structures show altered VBM during spontaneous migraine attacks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of the Blood-brain and Blood-dura Barrier Durin Migraine Attacks Using MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain MRI during and outside migraine attacks. Up to 600 patients will be recruited, who will be given a phone number that they can call when they get migraine attacks. The study will continue until 20 patients with migraine with aura, 20 patients without aura, 20 patients with chronic migraine have completed the study.</detailed_description>
