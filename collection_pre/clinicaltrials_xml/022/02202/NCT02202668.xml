	<brief_summary>The primary translational research objective of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of using the Transcutaneous Raman Spectroscopy technology in a point-of-care environment. This study represents an initial evaluation of the device in a small cohort of human patients with diabetic foot ulcers. We will be evaluating safety, device design and certain human engineering factors associated with point of care use of the TRS. We anticipate the data we collect in this study will form the basis of later medical device studies.</brief_summary>
