	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation is self-limiting aggressive behavior that develops in the early period of awakening from anesthesia. A high level of preoperative anxiety is a risk factor for emergence agitation using Aono's four-point scale. Midazolam and ketamine was administered to the patients to decrease of preoperative anxiety. We aimed to compare the emergence agitation between midazolam group and ketamine group.</detailed_description>
