	<detailed_description>The study seeks to determine the reliability and accuracy of the acoustic respiratory monitoring (RAM) in comparison of clinically completed transthoracic impedance monitoring (TI) and manual counting of respiratory rate in postoperative pediatric patients at risk of adverse respiratory events.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male or female children 2 to 16 years of age Inpatients or 23 hour short stay patients who had a tonsillectomy with a diagnosis or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea or who had any surgery and receiving an opioid by patient controlled analgesia for postoperative pain control Child weighs at least 10 kg on day of surgery Patient has skin abnormalities (rash, eczema, etc.) at the planned application sites that would interfere with sensor or electrode applications. Patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit Patient has tracheostomy Patient is on noninvasive ventilator support</criteria>
