	<brief_summary>The rationale of this study is to further fine-tune and individualize prophylactic treatment of patients with severe Haemophilia A with the goal of keeping the trough FVIII level above 1% between doses. Because trough FVIII levels are likely to be important predictors of the efficacy of prophylaxis, the focus of this study is on PK data.</brief_summary>
