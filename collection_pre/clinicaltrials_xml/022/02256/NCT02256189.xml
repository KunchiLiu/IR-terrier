	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effect of DPP-4 inhibition on glucagon counter-regulatory mechanisms at moderate hypoglycemia in metformin-treated subjects with T2DM</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin and Glucagon Counterregulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The glucagon response to mild (3.0 mmol/l) hypoglycemia with and without DPP-4 inhibition by sitagliptin will be evaluated in elderly subjects with metformin treated type 2 diabetes to explore whether DPP-4 inhibition affects glucagon counter-regulation.</detailed_description>
