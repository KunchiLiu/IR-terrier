	<brief_summary>VRC01 is an experimental monoclonal antibody, which is a substance that may have the potential to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) (which is how the body interacts with a drug) of VRC01 in HIV-exposed infants who are at increased risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of VRC01, a Potent Anti-HIV Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody, in HIV-1-Exposed Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VRC01 is a potent anti-HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which is a substance that may have the potential to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This study will enroll HIV-infected mothers who are at increased risk of passing HIV on to their children. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and PK of VRC01 in HIV-exposed infants. This study will enroll 39 mother-infant pairs in three groups. Infants enrolled in Dose Group 1 will receive a single VRC01 20 mg/kg injection in the thigh less than 72 hours after birth. After 13 mother-infant pairs have been enrolled in Dose Group 1 and study staff have reviewed their safety data, staff will enroll 13 mother-infant pairs into Dose Group 2. Infants in Dose Group 2 will receive a single VRC01 40 mg/kg injection in the thigh less than 72 hours after birth. Study staff will review safety data from 6 participants in Dose Group 2 before enrolling 13 mother-infant pairs into Dose Group 3. Infants in Dose Group 3 will receive a VRC01 40 mg/kg injection in the thigh less than 5 days after birth. They will then receive a VRC01 20 mg/kg injection in the thigh monthly for at least 6 months (24 weeks) and no more than 18 months (72 weeks) while breastfeeding. The mothers in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will not receive any VRC01 injections. At study entry, all mothers will undergo a medical history review and a blood collection. Infants in Dose Groups 1 and 2 will attend several study visits through Week 48. Infants in Dose Group 3 will attend several study visits through Week 96. Visits will include a medical history review, physical examination, blood collection, and oral fluid collection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Maternal Documentation of HIV infection. Documentation of HIV1 infection is defined as positive results from two samples collected at different time points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. For this protocol, the results for sample #2 may be pending at the time of enrollment. Results documented in the clinical record from past testing may be used to satisfy the criteria for documentation of HIV1 infection. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age Able and willing to provide signed informed consent for herself and her infant Maternal Prior participation in any HIV1 vaccine trial Receipt of any other active or passive HIV immunotherapy or investigational product during this pregnancy. (Note that administration of Food and Drug Administration [FDA]approved antiretroviral [ARV] drugs when used to treat disease or prevent mothertochild transmission are not considered investigational.) Documented or suspected serious medical illness or immediate life threatening condition (other than HIV infection) in the mother that may interfere with the ability to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician Infant Born to an HIV1infected woman who meets all maternal inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above Gestational age, by best obstetrical, ultrasound, or infant exam, greater than or equal to 36 weeks Birth weight greater than or equal to 2.0 kg Allowable infant age at the time of enrollment is dependent on the Dose Group: Dose Group 2: Less than 72 hours of age, and anticipated availability to receive VRC01 immunization at less than 72 hours after birth. Dose Group 3: Less than or equal to 5 days of age, and anticipated availability to receive VRC01 immunization no more than 5 days after birth. At increased risk of HIV acquisition defined as documentation of one or more of the following risk factors: Dose Group 2, only: Mother received no ART during pregnancy; or Mother began or reinitiated ART (after an interruption of greater than 14 days), during the third trimester of pregnancy; or Mother with any detectable viral replication (HIV RNA above the limit of detection) at last measurement prior to delivery determined within 30 days of delivery; or Prolonged rupture of membranes (greater than 12 hours); or Mother with documented* 2class resistant HIV infection, which may include historical documentation of lack of response Women who have a documented history of virologic failure while on NNRTIs but who had no resistance testing at the time of viral failure will be considered to have NNRTI documented resistance. Dose Group 3, only (international sites): Mother intends to breastfeed Infant Receipt of any other active or passive HIV immunotherapy or investigational product other than the study vaccine (Note: Infant prophylaxis with any licensed ARV drugs clinically prescribed to prevent mothertochild HIV transmission are not considered investigational.) Receipt of or anticipated need for blood products, immunoglobulin, or immunosuppressive therapy. This includes infants who require hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) but does not require exclusion of infants who receive hepatitis B vaccine in the newborn period. Documented or suspected serious medical illness, serious congenital anomaly, or immediate life threatening condition in the infant that may interfere with the ability to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician Any requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 24 hours of life or requiring supplemental oxygen at the time of the VRC01 dose Baseline laboratory results: Hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL Platelet count less than 100,000 cells/mm^3 Absolute neutrophil count: for infants less than or equal to 24 hours old, less than 4,000 cells/mm^3; for infants greater than 24 hours old, less than 1,250 cells/mm^3 Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) greater than or equal to 1.25 times upper limit of age adjusted normal Dose Group 2, only: Infant is breastfeeding at time of enrollment or mother has indicated an intention to initiate breastfeeding. Note: if a child is breastfed prior to known maternal diagnosis (in the case of a woman diagnosed in the intrapartum period), the child is still eligible as long as breastfeeding is stopped by the time the child is enrolled and there is no plan to resume breast milk feeding.</criteria>
