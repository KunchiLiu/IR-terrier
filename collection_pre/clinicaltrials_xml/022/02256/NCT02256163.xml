	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study are - to assess the contribution of alteration of each known gene on non-syndromic TAA. - to map and identify unknown gene involved in the non-syndromic TAA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of the study are - to study the correlation of phenotype-genotype, in particular, to compare the aortic phenotype of non-syndromic TAA patients and TAA syndromic patients. - to develop national standardized strategies of genetic diagnosis and of clinical management using genetic data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For all: Aged &gt; 18 years. Written informed consent obtained. People with health insurance. For individual: people â‰¥ 45 years, thoracic aortic aneurysm without syndrome, or people &gt; 45 years with familial TAA. For family: At least 2 members of family in 2 generations have TAA without syndrome and at least 2 patients of TAA will undergo blood collection. All people in family will undergo blood collection, each member should declare at first his (her) status (with or without TAA, unknown), the relationship (direct relative family or family inlaw), no limit of age. For the children, only those with TAA will perform blood collection for the study. Thoracic aortic aneurysm with different syndromes (Marfan syndrome, EhlersDanlos syndrome, LoeysDietz syndrome, Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome). Arterial hypertension.</criteria>
