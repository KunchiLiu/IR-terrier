	<brief_summary>Participants with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable urothelial cancer that has recurred or progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab will prolong Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. The study's interim analysis results demonstrated superior OS in the Pembrolizumab arm compared to the Active Comparator arm (investigator's choice: paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine). Based on the positive outcome of the OS interim analysis, effective with Amendment 15, eligible participants who were allocated to the Active Comparator arm and experienced disease progression will be provided with the opportunity to crossover to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg one time every three weeks (Q3W) for up to two years of treatment in the Crossover Phase of the study.</brief_summary>
