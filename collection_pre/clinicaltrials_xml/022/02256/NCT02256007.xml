	<detailed_description>The rehabilitation industry is the incipient stages of developing and using electronic based assessment and intervention tools. With the growing understanding of cognitive recovery following stroke, rehabilitation specialists are optimistic that appropriate rehabilitation interventions may optimize and enhance functional outcomes. The use of technology based assessments via video games may assist in a patient's cognitive recovery. Design and development of an evidence-based game approach will enhance the investigators understanding and usability of electronic tools to measure cognitive and sensorimotor abilities.</detailed_description>
