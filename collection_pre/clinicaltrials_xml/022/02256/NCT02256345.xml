	<brief_summary>This study will be performed to determine the safety, tolerability, and dose-response to inorganic nitrate on exercise capacity in HFpEF. There are two primary goals for this study: 1. Determine the population-specific pharmacokinetics and dose of KNO3 that can be safely given to subjects with HFpEF. 2. Determine if there is a dose-response effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise capacity, evidenced by peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), and physiologic adaptations to exercise.</brief_summary>
