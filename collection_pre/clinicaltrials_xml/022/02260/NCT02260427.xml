	<brief_summary>Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are well established in anesthetic practice. Among these devices, the i-gel has been typically widely used. The self-pressurised air-Q intubating laryngeal airway (air-Q sp) is newly developed supraglottic airway devices. It is a new single-use device that may optimise the airway sealing while reducing the potential for postoperative complications such as sore throat. The overall structure of the air-Q sp is similar to the original air-Q, except the inflatable cuff. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the clinical performance of the i-gel and the air-Q sp in elderly patients</brief_summary>
