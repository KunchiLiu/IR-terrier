	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefit of systematic preoperative coronary angiography followed by selective coronary artery revascularization on the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients without a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Angiography Before Elective Carotid Endarterectomy in Patients With Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients candidates for CEA, with no history of CAD, a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and a normal cardiac ultrasound were randomized in two groups. In group A (n = 216) all patients underwent coronary angiography before CEA +- coronary artery revascularization. In group B (n = 210) CEA was performed without coronary angiography.</detailed_description>
