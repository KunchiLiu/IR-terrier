	<brief_summary>This is a single center randomized controlled trial. Approximately 102 patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: cooled radiofrequency or conventional monopolar radiofrequency ablation. Patients with chronic knee pain, with moderate to severe osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence scale for at least 6 months who have failed conservative therapy will be screened for the study. Then, patients will be enrolled based on reporting â‰¥50% pain relief after a fluoroscopic guided single diagnostic block of the geniculate nerves (superior medial, superior lateral, and inferior medial) with 0.5 ml of local anesthetic (2% Lidocaine). Baseline data will be collected for all enrolled patients. Outcomes will be measured at 1, 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks. Outcome measures will be: Visual analogue scale (VAS) both while at rest and during ambulation, Oxford knee scores, WOMAC, and global perceived effect.</brief_summary>

Persistent pain despite the use of conservative treatment (physical therapy, oral analgesic, steroid injections). Must have a VAS score of at least 5 with ambulation. Subjects must be on a stable dose of pain medication regimen for at least 2 months. Greater than or equal to 50% improvement from blocks in target knee for duration of the anesthetic. Knee pain must not be acute. Previous total knee replacement. Evidence of connective tissue disease. Patients who have a BMI greater than 40. Evidence of serious neurological or psychiatric disorders. Current opioid use must not be greater than or equal to 90 mg morphine equivalent per 24 hour period. Must not have radicular pain in the affected limb. Patients with uncorrected coagulation disorders or who are on anticoagulation therapy and cannot interrupt the therapy. Patients who have pacemakers or generators. Patient who are pregnant, breastfeeding or women of childbearing potential with positive pregnancy tests. Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential who are not willing to use adequate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy until week 52 of the study. Sexually active male patients who are not willing to use adequate contraceptive measures until week 52 of the study. Adequate methods of birth control include the following: Hormonal contraception (female patients) or use of at least one acceptable doublebarrier method (for example: diaphragm plus spermicidal agent or condoms (male or female) plus spermicidal agent.), vasectomy, intrauterine device, and/or exclusive sexual partner for whom one of the above acceptable methods applies. Patients who have cancer or a past history of any cancer within 5 years prior to the time of informed consent, with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
