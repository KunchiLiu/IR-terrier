	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has sequential two stage design. Bioequivalence based on encapsulated doxorubicin will be tested at the end of stage 1. Power analysis will be performed for the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of free Doxorubicin and liposome encapsulated Doxorubicin, for all completed patients before bioequivalence evaluation. If observed power will be &gt;= 80% then two one-sided 90% CI will be calculated for bioequivalence assessment at stage I. If observed power will be &lt; 80% then bioequivalence will be evaluated at stage I. If bioequivalence met then study will be stopped and if bioequivalence not met, then required additional patients will be enrolled in stage II. Each patient will be randomized to one of the two treatment sequences ( RT or TR ) according to a randomization scheme prepared prior to the start of the trial. Serial blood samples for determination of free doxorubicin and liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin plasma concentration for PK analysis will be obtained in each cycle . Bioequivalence Criteria : The 94.12% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least squares means of ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf should be within 80.00 to125.00% to conclude the test product is bioequivalent to the reference product.</detailed_description>
