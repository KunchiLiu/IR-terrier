	<brief_summary>Objective: To investigate the effects of a one-year worksite individual exercise intervention on lifestyle-related modifiable health risks, physical capacity and work performance. Methods: Two hundred ninety-five employees volunteered to participate (n=191 women, n=104 men), aged 38 ± 8 years and body mass index (BMI), 24.71 ± 3.79. Measures of physical activity levels were assessed by the long self-administrated version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form (IPAQ-L), and all subjects performed a maximal cardiopulmonary treadmill graded exercise test. Blood samples and anthropometry measures were collected from participants at baseline survey, at 6 months and 1-year after. Components of the program included supervised moderate to high intensity cardiorespiratory exercise, resistance training, and flexibility.</brief_summary>
