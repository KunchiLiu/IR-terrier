	<detailed_description>Most organ failure results in modest drops in function until over 50% of function is lost. At a certain point, even modest drops in physiologic activity result in dramatic drops in clinical function. Though less homogeneous than in other organs, clinical experience and the literature suggests a similar process occurs in the brain. The hypothesis is that by using an integrated protocol to, essentially, "tune up" neuronal function, a 5-10 % improvement in metabolic functioning may translate to significant improvement in clinical functioning. This tune-up will include "MIND": M- Metabolism-- optimizing hormonal function I- Infections-- looking for and eliminating N- Nutritional and herbal support D- Drugs- Weaning subjects off unneeded medications</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis of Alzheimer's and/or dementia with an MMSE score over 12 or being ambulatory and able to travel outside the home with assistance. Must have a caregiver living with them. Overt progressive and severe causes of secondary dementia such as metastatic brain cancers, or severe overt infectious encephalopathies or severe autoimmune illness. Also, severe life threatening illnesses which would make them unlikely to be alive after 612 months</criteria>
