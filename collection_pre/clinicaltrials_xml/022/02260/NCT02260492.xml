	<criteria>1. Males and females ≥ 18 years old of nonchild bearing potential or of child bearing potential committing to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control 2. Subjects with a reliable clinical history of asthma documented at least 12 weeks prior to screening 3. Subjects with a prebronchodilator FEV1 of &gt; 40% and &lt;85% of the predicted value during the screening visit and on the first day of treatment 4. Subjects who are currently nonsmoking and have not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco) within the past year, and had &lt; 10 packyears of historical use 5. Subjects with &gt; 15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 360 mcg of albuterol inhalation (pMDI). Note: This test may be repeated on a different day if the patient fails the first attempt; and if the patient achieves at least 10% reversibility and the Investigator thinks that a second attempt is appropriate 6. Subjects who are able to discontinue their asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids and longacting beta agonists) during the runin period and for the remainder of the study 7. Subjects who are able to replace current shortacting beta agonists (SABAs) with salbutamol/albuterol inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study (subjects should be able to withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours prior to lung function assessments on study visits) 8. Subjects who are able to continue the following medications without a significant adjustment of dosage, formulation, or dosing interval for the duration of the study, and judged able by the investigator to withhold them for the specified minimum time intervals prior to each clinic visit: shortacting forms of theophylline for 12 hours, twiceaday controlled release forms of theophylline for 24 hours, onceaday controlledrelease forms of theophylline for 36 hours 9. Subjects who are able to discontinue the following medications for the specified minimum time intervals prior to the runin period and for the remainder of the study: oral and parenteral corticosteroids for 1 month and oral shortacting beta agonists for 12 hours 10. Subjects who are able and willing to give their written informed consent to participate in the study. ********************************************************** 11. Female Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding 12. Subjects who have lifethreatening asthma in the last 10 years, as defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnoea; respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures, asthmarelated syncopal episodes(s), or hospitalizations within the past year or during the runin period 13. Subjects with evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. In addition, historical or current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal, or other diseases that in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk through study participation, or would affect the study analyses if the disease exacerbated during the study 14. Subjects with a hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g. Salmeterol or salbutamol/albuterol) or any inhaled, intranasal or systemic corticosteroid therapy 15. Subjects who are on other medications with the potential to affect the course of asthma or to interact with sympathomimetic amines (e.g. beta blockers, oral decongestants, benzodiazepines, digitalis, phenothiazines, polycyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) 16. Subjects with a viral or bacterial upper or lower respiratory tract infection or sinus or middle ear infection within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit or during the runin period 17. Subjects with any factors (e.g. infirmity, disability, or geographic location) that the investigator feel would likely limit the patient's compliance with the study protocol or scheduled clinic visits 18. Subjects who have used any investigational drug in any clinical trial within 1 month of receiving the first dose of OT329 Solis™ study medication 19. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably or who are unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator 20. Subjects with a milk protein allergy</criteria>
