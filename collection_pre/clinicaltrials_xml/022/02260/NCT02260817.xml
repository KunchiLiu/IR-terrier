	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study will target approximately 100 men over age 18 who have a biochemical relapse or other evidence of relapse of prostate cancer after primary treatment. The purpose of this study is to: A. Provide expanded access the drug 11C-choline. B. Determine the performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) of 11C-choline PET/Computed Tomography (CT) and PET/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the detection of metastatic prostate cancer in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after primary treatment in a prospective manner. C. Determine the optimal Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) trigger value in 11C-choline PET/CT and PET/MRI positive patients through a prospective study. D. Determine factors that predict a confirmed positive 11C-choline PET/CT and PET/MRI using a multivariable analysis of clinical and pathologic data collected prospectively. E. Compare the individual performance characteristics of 11C-choline PET/CT and 11C-choline PET/MRI and the combination of 11C-choline PET/CT and PET/MRI Study Protocol: 1. Patients entered into the study will undergo a 11C-choline PET CT scan and MRI scan. 2. The CT and MRI images will be evaluated for evidence of metastatic prostate cancer. 3. The 11C-choline PET CT and MRI images will be evaluated for evidence of metastatic prostate cancer. 4. Evidence of metastasis on conventional imaging or 11C-choline PET will be confirmed with biopsy or surgical pathology when possible, or by response to treatment on subsequent imaging. 5. Rates of confirmed metastasis between conventional CT and MRI images will be compared with the 11C-choline PET CT and MRI images. 6. Upon conclusion of each imaging protocol, the referring physician will receive written documentation of the results. At this time, the patient will be considered off study and no further follow up is required.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. The study will consist of patients who have a biochemical relapse or other evidence of relapse after primary treatment. This study group will consist of patients who have been treated with radiation therapy, or androgen suppression and radiation therapy who have a PSA &gt; 2 ng/mL higher than the nadir level. The nadir level in patients who have been treated with androgen suppression and radiation therapy is determined after the serum testosterone level has normalized. This study group will also consist of patients who have been treated with radical prostatectomy and who have a biochemical relapse defined as a PSA of 0.2 ng/mL confirmed at that level or higher on a subsequent PSA test 3 months later. This group may consist of men who have other clinical evidence of relapse such as a suspicious bone scan or CT scan regardless of PSA kinetics. Patients identified as potential subjects will be screened against the eligibility criteria as defined above in Section 4.1. 2. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants before any study related procedures are conducted. Each participant will be informed about the nature of the study, its purpose, and possible risks. Informed consent will be documented by using the written informed consent document approved by the local IRB at the Decatur Memorial Hospital. 3. At the time of referral, patients will be asked to bring their prior records as it pertains to their prostate cancer history. Data collected from outside records, such as radiographic studies, previous imaging studies and biopsies will be incorporated into the study record. 4. Abstracted data for the study record will include: 1. Patient demographics such as age, race, and family history of prostate cancer 2. Risk factors such as finasteride or dutasteride use, and environmental exposure (eg. Agent orange) 3. Prostate exam results, most recent within last 90 days 4. PSA test results, most current and past 5. Past medical and surgical history 6. Current medications 7. Allergies 8. Pathology reports 9. Imaging reports 10. Date of diagnosis 11. Date(s) of biochemical relapse and coordinating PSA results. Once all records have been assessed for eligibility, an order for the 11C-choline PET CT scan and MRI scan will be requested from the referring physician and patient will be scheduled and given the appropriate prep instructions. 5. Patients entered into the study will undergo a 11C-choline PET CT scan and MRI scan. The CT scan will be performed with intravenous contrast unless deemed unsafe by lab values. The CT and MRI images will be evaluated for evidence of metastatic prostate cancer. The 11C-choline PET CT and MRI images will be evaluated for evidence of metastatic prostate cancer. Unequivocal evidence of metastasis on both conventional imaging and 11C-choline PET will be considered a true positive. Evidence of metastasis on conventional imaging or 11C-choline PET will be confirmed with biopsy or surgical pathology when possible, or by response to treatment on subsequent imaging. If confirmation of metastasis is not achievable by biopsy or surgical pathology, then confirmation will be achieved with 11C-choline PET CT and MRI images obtained 3 months after treatment conclusion. Rates of confirmed metastasis between conventional CT and MRI images will be compared with the 11C-choline PET CT and MRI images. 6. Upon conclusion of each imaging protocol, the referring physician will receive written documentation of the results. At this time, the patient will be considered off study and no further follow up is required.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. For biochemical relapse after primary treatment 1. PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy confirmed at that level or higher on a subsequent test 3 months later 2. PSA increase &gt;2 ng/ml from nadir following radiation therapy 3. PSA increase &gt;2 ng/ml from nadir following radiation therapy plus androgen deprivation therapy with nadir defined with normalized testosterone level 4. Two consecutive PSA increases from nadir level after androgen blockade or androgen suppression therapy 2. Kidney function with GFR &gt; 60 mL/sec/1.73m2 and Creatinine &lt; 1.7mg, collected within 90 days of planned scan 1. if GFR is &gt; or equal to 60 mL/sec/1.73m2, PET/CT will be completed with contrast 2. if GFR is &lt; 60 mL/sec/1.73m2, PET/CT will be completed without contrast 3. if Creatinine is &gt; than 1.7 mg, Radiology will follow ACR recommendations as outlined in department policy. 3.
