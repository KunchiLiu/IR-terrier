	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial of epiphysiodesis techniques: percutaneous transphyseal screw epiphysiodesis versus percutaneous drill epiphysiodesis for the correction of leg length discrepancy. The primary outcome will be mean physeal growth following epiphysiodesis, at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include fluoroscopy and surgical times, physeal growth at additional time points out to 2 years, pain, knee function, return to activity, quality of life, complications, need for additional surgical procedures and cost. A cost-effectiveness analysis will follow completion of the RCT. The authors hypothesize that mean growth at the treated physis will be significantly lower following drill epiphysiodesis compared to screw epiphysiodesis, measured at 6 months and that screw epiphysiodesis will have a shorter length of hospital stay, shorter fluoroscopy and OR times, fewer days with modified weight bearing, less time to full weight bearing, less pain, less time to return to sports, and higher quality of life, and higher knee function than drill epiphysiodesis. Additionally, the authors hypothesize that screw epiphysiodesis will be more expensive due to secondary surgeries to remove implants but that screw epiphysiodesis will be preferred by patients due to less pain, better outcomes, shorter time in hospital, and fewer days with modified weight-bearing.The results of this study are expected to improve outcomes for children undergoing epiphysiodesis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tantalum bead implants will permit accurate and reliable measurements of growth after epiphysiodesis. Although plain x-rays are the standard method in clinical practice for assessing growth following epiphysiodesis, this technique presents some difficulties, as it is not possible to determine whether growth in the limb following epiphysiodesis is from the distal or proximal physis.{{96 Blair,V.P.,3rd 1982}},{{98 Little,D.G. 1996}}. Attempting to assess the success of epiphysiodesis with plain radiographs requires multiple assumptions (assumptions regarding proportion of growth from each physis, growth rates, and age at final growth), and with multiple assumptions come multiple opportunities for error. Tantalum beads will facilitate direct measurement of growth following epiphysiodesis. Tantalum beads have been successfully used in adults and children {{12 Lauge-Pedersen,H. 2006}}, and although it requires implantation of small radio-opaque beads, it is considered the gold standard when making detailed radiographic measures, and the optimal technique for physeal growth measurements.{{12 Lauge-Pedersen,H. 2006}}{{13 Haugan,K. 2012}}. Over 300 000 beads have been inserted in vivo without significant complications. To date, tantalum beads have not been used to accurately assess growth following screw epiphysiodesis. Although outcomes of drill and screw epiphysiodesis exist{{10 Campens,C. 2010; 11 Ghanem,I. 2011}} , the assessments are retrospective non-randomized series, which may be at risk for selection bias, and may not adequately capture all of the outcomes of interest, depending on what data is routinely collected and documented in the medical chart. To our knowledge, no prospective randomized comparison of epiphysiodesis techniques and clinical outcomes has been published accurately assessing how effective each technique is in disabling growth at the physis, or taking into account patient-centered outcomes or cost. Operative measures such as the surgical time and radiation exposure from intra-operative fluoroscopy have not previously been compared. Utilization of functional outcomes such as time to full weight-bearing, return to school, knee function by pedi-IKDC have not previously been assessed in this population. The proposed research study aims to fill this gap. By randomized controlled trial, the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of drill and screw epiphysiodesis will be assessed. When selecting a technique of epiphysiodesis, the most important factor is how reliable the procedure is in gaining the desired effect: obliteration of growth at the physis. This is important because failure to completely disrupt growth may result in angular deformity or ongoing length discrepancy, which may require secondary surgery and have negative effects on function and quality of life. Secondary factors that may be used in selecting an epiphysiodesis technique include complications, procedure time, radiation exposure, pain, hospital stay, return to weight bearing activities, and quality of life. The assessment of costs associated with these techniques has not previously been documented. A cost- effectiveness analysis will be conducted at the end of the study in order to evaluate the cost utility balance of both of these procedures.We will use advanced decision analysis techniques to determine the overall best method of epiphysiodesis incorporating cost data as well as data on clinical recovery and outcomes. This study will add valuable clinical information that is expected to change surgeon technique preferences for epiphysiodesis. Further, patients will better understand what to expect following this type of surgery, and ultimately benefit from improved clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
