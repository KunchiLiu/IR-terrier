	<brief_summary>Hip impingement is thought to be a leading cause of hip osteoarthritis, and occurs due to deformities in the hip joint. However some individuals have these deformities but do not exhibit symptoms. Using the standard magnetic resonance imaging and clinical tests it is not clear which deformities will cause degeneration, requiring surgical intervention. We propose to evaluate the deformity and impingement between the femur and acetabulum using dynamic ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound does not involve radiation and can acquire video of the hip joint and is thus suitable for such diagnostic purposes. In this pilot study we will evaluate the feasibility of ultrasound in diagnosing hip impingement.</brief_summary>
