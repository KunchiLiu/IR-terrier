	<brief_title>Study of A-101 for the Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of 2 concentrations of A-101 Solution and its matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when applied to SK target lesions on the face. A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 concentrations of A-101 Solution and its matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when applied topically up to 2 times to SK target lesions on the face.</detailed_description>
