	<brief_summary>The ability to regulate impulses enables us to plan for the future, to maintain focus in the face of distractions (i.e. to encode memories), and to manage emotions. This self regulation can be compromised in individuals who have a history of mild traumatic brain injury and co-occurring disorders. In this study the investigators are using functional MRI scanning to understand how memory and self regulation are expressed in the brains of people with a history of mild traumatic brain injury. The investigators are also testing whether the medication tolcapone may improve memory and self regulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover cognitive neuroscience study, the investigators are evaluating whether the COMT inhibitor tolcapone impacts memory and self regulation, as measured both behaviorally (via cognitive testing) and neurophysiologically (via functional MRI).</detailed_description>
