	<brief_summary>This study aims to ensure that assays that measure drug concentrations are accurate and precise in different matrices when quantified using high performance liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The study involves collecting samples of various bodily fluids to quantify antimicrobials, antivirals, oral contraceptives and erectile dysfunction agents. Samples will also be obtained from individuals not receiving these medications for quality control purposes.</brief_summary>
