	<brief_title>Sonoelastography of the Uterine Cervix Before Induction of Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Softening of the uterine cervix in pregnant patients at term causes changes in its elasticity.these changes may affect success or failure in induction of labor.The elasticity of the uterine cervix is usually evaluated clinically and subjectively by vaginal examination (bishop's score) which is not very predictive.We aim to measure the elasticity quantitatively and objectively.The difference in strain, in the area of the internal os , is often illustrated by a color map, where low stiffness (soft tissue) is indicated in red, middle stiffness is in green and high stiffness (hard tissue) is in blue.The color maps will be compared between patients with successful and failed inductions.</detailed_description>
