	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized placebo- controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus SP1- containing probiotic tablets as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP). Material and methods: Thirty six chronic periodontitis patients will be recruited and monitored clinically, immunologically and microbiologically at baseline, 3 and 6 months after therapy. All patients will receive scaling and root planning and randomly will be assigned over an experimental (SRP + probiotic, n=18) or control (SRP + placebo, n=18) group.
