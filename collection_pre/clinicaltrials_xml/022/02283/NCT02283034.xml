	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to compare five CPR feedback devices to standard BLS in terms of the quality of single rescuer pediatric resuscitation. Therefore, the investigators hypothesis was that there would be no difference between CPR methods in terms of chest compression quality parameters.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide. High-quality chest compressions are of paramount importance for survival and good neurological outcome. Unfortunately, even health professionals have difficulty performing effective CPR. Chest compression (CC) is often too shallow, compression ratio is inadequate, and hands-off time is too long. CPR feedback devices might be an option for rescuers to in order to increase CC efficiency.</detailed_description>
