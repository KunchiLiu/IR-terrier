	<brief_summary>This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or lifestyle modification plus Pentoxifylline groups. Liver function tests, metabolic profile and anthropometric measurements were checked at baseline and six months later.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Pentoxifylline on Liver Function Tests in Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in patients with the evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or lifestyle modification plus Pentoxifylline groups. Fasting serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein,homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR), and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference) were checked at baseline and six months later.</detailed_description>
