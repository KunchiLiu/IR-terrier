	<brief_summary>Introduction: Different variations of the Fontan operation has been used to treat complex cardiac anomalies with a single functional ventricle. This procedure has substantially improved quality of life and survival in patients with these complex cardiac anomalies. However, the cardiovascular and pulmonary functioning as well as skeletal muscle alterations that can explain the exercise intolerance in these patients is still poorly understood. Objectives: 1) To evaluate effects of different exercise programs on adolescents and adults with Fontan circulation. Methods: A long-term randomized clinical study that will include 60 patients between 12 and 30 years, submitted to total cavopulmonary connection for at least 5 years post operative at the Heart Institute, University of São Paulo Medical School. The patients will be divided into four groups: 1) Exercise training with aerobic exercise + lower and upper limb strength exercise (GTF-I); 2) Respiratory training with respiratory muscle exercise (GTF-II); 3) Exercise training with aerobic exercise + lower and upper limb strength exercise + Respiratory training with respiratory muscle exercise (GTF-III); and A non-exercise group as control group (GNTF-IV). The patients will be revaluated after the 4-month period of intervention. Expected Outcomes: The investigators expect to demonstrate that exercise training and respiratory training can substantially improve the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses and skeletal muscle system in patients with univentricular circulation. In addition, the investigators wil test the hypothesis that the effects of exercise training associated with respiratory training on cardiovascular and pulmonary responses and skeletal muscle system may be greater than exercise training or respiratory training alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research proposes to evaluate patients after undergoing the Fontan surgery. The investigators want to understanding exercise intolerance and they want to demonstrate the effects of exercise training after different programs of physical exercise. As well as, the quality of life.</detailed_description>
