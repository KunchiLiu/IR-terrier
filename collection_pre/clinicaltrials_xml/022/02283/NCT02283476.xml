	<brief_summary>Endostar is a anti-angiogenesis product and has been launched in China . The efficacy and safety have been defined. However, the compliance is unsatisfactory since routine i.v of Endostar is needed for 3 to 4 hours daily during one cycle of 14 days. The continuous intravenous infusion by using venous pump can improve the compliance.The comparative study in efficacy and safety has not been done concerning continuous and routine i.v.In addition, what patient can be benefited from Endostar have not been investigated. The biological markers, such as circulating endothelial cells，CECs, will be explored in the study.</brief_summary>
