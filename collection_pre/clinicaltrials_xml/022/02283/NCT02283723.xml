	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Using the TAPESTRY Approach to Care for Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching aim of the integrated multicomponent TAPESTRY approach is to promote optimal aging. Optimal aging within the TAPESTRY program means supporting people to move through life with good health in the best possible way: Being Alive Well. TAPESTRY is a health and social care approach that centres on meeting a person's health goals with the support of technology, trained community volunteers, an interprofessional team, system navigation, and better links between primary care and community organizations. The TAPESTRY intervention takes a complex, multilevel approach to integration, from both system level and individual level perspectives. The TAPESTRY program will provide processes and tools to activate and support individuals to access and use the broad range of available primary health care, social and community services to achieve their personal health goals and strategies to better integrate care at the system level. More specifically TAPESTRY will promote optimal aging: - through intentional, proactive conversations about a person's life, health and care goals within the primary healthcare setting; - through improved connections between inter-professional primary care teams, community service providers and informal caregivers; - by training volunteers to serve as a link between the primary care team and a person in their home; - by using technology from the home to link directly with the primary health care team which includes - the tablet-based TAPESTRY APP for volunteers to use; - the Personal Health Record (PHR) and - innovative resources (i.e. Optimal Aging Portal). It is anticipated that together these will enable transformation of how primary healthcare and interprofessional teams provide care to older adults in a manner that provides value for resources used and meets needs and goals of older adults.</detailed_description>
