	<brief_summary>This study will test a suction-based method of engaging the cervix. Bioceptive has developed a device that more gently and atraumatically attaches to the cervix with no bleeding. This novel attachment mechanism may diminish pain and discomfort. Pre-clinical testing has been performed on the device including testing on synthetic uterine models, human cadavers, and human uteri immediately post-hysterectomy (Utah IRB # 00059096). Results from these efforts have shown effective attachment to the cervix and the ability for the device to maintain suction throughout a procedure atraumatically. This study proposes to introduce this minimal risk device in a clinical setting to determine the response of women undergoing gynecologic procedures.</brief_summary>
