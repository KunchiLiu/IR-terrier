	<brief_summary>With a growing body of knowledge on the promising advancements and recent clinical data of the third generations of the Greenlight PVP/XPS, it seems to be a real contender in the world of MIS. Contenders of Greenlight laser technology includes bipolar as well as Holmium laser technology. In this study the investigators planned to test the Greenlight (532-nm) laser PVP using (XPS) 180W system compared to bipolar electro-vaporization, in reduction of LUTS secondary to small to moderate sized BPH in a prospective randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GreenLight Laser Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate vs Plasma Kinetic Vaporization of the Prostate; RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with LUTS due to BPH seen through the outpatient prostate clinic in the Mansoura UNC were assessed to evaluate if the patient is eligible to the study inclusion criteria. Patients who are meeting these criteria were asked to participate in this randomized comparative study and were provided with an informed consent form. Study participants were enrolled and randomized, and the appropriate scheduled procedures were performed. Preoperatively, all patients were thoroughly evaluated by medical history and physical exam, digital rectal exam (DRE), prostate specific antigen (PSA), urinalysis and urine culture, international index of prostate symptom score (IPSS), Quality of Life (QOL), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) measurement of prostatic volume and biopsy whenever indicated, measurement of post-void residual assessment (PVR), and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). Preoperative flexible urethrocystoscopy was done when hematuria was the presenting symptom.</detailed_description>

Patient with neurological disorder which might affect bladder function as cerebrovascular stroke, Parkinson disease 2. Active urinary tract infection, 3. Presence of active bladder cancer (within the last 2 years) 4. Known prostate cancer patients will be excluded preoperatively on the basis of digital rectal examination, prostate specific antigen level, and TRUS imaging followed by prostate biopsies if necessary.</criteria>
