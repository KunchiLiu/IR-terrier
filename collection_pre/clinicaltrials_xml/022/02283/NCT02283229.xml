	<brief_summary>Prospective randomized clinical interventional trial after birth in maternity ward, and follow up to 8-9 years of age. Hypothesis: Preventive handling and caring advices to parents of newborns decrease craniofacial asymmetries (deformational plagiocephaly and torticollis). The minimum sample size of the study was calculated at 86 (43 in each arm) using a 5% significance level, a power of 80% and a fall in the prevalence of DP from 31% to 8%. Craniofacial asymmetries and appearances of occlusal defects are followed up to 9 years. 50 preterm infants can participate without intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Newborn Head Molding and Later Asymmetries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The amount of craniofacial abnormal molding after birth in newborns and the frequency of plagiocephaly in infancy or later consequences of those in childhood are not known in finnish population. Head malposition and deformational plagiocephaly, however, have been linked to delayed development in early life and even much later to orthognathic problems demanding surgery in adulthood. In this study parents with healthy newborns are randomized to have normal discharge home or discharged with extra advice information for caregivers; to charge both sided feeding and handling habits; to change regularly sleeping and lying positions; to have early tummy times. Anthropometric measurements of the infants; tilting degrees of the head and rotations of the neck (range of movement =ROM) are taken at discharge home and at the age of 3 and 6 months, and 1, 3, 5-6 and 8-9 years. Two-dimensional digital photographs (upto the age of 6 months) and three-dimensional imaging (from the age of 3 months) are taken to measurements of the head shape (Cephalic index=CI and (approximate) Oblique Cranial Length Ratio= (a)OCLR measured using a semiautomated, computer-based method). The development quotient by Griffiths scales are assessed at the age of 3 and 6 months. Dental occlusal defect evaluation are started at the age of 3 ys.</detailed_description>
