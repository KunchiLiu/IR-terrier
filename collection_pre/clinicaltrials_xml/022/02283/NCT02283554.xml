	<brief_summary>ABSTRACT: Background: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate which releases various growth factors that promote tissue regeneration. Metformin (MF), a member of biguanide group has been shown to facilitate osteoblast differentiation and thus may exhibit a favourable effect on alveolar bone . Current study was designed to evaluate the combined efficacy of PRF and 1% MF gel with open flap debridement (OFD) in treatment of intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis (CP) subjects. Methods: One hundred and twenty subjects with single defects were categorized into four treatment groups: OFD alone, OFD with PRF, OFD with 1% MF and OFD + PRF+1% MF. Clinical parameters like site specific plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL) and gingival marginal level (GML) were recorded at baseline before surgery and 9 months post-operatively. Percentage radiographic intra-bony defect depth reduction was evaluated using computer-aided software at baseline and 9 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presence of 3 wall intrabony defects ≥3 mm deep (distance between alveolar crest and base of the defect on an intraoral periapical radiograph [IOPA] ) along with an interproximal probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm after phase I therapy (scaling and root planing [SRP] ) in asymptomatic molar teeth. Aggressive Periodontitis subjects Subjects with systemic conditions known to affect the periodontal status Medications known to affect the outcomes of periodontal therapy Hematological disorders and insufficient platelet count (&lt;200,000/mm3) Pregnancy/lactation Smoking and tobacco use in any form Immunocompromised individuals. Those having unacceptable oral hygiene (plaque index [PI]16 &gt; 1.5) after reevaluation of Phase I therapy were also excluded from the study. In addition, teeth with furcation defects, non vital teeth, carious teeth warranting restorations and mobility of at least grade II were also excluded.</criteria>
