	<brief_summary>The efficacy of intravenous paracetamol has never been compared with other drugs for the management of fever due to infections. Available data come from clinical studies conducted in healthy volunteers subject to experimental endotoxemia. The present study compares the efficacy of the new ΑPOTEL Μax® formulation versus placebo for the management of fever of infectious origin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Formulation of Intravenous Paracetamol for Fever Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new formulation of paracetamol for intravenous administration has been manufactured in Greece by the industry Uni-Pharma (ΑPOTEL Μax®). According to this new formulation, 1g of paracetamol is provided as a flask diluted into 100ml volume with the possibility of immediate connection with the infusion device of the patient. This formulation provides the advantage of a dilution ready-to-use which equals considerable financial benefit; nursing staff is not pre-occupied with the preparation of dilutions and the amount of consumables required for the preparation of this dilution is significantly decreased. Taking into consideration that the antipyretic effect of intravenous paracetamol has never been studied compared with other agents in patients and available data come from studies in volunteers with experimental endotoxemia, the present study compares the efficacy of the new ΑPOTEL Μax® formulation versus placebo for the management of fever of infectious origin (fever due to infection of the upper respiratory tract, of the lower respiratory tract, acute pyelonephritis or of the skin and soft tissues).</detailed_description>
