	<brief_title>Single Dose Crossover Comparative Bioavailability Study of Eslicarbazepine Acetate Versus To-be-marketed Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover design to evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability and therefore the bioequivalence of three doses (400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg) of eslicarbazepine acetate for two formulations (CTF versus TBM) after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Eslicarbazepine acetate</mesh_term>
