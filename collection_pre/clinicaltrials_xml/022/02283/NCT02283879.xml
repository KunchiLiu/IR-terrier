	<brief_title>Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Cerebral Hemorrhage Sequela</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells exhibit the potential to differentiate into neural cells, which have been confirmed in in vivo and in vitro experiments. There have been few clinical reports describing umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of cerebral hemorrhage. To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for cerebral hemorrhage sequela, 20 patients with cerebral hemorrhage will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.</detailed_description>
