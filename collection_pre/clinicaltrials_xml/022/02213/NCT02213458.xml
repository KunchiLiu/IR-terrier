	<brief_summary>This is a 3 year clinical trial evaluating the benefits of a program that supports model care for patients with dementia and their family caregivers. Subjects will be recruited from several sites in San Francisco. Subjects determined to be eligible will be consented and randomized into one of two groups. Two thirds of patients will be enrolled into Navigated Care that provides them with assistance in meeting important benchmarks in their care, for example completion of legal and financial planning and strategies for minimizing caregiver burden. One third of patients will be enrolled to a control group, entitled Survey of Care. Outcomes include quality of life, health care utilization, caregiver burden, and satisfaction with care.</brief_summary>
