	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery leeds to a systematic inflammatory response induced by the surgical trauma and the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Activation of inflammatory cascades can cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, strategies to reduce the inflammatory response have a potential benefit for cardiac surgery patients. The clinical benefit of reducing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, Il-8 and TNF-a with the use of a cytokine adsorbing circuit (Cytosorb) during CBP remains unclear. Therefore, the investigators conduct this prospective, observational pilot study to determine the clinical impact of the use of a cytokine adsorbing circuit during CBP.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients, who have an elective myocardial revascularization and give there written consent will be enrolled to the study. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data will be collected prospectively. Furthermore, blood samples (1. before induction of anaesthesia 2. at the end of CPB 3. 6 hours after surgery 4. 24 hours after surgery 5. 3-5 days after surgery) will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
