	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to compare the efficacy of an 8-week yoga intervention, relative to a wait-list control (WLC) condition, for improving psychological functioning and health-related quality of life in depressed postpartum women. It was hypothesized that the yoga intervention would be significantly more efficacious than the wait-list control condition in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improving health-related quality of life, at the end of the 8-week yoga intervention.</brief_summary>
