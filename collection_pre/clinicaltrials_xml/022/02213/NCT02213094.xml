	<brief_summary>This is an open labeled dose escalation safety study of vitamin B3-amide dietary supplementation in pregnant women with hypertensive complications of pregnancy. The investigators will enroll 5 pregnant women at 24-36 weeks' gestation with the diagnosis of hypertensive complications of pregnancy. If the woman is anticipated to remain undelivered for 48 hours after diagnosis she will receive vitamin B3-amide, 500 mg/day in a single daily dose, continuing for two weeks or until delivery, which ever occurs first. Maternal blood will be collected at baseline and 2 times per week to measure maternal LFTs and study markers (nicotinamide metabolites, sFlt-1-Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and PlGF). The objective of this dose escalation safety study is to determine the safety of vitamin B3 amide dietary supplementation during expectant management of hypertensive complications of pregnancy.</brief_summary>
