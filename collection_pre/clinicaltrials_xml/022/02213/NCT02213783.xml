	<brief_summary>This is prospective and randomized study to compare the pharmacodynamics (t&gt;MIC) of 0.5 g every 6 h of imipenem in twelve patients with febrile neutropenia following administration by a 4 h infusion or bolus injection. Concentration of imipenem in plasma will be measured by HPLC method and simulated in Monte Carlo technique (Computer model) to get PK/PD index (40%T&gt;MIC) and reported to %PTA (Probability Target Attainment) and %CFR (Cumulative Faction Response.</brief_summary>
