	<brief_summary>Due to widespread use of cross-sectional imaging modalities, pancreatic cysts are common in abdominal image. These lesions encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from benign to malignant. The diagnosing specific type of cystic lesion is limited in spite of recent advances of diagnostic modalities. Surgical resection is generally recommended for malignant and potentially malignant lesions. However, surgical resection has significant morbidity and sometimes mortality. Recently, a few study of EUS-guided ethanol lavage for cystic tumors of the pancreas reported that complete resolution was achieved in only one-third of patients. Ethanol lavage of pancreatic cysts may be alternative method to surgical resection. The purpose of this study is the double ethanol lavage is a safe and effective method for treatment in those with the indeterminate pancreas cysts.</brief_summary>
