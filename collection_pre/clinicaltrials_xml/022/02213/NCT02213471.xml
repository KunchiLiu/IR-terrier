	<brief_summary>Effective communication between physician and patient is fundamental to effective care. The recent introduction of electronic patient on-line portals has the potential to change the communication landscape. The investigators surveyed patients to assess their preferred modality for biopsy notification at 3 institutions with differing patient access to on-line portals, to ascertain what patient preferences are currently and if it has changed from historical preferences. Our hypothesis is that as patients become more familiar with ln-line portals, their preferences will likely reflect familiarity with this modality.</brief_summary>
