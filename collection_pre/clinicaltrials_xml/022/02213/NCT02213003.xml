	<brief_summary>Current islet transplantation into the portal vein of the liver has shown the unique ability of islets to stabilize blood glucose levels and prevent severe hypoglycemia in a selected group of subjects with Type 1 diabetes. The main limitations of islet transplantation are the need for systemic immunosuppression to maintain function and the loss of islet function over time. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated that the current site of transplantation in the liver is not an ideal site due to several factors. These factors include (1) significant liver inflammation following islet infusion; (2) potential for life-threatening procedure-related complications such as bleeding and thrombosis; (3) high levels of immunosuppressive drugs and GI toxins in the liver contributing to islet toxicity; (4) the inability to retrieve islets after infusion; and (5) development of graft dysfunction in a number of recipients of intrahepatic allogeneic and autologous islets. The implantation of islets into the omentum will allow adequate engraftment of islets onto the omentum and will lead to comparable or superior functional and clinical outcomes than in the traditional intrahepatic site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Islet Cells Transplanted Onto the Omentum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Islet transplantation will be performed in subjects with unstable Type 1 diabetes mellitus under permanent immunosuppression. Islets are re-suspended in autologous plasma and distributed on the omental surface by a minimal invasive approach. Cell adherence is achieved by addition of clinical-grade recombinant human thrombin that reacts with plasma to create a biocompatible, degradable gel containing the islet graft. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with HbA1c ≤6.5% at 1 year AND free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 365, inclusive, after the islet transplant. The primary safety endpoint is to demonstrate patient safety throughout all stages of the trial.</detailed_description>
