	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION: Vascular ulcers are an important pathology in the daily medical practice in all the assistance levels, and they have big repercussion referring to individual, social and labour levels, supposing a big consumption of human and material resources.The cure with autologous platelet rich plasma (autologous PRP) has demonstrated in different studies a decrease in the cicatrization time comparing to conventional methods in hospital levels, which becomes interesting contrasting its efficacy in primary care. AIM:Evaluate the efficacy of the autologous PRP in the treatment of vascular ulcers, comparing to the conventional treatment ( cure with humid environment), in primary care patients with chronic venous insufficiency in C-6 degree (CEAP classification). DESIGN: A study will be executed, which will consist in a randomized clinical test, multicentered, in parallel groups and opened. 150 patients suffering of venous vascular ulcers will be studied, who will be between the age of 40-100 years old, and who will be attached to 10 health centers. Variables for the identification, following, result and patient profile have been defined. Emphasize the variables of "ulcer area decreasing", "CIVIQ index", "% one cure per week".</brief_summary>
