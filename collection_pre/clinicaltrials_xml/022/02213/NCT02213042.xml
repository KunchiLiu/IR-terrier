	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase II study in subjects with Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer who received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2-targeted therapies of which at least one included a Trastuzumab-containing regimen. This study is a post-approval commitment with regulatory authorities. It is designed with the primary endpoint to evaluate the changes in biomarkers associated with HER family, immunomodulation, apoptosis, and Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters between the pre-treatment and disease progression biopsy. It is hypothesized that these changes in biomarkers may modulate resistance mechanisms and thereby alters the response to subsequent chemotherapy based regimens. Therefore, in addition to the description of the clinical outcome of Overall response rate, Clinical benefit rate, Progression-free survival and Overall survival for each arm, Progression-free survival on next-line therapies will be collected and summarized for each arm. All subjects will receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal, and after which, will be followed for subsequent anticancer therapy and disease progression events, and survival. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate changes in expression of biomarkers associated with the HER family or receptors and ligands, immunomodulation, apoptosis, and ABC transports between a pre-treatment biopsy and the disease progression biopsy. This study will evaluate potential mechanisms to explore the antitumor activity of dual blockade and will provide a descriptive clinical outcome for subjects treated with Trastuzumab in combination with Lapatinib or chemotherapy. No formal comparisons between treatment arms will be undertaken.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed written informed consent Female &gt;=18 years Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with distant metastasis Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 Note: Biopsied lesions should not be used as target lesions. Documentation of HER2 overexpression or gene amplification, in the invasive component of either the primary tumor or metastatic disease site as defined as: 3+ by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence, chromogenic, or silver in situ hybridization [FISH, CISH or SISH;&gt;=6 HER2/neu gene copies per nucleus or a FISH, CISH, or SISH test ratio (HER2 gene copies to chromosome 17 signals) of &gt;=2.0 OR HER2/chromosome 17 ratio &lt;=2.0 with average HER2 copy number &gt;=6 signals/cell nucleus] Centrally determined HER2positive, hormone receptor status, breast molecular subtype by Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50 (PAM50) on the pretreatment biopsy of metastatic lesion obtained during screening Note: Biopsied lesions should not be used as target lesions. Progression on at least 2 lines of antiHER2targeted therapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) Documented radiological disease progression during the most recent treatment regimen for metastatic disease Most recent treatment regimen for metastatic disease must include Trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Note: Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1) is considered acceptable as prior Trastuzumab/chemotherapy regimen Agreement to provide 2 tumor biopsies Prior treatment with pertuzumab, Lapatinib, and/or Trastuzumab emtansine is allowed; however, the last treatment for MBC must not include Trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab. Subjects with radiographically stable Central nervous system (CNS) metastases, defined as radiographically stable on the previous 2 brain imaging scans, asymptomatic, and off systemic steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 1 month are eligible; treatment with prophylactic anticonvulsants is permitted unless listed under Prohibited Medications Discontinuation of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational product is required. Note: Discontinuation of Trastuzumab is not necessary. All treatment related toxicities, except alopecia, must have recovered to Grade 1 or better (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE); version 4.0) prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment. Baseline Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=50% as measured by Echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multigated acquisition (MUGA) and above the testing institution's lower limit of normal QT interval corrected (QTc) &lt;450 millisecond (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB) Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread. For subject eligibility and withdrawal, QT correction formula QTcB will be used. For purposes of this data analysis, Bazett's formula will be used as the primary method of calculating the corrected QT interval. The QTc should be based on either a single Electrocardiogram (ECG) or an average of 3 sequential ECGs obtained within 24 hours of each other. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception, during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study treatment.

At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the last surgery and 2 weeks must have elapsed since radiotherapy Adequate baseline organ function as defined below Screening laboratory values should be used to confirm subject eligibility. Laboratory results may be retested if necessary to confirm eligibility.
