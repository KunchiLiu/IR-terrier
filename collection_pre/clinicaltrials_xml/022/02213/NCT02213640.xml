	<brief_summary>Following stroke, over 50% of patients keep severe neurological deficiency whose unilateral neglect, mostly following a right hemispheric lesion. The prismatic adaptation involves to pointing movements toward visual targets wearing prismatic glasses. These prismatic glasses induce a shift to the right visual field for improving symptoms in short term. Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) has been evaluated for different types of deficiency resulting from stroke with encouraging results. The hypothesis of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of brain stimulation as an adjunctive intervention to optimize and increase the rehabilitation of unilateral neglect to long-term. Thus, the main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of standard treatment with prismatic adaptation with anodal tDCS or sham tDCS.</brief_summary>
