	<brief_summary>A recent study suggests that, in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients treated by insulin pumps, a better coordination of meal boluses and post prandial basal rate could reduce the importance of postprandial hyperglycaemias without increasing the risk of delayed hypoglycaemias. The aim of the investigators study is to assess if these results are confirmed in a clinical trial. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of coordinated boluses versus normal boluses on postprandial glycaemic control of T1D patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.</brief_summary>
