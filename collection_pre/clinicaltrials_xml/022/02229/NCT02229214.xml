	<brief_title>Effect of VI-0521 (Qsymia®) on Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in Overweight or Obese Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site study in healthy overweight or obese male and female volunteers. Oral VI-0521 (combination of phentermine and topiramate [PHEN/TPM] extended-release capsule) will be administered daily as follows: - Days 1-3: PHEN/TPM 3.75 mg /23 mg - Days 4-6: PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg /46 mg - Days 7-9: PHEN/TPM 11.25 mg /69 mg - Days 10-28: PHEN/TPM 15 mg /92 mg A single dose of Iohexol (a non-radioactive iodine-containing contrast agent) will be administered intravenously on three separate occasions. The study will include a total of 50 healthy subjects (40 active and 10 placebo), all of whom will have overnight stays on 3 separate occasions. Total study duration is approximately 10 weeks (2 weeks screening, 4 weeks study treatment, 4 weeks post treatment follow up).</detailed_description>
