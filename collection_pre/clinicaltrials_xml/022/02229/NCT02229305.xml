	<brief_summary>This study focused on youths who were referred to community-based mental healths clinics for problems related to disruptive behaviors, depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and any combination of these problems. Therapists were randomly assigned to deliver usual treatment procedures (usual care, or UC) in their clinics or an evidence-based, modularized treatment (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems, or MATCH-ADTC). Assessments were conducted at pre-treatment and post-treatment, and every 3 to 6 months for two years. Results will address critical questions about deployment of evidence-based youth practices to clinical settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maine Implementation Study - Phase III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study focused on youths aged 6 - 15 who were referred to community-based mental healths clinics for problems related to disruptive behaviors, depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and any combination of these problems. Using a randomized block design, therapists were randomly assigned to deliver usual treatment procedures (usual care, or UC) in their clinics or an evidence-based, modularized treatment (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems, or MATCH-ADTC). MATCH-ADTC was supported by training and supervision procedures designed to fit providers and their clinic contexts. Assessments were carried out at pre-treatment, at post-treatment, and at 3-,6-,9-,12,18-,and 24-month follow-ups. Assessments carried out at pre-treatment included (a) individual youth problems and disorders; (b) individual youth functioning at home and school; and (c) clinic staff beliefs and attitudes toward evidence-based treatments. Assessments carried out at post-treatment and follow-ups included measures of (1) youth, caregiver, and therapist satisfaction with treatment; (b) youth, caregiver, and therapist views on the quality of the therapeutic relationship; and (c) treatment costs. Assessments carried out at follow-up only included measures of (a) caregiver reports of any mental health service use following project treatment; (b) therapist reports on the extent to which the treatment procedures they used in the project are continued after project termination. Analyses will address critical questions about deployment of evidence-based youth practices to clinical settings.</detailed_description>
