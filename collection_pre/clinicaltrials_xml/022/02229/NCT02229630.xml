	<brief_title>Diffusion-weighted Cerebral MRI and Intra Uterine Growth Restriction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intra-uterine growth restriction is associated with an increased risk of perinatal morbimortality. The objective of foetal monitoring is to assess foetal growth, foetal well-being and to evaluate ability to adapt to chronic hypoxia. The primary objective in antenatal care is to ischemic cerebral lesions. However, there is currently no relevant prenatal exam predictive for the risk of such lesions. Foetal cerebral MRI could highlight changes in Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) in some frontal cerebral territories in foetuses with intra-uterine growth restriction and poor neonatal outcome. These changes could be associated with a transient cerebral ischemia. The study of ADC could be a useful tool in the prognostic evaluation of these foetuses.</detailed_description>
