	<criteria>1. Male or female patients of 18 years of age at the screening visit or older 2. Meet criteria for severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 3.

Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGISeverity) score ≥4 at both screening visit and baseline visit. 5. Requirement of hospitalization (not for social or other nonmedical reasons) at screening visit and at least up to Visit 4 6. Patient willing and able to comply with the requirement for hospitalization and with all scheduled visits, tests and procedures required by the protocol 7.

Lack of response to at least two antidepressant therapies given at adequate doses for at least 6 weeks for the current depressive episode 3. Concurrent presence of symptoms fulfilling criteria for any Axis I disorder other than anxiety disorders (with exception of the ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD)) or Major Depressive Disorder, in the investigator's judgment 4. Any previous diagnosis of a bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or OCD 5. Depression with catatonic features, depression with postpartum onset, or organic mental disorders 6.

Known diagnosis of congenital galactosaemia, glucose or galactose malabsorption syndrome, or lactose deficiency 13. Patient with a known diagnosis of raised intraocular pressure, or at known risk of acute narrowangle glaucoma 14. Serious medical illness or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that, in the judgment of the investigator, are likely to require intervention/exclusion of study medication during the course of the study: cardiovascular (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension, abnormal initial ECG findings according to investigator judgement), respiratory, haematological, hepatic or gastrointestinal 15. End stage renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min) and undergoing dialysis 16. Abnormal thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations, based on the performing laboratory's reference ranges. Patients must be clinically and chemically euthyroid at the time of randomization. Patients may be taking thyroid replacement therapy provided their dose is stable and their compliance is good for at least three months before the screening visit 17.

Current treatment with Duloxetine for any indication and previous treatment with Duloxetine for psychiatric indications 21. Known hypersensitivity to Duloxetine or any of the inactive ingredients 22. History of oversensitivity to psychotropic drugs, in the investigator's judgment 23.
