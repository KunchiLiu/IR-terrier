	<brief_summary>Statement: Patients with Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 60 ml/min using the MDRD-6 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) formula and/or CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formula should undergo nephrological and urological care (diagnosis and treatment) to prevent chronic kidney failure. This is recommended by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and European Urological Association (EAU). Renal and postrenal diseases can cause or worsen CKD. Internistic and intrarenal diseases can caused or worsen CKD. All diseases affecting CKD should be treated and the medical care should be optimized. Hypothesis: Not all patients with CKD receive urological and nephrological care. Interdisciplinary work of outpatient working urologists and nephrologists in the metropolitan area Magdeburg / Saxony-Anhalt Germany is unknown. An descriptive analysis of interdisciplinary treatment connection of CKD patients for an orientating statement is needed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Medical Laboratory Schenk-Ansorge Magdeburg Saxony-Anhalt Germany receives all blood samples of outpatient patients of the medical practices of the metropolitan area Magdeburg Saxony-Anhalt Germany. Every patient has a lifetime identification number Independent of the submitting practice. Every submitting medical doctor has a lifetime identification number and is identified by her/his medical subject /specialization. This analysis is based on that laboratory database. For that study a cohort of 1.031.336 patients from 12/2004 to 08/2014 is evaluated, that had been received blood tests with measurement of serum creatinine. For every serum creatinine an eGGR is calculated with the guideline recommended formula.</detailed_description>
