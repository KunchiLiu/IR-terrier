	<brief_summary>Neuroglobin has been described as a marker of traumatic brain injury. Nogo-A plays an important role in mediating neuroanatomical plasticity and functional recovery following traumatic brain injury. The investigators sought to examine the changes in serum neuroglobin and Nogo-A concentrations in patients with traumatic brain injury during the initial 96-h posttraumatic period and assessed the relation of neuroglobin and Nogo-A to Glasgow Coma Score and prognosis of such patients with traumatic brain injury.</brief_summary>
