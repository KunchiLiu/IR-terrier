	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Deep TMS (DTMS) treatment in subjects with OCD. The device technology is based on the application of deep brain TMS by means of repetitive pulse trains at a predetermined frequency. The Brainsway DTMS study is a randomized, 10 week, double blind, multi-center trial comparing active DTMS treatment to sham treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of the dTMS Treatment for OCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OCD study will compare one group of OCD subjects receiving DTMS treatment (HAC-coil) to a second group of OCD subjects receiving sham treatment (sham coil). The treatment group will receive 5 weeks of daily DTMS treatments followed by 4 treatments in week 6, for a total of 29 treatment sessions. The control group will receive the same treatments with a sham coil. Subjects may continue to take SSRI medications (if prescribed) and any other antidepressant medications will be tapered down prior to the first treatment. SSRI medications approved for OCD include Fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Symbyax), Fluvoxamine (Luvox, Luvox CR), Paroxetine (Paxil, Paxil CR, Pexeva) and Sertraline (Zoloft). Efficacy will be assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score (YBOCS), as well as other efficacy scales. Safety will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, physical and neurological examination and using certain safety questionnaires.</detailed_description>
