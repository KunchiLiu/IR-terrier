	<brief_summary>Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)is a disease can not be cured. Medicine for DOR includes dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), hormone replacement therapy (HRT), immunosuppressive agents and alternative therapy, etc. Electroacupuncture (EA) can help patients regain regular menses, increase the estradiol (E2) level and decrease the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and decrease FSH/luteotropic (LH) ratio. In this cohort study, we aim to observe the effect of EA versus other therapies for DOR.</brief_summary>
