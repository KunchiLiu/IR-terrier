Eligible patients will be randomized at Visit 5 (Day 1) to receive either EQW added to titrated basal insulin glargine, with or without metformin ≥1500 mg/day, or placebo added to titrated basal insulin glargine, with or without metformin ≥1500 mg/day, during the 28-week treatment period.</brief_summary>
