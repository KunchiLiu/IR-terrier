	<brief_summary>The ABSORB III PK sub-study is a prospective, open-label, non-blinded study enrolling approximately 12 subjects in up to 5 US sites. ABSORB III PK sub-study is a part of ABSORB III RCT (NCT01751906). The objective is to determine the pharmacokinetics of everolimus delivered by the Absorb BVS in a separate and non-randomized cohort of subjects who only receive Absorb BVS with a maximum of two de novo native coronary artery lesions after implantation of the Absorb BVS. Note: The ABSORB III PK subjects will not contribute to the determination of the ABSORB III RCT primary endpoint.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Everolimus in Absorb BVS in Patients With Coronary Artery Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To ensure the PK measurements reflect everolimus exposure due to Absorb BVS only, the PK sub-study will not allow non-target lesion treatment. Blood Sampling Timing: - Pre-Absorb BVS implantation: Baseline o Baseline is defined as prior to implantation of the first Absorb BVS; the blood sample will be drawn on the day of the index procedure either through a heparin lock, venous sheath, or venipuncture. - Post-Absorb BVS implantation: 10 and 30 minutes, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 6 hrs , 12 hrs, 24 hrs (1 day), 48 hrs (2 days), 72 hrs (3 days), 96 hrs (4 days), 120 hrs (5 days), 168 hrs (7 days), 336 hrs (14 days), and 720 hrs (30 days). - Post-implantation blood samples will be drawn at the time intervals stated above; timing of the post-implantation sampling will begin when the last Absorb BVS is deployed, i.e. last Absorb BVS delivery catheter is removed from the body. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will include time to maximum concentration (tmax); maximum concentration (Cmax); AUC24h: Area under the blood analyte concentration vs. time curve from time 0 up to 24 hours post placement of the last Absorb BVS; AUClast: Area under the blood analyte concentration vs. time curve from time 0 up to the last quantifiable concentration; AUC 0-infinity: Area under the blood analyte concentration vs. time curve from time zero and extrapolated to infinite time; terminal elimination rate constant (λz); terminal elimination half-life (t1/2term); drug clearance (CL).</detailed_description>

Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical study for a period of 1 year following the index procedure. Angiographic 1. One or two de novo target lesions: 1. If two target lesions are present, they must be present in different epicardial vessels and both must satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria. 2. The definition of epicardial vessels means the left anterior descending (LAD), left coronary artery (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA) and their branches. Thus, the patient must not have lesions requiring treatment in e.g. both the LAD and a diagonal branch. 2. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated or quantitatively assessed % diameter stenosis (DS) of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1 and one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow reserve (FFR), stress test), unstable angina or postinfarct angina. 1. Lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with reference vessel diameter (RVD) by visual estimation of ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm. 2. Lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with length by visual estimation of ≤ 24 mm. General 1. Any surgery requiring general anesthesia or discontinuation of aspirin and/or an Adenosine diphosphate receptor (ADP) antagonist is planned within 12 months after the procedure. 2. Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to device material and its degradants (everolimus, poly (Llactide), poly (DLlactide), lactide, lactic acid) and cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers that cannot be adequately premedicated. Subject has a known contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. 3. Subject has known allergic reaction, hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin; or to clopidogrel and prasugrel and ticagrelor; or to heparin and bivalirudin, and therefore cannot be adequately treated with study medications. 4. Subject had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI: STEMI or NSTEMI) within 72 hours of the index procedure and both creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase myocardialband isoenzyme (CKMB) have not returned to within normal limits at the time of index procedure; or subject with stable angina or silent ischemia has CKMB that is greater than normal limits at the time of the index procedure. 5. Subject is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset AMI (STEMI or NSTEMI), such as nitrateunresponsive prolonged chest pain with ischemic ECG changes. 6. Subject has a cardiac arrhythmia as identified at the time of screening for which at least one of the following criteria is met: 1. Subject requires coumadin or any other agent for chronic oral anticoagulation 2. Subject is likely to become hemodynamically unstable due to their arrhythmia 3. Subject has poor survival prognosis due to their arrhythmia 7. Subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% 8.
