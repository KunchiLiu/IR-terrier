	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study divided into two phases. IN phase 1 (completed) participants will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of Problem Solving Therapy (PST) alone or 8 weeks of a cognitive training game called, Evolution (Evo) plus clinical management. In Phase 2 (now recruiting), participants will be randomized to Evo, PST, and a different cognitive training program called Words. Words is similar to Evo in that it is an adaptive training program and includes case management. IN both studies participants will be assessed for clinical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
