	<brief_summary>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can receive care in the general practice or at the outpatient clinic. In the region of Amersfoort in The Netherlands, primary care practices and the hospital are connected through Diamuraal to organize the diabetes care in that region. They work in the same electronic medical record, and patients can request access to their own record (called a patient web portal). They set up Diamuraal guidelines, based on the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners and Internists, on where the patient care needs to be allocated (primary or secondary care), depending on the amount of specific care a patient needs. Despite guidelines, not all patients are treated in the correct place. Our hypotheses is that when we improve triage we can cause a major shift from treatment in secondary care to primary care and from primary care to self-care by using the patient web portal. Furthermore, patients who needs extra attention due to problems with their diabetes or complications can receive this extra attention due to increased e-consultation between primary care and secondary care and if necessary actually can, during a short time, be treated by an internist. We hope to achieve this by introducing a signal in the electronic medical record. This signal allocates patients according to the guidelines and warns a physician if their patients is not treated according to that guideline. The health care provider can then discuss this situation with his patient. We believe that this leads to shift in allocation of care, in which optimal care is provided and patients are made more aware of their situation which hopefully leads to better self-management and satisfaction.</brief_summary>
