	<brief_summary>Preliminary studies on safety profile of Triticum Monococcum (Tm, a variety of Ancient Wheat) have provided conflicting results with some in vitro and ex vivo studies consistent with non toxicity and other suggestive of toxicity. We recently reported results of a single administration of 2.5 grams of Tm in 12 Celiacs in remission on Gluten Free Diet (GFD), while assessing symptoms and changes of intestinal permeability. Although results of intestinal permeability were inconclusive Tm, but not other type of gluten, was clinically well tolerated. The aim of the present study was to assess safety of 60 days of administration of Tm (100 grams of water biscuits per day accounting for about 6 grams of gluten from Tm) as judged on clinical, serological and histological parameters in Celiac Disease patients on remission after 1 year of GFD.</brief_summary>
