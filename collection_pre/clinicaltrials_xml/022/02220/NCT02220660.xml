	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the systemic exposure of BI 1744 BS and CD 1857 XX (the active metabolite of the pro-drug BI 54903 XX) at steady state following inhalation of the fixed dose combination (FDC) BI 1744 CL plus BI 54903 XX (as ethanolic solution for inhalation, EIS) with the systemic exposure following inhalation of the free dose combination of BI 1744 CL (as aqueous solution for inhalation, AIS) and BI 54903 XX (EIS), respectively, when administered once-daily via Respimat® Inhaler (Respimat® A for AIS and Respimat® B for EIS) for 14 days in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were: to compare exposure to BI 1744 BS and CD 1857 XX after a single dose of the BI 1744 CL/BI 54903 XX FDC and the free dose combination, respectively; to compare exposure to BI 54903 XX after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses of the BI 1744 CL/BI 54903 XX fixed dose combination and the free dose combination, respectively; to compare the safety and tolerability of BI 1744 CL and BI 54903 XX when administered as BI 1744 CL/BI 54903 XX fixed dose combination and as the free dose combination, respectively.</brief_summary>
