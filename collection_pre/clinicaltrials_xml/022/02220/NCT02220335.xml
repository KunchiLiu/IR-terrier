	<brief_summary>A number of 100 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the left Heart failure scheduled for elective pulmonary arterial denervation (PADN) are randomized 1:1 to either PADN or control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Arterial Denervation in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated With the Left Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure patients must have completed the right heart catheterization. All the patients accepted the optimal medical therapies,including diuretics, Nitrate esters, β-blockers, ACE inhibitors or receptor blocker aldosterone antagonists and/or digoxin).The patients of pulmonary hypertension are defined into two groups: "passive" pulmonary hypertension(mPAP≥25 mmHg, PCWP&gt;15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance&lt;2.5 woods unit) increase due to backward transmission of increased left ventricular filling pressure, "reactive" pulmonary hypertension (mPAP≥25 mmHg, PCWP&gt;15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance ≥2.5 woods unit) increase in resistance due to either pulmonary vasoconstriction or structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature. All the "reactive" pulmonary hypertension patients are eligible for the randomized study in PADN group or control group according to the computer generated random table.</detailed_description>
