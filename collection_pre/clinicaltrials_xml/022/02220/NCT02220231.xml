	<brief_summary>Video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) is a minimally-invasive method for excision of mediastinal mass instead of open thymectomy. The iatrogenic capnothorax with one-lung ventilation during VATET may cause hemodynamic instability due to the compression of intrathoracic structures. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of capnothorax on the pulmonary blood flow and cardiac function during the VATET by using the transesophageal echocardiography.</brief_summary>
