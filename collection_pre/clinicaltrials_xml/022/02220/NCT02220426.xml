	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of detecting Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) in healthy subjects by using hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI. In this pilot study, MRI of BAT of healthy adult volunteers will be performed at 3 Tesla to assess image quality using a prototype surface coil and pulse sequence following inhalation of hyperpolarized 129Xe (xenon) gas at thermoneutrality and under mild cold condition. The investigators are testing the abilities of xenon MRI to see brown adipose tissue and detect its thermogenic activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the fight against obesity, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered to be the newest target. The hypothesis is that this tissue is partially responsible for the imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure that keeps lean people lean and obese people obese. As the detection of this tissue in adult humans is difficult, this study aim to evaluate the use of hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI for the detection of this tissue. Hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI is currently used for lung ventilation studies. For this study subjects will undergo an MRI scan for which they will also inhaled hyperpolarized xenon. Scans will be done before and during stimulation of thermogenic activity by cold exposure, while MR images and spectra will be acquired from the supraclavicular area. We expect that the inhaled gas will diffuse into blood and eventually reach BAT in a manner proportional to the metabolic activity of this tissue. Objectives of this studies are: - To detect BAT volume using hyperpolarized xenon MRI - To detect BAT thermogenic activity by hyperpolarized xenon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy</detailed_description>
