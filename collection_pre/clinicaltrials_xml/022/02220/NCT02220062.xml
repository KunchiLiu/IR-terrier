	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer related pain can be difficult to control, even with high doses of narcotics, whose adverse effects may further impair quality of life. So EUS-CPN(endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis) is well established as an effective technique for controlling pain and reducing narcotic requirements in patients with pancreatic cancer. Recently, celiac ganglia can be visualized and accessed by endoscopic ultrasound. So it allows for direct injection into individual celiac ganglia to perform celiac ganglia neurolysis. This more precise delivery of therapeutic drug will offers the potential for enhanced efficacy and safety. To evaluate this hypothesis, this randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of EUS-CGN(Endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac ganglia neurolysis) vs. Bilateral EUS-CPN(Endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis) in providing relief from pancreas cancer-related pain.</brief_summary>
