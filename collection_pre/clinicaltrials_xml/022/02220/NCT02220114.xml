	<brief_summary>The sponsor is developing a new paediatric formulation of vigabatrin to better adjust the dose to body weight and to limit waste of unused drug. The currently marketed vigabatrin (Sabril™) form only exists as 500 mg film coated tablets (for adults and children above 6 years) and 500 mg granules for oral solution sachets (for infants and children below 6 years). Sabril™ is not adapted for administration to infants when a fraction of the sachet is needed. Manual splitting of the sachet or lengthy and error-prone dilutions are often required. This study is a descriptive, non-randomized, open label multi-centric acceptability study in infants and children affected with infantile spasms. The primary objective is to describe the adherence to the new formulation. Secondary objectives include: - evaluation of the palatability and user-friendliness of the new treatment, - evaluation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the new formulation, - PK parameters, - evaluation of the tolerance, - measurement of taurine plasma levels. This study will recruit up to 40 patients with infantile spasms and pharmacoresistant partial epilepsy aged 1 month to 6 years in 23 clinical sites in France.</brief_summary>
