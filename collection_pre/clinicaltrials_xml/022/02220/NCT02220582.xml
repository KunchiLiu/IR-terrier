	<brief_summary>The Cardiac, Vascular and Cognitive Dysfunction (CVCD) Alliance will be a prospective, multi-ethnic cohort study in healthy Canadian individuals between 35 and 69, looking at contextual risk factors and novel predictors of hard events over a period of four years. The unique features of this initiative are: - MRI as the sole imaging technique (including the use of a mobile MRI machine) - Contextual factor analysis (including community environmental profile assessments) - Record linkage follow-up of individuals to health services (administrative) databases for major morbidity and mortality events and health services utilization</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac, vascular, and cognitive dysfunction have a strong impact on the quality of life, longevity and health care costs, in Canada and globally. Cardiovascular risk factors account for up to half of the attributable risk for dementia, mediated in large part by difficult to detect microvascular disease of the brain. In this study the investigators will try to understand the role of the societal structure, nutrition, access to health services, and other socio-environmental and contextual factors on cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical disease and clinical cardiovascular events at the individual and population levels. We will try to identify markers for early subclinical dysfunction in the brain, vessels, heart and abdomen using magnetic resonance imaging and investigate the associations with contextual and individual determinants of these markers, as well as to assess the predictive value of novel markers of subclinical dysfunction on the development of clinical cardiovascular events.</detailed_description>
