	<brief_summary>Approximately 50%-95% of prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) develop symptomatic urinary problems .These symptoms can significantly diminish a patient's quality of life during and shortly after therapy. Alpha1-blockers, such as Rapaflo, act to decrease resistance to urinary flow. This multi-institutional phase III trial is designed to compare standard of care versus preventive treatment with Rapaflo for prostate cancer patients, regardless of risk group, whose treatment consists of radical radiation therapy. We plan to recruit 188 patients across Quebec who will be randomized into two arms: rapaflo prescribed at start of radiation therapy or if/when symptoms appear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Use of Alpha-Blockers to Treat Symptoms in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy of Rapaflo treatment will be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The IPSS will be assessed at baseline before RT, 4 weeks into RT, the last day of RT, and monthly thereafter for a total duration of 6 months from start of RT. Patients will have 2 more IPSS assessments at 9 and 12 months. The total duration of follow-up will be one year from start of RT. We will compare the rate of IPSS increase in the Rapaflo group compared to the standard arm at different time point (4 weeks, 6 weeks and at the end of treatment). We will also determine the rate of IPSS return to baseline at 4 and 12 weeks after the end of treatment. The rate of therapy dependence in the 2 arms will be evaluated at 20 and 26 weeks.</detailed_description>
