	<brief_summary>Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a very effective, long-acting method of contraception. In order to make them accessible to women, health care providers must be trained to insert them. Physicians, physician assistant, and nurse practitioners often learn how to do so by first learning about IUDs, then practicing on a model that the IUD manufacturer provides. Educators have recently been using more sophisticated models to teach clinical skills such as surgical procedures. We are investigating whether these models may be more useful in teaching IUD insertion.</brief_summary>
