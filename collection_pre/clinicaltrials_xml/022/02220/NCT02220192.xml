	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to test the short-term effectiveness of an alternative treatment approach for precancerous cells of the cervix. The study will also explore whether this new treatment is feasible to perform and if it is acceptable to patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Alternative Treatment for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Using the Focal Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment for precancerous cells of the cervix is called electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Standard LEEP involves treating the entire cervix using FDA-approved equipment. Focal LEEP utilizes the same surgery and the same equipment but only treats the visually unhealthy part of the cervix and not the entire cervix. Side effects and unusual symptoms will be monitored as well as the patient's thoughts and recommendations of the procedure. The total amount of time of study participation is six months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 2145 years old Histologically confirmed highgrade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2, CIN3, or CIN2/3). A copy of the pathology report is required at the time of enrollment. We will only include patients that had their biopsy performed at the UAB Colposcopy clinic because those that return for treatment represent a select group that is more reliable for followup given the standard noshow rate of 50% at the clinic. Focal lesion visualized in its entirety colposcopically and involving less than or equal to 2 quadrants of the cervix. Satisfactory (adequate) colposcopy. Lives within 100 miles of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Any suspicion for invasive cancer. Glandular abnormalities on cytology or histology. Cervical lesion incompletely visualized (e.g. extending into the endocervical canal). Endocervical curettage positive for highgrade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Unreliable for followup (drug use, planning to move out of region, etc.). Any patient that lives &gt;100 miles away will be excluded due to concern for possible loss to followup. Immunosuppression (HIV positive, history of transplantation, lupus on immunosuppressive medication, etc.). Pregnancy. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.</criteria>
