	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, global study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) and obinutuzumab in participants with refractory or relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) or atezolizumab and obinutuzumab or tazemetostat administered in participants with refractory or relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The anticipated duration of this study is approximately 4.5 years.</brief_summary>
