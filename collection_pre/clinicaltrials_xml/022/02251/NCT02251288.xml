	<brief_summary>A phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult subjects at a single center. Adult subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment criteria will choose to participate as subjects who receive inactivated vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group 1), 12 weeks (Group 2), or 24 weeks (Group 3), or to be in an observational group (Group 4) which will not be scheduled for a booster dose but will serve as a backup for dropouts in the other three groups. A fifth group will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Priming With an Inactivated A/H7N9 Influenza Virus Vaccine With or Without MF59 Adjuvant Followed by Live Attenuated A/H7N9 Influenza Virus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted as a Phase I prospective, randomized study in healthy adult subjects at a single center. Adult subjects age 18 to 47 years and meeting all enrollment criteria will choose to participate as subjects who receive unadjuvanted or adjuvanted H7H9 pIIV vaccine followed by a live vaccine boost at 4 weeks (Group 1, n=24), 12 weeks (Group 2, n=24), or 24 weeks (Group 3, n=24), or to be in an observational group (Group 4, n=16) which will not be scheduled for a booster dose but will serve as a backup for dropouts in the other three groups. Within each group, subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV at 15 mcg (Subgroup A), or the same vaccine adjuvanted with the oil-in-water emulsion, MF59, (Subgroup B) delivered intramuscularly. Finally, a fifth group (Group 5, n=12) will receive two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV separated by four weeks. The total duration of study participation for all subjects will be approximately 13 months. Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product will be suspended when one of the following occurs in the clinical or research laboratory at the clinical site: at least two respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to be positive for influenza or at least 10% diagnostic tests (rapid tests, respiratory cultures or PCR assays) performed for influenza as positive during two consecutive weeks in the clinical or research laboratory at the clinical site. Recruitment, enrollment and administration of study product may be resumed after 2 weeks without a signal that influenza is still circulating in the community, as defined by the same measures that indicate the start of influenza season (i.e., less than 2 respiratory cultures or PCR assays are determined to positive for influenza or less than 10% of diagnostic tests performed or influenza with positive results).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, including future use of specimens. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. Are males or nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding females, 18 to 47 years old, inclusive. Are in good health, as determined medical history, and targeted physical examination to ensure any existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those exclusionary) are stable. Note: Stable chronic medical condition no change in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3 months (defined as 90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months (defined as 180 days). Any change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.2)), vitamins, and contraceptives are permitted. Oral temperature is less than 100.4 degrees F Pulse is 55 to 100 bpm, inclusive. Systolic blood pressure is 90 to 140 mm Hg, inclusive. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 90 mm Hg, inclusive. Women of childbearing potential in sexual relationships with men must use an acceptable method of contraception from 30 days prior to pIIV administration until 90 days after last study vaccination. Note: Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy and still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal). Includes, but is not limited to, abstinence from intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, male condoms with the use of applied spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods, with use of a highly effective method of contraception for a minimum of 30 days prior to study product exposure and agree to practice highly effective contraception for the duration of study product exposure, including 3 months (defined as 90 days) after the last study vaccination. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination. Have an acute illness within 72 hours prior to study vaccination. Any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is a contraindication to study participation. Note: Includes medical disease or condition that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render them unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or their successful completion of the study. Have history of any significant acute or chronic medical conditions or need for chronic medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with immunogenicity or affect safety.
