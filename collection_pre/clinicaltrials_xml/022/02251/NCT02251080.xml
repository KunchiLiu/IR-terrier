	<brief_summary>Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common condition in young adults. There are many safe oral therapies that require daily use to be effective. Because frequent follow-up visits have been shown to increase adherence to medication, we will determine if adherence to oral therapy for ADHD will improve with an intervention involving weekly internet-based contact without an office visit. The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of an Internet-based survey in improving adherence to therapy for ADHD. Subjects in this study will be either receive a weekly Internet-based survey assessing the prescribed medication and their ADHD, or to receive standard-of-care therapy in which they will take their medication. The following hypothesis is to be tested: A weekly Internet survey will promote improved adherence to oral ADHD medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Internet Survey Study in a College Student Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an investigator-blinded, prospective study of subjects diagnosed with ADHD.Forty-four subjects ages 18 years and older will be enrolled. An Internet-based survey will be piloted to evaluate its effect on adherence to oral ADHD medication. Subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Internet-survey group will log their impression of the state of their disease on a weekly basis. Subjects in both the intervention and control groups will receive standard-of-care medication, stimulants. Adherence to the medication will be assessed using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSÂ®) caps, electronic monitors affixed to the medication containers. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence data until the final (Month 2) treatment visit.</detailed_description>
