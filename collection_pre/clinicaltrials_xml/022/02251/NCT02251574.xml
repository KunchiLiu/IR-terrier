	<brief_title>Effect of a Very Low Calorie and Low Calorie Diet on Moderate to Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which occurs when the muscles in your throat relax and block your airway during sleep. The most noticeable sign of OSA is snoring. OSA is a risk factor for other chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and high blood pressure. Although anyone can develop OSA, it commonly affects people who are obese. The more someone weighs, the more likely the OSA is to be severe. Weight loss is typically recommended for overweight individuals to help improve OSA. However, not enough research has been done for doctors to be able make specific recommendations to their patients.</detailed_description>
