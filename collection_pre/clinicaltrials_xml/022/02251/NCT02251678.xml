Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with polygenic predisposition combined with triggering factors such as trauma, inflammation or medication. Elimune™ is a uniquely formulated prescription dietary supplement for oral administration. Each capsule contains a proprietary blend of natural ingredients, Vitamin D3, Folic Acid, Nicotinamide, Eicosapentaenoic Acid, Doscosahexaenoic Acid, Quercetin, Curcumin, Glycyrrhizin, and Hesperetin, which share anti-inflammatory activities including the ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study consisting of a 1 day Screening Period and a 28 day Treatment Period. During the Screening Period subjects will sign informed consent and eligibility will be determined by reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria including history of plaque psoriasis. Demographics, medical history, medication history, height and weight will be recorded. A blood sample for pre-dose biomarker analysis will be collected. Subjects will take two Elimune capsules twice daily from Day 1 to Day 28. On Day 7 and Day 28 subjects will return to the site and provide a blood sample for biomarker analysis. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study. A Physician's Evaluation of Plaque Severity and Physician's Evaluation of Arthritis Severity will be performed on Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28.</detailed_description>
