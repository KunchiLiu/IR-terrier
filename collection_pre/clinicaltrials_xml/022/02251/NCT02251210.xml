Patient in treatment with oral corticosteroids at a dose higher than 10 mg/day or 0.2 mg/Kg/day (prednisone equivalent) whichever is lower, during the 4 weeks prior to Visit 2, change in the treatment with oral corticosteroids during the 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 or intended change during the trial Patients in treatment with any parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular or intraarticular) treatment with corticosteroids during the 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 or their intended use during the trial. Change in treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the 2 weeks prior to Visit 2 or any intended change during the trial. Synovectomy, and/or surgical treatment for RA in the previous 3 months prior to visit 2 or intended indication during the trial. Synoviorthesis in the previous 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 or intended indication during the trial.

Initiation of physiotherapy during the 2 weeks before V2, or intended change during the trial Patients with history of cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, liver, gastrointestinal (including lactose intolerance ), immunologic or endocrine dysfunction if they are clinically significant. Patients with any other known condition or circumstance, which would in the investigator's opinion, prevents compliance or completion of the study Patients with history of cancer within the past 5 years, excluding treated basal cell carcinoma Patients with chronic infection or acute infections during the 4 weeks before visit 1 Patients with known positive serology for hepatitis B or C Patients with anticoagulant treatment (i.e. dicumarol or derivatives, warfarin) Any of the following abnormal laboratory parameters at Visit 2: Impaired hepatic function, defined by serum levels of either Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Impaired renal function, defined by serum creatinine &gt; 133 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dl) Hemoglobin values &lt; 10 g/dl White blood cell count &lt;= 3.500 cells/mm3 Platelet count of less than 120.000/mm3 Severe hypoproteinemia (e.g. in case of severe liver disease or nephrotic syndrome) with albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dl Patients with any other abnormal, clinically relevant laboratory values not related to RA Patients participating in another clinical trial during the 3 months prior to visit 2 Previous participation in the randomised period of this study Patients with a significant history and/or active alcohol or drug abuse Significant is defined as that which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study Pregnancy (to be excluded by pregnancy test at visit 1) or breast feeding, and sexually active women with childbearing potential not using a medically approved method of contraception (i.e. oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or doublebarrier) for at least one month before and throughout the study period</criteria>
