	<brief_summary>Oral antiplatelet therapy is a key treatment of the STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction). Delayed action isn't suitable and has to be elucidated. If a delayed gastric emptying time is observed during STEMI, limiting the use of morphine and encourage the use of prokinetic agents can be a first answer to optimize coronary angioplasty environment. Investigators propose a study to assess the gastric emptying times at the acute phase of myocardial infarction using a validated paracetamol absorption test. The STEMI group will be compared to in one hand, itself with measures performed 72 hours±12h after the event onset; and on the other hand, to a stable patient group referred for angioplasty for angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). For STEMI group and stable patient group, the delay of apparition of Prasugrel or Ticagrelor efficacy will be determined by VerifyNow® test and correlated to gastric emptying times.</brief_summary>

For STEMI group and stable patient group, the delay of apparition of Prasugrel or Ticagrelor efficacy will be determined by VerifyNow® test and correlated to gastric emptying times. Paracetamol absorption test is a safe, cheap and well validated method to assess these times including during the STEMI period. This one consists in oral ingestion of 1.5g of paracetamol followed by the realization of the curve of concentration of paracetamol in plasma samples. These samples are taken at 15 min intervals during the first 2 hours. In the same time the curve of Platelet reactivity Unit (PRU) obtained by VerifyNow® tests will be determined with the goal to establish a relation between gastric emptying times and delayed observed antiplatelet activity.</detailed_description>
