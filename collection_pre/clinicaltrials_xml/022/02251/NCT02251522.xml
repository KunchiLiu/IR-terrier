	<brief_summary>It has been noted that patients "dramatically overestimate their functional ability early after surgery." Despite use of assistive devices increasing and functional testing scores decreasing post-surgery, the patient reported outcome scores fail to show worsening. Outcome questionnaires will be administered and functional testing will be conducted on all patients to capture these changes.</brief_summary>
