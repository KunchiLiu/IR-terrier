Use of any other herbal/complementary treatment must be discussed in advance with the monitor and permission obtained prior to study entry 4. Ingestion of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and Cabernet Sauvignon within 15 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) 5. Ingestion of Seville oranges, strawberries or strawberry extract, garlic supplements, St. John's Wort, Milk Thistle, or methylxanthinecontaining drinks or food (coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, chocolate, etc) within 72 hours of PK sampling days 6.

Subjects who have had an acute illness within 2 weeks prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) 15. Subjects who are currently taking any overthecounter drug within 7 days prior to Day 0, (Visit 2) or who are currently taking any prescription drug that, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation with the clinical monitor and pharmacokineticist, might interfere with either the absorption, distribution or metabolism of the test substances 16.
