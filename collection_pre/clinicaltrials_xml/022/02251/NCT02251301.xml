	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether combining interval training with skim milk supplementation will result in improved glucose control and markers of cardiovascular health in people with type 2 diabetes. Participants will complete supervised interval training three times a week over a 12 week training period while consuming skim-milk, whey/casein protein drink, or a placebo beverage that does not contain any calories or vitamins/minerals immediately and 1 hour after each training session. After twelve weeks participants will repeat baseline tests to examine any effects of the intervention on their glucose control, fitness, blood vessel function, body composition, and blood markers of inflammation.</brief_summary>
