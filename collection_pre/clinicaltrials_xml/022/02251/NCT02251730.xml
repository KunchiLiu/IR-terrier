	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Receiving Curative Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking during radiotherapy in head and neck cancers yields not only more radiotherapy acute and late complications but also poor clinical tumor response, poor local control, and poor overall survival. However, smoking cessation has not been included into the standard intervention in treating head and neck cancer patients in Taiwan. We propose a prospective study of introducing a smoking cessation program in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. The study will feature the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a prospective smoking cessation program during head and neck irradiation. The primary outcome is to test the feasibility of the smoking cessation intervention, and the secondary outcome is to test the efficacy of the intervention during radiotherapy on acute and late RT toxicities, tumor response, patterns of relapse, and overall survival.</detailed_description>
