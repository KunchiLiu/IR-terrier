	<criteria>1. Subject is 18 to 80 years of age. 2. Subject has been diagnosed, by a neurologist, with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 3. The PD patients can recharge the neurostimulator independently, with favourable compliance and commit to cooperate with the clinical trial study, 4. Subjects are PINS neurostimulator users Subject were major depression with suicidal thoughts (a score of &gt;25 on the Beck Depression Inventory II,20 with scoresranging from 0 to 63 and higher scores indicating worse functioning), tumor, abnormality in routine liver and renal function, cerebral infarction, hydrocephalus, encephalatrophy, stroke sequela, heart disease, thrombocytopenia, hyperthermalgesia and any medical or psychological problem that would interfere with the conduction of the study protocol.Patients with symptoms of the midline at the state of off medication such as severe language barrier, dysphagia, disequilibrium, slippingclutch gaitwere excluded. Patients who had undergone other implantation such as cardiac pacemaker, artificial cochlea because of the accompanied diseases such as were excluded. Patients with history of pallidotomy, stereotactic radiofrequency (Gamma Knife) and cell transplantation were also excluded.</criteria>
