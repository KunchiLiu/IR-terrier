	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study was to compare the drug compliance in patients after renal transplantation under once or twice-daily tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen. The rationale for this study is to access the influence of once-daily prolonged-release tacrolimus versus standard twice-daily tacrolimus on drug compliance in renal transplantation recipients base on the assumption that once-daily dosing regimen may help to improve drug compliance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be a prospective, two-arm randomized and open-label, phase IV study to compare the drug compliance in patients under prolonged-release once-daily tacrolimus versus standard twice-daily tacrolimus based regimen after de novo renal transplantation. The investigators will evaluate the drug compliance of the patients under once or twice-daily tacrolimus-based regimen using the medication scale BAAISÂ® (basal assessment of adherence with immunosuppressive medication scale)</detailed_description>
