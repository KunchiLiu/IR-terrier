	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-site, multinational, double-blind followed by open label period, Phase 3 trial of 100 mg of grazoprevir (MK-5172) in combination with 50 mg of elbasvir (MK-8742) (grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination [FDC]) in treatment-naïve (TN) participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype (GT) 1, 4 or 6 infection. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of participants receiving grazoprevir/elbasvir FDC in the immediate treatment arm achieving SVR12 (Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy) will be superior to the reference rate of 73%.</brief_summary>
