	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been demonstrated to reduce long term disease burden and costs. Unfortunately, less than 65 % of age-eligible persons in the US are actually screened for CRC. The leading methods, colonoscopy and FIT (fecal immunochemical test) testing, both have patient-associated barriers that reduce their use. The combination of bowel preparation and procedure time are barriers to colonoscopy, while stool handling as part of the sampling protocol reduces FIT usage. It has been hypothesized and supported by a variety of preference studies that the availability of a blood-based assay for CRC screening would increase patient participation and adherence to CRC screening by reducing barriers that prevent participation. This study is designed to investigate the relative participation in CRC screening in average risk, screening eligible patients with demonstrated non-adherence to guideline-recommended screening modalities. Participation with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the blood-based Epi proColonÂ® test will be examined. Screening eligible average-risk patients identified as non-adherent by medical record will be eligible for the study. Potential subjects will be recruited to participate in a study via mailing and/or at a clinic visit. All study subjects will be enrolled at a clinic visit and will be randomized in two study arms. Those assigned to Arm 1 will be offered a FIT test kit for home use. Those assigned to Arm 2 will be offered a blood draw for the Epi proColon test. Rates of adherence will be compared between those that accept and complete the blood test and those that accept and complete the FIT test. A passive control, usual care arm will comprise subjects meeting eligibility criteria, but not recruited for or participating in the study. In conjunction with published data (Johnson et al, 2014), the relative utilization of the blood test will be compared to the screening participation via FIT. Increased participation with the Epi proColon blood test could increase screening rates in the non-adherent population. Additionally, for those testing positive in the trial, the rate of adherence to colonoscopy will be determined.</brief_summary>
