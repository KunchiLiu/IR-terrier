	<brief_title>Geriatric Fracture Centers - Evaluation of a Geriatric Co-management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients aged ≥ 70 years or older with an osteoporotic hip fracture treated with an osteosynthesis or endoprosthesis will be included in this study. The primary objective of the study is to assess the difference in the numbers of pre-defined major adverse events (AE) which are related to the treatment, hospitalization and/or immobilization between patients who were treated in a geriatric fracture center or in a usual care center. As a secondary objective, health economic implications and cost-effectiveness comparison analyses will be performed. In order to be able to analyze data based on the geographic regions as well as globally, in each participating country, both a Geriatric Fracture Center (GFC) and a Usual Care Center (UCC) will be included.</detailed_description>
