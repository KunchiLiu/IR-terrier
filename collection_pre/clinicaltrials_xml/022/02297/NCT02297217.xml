	<detailed_description>Patients with carcinoma of the esophagus not suitable for definitive radical treatment who have symptomatic dysphagia requiring locoregional palliation, and who have no contra-indications to chemo-radiotherapy will be offered Carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) intravenously on days 1, 8 concurrent with external beam radiation therapy of 30Gy/10 fractions over two weeks where the primary goal is relief of dysphagia and other outcomes include toxicity, quality of life and metabolomics.</detailed_description>
