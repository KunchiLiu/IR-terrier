	<brief_summary>Contrary to popular belief, previous studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of whole egg consumption in modifying biomarkers indicative of a greater risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. The following study is designed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of consuming an egg-based breakfast compared to an oatmeal-based breakfast on lipid biomarkers, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and satiety in young, healthy men and women. The investigators hypothesize that the consumption of 2 eggs per day will not negatively impact plasma lipids in a young, healthy population.</brief_summary>
