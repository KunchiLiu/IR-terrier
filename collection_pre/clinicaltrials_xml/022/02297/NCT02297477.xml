	<brief_summary>This is a two-arm, randomized, open label Treatment Study evaluating the therapeutic efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a three-day course of Atovaquone-Proguanil (AP) or a three-day course of Atovaquone-Proguanil combined with 3 days of Artesunate (ASAP) in patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria at selected sites in Cambodia. Atovaquone-proguanil, soon to adopted as a first line antimalarial agent by the National Malaria Control Program (CNM) in Cambodia in provinces with confirmed multidrug resistance, will be given with or without artesunate (AS) as a directly observed, standard three-day fixed dose combination treatment to all volunteers enrolled. The efficacy and safety of both drug combination as well as evidence for in vivo and in vitro resistance to their components will be monitored during the treatment period. All volunteers will receive a single dose of 15mg of primaquine as recommended by WHO with the first dose of AP or ASAP to block the transmission of malaria to mosquitoes. Resistance to AP and ASAP will be assessed by a combination of clinical, pharmacologic, and parasitological parameters including genomic signatures of selection during careful weekly follow-up visits for 6 weeks. Investigators will also be able to evaluate the effects of primaquine on the sexual stages of malaria (gametocytes).</brief_summary>
