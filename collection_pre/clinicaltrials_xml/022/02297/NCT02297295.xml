	<brief_title>Impact of Exercise Medicine on Lower Limb Amputees According to the International Classification of Functioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise medicine in lower limb amputees has a positive impact on physical condition and on some cardiovascular aspects (first domain of ICF). But as the investigators know, there is no evidence that this improvement is connected with a significant benefit on the performance of daily live activities and social participation (second and third domains of the ICF). The investigators want to determine benefits of exercise medicine on all of these domains.</detailed_description>
