	<brief_summary>This study through the long-term observation followed up for 2 years to find the change of the COPD patients blood ROMs, systematically evaluate the relationship between ROMs and the severity of COPD. Evaluate the differences of prognosis between the different oxidative stress level (according to the level of ROMs are divided into higher and normal phenotype). Explore the new oxidative stress evaluation index ROMs application value in COPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Reactive Oxygen Metabolites in the Value of COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reactive oxygen metabolites (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROMs) test is a method by measuring the total reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) content in blood so as to evaluate the overall level of oxidative stress in the human body .Our previous studies have established the method of detecting ROMs which is suitable for fully automatic biochemical analyser.Our study through the long-term observation followed up for 2 years to find the change of the COPD patients blood ROMs, systematically evaluate the relationship between ROMs and the severity of COPD. Evaluate the differences of prognosis between the different oxidative stress level (according to the level of ROMs are divided into higher and normal phenotype). Explore the new oxidative stress evaluation index ROMs application value in COPD.</detailed_description>
