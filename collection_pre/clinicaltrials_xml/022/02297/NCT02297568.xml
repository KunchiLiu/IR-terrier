	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation During Lactation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy increases risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight and cesarean section. To against these adverse events, vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and lactation is recommended, but dose ranges are varied. Then, this study is carried out in lactating mothers and their breastfed infants with maternal 25 Hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels of 10-30 ng/ml in third trimester. Subjects are divided into 2 groups, one is randomly assigned to 1,800 IU/d compared with maternal and infant controls receiving placebo. Maternal serum 25OHD and milk VitD will be measured by LC-MS/MS during lactation, and on cord blood at 6 weeks breastfed infants. This study is submitted for ethical consideration by relevant Ethics committee.</detailed_description>
