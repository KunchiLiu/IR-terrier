	<brief_summary>Newborn screening and early treatment prevent the most severe manifestations of phenylketonuria (PKU). However, executive functioning deficits, attention deficit disorder, slow processing speed, and visual-motor problems commonly occur. Many adults with this disorder also suffer depression and anxiety. In this study the investigators will examine adults with PKU on sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan) treatment for PKU and compare their results to those of subjects with PKU not on Kuvan. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including novel MR spectroscopy (MRS) the investigators hope to discover why this distinct constellation of deficits occurs in PKU. Adult subjects with PKU will undergo a comprehensive MRI evaluations, including a novel method of MR spectroscopy to determine brain phenylalanine levels. In addition, participants will receive neurological and neuropsychological examinations and dietary evaluation.</brief_summary>
