	<brief_title>Improvement of Tolerance of Bowel Cleansing Before Colonoscopy in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive diabetic patients undergoing an ambulatory colonoscopy at the participating sites will be randomized to 2 different methods of colon cleansing before the procedure. Both will be based on the oral ingestion of a fluid solution (half of it on the evening before the procedure is planned and the rest on the morning of the same day), and the main difference between them will be the volume of fluid that will be ingested in each case. Analogic visual scales and standardized questionnaires on various aspects that may influence the degree of satisfaction about the preparation will be answered by the participants and collected before the colonoscopy. The endoscopist, blinded to the preparation method, will grade the adequacy of the preparation. Adverse events will be recorded up to 1 month after the procedure</detailed_description>
