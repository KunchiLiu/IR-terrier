	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to identify the optimal usage of Onabotulinumtoxin A in interstitial cystitis. Onabotulinumtoxin A, more commonly known by the trade name BotoxÂ®, is a medication that comes from the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. It works by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine(a chemical messenger that carries signals between nerve cells and other cells in the body). Blocking that neurotransmitter results in decreased muscle activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravesicular Onabotulinumtoxin A in Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravesicular Onabotulinumtoxin A injections for the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC). Specifically, we hypothesize that trigonal Onabotulinumtoxin A injections is an effective treatment for IC and will result in more subjective and objective symptom relief than posterior wall Onabotulinumtoxin A injections.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult females between the ages of 18 and 80 inclusive 2. Patients being treated for IC who are refractory to conservative management and oral therapy. 3. willing and able to initiate catheterization posttreatment 1. Any history of bladder cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, vaginal cancer, urethral diverticulum, spinal cord injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, cyclophosphamide treatment, radiation treatment to the pelvis, bladder tuberculosis, genital herpes. 2. Currently on or requiring antiplatelet/anticoagulant concomitant therapy or having been on antiplatelet/ anticoagulant therapy within the past 3 months 3. Pregnancy. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to undergoing these procedures. Thus, as part of their normal preoperative work up, which is standard of care, pregnancy tests are administered if they are women of childbearing age, are sexually active, and are within 10 days of the normal menstrual period. If positive, they will be excluded as they will not undergo the procedure. 4. An active urinary tract infection as shown during cleancatch urinalysis at screening visit. Subject may be rescreened if UTI is successfully treated and urinalysis is negative at rescreening. 5. A history of hypersensitivity or allergy to any botulinum toxin preparation 6. A postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume &gt;200mL at baseline 7. Treatment with botulinum toxin during the 12 week period prior to the trial</criteria>
