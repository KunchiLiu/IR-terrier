	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness of Antibiotics for Respiratory Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatient, ARTIs account for the vast majority of antibiotic exposure to children, and roughly half of these antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate. Although unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for viral infections has significantly decreased, there has been a substantial increase in prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat ARTIs when narrow-spectrum antibiotics are indicated. Primary care providers, patients, and caregivers would benefit from studies assessing the implications of alternate antibiotic regimens for these common infections. Specifically, it remains unclear if treating common ARTIs with broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to an improvement in patient outcomes compared to treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, particularly considering the increasing threat posed by antimicrobial resistance. Because of the lack of large comparative effectiveness studies with patient-centered outcomes addressing this issue, professional guidelines and expert recommendations are conflicting, and, as a result, practice patterns vary considerably. Furthermore, the adverse effects of antibiotic use have not been clearly defined or quantified in children. Therefore, using patient-centered outcomes, we aim to: 1) compare treatment failure rates and 2) compare the rate of adverse drug effects between narrow-spectrum and broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of common ARTIs in children. To accomplish this, we will perform a prospective cohort study of children receiving antibiotics for ARTI across a comprehensive pediatric healthcare network. Outcomes will include clinical treatment failure and adverse drug effects as identified by 1) return to primary care, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for new antibiotic prescription and/or ARTI complication and 2) parent/caregiver assessment of clinical improvement and adverse drug effects. Comparing the patient-specific outcomes between these different antibiotic regimens for ARTIs will help inform treating clinicians and parents of the risks and benefits associated with the management of these common conditions.</detailed_description>
