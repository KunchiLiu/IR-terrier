	<brief_summary>This 5-year proposal is a randomized study of split-virus influenza vaccine (SVV) in a high-dose (HD) vs. standard-dose (SD) formulation in each of five influenza seasons to define the key determinants of vaccine-mediated protection against influenza and how these immunologic mediators may be enhanced by vaccination with a newly approved high-dose influenza vaccine in older people</brief_summary>
