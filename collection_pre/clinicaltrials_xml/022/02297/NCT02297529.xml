	<brief_title>Expanded Access Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec for Treatment of Subjects With Unresected Stage IIIB-IVM1c Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, expanded access study of talimogene laherparepvec for the treatment of subjects with unresected stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma in select European countries. Subjects with unresected stage lllB-IVM1c melanoma who are not eligible for or cannot access ongoing talimogene laherparepvec clinical trials and who meet the eligibility criteria outlined will be considered for participation in this protocol. Eligible subjects will be treated with talimogene laherparepvec until the subject has achieved a complete response, all injectable tumors have disappeared, clinically relevant (resulting in clinical deterioration or requiring change of therapy) disease progression beyond 6 months of therapy, intolerance of protocol treatment, or until talimogene laherparepvec receives marketing authorization approval in Europe for the treatment of melanoma, whichever occurs first. Subjects will be followed for safety approximately 30 (+7) days after the end of treatment. Thereafter, subjects who provide consent will be followed under an ongoing separate registry protocol for the long-term survival follow-up of subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials. The registry protocol will also monitor for late and long-term adverse events thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec.</detailed_description>
