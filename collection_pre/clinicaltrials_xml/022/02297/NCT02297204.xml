	<brief_summary>The Endurance Trial is a phase IV open label clinical study to assess the need for ongoing intravitreal aflibercept injections after the 3-year VISTA DME (VGFT-OD-1009) end-point. Subjects will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injections pro re nata (PRN) based on the presence of CR-DME (Clinically Relevant-Diabetic Macular Edema). In addition, subjects who meet re-treatment criteria will be eligible for focal laser treatment every 90 days.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The safety and tolerability of intravitreal aflibercept injections have been investigated in previous Phase I, I/II and III studies in AMD, RVO, and DME trials. Potential safety issues associated with the route of administration or the pharmacology of aflibercept in the study population include decreased BCVA, intraocular inflammation, intraocular infection, transient and/or sustained elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), cataract development or progression, retinal or intravitreal hemorrhage, macular edema, retinal break or detachment, and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs). Safety will be assessed by visual acuity, ophthalmic examinations, fluorescein angiograms, OCT, intraocular pressure, vital signs, and adverse event documentation. To minimize the risks of intraocular infections, all injections will be performed employing sterile techniques as described in Appendix A. Study drug administration will be held for subjects who experience certain ocular events or infections. In the event any subject develops an adverse event in the study eye that is considered by the evaluating physician to be severe in intensity, serious consideration should be given to withdrawing the subject from the study. The PI or designated Sub-Investigators will review all adverse events on an ongoing basis to determine causality and relationship to study drug and/or study procedures.</detailed_description>
