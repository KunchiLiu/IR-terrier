	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot trial studies how well minocycline hydrochloride works in reducing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and acute pain in patients with breast cancer undergoing treatment with paclitaxel. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, may cause damage to nerves that result in aches, pains, and tingling or numbness of fingers and toes. Minocycline hydrochloride may help lessen nerve damage from paclitaxel and improve the quality of life in breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minocycline Hydrochloride in Reducing Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy and Acute Pain in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Treatment With Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate whether minocycline hydrochloride (minocycline) can alleviate paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. II. To estimate whether minocycline can alleviate paclitaxel acute pain syndrome (P-APS). III. To examine the possible relative toxicities related to minocycline therapy in this study situation. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive minocycline hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 7 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive a placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 7 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the study, patients are followed up every month for 6 months.</detailed_description>
