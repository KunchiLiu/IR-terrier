	<brief_summary>Background: Beneficial effects from noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in acute COPD are well-established, but couple to nebulization is still challenging. Aim: To compare radioaerosol pulmonary deposition and radioaerosol mass balance in the different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) using vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) and jet nebulizer (JN) coupled to NIV.Methods: It was a crossover study involving 9 stable moderate to severe COPD randomly allocated for both phases of the study: Phase 1(NIV+MN,n=9) and phase 2(NIV+JN,n=9). Bronchodilators were delivered during NIV using a facemask (pressures of 12 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O - inspiratory and expiratory, respectively). Radioactivity counts were performed using a gamma camera and regions of interest(ROIs) were delimited. We determine aerosol mass balance from the lungs, upper airways, stomach, nebulizer, circuit, inspiratory and expiratory filters, and mask as a percentage.</brief_summary>
