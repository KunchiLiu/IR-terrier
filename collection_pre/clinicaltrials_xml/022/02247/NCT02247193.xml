	<brief_summary>Objectives: To determine if the use of botulinum toxin during primary cleft lip repair improves the cosmetic appearance of the scar Study Design: Double blinded randomized controlled trial Methods: Study to be completed at an academic tertiary hospital. Patients must be 6 months of age or younger with a unrepaired complete unilateral cleft lip and palate requiring a primary cheiloplasty. Botulinum toxin will be injected intraoperatively at 4 standardized sites in the cleft lip during surgical repair. Control subjects will receive a placebo injection in place of the toxin. Surgeons will be blinded to patients that receive the experimental injection. Outcomes will be determined using 3D-videography preoperatively and post operatively at scheduled visits with a total of one year follow up. A scar assessment questionnaire will be completed by parents at select post operative visits. Videography images will also be assessed by a blinded expert panel at the completion of the study.</brief_summary>
