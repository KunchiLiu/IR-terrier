The respective modules contain multimodal and multiprofessional approaches to improve capabilities relevant to activities of daily living (external memory support, compensation strategies, training of everyday competence, communication training). The intervention group receives this therapy for 12 weeks. Age and gender matched participants with AD serve as active control sample receiving a standardized cognitive training in the domesticity. The primary outcome are measurements of skills in activities of daily living prior the intervention as well as at the end of the intervention (after 3 months) and after 6 months (Follow up).</detailed_description>
