	<brief_title>Does Meal Timing Affect Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 overweight adult men and women will eat according to two different eating schedules: grazing and time-restricting feeding ("early eating"). While on each eating schedule, metabolism (calories burned) will be measured during a 24-hour stay in a respiratory chamber. Glucose levels—as well as key diurnal rhythms such in heart rate—will also be measured continuously. This study requires two 1-week periods of participation.</detailed_description>
