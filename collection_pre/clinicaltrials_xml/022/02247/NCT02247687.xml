	<brief_title>Management of Participants With Low-level Persistent Viremia (ANRS 161 L-VIR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ANRS 161 L-Vir is a phase III prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, superiority trial for participants with low-level persistent viremia. Participants will be randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio to the following three arms, - Reference arm : counseling without antiretroviral treatment modification - Switch arm : switch of current PI/r for Prezista® (darunavir)/ Norvir® (ritonavir) (switch for a drug with a higher genetic barrier) 600/100 mg two times a day (BID) with counseling. - Addition of Isentress® (raltégravir) arm : Isentress® (raltegravir) 400 mg two times a day (BID) added to current antiretroviral treatment with counseling</detailed_description>
