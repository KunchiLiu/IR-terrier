	<brief_summary>Surgical incision for plate osteosynthesis of midshaft fractures of the clavicle averages 7 to 8 centimeters in the literature. It is hypothesized, that depending on the invasiveness of this incision secondary problems like prolonged fracture healing, paresthesia of supraclavicular nerves and pain due to scar tissue increase. Therefore we developed a mini-incision technique using an average incision length of 4cm. The aim of this study is to analyzed whether secondary problems following plate osteosynthesis of the clavicle correlate mit the length of the surgical access.</brief_summary>
