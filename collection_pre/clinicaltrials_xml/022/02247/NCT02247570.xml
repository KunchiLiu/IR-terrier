	<detailed_description>The study has been approved by our Institutional IRB and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial will be registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. There is equipoise. This randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of VR in in patients with PTSD who have suffered combat related traumatic brain injuries. A blinded investigator that will not be involved in the study will perform the randomization and allocation procedure. We will accomplish the specific aim of our study by analyzing the difference in the Clinician Administered DSM-IV PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores between the two groups in our study as outcomes to compare the effectiveness of VR. The CAPS is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing PTSD and assessing symptom severity. We expect differences in the outcomes between both treatments to be immediate and at follow-up over time, i.e. immediately after 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after cessation of a 2 week treatment period. The study design will include one pre-treatment assessment and our post-treatment assessments (at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months). Investigators who will be blinded for the allocated treatment will perform all assessments. The study will be performed at the department of Neurology of our Institutional Brain Center in Dallas, Texas. Patient recruitment will begin starting in September 2014.</detailed_description>
