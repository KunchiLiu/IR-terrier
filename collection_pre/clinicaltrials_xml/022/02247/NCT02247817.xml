	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy has become one of the cornerstones of the treatment of heart failure. However, a large proportion of patients still fails to this type of therapy. This may be due to a suboptimal position of the left ventricular pacing lead, which may be caused by unfavorable cardiac venous anatomy. Implantation of the pacing lead using video assisted thoracic surgery is more flexible and evades the venous system altogether, resulting in a much more favorable position of the pacing lead, with better treatment results as e consequence.</brief_summary>
