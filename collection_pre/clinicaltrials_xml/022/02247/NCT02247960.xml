	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether antibiotics prophylaxis at the time of urinary catheter removal decreases the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients after radical prostatectomy. In addition, the investigators aim to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is potentially harmful to patients (e.g. adverse reactions from antibiotic use, resistant bacteria in the urine, Clostridium difficile infections etc.). The investigators also aim to identify specific populations that may be at higher risk of developing urinary tract infections with urinary catheter use after radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will include patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Subjects will be randomized into control or treatment group. Subjects with a history of adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin, or any other quinolone will be excluded. Subjects being treated with tizanidine or with a history of myasthenia gravis will be excluded. In addition, we will exclude patients with major immediate postoperative complications after prostatectomy including significant postoperative bleeding with known pelvic hematoma and known urine leak.</criteria>
