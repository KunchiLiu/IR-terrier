	<brief_title>CKD-397 Drug-drug Interaction Study (B)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, open-label, mutiple dosing, 2-way crossover design to evaluate the pharmacokinetic effect of tadalafil(5mg) on tamsulosin(0.2mg) in healthy male subjects Subjects will receive repeated dose of tamsulosin (0.2mg*1t/day) or tamsulosin (0.2mg*1t/day) / tadalafil (5mg*1t/day) for 5days Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 10 days. Each period of study will enroll 14 healthy male subjects. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, safety laboratory data, and review of adverse events.</detailed_description>
