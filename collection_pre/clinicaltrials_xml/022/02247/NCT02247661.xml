	<brief_summary>A prospective cohort study to compare the direct lateral and poster-lateral approach concerning abductor function. Patients admitted with a femoral neck fracture operated with a hemiarthroplasty through a direct lateral or a poster-lateral approach were screened for inclusion. Patients with altered mental status SPMSQ &gt;7, pathological fractures, non-walkers were excluded. Those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and non of the exclusion criteria were followed 1 year postoperatively by clinical examination. Sample size were estimated to 30 patient in each group. Primary outcome variables were trendelenburg test, abductor strength measured with dynamometry, trochanteric tenderness measured with algometry and palptation.</brief_summary>
