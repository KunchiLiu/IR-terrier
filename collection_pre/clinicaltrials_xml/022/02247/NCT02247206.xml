	<brief_title>VoIP Delivered Behavior Therapy for Tourette Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is an emerging treatment for children with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and has been shown to be efficacious in separate randomized trials with children and adults; however, many families of children with TS are prevented from accessing it due to limited availability of adequately trained treatment providers. Recent research has shown that videoconference-delivered CBIT is as effective as face to face delivery, and that both modalities are efficacious. Despite its effectiveness, traditional videoconferencing has limitations including lack of portability, ease of access, the need for third party clinics, and cost. A newer, more convenient alternative to increase access is the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transmission, allowing for the direct delivery of CBIT to patients' homes. Therefore the objective of this study (the final phase of a three-phase project) is to establish the preliminary efficacy of VoIP-modified CBIT for reducing tics in children with TS relative to a waitlist-control. Twenty children (ages 9-17) with TS or Chronic Tic Disorder as a primary diagnosis will be recruited for a randomized, observer-blind, waitlist controlled trial of VoIP-delivered CBIT. Participants will be randomly assigned to 8 weekly sessions of CBIT-VoIP over a 10-week acute treatment period, or waitlist control condition. As an exploratory aim, the current study will investigate potential correlates of treatment outcome, including home computer equipment available (i.e., web camera type, microphone type, internet upload speed, and type of internet connection), prior computer experience, and comfort with study computer equipment.</detailed_description>
