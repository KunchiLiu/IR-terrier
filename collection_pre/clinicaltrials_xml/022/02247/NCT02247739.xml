	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human C1 inhibitor (rhC1INH) in the prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant human C1 inhibitor (rhC1INH) in the prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 HAE Prophylaxis Study With Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover study of rhC1INH in prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. Medical screening (clinical and laboratory parameters) will be performed and patient medical history specific to HAE attacks will be collected to assess eligibility. Each patient will receive three 4 week periods of treatment twice weekly.</detailed_description>
