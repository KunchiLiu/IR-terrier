	<brief_summary>Considering the significance of an early and consequent Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment as well as the challenge to achieve high adherence to treatment, evaluating the benefits of any new measure to improve adherence is important. The data storage capabilities of the BETACONNECT device, including the automated recording of injections, will facilitate the collection of reliable data on patient's injection behavior and adherence, which should be unaffected by recall bias or reporting bias. To better understand the utilities of the new BETACONNECT device and characterize its contribution to adherence, we plan to prospectively follow-up MS patients using this device for 24 weeks. The study will take place in a real-life setting in Neurology centers across Europe.</brief_summary>
