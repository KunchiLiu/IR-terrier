	<brief_title>Stem Cell Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects ~90,000 people in the U.S. who suffer significant neurological, lung, and kidney damage, as well as severe chronic pain episodes that adversely impact on quality of life. While current medical therapies for SCD can reduce short-term morbidity, the inevitable progressive deterioration in organ function results in a significant decrease in quality of health with early mortality. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) can benefit patients with SCD, by providing a source for life-long production of normal red blood cells. However, allogeneic HSCT is limited by the availability of well-matched donors and immunological complications, especially for the more than 80% of patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor. Autologous HSCT using a patient's own bone marrow stem cells that have been corrected by transfer of a modified human beta-globin gene that inhibits polymerization of the HbS (stem cell gene therapy) may provide a better therapeutic alternative, as it would avoid the immunologic complications and donor limitations of allogeneic HSCT. Up to 6 subjects with SCD lacking matched sibling donors and meeting eligibility criteria for disease severity and adequacy of organ function will be enrolled. Following informed consent, enrolled subjects will be screened to confirm full eligibility for participation. Eligible subjects will undergo bone marrow harvest (with a portion cryopreserved as "back-up") with the remaining portion of marrow used to prepare the gene-modified Final Cellular Product: autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo by the Lenti/βAS3-FB lentiviral vector to express an anti-sickling (βAS3) gene. The subject will receive marrow cytoreduction with busulfan prior to infusion of the gene-modified cells. The follow-up period will include an initial 2 years of active end-point evaluations, where the subjects will be seen at intervals of no more than 3 months, followed by offer for enrollment into a long-term follow-up study during years 3-15. The primary objectives of the Phase I study are to assess safety and feasibility, with secondary objectives to assess efficacy (engraftment, βAS3-globin gene expression, and effects on RBC function and clinical hematologic and disease parameters).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 by time of enrollment Diagnosis of SCD documented by phenotype (Hb electrophoresis) or genetic analysis (S/S, S/βthalassemiazero) Must not have medically eligible and available HLAidentical sibling donor or 10/10 allelematched unrelated donor Inadequate clinical response to hydroxyurea (HU), defined as any one of the following outcomes, while on HU for at least 3 months: 2 or more acute sickle pain crises requiring hospitalization no rise in Hb &gt;1.5 gm/dl from preHU baseline or requires transfusion to maintain Hb &gt; 6.0 gm/dL Has an episode of acute chest syndrome despite adequate supportive care measures. Or medical decision for other therapy (e.g. chronic transfusion program), or subject refusal to take HU. The patient must be off HU for at least 90 days (+/ 5 days) before enrolling in the trial. Must have one or more of the following clinical complications demonstrating disease severity: Clinicallysignificant neurologic event: stroke or any central nervous system deficit lasting &gt;24 hours. Abnormal head CT or brain MRI demonstrating previous stroke Administration of regular RBC transfusions for equal or longer than 1 year to prevent vasoocclusive crises or other sickle cell disease complications or to maintain Hb &gt;6. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity &gt; 2.5 m/sec. At least one episode of acute chest syndrome that required hospitalization, intubation, and mechanical ventilation support within the 2 years prior to enrollment At least 2 acute sickle pain crises requiring hospitalization within the 2 years prior to enrollment Osteonecrosis requiring joint replacement History of acute dactylitis during childhood Recurrent priapism (2 or more episodes) Karnofsky performance score ≥60% Patient has a medically eligible and available HLAidentical sibling donor or 10/10 allelematched unrelated donor (after at least 3 months search) Cardiac evaluation: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% or LV shortening fraction &lt; 26% by cardiac echocardiogram or by MUGA scan, Poorlycontrolled hypertension as determined by history of recorded BP in previous year with systolic &gt;135 or diastolic &gt;95 mmHg. Pulmonary evaluation: baseline oxygen saturation of &lt;85% or DLCO&lt; 40% (corrected for Hb). Renal evaluation: serum creatinine &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal for age or GFR&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Hepatic evaluation: serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin &gt; 2x upper limit of normal for age as per local laboratory or ALT and AST &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal as per local laboratory Hematologic evaluation: Leukopenia (WBC&lt; 3x103/uL) or neutropenia (ANC &lt; 1.0x103/uL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100x103/uL) PT/INR or PTT &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal or other clinically significant bleeding disorder Serum ferritin &gt;1,000 ng/ml. (Potential subjects with serum ferritin &gt;1,000 will be referred back to their physician for more specific evaluation {e.g. MRI or liver biopsy}, and consideration of iron chelation therapy, if indicated. If successful and serum ferritin comes below 1,000 ng/ml, subjects may be reconsidered for enrollment). Seropositivity for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), HCV (Hepatitis C Virus), HTLV1 (Human TLymphotropic Virus), or active Hepatitis B Virus, or active infection by CMV or parvovirus B19, based on positive blood PCR Psychiatric evaluation: psychiatric disorder or neurologic disease that would impair the informed consent process or cooperation with the clinical trial performance Pregnancy Cancer or other malignant disease.</criteria>
