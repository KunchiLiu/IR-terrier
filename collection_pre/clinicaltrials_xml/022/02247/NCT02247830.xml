	<brief_summary>It aims to evaluate the efficacy of the chamomile recutita gel and urea cream in the prevention of radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy. Prophylactic Trial will consist of a control group and two experimental groups, namely control group (usual care), Experimental Group 01 (usual care + topical application of the gel C. recutita) and Experimental Group 02 (usual care + topical application of Urea based cream). The doses used in the different compounds are being in test since february 2014 by a dose-response curve study, using 6 groups with three doses of urea cream and three doses of C. recutita gel. The study will be conducted at the Center for High Complexity Oncology at University Hospital of Bras√≠lia (CACON/HUB), Brazil. The degree of radiodermatitis is evaluated weekly, according to established criteria to classify the effects of radiotherapy, which identifies grades 0, 1, 2 , 3 and 4, according to the score of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group - RTOG. To evaluate the skin reaction will also be applied scale Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS).</brief_summary>
