	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the repeatability of SD-OCT (Spectralis™ OCT, Version 6.0, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) RNFL thickness measurements with a new software (glaucoma premium module) with the well established peripapillary RNFL thickness measurements in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reproducibility of RNFL and ONH Measurements in OAG With Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT Glaucoma Module Premium Edition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the repeatability of SD-OCT (Spectralis™ OCT, Version 6.0, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) RNFL thickness measurements with the new software (method B) and with the previous method of measurement (method A) in patients with glaucoma. It is a prospective, not blinded, not randomised, monocentric study. Inclusion of 50 patients with a diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), that will be recruited from the ophthalmology outpatient department of the UniversityHospital Zurich, Switzerland. All patients will undergo a full ophthalmic examination including measurement of refraction, best corrected visual acuity, examination of anterior and posterior compartment and measurement of the intraocular pressure. On the same day they will have 3 OCT examinations with a new method of measurement (method B).On the same day the first 10 patients will undergo also 3 OCT examinations with the previous method (method A) and they will get an other 3 OCT examinations with method B by a second observer. For this 10 patients the next consultation (3 months +/- 1 month) the 3 OCT examinations with method B will be repeated by the first observer. Primary objectives are coefficient of variations (COV) of method A and B; Intra-class-correlations (ICC) of method A and B.</detailed_description>
