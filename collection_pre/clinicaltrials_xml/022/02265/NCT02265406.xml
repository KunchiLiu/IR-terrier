	<brief_summary>Ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the main site of healthcare-associated infections in the brain injured patients, with an incidence rate of 22% to 58%. VAP increases morbi-mortality, length of stay in intensive care and overall management costs. The prevention of ICU nosocomial infections depends on several measures : orotracheal intubation route, maintaining tube cuff pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O, maintaining a semi-seated position &gt;= 30°, nasal and oropharyngeal care at regular intervals, striving to avoid unscheduled extubation, and use of a written sedation-analgesia algorithm allowing for early weaning from ventilation. Two randomized study show that administration of antibiotic therapy after intubation reduces the risk of early VAP incidence. However, in clinical practice, its administration solely purposes of limiting VAP occurence is not presently recommended. Indeed, to date no placebo blind controlled study was been realized and the fear of development of bacterial resistance remains stronger than the efficiency of this prevention measure. This aim of the present study is to show by a placebo randomized study that 2g of Ceftriaxone within 8 hours post-intubation after a brain injury decrease the risk of occurence an early VAP.</brief_summary>
