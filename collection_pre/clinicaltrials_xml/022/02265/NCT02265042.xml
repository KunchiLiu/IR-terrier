	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate whether there is an effect of electrical stimulation on the denervated gluteus muscle (buttocks) in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury. The expected outcome is an increase in muscle volume and a better pressure distribution during sitting. The stimulation of the gluteus muscle is performed daily for 35 minutes over a period of six months. The muscle volume and the pressure distribution are measured before stimulation, three months after having started stimulation and after six months.</brief_summary>
