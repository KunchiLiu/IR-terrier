	<brief_summary>Currently there are no official data concerning incidence, progression and prognosis of patients with lymphoma in Brazil.This project aims the establishment of a network of 12 Brazilian Institutions to implement a Lymphoma Registry (RELINFO) with the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) as the Coordinating Center.We intend to develop and implement a computerized system for data entry and information management of patients with lymphomas. This will enable create a virtual registry of demographic, clinical, epidemiological, histopathological, molecular, and therapeutic data. This clinical record must be linked to histopathological and molecular diagnosis, allowing institutions that work in the context of the public health system have access to new technologies for early cancer diagnosis.We expect is that this record reliably portrays the scene of lymphomas in our state and will become a management model that can be replicated at the national level. Thus, the implementation of RELINFO will strengthen the multidisciplinary diagnosis, promote the standardization of clinical record of patients with lymphomas and provide subsidies to cooperative research projects between participating institutions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data collection and management: For data collection will use a common system for all institutions participating.We developed a computerized tool that utilizes models of case report forms (CRF) and allows the inclusion and management of clinical, epidemiological, histopathological and molecular data. The clinical and laboratory data of patients included in RELINFO will be obtained from the hospital records. The integration of local databases allows constitute the RELINFO, conceived as a virtual database of patients with lymphoma. The INCA as Coordinating Center is committed to the security of this database.Standardization of diagnosisThis phase includes structuring a technological platform for the standardization of histopathologic diagnosis (establishing common routines in hematopathology) and the incorporation of molecular methods in the diagnosis of lymphoma.</detailed_description>
