	<criteria>Healthy Subjects Written informed consent signed and dated prior to participation into the study (including medication washout) Male of female 2470 years of age All subjects should be within (+ 20 %) of their ideal body weight (BrocaIndex) Healthy subjects must be able to be comparably matched to a hepatic impaired patient according to age (+ 5 years), weight (+ 30 lbs), gender, and smoking status Volunteers will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease based upon the following: a detailed medical and surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12lead ECG, complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets, prothrombin time (PT), blood chemistry, hematology and urinalysis Female subjects need to be of nonchildbearing potential (postmenopausal), tubal ligation or total hysterectomy) and had to provide a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit or subjects is a male Tested negative at the screening visit for the following drug screen panel (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids) Patients with hepatic impairment Written informed consent signed and dated prior to participation into the study (including medication washout) Male of female 2470 years of age All subjects should be within (+ 20 %) of their ideal body weight (BrocaIndex) Proven history of cirrhosis confirmed by liver/spleen scan or biopsy (within one year) Hepatic impairment: A ChildPugh classification of Class A, or B Volunteers will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease (other than hepatic impairment) based upon the following: a detailed medical and surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12lead ECG, CBC with differential and platelets, prothrombin time (PT), blood chemistry, hematology and urinalysis Tested negative at the screening visit for the following drug screen panel (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids). Unless known drugs were being used for medicinal reasons. For this reason the sponsor and investigator were notified Female patients were of nonchildbearing potential (postmenopausal), tubal ligation or total hysterectomy) and had to provide a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit Healthy subjects Tested positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody or HIV antibody Have a significant acute or chronic disease, which could have interfered with the objectives of the study Small or difficult to locate arm or hand veins that would impair the clinician's ability to draw multiple blood samples or to place a venous catheter Likely to need concomitant medication during the study period, which could interfere with the objectives of the study Had given a blood donation during the month preceding the study drug administration Alcohol consumption &gt; 2 drinks daily (one drink defined as: 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of spirits) Coffee or tea consumption &gt; 3 cups per day or xanthine containing drinks &gt; 0.5 liter/day History of any clinically significant hematological, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal or central nervous system (CNS) disease or other medical condition that is capable of altering the metabolism or elimination of drugs, or of constituting a risk factor when taking the study drug History of drug addiction or alcoholism Any medical or psychological condition which could relapse during or immediately after the study Use of any drug or nutrient which could induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes within one month of the start of the study or longer based on the elimination halflife of the drug Use of experimental new drug one month prior to study drug administration Consumed any medicine whatsoever (including over the counter (OTC) drugs) within two weeks of the scheduled administration of the study drug Patients with Hepatic Impairment Positive serology for HIV Have a significant acute or chronic disease (except hepatic disease), which is unstable or could interfere with the objectives of the study Small or difficult to locate arm or hand veins that would impair the clinician's ability to draw multiple blood samples or to place a venous catheter Have hepatocellular carcinoma, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, surgical portalsystemic shunting, acute hepatitis of any origin Digestive bleeding within one month of inclusion Likely to need concomitant medication during the study period, which could interfere with the objectives of the study Had given a blood donation during the month preceding study entry Coffee or tea consumption &gt; 3 cups per day or xanthine containing drinks &gt; 0.5 liter/day History of any clinically significant hematological, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal or CNS disease or other medical condition (except hepatic impairment) that is capable of altering the metabolism or elimination of drugs, or of constituting a risk factor when taking the study drug Any medical or psychological condition which could relapse during or immediately after the study Use of any drug or nutrient which could induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes within one month of the start of the study or longer based on the elimination halflife of the drug Use of experimental new drug within the previous month</criteria>
