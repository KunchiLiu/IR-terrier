	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Two Different Formulations of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the two stage design, a first Group of healthy subjects has been dosed and analysis of plasma level of the drug will be performed. In the event the sample size is not sufficient for a powerful statistical analysis, an additional Group of subject will be dosed and data from these Group, will be pooled with the first Group to provide statistical results.</detailed_description>
