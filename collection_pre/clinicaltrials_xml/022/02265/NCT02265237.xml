	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study in HCV genotype 4-infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis is to assess the safety and to compare the percentage of subjects achieving a 12-week sustained virologic response (SVR12), [HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12 weeks following treatment], to a clinically relevant threshold [based on SVR rates for HCV genotype 4-infected subjects treated with pegylated interferon (pegIFN)/RBV]. The 12 and 16-week arms have been fully enrolled. As of 19 May 2015, they were closed and the two 24-week arms were opened for enrollment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet one of the following: Treatmentnaive (Subject has never received antiviral treatment for hepatitis C infection) OR For Arms A, B, and C: Treatment Experienced (Prior null responders, Partial responders or Relapsers to IFN/RBV) For Arm D: Treatment Experienced (Prior sofosbuvir (SOF) breakthrough/nonresponder or Prior SOF relapser to SOF/pegIFN/RBV or SOF/RBV) Subject has plasma HCV RNA &gt; 1000 IU/mL at Screening Chronic HCV genotype 4 infection with cirrhosis Positive test result at Screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). Current enrollment in another interventional clinical study, previous enrollment in this study, or previous use of any protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitor, or Nonstructural viral protein (NS) 5A inhibitor, either investigational or commercially available (including previous exposure to ABT450 or ombitasvir), or receipt of any investigational product within 6 weeks prior to study drug administration. Prior use of any directacting antiviral will not be allowed, except for Arm D where prior experience with the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir with pegIFN/RBV or SOF with RBV is required. Any current or past clinical evidence of ChildPugh B or C classification or clinical history of liver decompensation including ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy. Confirmed presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Any cause of liver disease other than chronic HCV infection. Abnormal laboratory tests.</criteria>
