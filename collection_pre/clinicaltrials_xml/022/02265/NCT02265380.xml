	<brief_summary>A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in the pediatric population. The study hypothesis is that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful venous access after first attempt.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial to Demonstrate the Safety and Efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter In a Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OptiVein System uses transillumination of skin tissue to aid in cannulation and consists of the OptiVein IV Catheter with an integrated optical fiber, and an electronic unit. The electronic unit is a portable internally powered generator of low power visible laser light of green color. The electronic unit generates visible light, which is released from the tip of the needle into the soft tissue around the tip of the IV catheter. Light is visible through the skin and helps mark the location of the tip of the needle under the skin and against the vein. In addition to pinpointing the exact location of the tip of the needle, the OptiVein System informs the user of the exact moment of penetration of the tip of the needle into the blood vessel. Hemoglobin in blood strongly absorbs visible light of specific wavelengths, so when the needle enters the blood vessel, the light is instantly absorbed by blood, which causes instant fading of skin transillumination. Instant disappearance of tissue illumination indicates successful venipuncture. The user can then lower the angle of the needle and start to advance the cannula over the needle into the blood vessel. Such optical confirmation is much faster than the traditional observation of blood in the flashback chamber of the needle and should lead to increased first-attempt success rates and decreased cannulation-related complications. The use of OptiVein device will be compared to the use of a traditional IV catheter to explore the potential increase of effectiveness of cannulation with OptiVein versus traditional IV catheters.</detailed_description>
