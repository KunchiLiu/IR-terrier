	<criteria>All participants in the study were cystic fibrosis patients: Male or female ≥6 years (pediatrics 6 17 years; adult ≥18 years); minimum weight requirement of 20 kg Confirmed diagnosis of CF (positive sweat chloride ≥60 milliequivalents (mEq)/liter (by pilocarpine iontophoresis) and/or a genotype with two identifiable mutations consistent with CF accompanied by one or more clinical features with the CF phenotype Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt;25% predicted (using prediction equation's of Knudson) Clinically stable with no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection or current pulmonary exacerbation within 2 weeks of screening Females of child bearing potential needed to have a negative pregnancy test at screening and, if sexually active, had to be willing to use a doublebarrier form of contraception for the duration of the study The patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative had to be able to give informed consent in accordance with international conference of harmonization (ICH) good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines and local legislation The patient must be able to swallow the BIIL 284 BS tablet whole Patients taking a chronic medication must be willing to continue this therapy for the entire duration of the study Patients with a history of allergy/hypersensitivity (including medication allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the Investigator Patients who had participated in another study with an investigational drug within one month or 6 halflives (whichever is greater) preceding the screening visit Patients with known substance abuse, including alcohol or drug abuse, within 30 days prior to screening Patients who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. strenuous sporting events) within 24 hours before the study Female patients who were pregnant or lactating Patients who were unable to comply with breakfast requirements prior to dosing Patients who had received IV, oral or inhaled antibiotics or corticosteroids for a pulmonary exacerbation within 2 weeks of screening Patients who had started a new chronic medication for CF within 2 weeks of screening Patients with documented persistent colonization with B. cepacia (defined as more than one positive culture within the past year) Patients with clinically significant findings on chest xray which in the opinion of the Investigator precludes the patient's participation in the trial Patients with oxyhemoglobin saturation in room air &lt;90% by pulse oximetry Patients with hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL; platelets &lt;100x109/L; serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (ALT) or serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (AST) &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal; creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL at screening Clinically significant disease or medical condition other than CF or CFrelated conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data. This includes significant hematological, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and neurologic disease. Patients with diabetes may participate if their disease is under good control prior to screening.</criteria>
