	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, investigator initiated study that will prospectively examine treatment strategies and outcomes of patients who underwent clinically-indicated Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The information collected will be used to determine the frequency of NIRS imaging performed at the participating sites and to examine the clinical outcomes of the NIRS-detected Lipid Core Plaques (LCPs).</brief_summary>
