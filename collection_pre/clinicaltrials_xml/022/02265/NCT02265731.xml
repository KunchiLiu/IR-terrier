	<criteria>Participants must have histologically documented diagnosis of NHL (and exhausted options considered standard of care) as defined in the World Health Organization classification scheme and relapsed following or be refractory to standard treatments such as RCHOP, RCVP, or fludarabine based regimens. Participants with other lymphoproliferative diseases can be considered in consultation with the AbbVie medical monitor Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma participants must have been previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy and have measurable disease Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma participants must have relapsed or be refractory to standard treatments such as fludarabine based regimens or alkylator based regimens Untreated AML subjects or Relapsed or refractory AML subjects must have been previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score less than or equal to 1; adequate bone marrow independent of growth factor support per local laboratory reference range; and adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory reference range at Screening Participants with a history of autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation must have adequate blood counts independent of growth factor support and have recovered from any transplantrelated toxicity(s) and be at least 100 days postautologous transplant (multiple myeloma) or 6 month postautologous transplant (NHL) prior to first dose of study drug or at least 6 months postallogenic transplant (multiple myeloma) prior to first dose of study drug and not have active graftversushost disease (GVHD), i.e., requiring treatment NHL participants who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant or were diagnosed with PostTransplant Lymphoproliferative Disease, Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkittlike lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia Participant tested positive for HIV Participant has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater or equal to 2 Participant has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study. Participant received a monoclonal antibody for antineoplastic intent within 8 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.</criteria>
