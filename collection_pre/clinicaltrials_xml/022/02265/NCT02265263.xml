	<brief_summary>The research leading consortium to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement no 602461 (www.biocog.eu). The investigators will establish valid biomarkers panels (neuroimaging and molecular) for risk and clinical outcome prediction of postoperative delirium (POD)/postoperative cognitive deficit (POCD) in N = 1200 elective surgical patients (Age ≥ 65 years) in study centers in Berlin,Germany (data collection within 5 years after initial hospital stay) and Utrecht, The Netherlands (data collection within 1 year after initial hospital stay), thereof cerebrospinal fluid (only once on day of surgery in patients with planned spinal anesthesia/combined spinal epidural analgesia in N = 200 patients, only in Berlin). Post-mortem samples of brain tissue are analyzed in a limited number of voluntary patients, only in Berlin. A control group of 300 ASA II/III- patients (200 from Berlin and surrounding area and 100 from Utrecht and surrounding area ) is collected for measuring the learning experience during the cognitive testings. The participants are matched on age, education, and gender to the study patients. The 300 ASA II/III- patients from Berlin and surrounding area and Utrecht and surrounding area receive additionally MRI-scan (3 Tesla) at baseline, after 3 months and after 1 year. An interim-analysis is performed on the primary endpoint after 400 included patients. The resulting (multivariate) expert system is expected: 1) to support clinical decision-making in patient care, e.g. to balance the individual POD/POCD risk against the expected overall clinical outcome of an (elective) surgical intervention, 2) to allow the design of more sophisticated and hypothesis-driven clinical studies and drug trials (translational research) in the future. The latter will be possible on the basis of biomarker-based sub-grouping of patients and a better understanding of relevant pathophysiological processes. Furthermore, a state-of-the art clinical database and biobank will be created that does not yet exist worldwide. Both the expert system and the reference database/biobank will expand the leadership of the contributing academic institutions in this particular research area. In addition, the newly created biobank will become an integral part of the European Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI) which allows top address specific and hypothesis-driven research questions. Most notably, the developed (multivariate) expert system also has the potential for commercialization. Possible customers are: 1) physicians and hospital departments being involved in pre-surgical decision making, 2) pharmaceutical industry intending to conduct biomarker-based drug trials in POD/POCD.</brief_summary>
