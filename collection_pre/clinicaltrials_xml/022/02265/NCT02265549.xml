	<brief_summary>Published prognostic scores have limitations in prediction of long term survival after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. Moreover, no validated tools are available for prediction of local failure. The value of radiomics is evaluated in this perspective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiomics for Prediction of Long Term Survival and Local Failure After Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sensitivity is low for prediction of long term survival of currently available prognostic scores for brain metastases. First the current clinical models will be optimized with a new prognostic model and nomogram. Radiomics is a tool to analyze tumor characteristics based on CT and MR images. These tumor characteristics may reflect tumor biology and outcome. Therefore it is investigated if radiomics improves prediction of long term survival after stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. Moreover, the predictive value of radiomics for local failure is investigated.</detailed_description>
