	<brief_summary>The study aims to find out if usage of N95 type respirators affects respiratory parameters in pregnant women so as to provide guidance on N95 respirator usage in pregnant healthcare workers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Consequences of N95-type Mask Usage in Pregnant Healthcare Workers - A Controlled Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase of the study aims to determine the average workload of a nurse. In the second phase of the study, this workload is then translated to walking on a treadmill while pregnant subjects wore special masks open to air, then occluded with N95 mask materials.</detailed_description>
