	<brief_summary>This open label trial is conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for patients with brain injury or neurodegenerative disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Therapy of Cord Blood and G-CSF for Patients With Brain Injury or Neurodegenerative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatments for brain injury or neurodegenerative disorders are palliative rather than curative. Preclinical and some clinical studies suggest that UCB and G-CSF can be used as restorative approach for such disorders.</detailed_description>
