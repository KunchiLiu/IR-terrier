	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to assess the impact of environmental conditions on live-birth rates after intraconjugal IVF. The second purposes are - to assess the impact on pregnancies (prematurity, preeclampsia); - to assess the impact on newborn's health (stunted growth); - to evaluate the consistency of results observed between assisted pregnancies and spontaneous pregnancies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter epidemiological study aims to analyze the individual standardized clinical records, collected prospectively since 2008 in the medically assisted procreation centers (MAP). These individual data will be mapped to the environmental data (meteorological and air quality), recorded in the area of residence of the mother at the time of conception and pregnancy, as well as to the socio-economic data. Choice of centers: - The study will be proposed to the 106 private or public centers in metropolitan France who are authorized for MAP procedures such as IVF and ICSI. - Only the centers who perform more than 200 oocyte retrievals per year will be selected to participate in the study. More than 80% of attempts performed by the selected centers should be available (without missing data) on the induced pregnancies and their outcome (minimum data set for each case: age of man and woman, cause of infertility, technique used, sperm collection method (ejaculation, surgical sperm retrieval techniques), total number of embryos obtained, clinical pregnancy or not, term of pregnancy, weight and height of the child at birth).</detailed_description>
