Analgesic support, and especially use of oxygen and care of associated symptoms as nausea, photophobia or phonophobia, is very dependent on the physician.

For the last 100 patients (group 2), physician in charge of patients are incited to use a formal protocol that include: putting the patient in a quiet spot, laying down on a stretcher, providing sound proof helmet and light blocking google, administering oxygen therapy 15 l/min during 15 min, and administering etiological headache adapted medication following learned society guidelines.
