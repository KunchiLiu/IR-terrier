	<brief_summary>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women. It is caused by a vaginal bacterial imbalance. Treatment with antibiotics is the standard of care but there is a high rate of recurrence. Almost half of women successfully treated suffer a recurrence within three months. Complications include risk factors for premature birth, increased transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and higher risk for carcinoma of cervix. The investigators proposed study is a cost effective treatment based on returning the normal microbial balance to the vagina. The investigators propose to transfer normal vaginal flora from healthy individuals to women with BV and thus restore normal vaginal flora and cure this disorder.</brief_summary>
