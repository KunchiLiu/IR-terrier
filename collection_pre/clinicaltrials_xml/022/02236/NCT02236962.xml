	<brief_summary>Obesity is epidemic in Australia, and current preventative strategies have had limited success in alleviating this health crisis. While numerous options are available for treatment of obesity, most do not result in sustained weight reduction. Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, therefore new methods that correct this imbalance are essential for effective long-term treatment. Rodent studies show that brown adipose tissue (BAT) can burn more energy than any other tissue in the body, therefore targeting BAT to increase its activity (energy burning rate) and quantity in humans is potentially a powerful tool for the treatment of obesity and related diseases. BAT has only recently been irrefutably identified in adult humans therefore little is known about how it functions in humans.</brief_summary>
