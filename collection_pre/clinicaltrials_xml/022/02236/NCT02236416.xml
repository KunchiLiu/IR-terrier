	<detailed_description>Community-dwelling volunteers, recruited from social centers, were invited to an in-person assessment that included a medical history questionnaire and examination, anthropometric measurements, blood tests for cardiovascular risk, and several outcome measures. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were divided in 3 groups (participants without subjective or objective cognitive impairment, with subjective memory complaints and with mild cognitive impairments) and randomly assigned (1:1) to an experimental group or a control group, using a list of random numbers generated by a statistical software. The list was kept in a sealed envelope and a researcher, not directly involved in the recruitment and in the evaluation of the participants, assigned the allocation numbers.</detailed_description>
