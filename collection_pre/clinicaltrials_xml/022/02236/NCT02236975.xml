	<brief_summary>Prospective, multi-center, randomized 1:1, single blind trial using BuMA Supreme versus Resolute Integrity conducted in approximately 14 interventional cardiology centers in The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. Clinical follow-up will occur at 1, 9 and 12 months post-stent implantation. All patients will undergo repeat angiography at 9 months follow-up. QCA assessment will be performed at baseline (pre- and post-procedure) and at 9 months follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The subject is at least 18 years of age. 2. Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive territorial functional study. 3. Documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification 1, 2, 3 or 4) or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (Braunwald Class IBC, IIBC, or IIIBC), or documented silent ischemia 4. The patient has a planned intervention of a single denovo lesion in one or two separate major epicardial territories (LAD, LCX or RCA). 5. Diameter Stenosis≥50 and＜100%. 6. The visually estimated target lesion must be able to be covered by a single BuMA Supreme stent or a single Resolute Integrity stent (for available sizes refer to tables 1 and 2, page 20 and 21). 7. The target lesion reference diameter must be visually estimated to be ≥2.5 mm and ≤4.5 mm in diameter. 8. Written informed consent. 9. The patient agrees to the followup visits including a 9 month angiographic followup. 10. Patient must have completed the followup phase of any previous study. 1. Female of child bearing potential (age &lt;50 years and last menstruation within the last 12 months). Subjects with age &lt;50 who underwent tubal ligation, ovariectomy or hysterectomy can be included. 2. Evidence of ongoing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in ECG and/or elevated cardiac biomarkers (according to local standard hospital practice) have not returned within normal limits at the time of procedure 3. Patient suffered from stroke/TIA during the last 6 months. 4. LVEF &lt;30% 5. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;400,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt;3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis) 6. Known renal insufficiency (e.g. serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dL, or creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min), or subject on dialysis, or acute kidney failure (as per physician judgment). 7. Patient undergoing planned surgery within 6 months with the necessity to stop DAPT. 8. Patient requiring oral anticoagulation (Coumadin, Novel Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC)) 9. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy 10. The patient is a recipient of a heart transplant 11. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, antiplatelet medication specified for use in the study, sirolimus, zotarolimus, or cobaltchromium. 12. Other medical illness (e.g. cancer, stroke with neurological deficiency) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) as per physician judgment that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy 13. The patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational device or drug study</criteria>
