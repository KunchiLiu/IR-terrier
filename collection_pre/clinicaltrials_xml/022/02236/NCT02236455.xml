	<brief_title>Effects of Complementary Therapies Delivered Via Mobile Technologies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for same-day surgery (SDS) often experience state anxiety, which may result in increased perceptions of pain and lower self-efficacy in healing. Complementary therapies (CT), such as relaxation technique, massage, guided imagery, and acupuncture have been shown to benefit patients undergoing surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of audio relaxation technique (ART), music intervention (MI), nature video application with music (NVAM), and nature video application without music (NVA) delivered via mobile technologies on patients' state anxiety, pain perception, and perceived self-efficacy in healing. Methods A randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 105 SDS patients, who were assigned to an ART (n = 25), MI (n = 25), NVAM (n = 15), NVA (n = 16), or a control group (n = 24) were assessed for state anxiety via the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), self-reported pain using the numeric rating scale (NRS), and self-efficacy with the general self-efficacy scale (GSE) four days prior to surgery, immediately prior and following the surgical intervention, and at day five post-operative.</detailed_description>
