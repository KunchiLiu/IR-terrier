	<brief_summary>The heart rate variability is a tool used to asses non-invasive cardiac autonomic. In fact, many studies have been disseminated of heart rate variability in adults, however few results in a literature this parameters in pediatric population, mainly with children submitted the physical training. Thus, this Project aims to verify the effects of aerobic training, with 10 weeks, in prepubertal on the performance and heart rate variability in rest.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The randomized control trial in accordance with Consort - Statement (Moher et al., 2012) will be done. Will be included 160 children, 80 in an experimental group and 80 children with no intervention, of both genders.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children be with body weight and height between the 10th and 90th percentiles, according to criteria adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2002). To characterize the infant state, all volunteers will conduct evaluation of secondary sexual characters by criteria of Tanner (Marshall and Tanner, 1970), through visual inspection by a single experienced paediatrician. Children must show the initial stage of pubertal development, for girls (1 breast) and boys (genital 1) to be included and characterized such prepubertal. Participants throughout the trial entering puberty will be excluded from the final analysis. The children will be healthy, without clinical or historical evidence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulindependent diabetes mellitus or obesity, and were not taking any drugs. The participants can be not linked to sports practices at least one year before the beginning the study, and can be involved only with the physical education classes two times a week for 50 minutes each class.</criteria>
