	<brief_summary>The purpose of this case series dismantling study is to extend previous findings regarding the efficacy of a brief treatment for chronic post-trauma nightmares by examining the dose effect and mechanism of change. Exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT) is a promising psychological intervention developed to target trauma-related nightmares and sleep disturbances. ERRT has exhibited strong support in reducing the frequency and intensity of nightmares, as well as improving overall sleep quality in both civilian and veteran samples. In addition, significant decreases in PTSD and depression symptoms have been reported following treatment (Davis et al., 2011; Davis &amp; Wright, 2007; Long et al., 2011; Swanson, Favorite, Horin, &amp; Arnedt, 2009). ERRT is currently an evidence-level B suggested treatment (Cranston, Davis, Rhudy, &amp; Favorite, 2011). Despite this evidence, the mechanism of change for ERRT remains unclear. We propose to conduct a set of case series in order to examine the possible mechanisms: psycho-education, dose response for exposure, and no exposure components of the treatment. Each part of the treatment is theorized to contribute to the improved treatment outcome and it is hypothesized that participants will benefit no matter what group they are in. All participants will receive 5 treatment sessions, conducted twice per week for about 90 minutes, of a modified version of ERRT.</brief_summary>
