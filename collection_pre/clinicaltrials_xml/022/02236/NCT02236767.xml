	<brief_summary>This is multiple baseline study including up to three participants with a primary diagnosis of hoarding disorder. All patients will receive unblinded repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation study intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment of Hoarding Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study assessments will be conducted at pre-baseline, weekly during baseline assessment (until a stable baseline is established, but not less than 2, 4, and 6 weeks for patients respectively), weekly during treatment, and at post-treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be competed at pre-baseline, pre-treatment, and post-treatment. Treatment will entail daily (5 days/week) sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation using the Neurostar Therapy System for 6 weeks employing right-sided, low frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 900 pulses/session for 30 sessions, 27,000 total pulses, intensity at 90% of the passive motor threshold) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Neuronavigation will direct coil placement over the DLPFC based upon structural MRI.</detailed_description>
