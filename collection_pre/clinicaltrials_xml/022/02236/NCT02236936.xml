	<brief_summary>Prevention of critical weight loss. In patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) weight loss is a relevant clinical problem during radiotherapy and might result in higher treatment related toxicity and discontinuation of a potential curative treatment. Thus the investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of overnight parenteral nutritional (PN) support in patients with SCCHN treated with curative radiotherapy (RTX) in combination with Cetuximab (E) or Cisplatin (P).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parenteral Nutrition for Patients Treated for Locally Advanced Inoperable Tumors of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that about 60% of patients receiving RTX without supplemental PN will suffer from critical weight loss of more than 5% during treatment - supplemental overnight PN might result in significant improvement of the nutritional status .</detailed_description>
