	<brief_summary>Tennis elbow is a common occurrence in the general population that causes lateral elbow pain and diminished grip strength, which may be debilitating. Most affected individuals achieve symptom resolution within 6 months to 1 year with measures such as physiotherapy, anti-inflammatories and corticosteroid injections, but a small subset will go on to develop chronic symptoms. Chronic tennis elbow can be treated surgically, with arthroscopy gaining popularity in recent years as it presents a less invasive option, allows for direct visualization of the elbow joint for other pathology and has a faster return-to-work time compared to other surgical procedures. Despite its promise there have been no high quality studies evaluating the efficacy of arthroscopic tennis elbow release, bringing the actual efficacy of this procedure into question. We propose a randomized, double-blind controlled trial comparing arthroscopic release with arthroscopic debridement for the management of chronic tennis elbow in an effort to definitively answer this question and provide better recommendations for the use of this procedure.</brief_summary>
