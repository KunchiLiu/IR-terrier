	<criteria>All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric criteria: Patients must have a stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1 &lt;=70% of Forced vital capacity (FVC) Males: Predicted Normal FEV1 = 0.093 (height in inches)0.032 (age)1.343 Females: Predicted Normal FEV1 = 0.085 (height in inches)0.025(age)1.692 Male or female age 40 years or older Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 packyears. A packyear is defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes (20 cigarettes) per day for a year Patients must be able to satisfactorily administer the medication, perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial (i.e., prior to prestudy washout of their usual pulmonary medications and prior to fasting for laboratory tests) Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease with may influence the results of the study or patients ability to participate in the study Patients with clinically relevant baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion the patient is excluded All patients with serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt;80 IU/L, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt;80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dl, or creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will be not be conducted in these patients Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a blood eosinophil count above 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil count will be not be conducted in these patients Patients with a recent (i.e., one year or less) history of myocardial infarction Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of cardiac failure, patients with cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy, patients receiving any systemic betablockers and patients on chronic daytime oxygen therapy Patients with known active tuberculosis Patients with a history of cancer within the last 5 years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed Patients with a history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a history of thoracotomy for other reason should be evaluated per exclusion criterion No.1 Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladderneck obstruction Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma Patients who are on cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium Patients who are on antihistamines Pregnant or nursing women and women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception (e.g., oral contraceptive, intrauterine devices, diaphragm or Norplant®) Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 1 month or 6 halflives (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to the screening visit or patients currently enrolled in another research study Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse</criteria>
