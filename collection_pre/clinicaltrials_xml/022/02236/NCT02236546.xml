	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well FDG-PET/CT measures early response in patients with stage III-IV melanoma who are receiving chemotherapy. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) uses a metabolic imaging radiotracer, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which selectively accumulates in tumors. FDG-PET/CT of advanced melanoma before, during, and after treatment may improve methods for predicting which patients may benefit from therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To correlate treatment-induced changes in FDG uptake with changes in tumor size and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving therapy for advanced melanoma. II. To correlate treatment-induced changes in FDG uptake with changes in the activity and/or expression of available molecular biomarkers from patients receiving therapy for advanced melanoma. OUTLINE: Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT up to 2 weeks prior to first dose of therapy, after completion of the first treatment course (day 21), and after completion of the fourth treatment course (day 84).</detailed_description>
