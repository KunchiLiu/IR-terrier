	<brief_summary>The heart requires nutrients and oxygen carried in the blood to generate energy for healthy pump function. Blood is supplied via heart vessels called coronary arteries. When the arteries narrow the investigators call this coronary artery disease. Narrowing and blockage of the coronary arteries can cause chest pain (angina), breathlessness (due to a reduction in pump function) and if prolonged even irreversible muscle damage known as a heart attack. The investigators can treat patients with coronary artery disease with drugs that reduce the workload on the heart or with balloons and hollow metal tubes (stents) to open the narrowed coronary arteries and improve the blood supply. These treatments can relieve angina, improve breathlessness and avert heart muscle damage during a heart attack. A potential new mechanistic effect is emerging by modulating the type of fuel used by the heart to generate energy more efficiently has been tested in the left ventricle. This study is designed to see if mechanistic effect provides the same protection in the right ventricle. It is hoped that this may further improve heart pump function and reduce the size of a heart attack in patients with coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
