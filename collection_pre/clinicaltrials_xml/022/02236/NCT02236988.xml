	<brief_summary>To study how the body absorbs apremilast, and how this absorption is affected when the drug is given as different formulations. Blood samples will be taken to look at the amount of study drug in the blood to determine how much apremilast is absorbed by the body. This study is beng done to iddentify the best tablet formulation (preparation) of apremilast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics of Apremilast in Heatlhy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single-center, open-label, crossover, single modified-release-dose, study in male subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of prototype modified-release formulations compared to the reference immediate-release apremilast formulation. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence. A total of up to 8 test MR formulations may be evaluated. Group 1: 4-sequence, 4-period to compare three modified-release prototypes with the reference immediate-release formulation. A total of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 4 periods. One of two scenarios will be conducted in the second group depending on the availability of the modified-release formulations. This will be a single-center, open-label, crossover, single modified-release-dose, study in male subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of prototype modified-release formulations compared to the reference immediate-release apremilast formulation. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence. A total of up to 8 test MR formulations may be evaluated. Group 1: 4-sequence, 4-period to compare three modified-release prototypes with the reference immediate-release formulation. A total of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 4 periods. One of two scenarios will be conducted in the second group depending on the availability of the modified-release formulations. Group 2/Scenario 1: This is a 4-sequence, 4-period design identical to Group 1. This will occur if all three modified-release formulations planned for Group 2 are available. A total of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 4 periods. Group 2/Scenario 2: This is a 6-sequence, 3-period design. This will occur if only two modified-release formulations are tested in Group 2. A total of 18 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 3 periods. A third group may be enrolled to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of one or two additional prototype formulations (after the initial six) compared to the immediate-release formulation. One of two scenarios will be conducted in the third group depending on the availability of the prototype formulations. Group 3/Scenario 1: This is a 2-sequence, 2-period design that will be used if one test formulation is available. A total of 14 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete both periods. Group 3/Scenario 2: This is a 6-sequence, 3-period design identical to Group 2/Scenario 2 above. This will occur if two test formulations are available. A total of 18 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 3 periods. A fourth group may be enrolled to evaluate the PK of four additional prototype formulations compared to the IR formulation. Group 4: This is a 10-sequence, 5-period William Square design to compare four MR prototypes with the reference IR formulation. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 20 subjects who complete all 5 periods.</detailed_description>

Male subjects of any race between 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive), and in good health as determined by the Investigator. 4. Has a body mass index between 18 and 33 kg/m2 (inclusive). 5. No clinically significant laboratory tests as determined by the investigator. 6. Must not have a fever, with systolic blood pressure: 90 to 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure: 60 to 90 mmHg, and pulse rate: 40 to 110 bpm (measurements taken while lying down). 7. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12lead ECG. 8. Subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex condom not made out of natural [animal] membrane [eg, polyurethane]) while on study medication, and for 28 days after the last dose of study medication. 9. Must agree to refrain from donating sperm, blood or plasma (other than for this study) while participating in this study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug. The presence of ANY of the following will exclude any healthy subject from enrollment into the study: 1. History of any clinically significant and relevant neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or other major disorders. 2. Any condition which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate in the study, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 3. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 30 days of the first dose administration, unless Sponsor agreement is obtained. 4. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration, unless Sponsor agreement is obtained. 5. Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure, colon resection, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, etc. Subjects with cholecytectomy and appendectomy may be included. 6. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to the first dose administration or 5 halflives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer). 7. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to a blood bank or blood donation center. 8. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual within 2 years before dosing, or a positive drug screen reflecting consumption of illicit drugs. 9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2 years before dosing, or a positive alcohol screen. 10. Known to have serum hepatitis, or known to be a carrier of the HBsAg, or HCV Ab, or have a positive result to the test for HIV antibodies at Screening.</criteria>
