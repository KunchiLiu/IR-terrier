	<brief_summary>Previous animal studies done by Dr. Brent Cameron in 2013 at the Univ. of Toledo have shown that glucose present in the fluid in the front of the eye, called the aqueous humor, correlates well with blood glucose. As blood glucose changes, the optical properties of the aqueous humor change, causing a change in the appearance of the iris of the eye.. The data collected in this study will be shared with IRISense to assist in validating the algorithm being used to develop the database needed. The data collected so far is in a narrow band of the normal glycemic range (healthy volunteers). We will collect standard digital photographic images of the eyes of subjects with diabetes along with corresponding blood glucose concentrations using the finger stick glucose monitoring method. In order to do this we will use standard digital photography techniques that is embedded in our benchtop prototype device</brief_summary>
