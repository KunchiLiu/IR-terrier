	<brief_summary>Besides the specific response to vaccine antigens, the investigators will analyze the anti-HPV immune response in HIV-1-infected men in different strata of immune deficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by stratification by T CD4 + lymphocytes in an attempt to assess the range of the count with the highest possibility of vaccine response. Thus, knowledge of vaccine response in HIV-infected patients, indicate which patients would have greater potential for vaccine response in vivo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be divided into three groups. Patients with HIV-1 infection will be subdivided into groups according to T CD4 + lymphocytes at the time of vaccination: Over 500 CD4 T cells count and bellow 500 CD4 T cells count.
