	<brief_summary>This is a randomized trial to assess the value of an emergency department-based intervention to reduce hazardous alcohol use among older adults. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in a 25% reduction in the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use while the control group will only have a 5% reduction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of an Emergency Department-based Intervention to Reduce Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to perform a pilot, randomized, controlled trial of a brief intervention and referral for treatment among older adults in the emergency department (ED) with alcohol misuse. The pilot data would then be used to design a larger study. The intervention for this trial will consist of a Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) with a stratified referral for further treatment, compared with usual care. The BNI is a standardized, well-described intervention that has been implemented in a broad range of clinical settings but has not been specifically tested in older adults in the ED. Following the BNI, we will provide a referral for further care for the patient that is stratified by severity of alcohol misuse. Patients with hazardous or harmful alcohol use will follow-up with a primary care physician; patients with alcohol abuse or dependence will follow-up with an outpatient alcohol and substance abuse program; those at risk for complicated withdrawal will be recommended for inpatient treatment. In all cases we will contact the referral physician to help transition the patient's care, and ensure the patient receives a consistent message regarding their alcohol use across the different care settings.</detailed_description>
