	<brief_summary>Frontal patients are impaired in categorisation and analogical reasoning tasks, and different functional imaging studies from our group have shown the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in categorisation and analogy tasks. The aim of this project is to test our hypotheses about the role of the prefrontal cortex in explicit and implicit categorisation and analogy tasks.</brief_summary>
