	<brief_summary>Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases, with potential lifethreatening impacts. Indeed, asthma is still responsible for about a thousand deceases per year in France, and constitutes a public health problem in our country as in many countries in the world. The economic burden of asthma is also very high, in terms of health care, and indirect costs including lost work and lost school days. A few international and French studies have shown a positive clinical impact of Medical Indoor Environment Counselors (MIECs) visiting homes of asthma patients, mainly pediatrics. It has been proposed that MIECs could contribute to reduce patient exposure to many allergens and irritants, among them, house dust mite allergens, formaldehyde or molds. Most of the studies that show a significant decrease of hospitalization or visit in an emergency ward for asthma are monocentric and study the eviction of 1 such identified risk factor. By contrast, meta-analysis underline that additional studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in adults, in a multicentric and controlled manner, with both clinical, environmental and economical endpoints.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methodology/Study schedule : A prospective multicenter randomised, open label, controlled trial with blind evaluation of the primary evaluation criterion on three parallel groups of patients. Procedures : Home intervention of MIECs that comprise diagnostic of allergen/irritant exposure (after sampling), advices for allergen/irritant avoidance and follow up of advice compliance. After randomisation and agreement of the patient and the family, the " intervention group " will benefit from a first home intervention of a MIEC during the 4 weeks following inclusion, then a final visit at the end of the study after 12 months. Two comparative groups will be identified : - the " control group " who will benefit from a first home intervention of a MIEC but without advices (only audit + sampling), then a final and a complete visit at the end of the study - a " non intervention " group with no initial visit, but who will benefit from a complete home intervention of a MIEC at the end of the study. Expected findings and impact : If our hypothesis that home intervention of MIECs are cost-effective on asthma control, then it is relevant to include such service in the medical care during the management of asthma patients with a reimbursement by the social security.</detailed_description>
