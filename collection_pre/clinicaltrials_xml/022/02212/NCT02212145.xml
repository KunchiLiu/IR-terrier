	<brief_title>Follow-up of Sollentuna Prevention Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Sweden there are unique opportunities to create a relevant comparison group for this study, which is of great importance to the value of this cohort study. Of the three study populations two (2-3)will be created by using national registries. 1. The screened group consists of the individuals (n = 5938) who had direct contact with the prevention program, ie undergone a voluntary opportunistic cardiovascular screening (questionnaire, physical examination and testing in connection with visits to health centers) and the rest of all individuals who lived in Sollentuna Municipality between 1988-1993. 2. Relatives of individuals included in the screened group who lived in Stockholm county at the time of the intervention will be identified by the use of the Medical Birth Register and the Multi-Generation Register. Family members are defined as parents, siblings and children and husband / wife to those in thescreened group and will be analyzed in the same way as those who participated in the intervention for risk of developing cardiovascular disease and cancer. 3. The comparison group consists of the entire population of Stockholm County minus Sollentuna 1988-93, taking into account population changes (migration, birth, death) during the period. This three populations will be followed-up in national registries and databases All subjects will be monitored for example disease history, socio-economics and biochemical risk factors presented below national registries and research databases. When all the matches of national registers and a local register (AMORIS)have been done the database will de-identified and anonymized data to be available for statistical processing.</detailed_description>
