	<detailed_description>A nationwide Nutrition Survey of Malaysian Children carried out between 2008-2009 among 3542 children aged from 6 months to 12 years showed a prevalence of 9.8% overweight and 11.8% obesity while in a more recent 2011 Global School-based Student Heath Survey showed that the percentage of overweight and obese Malaysian school children age 13-15 years old was 25.4% and 10.9% respectively . If left unchecked, these children will grow up to be obese adults, developed various obesity-related complications such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes etc. Realising the urgent needs to address the problems, the Ministry of Health Malaysia with the cooperation of the Ministry of Education, proposed to implement MyBFF@school in all schools in Malaysia. Students participating in MyBFF@school will take part in a structured physical activity in the form of small sided football game (SSG), and are to attend intensified and interactive nutrition and psychology classes aimed at improving their knowledge, self-esteem and self-empowerment.</detailed_description>
