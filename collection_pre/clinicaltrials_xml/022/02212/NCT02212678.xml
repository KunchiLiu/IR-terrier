	<brief_title>Repeated-Dose Oral N-acetylcysteine for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are interested in evaluating the use of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as therapy for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and measuring changes in brain and blood chemistry. The investigators' hypothesis is that repeated oral dosing of NAC will result in increased brain and red blood cell GSH concentrations in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. The specific aims are to 1.) measure plasma and blood (red blood cell) glutathione (GSH) and ratio of reduced GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in individuals with PD and healthy controls at baseline and after four weeks of repeated high doses of oral NAC (6000 mg/day) and 2) measure cortical GSH levels (as ascertained through MRS) in those with PD and healthy controls at baseline and four weeks during repeated high doses of oral NAC (6000 mg/day) simultaneously with Aim 1. This study will combine information from a medical history, a physical examination, and disease rating scales with results obtained using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) brain scans and pharmacokinetic studies from blood samples. This research will require 2 visits, one at baseline and one after approximately 28 days of therapy. Participants will provide their medical history during the first visit, and undergo a physical examination and rating scale each visit (duration: 1 hour). The first visit including the brain scans and blood collection will require approximately 3 hours of time. The brain scan and pharmacokinetic studies for the second visit will require approximately 8 hours of time. In total the second visit will take roughly 9 hours.</detailed_description>
