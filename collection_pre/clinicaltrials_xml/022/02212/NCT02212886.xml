	<criteria>Male or female subjects with a diagnosis of RRMS. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) consistent with the McDonald Criteria (revisions of 2010). Treatment with 20 mg or 40 mg of GA (Copaxone) during the previous 12 months with ongoing treatment at the Screening Visit. Normal renal function. Normal liver function. Normal hemoglobin concentration. Absence of any clinically significant medical, psychiatric or laboratory abnormalities. Ability to provide written informed consent. Any relevant medical, surgical, or psychiatric condition, laboratory value, or concomitant medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for study entry or potentially unable to complete all aspects of the study. Severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL). Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5xULN). Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Women capable of child bearing must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening visit and use an adequate contraceptive method throughout the study. Women who are surgically sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or whose last menstruation was 12 months or more prior to the Screening Visit are considered to be of nonchildbearing potential. Acceptable forms of contraception include oral, implanted, or injected contraceptives; intrauterine devices in place for at least 3 months; estrogen patch; and adequate barrier methods in conjunction with spermicide. Abstinence is considered an acceptable contraceptive regimen. History of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction following a vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug, e.g. GA, polylacticcoglycolic acid (PLGA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse. Positive test for HIV, hepatitis, venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL), or tuberculosis. Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to start of this study. Treatment with any kind of steroids during the last 30 days. Confirmed relapse during the last 30 days.</criteria>
