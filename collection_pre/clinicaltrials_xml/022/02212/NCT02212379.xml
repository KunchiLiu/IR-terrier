	<brief_summary>This multicenter, international, non randomized (single arm), open, phase II trial aims to evaluate the capacity of the dual combination raltegravir/etravirine to maintain virological success in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients, of at least 45 years of age, switching from a boosted PI-containing regimen. Patients will be followed for 96 weeks. Measurement of primary endpoint will be at 48 weeks. Virological success is defined as the absence of 2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;50 copies/mL within 2 to 4 weeks of a dual raltegravir/etravirin regimen. Raltegravir/etravirine will be considered acceptable if the percentage of patients in virological success at week 48 is significantly above 90 %. Assuming a 95 % virological success rate, by including 160 individuals and considering the strategy to be acceptable if no more than 8 individuals have virological failure; investigators will have a 95 % probability to discard a combination for which efficacy is smaller than 90 % and investigators will select with a power of 80 % the strategy for which the efficacy is above or equal to 95 %. The principal secondary endpoint is the proportion of patients in therapeutic success up to week 48 and 96.</brief_summary>
