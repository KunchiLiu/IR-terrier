	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy after surgery to remove breast cancer improves control of the breast cancer. Standard therapy after breast conservation surgery is five to six weeks of radiation to the entire breast. This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of conformal radiation therapy delivered only to the area in the breast where the lumpectomy will be performed. This study will determine if radiation therapy delivered in this manner will prevent the cancer from coming back and eliminate the need for five to six weeks of radiation. The study will also gather information about the safety and effects (good and bad) this radiation has, and on patient satisfaction with the appearance of the breast.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our proposal represents the convergence of several recent developments in the treatment of patients with low-risk carcinoma of the breast. For the selected subset of patients with low-risk disease, it appears that intra-operative radiotherapy with a single fraction leads to acceptable clinical outcomes in terms of local control, overall survival and toxicity. There have also been a few Phase I dose escalation trials demonstrating safety with single fraction breast radiation. In this study, we propose the delivery of radiotherapy using only a single fraction, 21 Gy, but using stereotactic body radiation therapy. Radiation will be delivered using Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), planned on coregistered PET/MRI and CT imaging, and delivered prone. Our approach will potentially have numerous benefits, including significantly shortened treatment time, convenience and potentially reduced health care costs. It would significantly improve the quality of life of many patients. This study will also provide a unique opportunity for pathologic assessment of the impact of radiation at a microscopic level and on tumour markers without the confounding impact of systemic treatments, comparing pre- to post-radiation biopsy specimens for imaging and histologic predictors of radiation sensitivity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 55 years and postmenopausal Tumour size ≤3cm (i.e. stage T1/T2a) on pretreatment imaging Any grade of disease, estrogen receptor (ER) positive Unicentric/unifocal disease Invasive ductal carcinoma or other favorable subtypes of epithelial breast malignancy (medullary, papillary, colloid, mucinous, or tubular) . Clinically nodenegative (based upon pretreatment physical examination &amp; axillary ultrasound). Surgical expectation that a &gt;2mm margin can be obtained. Lesion is 1cm or greater from the skin surface. Able to have surgery within 17 days of radiation therapy. Able to lie comfortably in the prone position with arms raised above the head for extended periods of time. Previous radiation therapy to the same breast Evidence of suspicious diffuse microcalcifications in the breast prior to the start of radiation. Local metastatic spread into ipsilateral axilla and/or supraclavicular region and/or neck nodes and/or internal mammary nodes diagnosed on clinical examination or any imaging assessment (unless such sites can be confirmed as negative following biopsy) Distant metastases Contralateral axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or internal mammary nodes (unless there is histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative) Prior nonhormonal therapy or radiation therapy for the current breast cancer Patients with Paget's disease of the nipple. Skin involvement, regardless of tumour size. Patients with a breast technically unsatisfactory for radiation therapy. Patients not appropriate for breast conserving surgery due to expectation of poor cosmetic result, even without radiation therapy Collagen vascular disease (particularly lupus, scleroderma, dermatomyositis) Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent. Any other malignancy at any site (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) &lt;5 years prior to study enrollment Patients who are pregnant or lactating</criteria>
