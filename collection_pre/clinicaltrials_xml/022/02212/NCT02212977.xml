	<brief_summary>Hypothesis is that incision closure with octylcyanoacrylate is inferior to closure with stitches in Port a Cath patients, who, as a population, are at increased risk for complications. All adult patients who present for initial Port a Cath placement during the recruitment period will be eligible to participate in the study. Subjects will be randomized to either skin incision closure with standard stitches or closure with skin glue. Time to complete skin closure and costs of closure will be compared. Patients will be evaluated approximately one month and three months from the procedure to assess for complications of wound breakdown or infection, as well as for the appearance of the Port a Cath incision.</brief_summary>
