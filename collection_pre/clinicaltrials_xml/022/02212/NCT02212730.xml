	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effect of treatment with the neoadjuvant antibody pembrolizumab (MK-3475) on tumors of participants with renal cell cancer (RCC). The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab is well tolerated in participants undergoing RCC tumor resection; and that pembrolizumab will stimulate a 2-fold or greater increase in intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration in at least 30% of participants with RCC.</brief_summary>
