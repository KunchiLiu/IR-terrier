	<brief_summary>Although there has been increasing interest in the association between cancer and cerebrovascular disease, the underlying pathophysiology of stroke in cancer patients is still not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the stroke mechanisms in patients with cancer-associated stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification the Cause of Cerebral Infarction in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with cryptogenic embolic stroke will be prospectively enrolled and categorized into two groups according to the presence of active cancer: cryptogenic embolic stroke with active cancer (cancer-associated stroke) vs. without active cancer (cryptogenic embolic stroke). All patients will undergo brain MRI/MRA, 12-lead electrocardiography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with injection of agitated saline, and 24-hour Holter and/or telemonitoring. Duplex ultrasonography to detect venous thrombosis of the lower extremity will also be performed in patients with a positive right-to-left shunt on echocardiography.</detailed_description>
