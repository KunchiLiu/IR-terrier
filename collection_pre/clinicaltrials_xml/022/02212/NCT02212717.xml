	<brief_summary>Acute cholecystitis commonly occurs in elderly patients that are high-risk candidates for surgery. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is frequently employed for gallbladder drainage in these patients. Recently, the feasibility of EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EGBD) in treatment of this condition has been demonstrated but how the two procedures compare to one another is uncertain. The aim of this study is to compare EGBD versus PC as a definitive treatment, in high-risk patients suffering from acute cholecystitis in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that EGBD can reduce the morbidity, re-intervention and mortality when compared to PC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years old admitted for acute cholecystitis but are unsuitable for early laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to poor premorbid conditions including: American society of anesthesiology grading ≥ 3, APACHE score ≥ 12, limited life expectancy (less than 2 years) or deemed unsuitable for general anesthesia would be included.
