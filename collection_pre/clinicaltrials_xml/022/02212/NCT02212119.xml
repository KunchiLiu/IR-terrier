	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to perform a pilot study to assess the impact of Botulinum toxin on muscle tone, and caregiver burden in individuals who are cognitively impaired and who are fully dependent. The primary objective is to confirm proof of principle that paratonic rigidity and the consequences associated with it can be reduced with injection of Botulinum toxin injections resulting in reduced care-giver burden. The secondary objectives are to determine optimal time points for evaluation of efficacy in this patient population and whether the time period is sufficient for washout of Botulinum toxin effect; determine most salient and sensitive outcome measures; identify obstacles in data gathering; and lastly, to determine feasibility of battery of assessments in this pilot study.</brief_summary>
