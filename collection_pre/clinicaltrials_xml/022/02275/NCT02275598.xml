	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Followed by ABVD in Patients With Previously Untreated Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter pilot phase II trial assessing 2 administrations of Brentuximab vedotin followed by PET scan and subsequent standard treatment with ABVD ± Radiotherapy. 12 patients defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in one year. All subjects will be followed for disease evaluation every 3 months for one year after end of therapy until disease progression, death, initiation of alternative therapy, withdrawal of consent, or end of study. For all study procedures patient will be assigned a Unique Subject Identifier (SID) number that will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation. A master log will be maintained of all consented subjects and will document all screening failures (i.e. subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria). Study records such as case report forms (CRFs) may be maintained electronically and require the same security and confidentiality as paper. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject/legal representative, except as specified in the informed consent form</detailed_description>
