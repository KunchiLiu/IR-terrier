	<brief_summary>Through bio-sampling this study investigates the relationship between the frequency and function of the cells of a patients immune system and how these change and impact on the outcome of alcoholic hepatitis. the investigators will examine the role of different cells of the immune system and how they may determine the outcome of this condition. The investigators will also look at how established treatment strategies impact on the frequency and function of these cell subsets.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Cell Dysfunction in Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through bio-sampling this study investigates the relationship between the frequency and function of the cells of a patients immune system and how these change and impact on the outcome of alcoholic hepatitis. The investigators will examine the role of different cells of the immune system and how they may determine the outcome of this condition. The investigators will also look at how established treatment strategies impact on the frequency and function of these cell subsets. Alcohol is the most common cause of liver disease in the developed world and results in the death of 2.5 million people annually. It is a causal factor in more than 60 major types of diseases and injuries and approximately 4.5% of the global burden of disease and injury is attributable to alcohol. Acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) is perhaps the most florid form of ALD and the leading cause of mortality in these patients is the development of sepsis which occurs in up to 40% of these patients and has a mortality rate of 50%. By gaining a better understanding of the relationship between elements of the immune system and the progression to severe alcoholic hepatitis, it will allow the formulation of more effective treatment strategies for this condition. Patients who agree to participate in this study will have an extra 40mls of blood drawn for scientific studies at the same time as routine blood samples are taken as part of their ongoing care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 1865 years 2. Patients presented with severe alcoholic hepatitis with a Maddrey score (discriminant function) of &gt;32 (The Maddrey score uses various blood results on a patient to define the severity of alcoholic hepatitis e.g.bilirubin etc). 3. Ongoing abuse of alcohol (drinking in excess of 28 units/wk) 1. Coinfection with HIV/Hepatitis B / Hepatitis C virus infection. 2. Patients with autoimmune liver disease. 3. Patients with metabolic liver disease. 4. Patients with significant psychiatric and/or neurological comorbidity. 5. Hepatocellular carcinoma or other neoplastic disease 6. Pregnancy or breast feeding of infants.</criteria>
