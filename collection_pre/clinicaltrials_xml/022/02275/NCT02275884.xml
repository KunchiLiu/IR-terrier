	<brief_summary>This study evaluates plasma concentrations of pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate and their effects on motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Following one week of abstinence from cocoa-containing products, patients with Parkinson's disease will be randomized to receive either dark or white chocolate. After one week of chocolate consumption, patients will then cross over to white or dark chocolate, respectively, and take the corresponding chocolate product for another week. Blood samples will be taken at baseline, week 1 and week 2 to examine plasma concentrations of pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate at all three timepoints. Moreover, patients will be clinically examined for motor and non-motor symptoms at all visits.</brief_summary>
