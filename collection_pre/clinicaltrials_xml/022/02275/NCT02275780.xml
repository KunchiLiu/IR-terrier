	<brief_summary>To establish a new treatment option for treatment-naïve participants with HIV-1, the efficacy and safety of doravirine will be determined relative to a protease inhibitor (PI). Participants will receive double-blind treatment during the 96-week Base Study. Eligible participants in either of the Base Study groups will continue to receive the doravirine-containing regimen open label for an additional 96 weeks in the Extension Study. The primary hypothesis is that doravirine 100 mg once a day (q.d.) is non-inferior to darunavir/ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d., each in combination with TRUVADA™ or EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™, as assessed by the proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 48. If non-inferiority is established, then the superiority of doravirine 100 mg q.d. compared to darunavir/ ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d. will be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Is HIV1 positive and has HIV treatment indicated based on physician assessment. Has received no (0 days of) antiretroviral therapy (ART), including investigational antiretroviral agents. Is considered clinically stable with no signs or symptoms of active infection for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment. Female is highly unlikely to become pregnant, or male is highly unlikely to impregnate a partner because they are not of reproductive potential, or agree to practice abstinence or use acceptable contraception for up to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.

Uses or has had a recent history of using recreational or illicit drugs. Has been treated for a viral infection other than HIV1, such as hepatitis B, with an agent that is active against HIV1. Has documented or known resistance to study drugs including MK1439, darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir, abacavir and/or lamivudine. Has participated in a study with an investigational compound/device within the prior month, or anticipates doing so during this study. Has used systemic immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulators within the prior 30 days, or anticipates doing so during this study. Has significant hypersensitivity or other contraindication to any of the components of the study drugs. Has a current (active) diagnosis of acute hepatitis due to any cause. Is pregnant, breastfeeding or expecting to conceive at any time during the study. Female who expects to donate eggs, or male who expects to donate sperm at any time during the study.</criteria>
