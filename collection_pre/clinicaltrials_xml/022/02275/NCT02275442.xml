	<detailed_description>It's a multicenter prospective observational study with a quali-quantitative method. This study involved three maternities in Auvergne region (Issoire, Thiers, Saint-Flour). Precarious women living in rural areas are included. They will be followed during a period of two months after childbirth. The main assessment criterion is the adequation rate between antenatal care for those women and the HAS recommendation's. The amount necessary to highlight a significant difference is 190 patients (IC 95% [0.429 - 0.571] ; risk = 5 % ; Adequation rate = 50 % ; lost to follow-up rate = 10 % ; deprivation rate = 27 %). The secondary criteria of judgment are the reasons for not realized antenatal and postnatal cares, the difficulties of realized antenatal and postnatal cares, the strategies developed to overcome them, the term and health status of the child birth (Apgar score, birth weight), the health status of the child birth and his mother during the two post-partum months (HAS recommendation's).</detailed_description>
