	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter, outpatient study in COPD subjects who are discharged from the hospital due to a COPD exacerbation. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments: arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution (BROVANA) 15 mcg twice daily (BID) or tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) 18 mcg once daily (QD), each given for 90 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Arformoterol Tartrate Inhalation Solution and Tiotropium Bromide on Re-hospitalization in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter, outpatient study in COPD subjects who are discharged from the hospital following a COPD exacerbation. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg (BROVANA) will be administered BID (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours between doses) using a standard jet nebulizer with a face mask or mouthpiece connected to an air compressor. Tiotropium 18 mcg (SPIRIVA) will be administered QD (morning) via the HandiHaler®. Study medications will be dispensed to the subject at Visit 1. The objective of the study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of arformoterol and tiotropium on re-hospitalization and to assess safety in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) subjects recovering from hospitalization for an acute exacerbation.</detailed_description>
