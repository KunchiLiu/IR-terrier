	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in eliminating any remaining cancer cells and preventing cancer from returning in patients with acute myeloid leukemia that had a decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer after receiving chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Eliminating Minimal Residual Disease and Preventing Relapse in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate and compare the progression free survival rate after randomization in the two treatment arms (nivolumab versus [vs.] observation). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine and compare the overall survival rates in the two arms. II. To determine and compare the incidence of non-relapse mortality in the two arms. III. To evaluate the toxicities of nivolumab as maintenance. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To analyze programmed cell death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples at diagnosis if available and at the time of study enrollment. II. To monitor AML minimal residual disease (MRD) by Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at enrollment and at subsequent defined time points in the nivolumab-treated and control groups. III. To perform an exploratory analysis on the frequencies, absolute numbers and subsets of T cells (including regulatory T cells) in the nivolumab-treated and control groups with an emphasis on activation markers. IV. To perform deep sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha and TCR-beta chains on polyclonal T cells at baseline and at subsequent time points in the nivolumab and control groups. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 46 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care clinical observation for up to 2 years. Upon disease relapse, patients may cross-over to Arm I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>
