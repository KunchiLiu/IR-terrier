	<brief_summary>This study compare the outcome (pain, function) after Radiofrequency microtenotomy (group I) and acromioplasty (group II) for treatment of rotator cuff tendinosis in the shoulder. The outcome of both methods will be compared to the physical therapy treatment (groupIII)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Microtenotomy for Treatment of Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tendinosis cause pain and disability of the shoulder. Tendinosis, sometimes complicated by partial rupture, appears to be the major lesion in chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy. Important features is a poor intrinsic ability to heal. Several patients receive treatment for shoulder tendinosis each year. Conservative treatments options include rest, stretching, strengthening, ice and/or physical therapy are used with difference results. A traditional surgical treatments (acromioplasty) have been reported with variable results.. The aim of this study is to evaluate improvement of VAS and functionality using Constant score before and after treatment of rotator cuff tendinosis using radiofrequency-plasma based microtenotomy in comparison to traditional acromioplasty and physical therapy.</detailed_description>
