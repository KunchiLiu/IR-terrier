	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate acupuncture's effect of preventing vasospasm after SAH. A total of 80 participants will be recruited and will be randomized to a study group or a control group. Acupuncture, electroacupuncture and intradermal acupuncture will be done at every session in a study group, while mock transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(mock TENS) and sham intradermal acupuncture will be carried out in a control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture for Cerebral Vasospasm After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention starts within 96hours after SAH, after ruptured aneurysms have been secured by endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Intervention is applied once a day, 6 days a week for 2 weeks(total 12 sessions) in addition to standard treatment such as prophylactic HHH therapy and nimodipine. Sterile disposable, stainless steel acupuncture needles are used. Primary outcome measurement is the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit between the study group and the control group. Moreover, the incidence of angiographic vasospasm, TCD vasospasm, and vasospasm-related infarct on CT or MRI, the change of nitric oxide(NO) and endothelin-1 in plasma, mortality and participant's functional status using mRS will be compared.</detailed_description>
