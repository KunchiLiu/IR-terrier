	<brief_summary>Patients with type 1 diabetes type 1 (DM1) have increased risk of death due to heart disease and stroke. These cardiovascular conditions (CVD) are the leading cause of death in patients with DM1 younger than 40 years of age and up to 35% of all persons with DM1 will die before age 55 from CVD. Strategies are needed to help identify adolescents with DM1 at risk for CVD so that interventions to prevent heart disease and stroke can be undertaken.</brief_summary>
