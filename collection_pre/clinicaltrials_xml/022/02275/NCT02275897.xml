	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if prolonging the speed of injection during spinal anaesthesia can reduce the incidence of hypotension and/or medication requirements thereby making it safer for the mother and foetus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Different Injection Speeds for Spinal Anaesthesia in Caesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to investigate if by varying the speed of injection during spinal anaesthesia, will there be a difference in the incidence of hypotension. Hypotension is a common complication especially for pregnant women undergoing caesarean section. A high speed of injection can theoretically cause a higher spread of anaesthetic, which may increase the incidence of hypotension. We want to know if by prolonging the injection time, will this lead to a reduction in a rate of hypotension.</detailed_description>
