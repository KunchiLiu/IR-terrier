	<detailed_description>The vasospasm after cranial aneurysm surgery have a higher incidence, but not have an ideal treatment method. At present, the medical treatment is very limited effect to prevent the perioperative cerebral ischemia.Stellate ganglion block （SGB）is an effective and well-tolerated approach to the treatment of CVS in various clinical settings.Resent study indicated that SGB has a protective effect on delayed cerebral vasospasm in an experimental rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage.Therefore,we hypothesized that the preoperative SGB would be a effective treatment for improvement of vasospasm after cranial aneurysm surgery.</detailed_description>
