	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscle Training With and Without Biofeedback in Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pelvic floor muscle training has been the first line of choice in the treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence. The goal of this technique is increasing the strength and function of the pelvic floor which aims to support the pelvic viscera, as well as part of their duties, such as locks sphincter muscles. Risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, multiple pregnancy, can cause a woman to present urinary incontinence (SUI), where the main cause is the dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles and the lack of awareness of these muscles as well as biomechanical problems. Some studies describe the use of EMG biofeedback to assess and improve the function of the pelvic floor muscles, however, the studies are not yet conclusive about the action of adding this equipment in the treatment of SUI. In this regard, the EMG Biofeedback has the ability to physiologically evaluate these disorders and perform a faster treatment for these patients, improving their quality of life. The EMG has the ability to monitor and measure the progression of activation of the pelvic floor muscles, giving feedback to the patient and therapist about the actual condition of muscle function.</detailed_description>
