	<brief_title>Effects of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Blood Pressure Levels in Hypertensive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with hypertension will be selected through the Outpatient Hypertension of the Hospital of Clinics de Porto Alegre, for convenience. Subsequently, patients will be subjected to test respiratory muscle strength (manometer), respiratory muscle resistance, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (maximum), evaluation of cardiac reflex sensitivity and autonomic control test and induction of inspiratory muscle mechanoreflex with occlusion plethysmography at baseline before the start of the training protocol. Patients will randomize inspiratory muscle training for 30 minutes a day, 7 days a week, for 8 weeks with muscle training device (PowerBreathe). There will be a weekly monitoring in the Clinical Research Center of the institution where the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and respiratory training techniques will be reassessed and readjusted (40% of MIP). The control group will be submitted to respiratory training techniques with muscle training device (PowerBreathe) without load. After this period, all initial tests will be reassessed. A healthy control group study with 10 normotensive individuals will be included.</detailed_description>
