	<brief_summary>Phase I-II trial that combines trabectedin plus radiotherapy for tumor reduction response measure in two cohorts of patients: Cohort A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or unresectable or not oncologically recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases soft tissue sarcoma. Cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma. Phase I: escalating dose of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2. Radiotherapy for cohort A: 30Gy in 10 fractions (3Gy/fraction) Radiotherapy for cohort B: 45Gy in 25 fractions (1.8Gy/fraction) A translational substudy is developed to analyse different biomarkers predictive value.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I-II Trial, Multicenter, Open, Exploring Trabectedin Plus Radiotherapy in Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study investigators plan to measure tumor response (RECIST and Choi criteria) when administering trabectedin standard dose or inferior with simultaneous radiotherapy treatment. The hypothesis states that administering trabectedin at 1.3mg/m2 or ≤1.5mg/m2 plus Radiotherapy 30-45Gy shows synergic activity that turns into tumor shrinkage. A phase I trial (dose escalation level of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2) will provide the proper dose level to perform a phase II trial to measure RECIST and Choi response, progression free survival, overall survival and register safety and quality of life details. To cohorts are indicated for this trial, A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or unresectable or not oncologically recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases soft tissue sarcoma and cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma. Unlimited cycles of chemotherapy are considered to be beneficial for cohort A patients, whereas cohort B only 3 cycles are indicated. About radiotherapy treatment, 30Gy will be given to cohort A patients, whereas cohort B will receive 45Gy. TCs and MRI are selected for imaging purposes. Several biomarkers are selected to perform FFPE tumor assays in relation to prediction</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cohort A: STS 1. The patient must sign voluntarily the informed consent form before any study test is conducted that is not part of routine patient care. 2. Aged between 18 and 70. 3. Patients must have a diagnostic of Soft Tissue Sarcoma with metastasis limited to lung, and not suitable for metastasectomy or surgery resection or not oncologically recommended metastasectomy 4. Patients must have documentation of disease progression within 6 months prior to study entry. 5. The patient must have been considered eligible for systemic chemotherapy. A maximum of two previous lines for advanced/metastatic disease are allowed as long as trabectedin has not been included. 6. The following histological subtypes can be included: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (previously, malignant fibrous histiocytoma) Leiomyosarcoma Angiosarcoma/ epithelial hemangioendothelioma Liposarcoma and its variants (well differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cells, pleomorphic) Synovial sarcoma Fibrosarcoma and its variants (epithelial fibrosarcoma/low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma) Hemangiopericytoma/solitary fibroid tumor Neurogenic sarcoma (Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, MPNST) Myxofibrosarcoma Epithelioid Sarcoma Unclassified sarcoma (spindle cell/epithelioid/pleomorphic/myxoid) 7. Measurable disease, according to RECIST V 1.1 criteria 8. Performance status ≤1 (ECOG). 9. Adequate respiratory functions: FEV1 &gt;1L 10. Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl, leukocytes ≥ 3.000/mm3, neutrophils ≥ 1.500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100.000/mm3). Patients with plasma creatinine ≤ 1,6 mg/dl, transaminases ≤ 2.5 times the UNL, total bilirubin ≤ UNL, CPK ≤ 2.5 times UNL, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times the UNL are acceptable. If the increase of alkaline phosphatase is &gt; 2.5 times the UNL, then the alkaline phosphatase liver fraction and/or 5' nucleotidase and/or GGT must be ≤ UNL. 11. Men or women of child bearing potential should be using an effective method of contraception before entry into the study and throughout the same and for 6 months after ending the study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test before study entry. 12. Normal cardiac function with a LVEF ≥ 50% by echocardiogram or MUGA. 13. Disease distribution in lungs allows meeting with normal tissue constraints of radiation therapy. Radiation oncologist must confirm this point. 14. It should be performed HBV and HCV serologies prior to inclusion. If HbsAg is positive it is recommended to reject the existence of replicative phase (HbaAg+, DNA VHB+). If these were positives the inclusion is not recommended, remaining at investigators' discretion the preventive treatment with lamivudine. If a potential patient is positive for antiHCV antibodies, presence of the virus should be ruled out with a qualitative PCR, or the patient should NOT be included in the study (if a qualitative PCR cannot be performed then patient will not be able to enter the study) 15. Patient must have a Central Venous Catheter for treatment 1. Previous treatment with trabectedin or radiotherapy involving any lung field. 2. Performance status ≥ 2 (ECOG). 3. Metastases out of those located in lungs. 4. Plasma bilirubin &gt; UNL. 5. Creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL. 6.
