	<brief_title>Portal Vein Thrombosis in Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients newly diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis by imaging tests, that evaluate the extent and exclude tumoral origin, will be included (informed consent previously signed). Anticoagulant treatment will be initiated according to clinical guidelines (if there is no contraindication) first with LMWH (low molecular weight heparin) and later with dicoumarin. An abdominal CT will be performed to evaluate the extent and exclude tumoral origin; a gastroscopy to evaluate portal hypertension (and do prophylaxis if required) and thrombophilia study. Patients will be followed by imaging and laboratory tests every 6 months; to evaluate the response to the treatment and detect any cirrhosis complication.</detailed_description>
