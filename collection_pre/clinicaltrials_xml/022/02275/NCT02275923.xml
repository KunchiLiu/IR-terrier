	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of subcutaneous impedance measured with an implanted Medtronic Reveal LINQ™ insertable cardiac monitor for use as a fluid status monitor in hemodialysis patients. The study will measure the changes in subject subcutaneous impedance and compare with the fluid status assessed by the volume removed from the hemodialysis subject during dialysis sessions. Subcutaneous impedance trends will also be evaluated between dialysis sessions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who currently undergo inclinic hemodialysis treatment prescribed 2 or 3 times per week Patients willing to be implanted with the Reveal LINQ™ device Patients greater than 21 years of age Patients willing and able to comply with the study procedures including giving informed consent Patient has an active implanted cardiac medical device (e.g. IPG, ICD, CRT, etc) Patients who currently undergo home dialysis treatment Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study, without documented preapproval from a Medtronic study manager. Patient with a recent infection defined as 1) bacteremia within 60 days OR 2) (nonbacteremic) infection within 14 days Patient not suitable for Reveal LINQ™ implantation (e.g., severe cachexia, dermatologic conditions of the skin, or major medical or social conditions expected to reduce survival to &lt; 6 months), in the opinion of the investigator</criteria>
