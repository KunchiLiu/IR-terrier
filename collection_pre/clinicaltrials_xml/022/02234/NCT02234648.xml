	<brief_summary>Given the global health issues associated with poor cardiovascular function, interventions that help reduce the severity, with emphasis on prevention would not only have economic implications, but would also improve health, wellbeing and quality of life. Research provides evidence that consumption of a diet high in plant foods and rich is polyphenols is associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (Hung et al 2004). Tart Montmorency cherries have been shown to be high in numerous phytochemicals (Wang et al 1999; Seeram et al 2001). Several of these compounds, are known to be vasoactive and improve blood vessel function by increasing bioavailability of vasodilators (Mudnic et al 2012), reducing vasoconstrictors (Broncel et al 2010), decreasing platelet aggregation (Hubbart et al 2006) and increasing blood vessel dilation (Schroeter et al 2006). Impaired function of the lining of blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction) has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the bioavailability of all the compounds in Tart Montmorency Cherry Juice and their efficacy with respect to vascular function has not been fully determined. This study will examine the influence of tart Montmorency cherry juice on cardiovascular function, specifically arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity and blood flow in the microcirculation by laser Doppler imaging. This study will also examine digital volume pulse and pulse wave analysis. These data will provide information on the ability of TMCJ to affect blood flow and vascular function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Investigate the Effect of Tart Montmorency Cherry Juice (Prunus Cerasus) on Vascular Function.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants provided blood samples immediately before supplementation and sequentially 8h post ingestion. Additionally, vascular measurements including laser Doppler imaging (LDI), pulse wave analysis (PWA), pulse wave velocity (PWV), digital volume pulse (DVP) and blood pressure (BP) were performed with the participant in a supine position. LDI, PWV, PWA, and DVP were measured at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8h intervals. BP was performed at hourly intervals. All vascular measurements took place on the non - cannulated arm. No additional food or fluid was provided during the study period except for low-nitrate mineral water. Following a minimum of two weeks washout, the participants were required to return to the laboratory to repeat the procedure with the other intervention drink.</detailed_description>
