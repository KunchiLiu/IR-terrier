	<brief_summary>Background: Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA) and combat related war-trauma are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. PTSD is one of the most prevalent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) axis 1 disorders for which psychotherapy is widely practiced. Depression is one of the most common co morbid disorders when PTSD is diagnosed. Exposure to the traumatic memories or cues of the traumatic event often plays an important role in reducing symptoms of PTSD. Also symptoms of PTSD and depression have been related to a reduced specificity in autobiographical memory. Objective: This study will examine the efficacy of a Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) in a CSA and war related trauma sample by comparing it with treatment as usual (TAU). It will also attempt to develop protocols to implement this new technology into clinical practice and collect data to develop a treatment progress prediction model. Study design: A randomized controlled intervention study. Study population: 144 individuals with memories of CSA or war related trauma and symptoms of PTSD and/or depression. Intervention: VRET or TAU.</brief_summary>
