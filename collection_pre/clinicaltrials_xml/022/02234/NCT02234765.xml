	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is characterized by the manifestation of excessive sleepiness secondary to repeated obstruction of the upper airway during sleep and cognitive-behavioral, respiratory, cardiac, metabolic or inflammatory disorders. Epidemiological studies in our country have shown that OSA is a highly prevalent disease in the general population, affecting 2-4% of the adult population. The most important clinical manifestations of OSAS is a deterioration in the quality of life and an increase in cardiovascular disease. OSA is also associated with traffic accidents. Therefore, and considering the medical complications of OSA, as well as the sociolaboral impact and its negative impact on quality of life and survival; is stated that this disease is a public health problem that requires the physician to identify patients eligible to treatment. Moreover, it has been shown that undiagnosed patients, duplicate the consumption of health resources, comparing when the diagnosis and treatment has been established. Finally, we have a highly effective treatment using positive pressure in the upper airway (CPAP) that has been shown to be effective and cost-effective. The current situation in which all patients diagnosed with OSA and receiving different treatments are monitored and controlled by the Sleep Units (SU) is an oversized medicine specialist at the expense of primary care (PC). Our working hypothesis is: "By the coordination of actions at various levels including interactive training equipment AP, use the bilateral (SU-AP) of electronic medical records and the use of new technologies can be achieved in AP satisfactory management of the diagnostic and therapeutic process of patients with suspected OSA. Patients assisted in both areas have a level of clinical response, satisfaction, compliance and avoidance of complications, similar to that obtained with monitoring by SU. In addition, management by AP will be more cost-effective than in the SU."</brief_summary>
