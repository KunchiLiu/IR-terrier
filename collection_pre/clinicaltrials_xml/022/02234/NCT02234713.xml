	<brief_summary>Disease modifying therapies (DMT) are widely used for children and adolescents with MS. Nonetheless, many pediatric patients continue to relapse and therefore require changes in therapy. We designed this research study to learn more about medication use in children and adolescents with MS. We are also interested in learning what a behavioral feedback intervention can tell us about adherence to medicine. Finally, we hope this research project will inform the way we provide clinical care for children and adolescents with MS.</brief_summary>
