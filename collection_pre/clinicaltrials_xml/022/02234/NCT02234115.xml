	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate if Leuprolide Mesylate is safe and effective in the treatment of subjects with advanced prostate carcinoma, when administered as two injections six months apart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic Behavior of Leuprolide Mesylate in Subjects With Advanced Prostate Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study conducted in 2 parts. Part I was established to provide a vanguard of the first 30 subjects who will have more frequent monitoring of their safety. If safety is established, the remainder of the subjects will be entered into the clinical study (i.e., Part II). All subjects will be males with advanced prostate carcinoma judged to be candidates for medical androgen ablation therapy, and all will receive two injections of LMIS 50 mg six-month apart in an unblinded fashion.</detailed_description>
