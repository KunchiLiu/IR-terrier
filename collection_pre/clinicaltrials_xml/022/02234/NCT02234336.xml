	<brief_summary>Assessment of wall thickness in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is of diagnostic and prognostic importance given its known association with sudden cardiac death. However, data regarding comparison of imaging modalities for this key measurement is lacking. This study seeks to compare assessment of maximum wall thickness between clinically indicated echocardiography (with and without contrast) and clinically indicated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Clinically and echocardiographically defined hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 2. Clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiography as part of the medical evaluation. 3. No contradiction to administration of ultrasonic echocardiography contrast. 4. Planned clinically indicated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as part of medical evaluation. 5. No contraindication to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (such as cochlear implants, central nervous system aneurysm clips and other implanted medical devices). 6. Age 18 years and older 1) Insufficient image quality for determination of maximal wall thickness.</criteria>
