	<brief_summary>X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a humoral primary immunodeficiency in which affected patients have very low levels of peripheral B cells and a profound deficiency of all immunoglobulin isotypes. Mutations in the gene encoding for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) are responsible for most of the gammaglobulinemia. We tend to investigate the gene mutation and clinical features of Chinese X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) patients, and also examined the relationship between specific Btk gene mutations and severity of clinical presentation.</brief_summary>
