	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by a progressive destruction of insulin producing beta cells, resulting in a lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin. While beta cells make up less than 1% of the pancreas, studies have demonstrated that T1D is associated with a marked reduction of pancreatic mass at diagnosis and as the disease progresses. As such, if pancreatic volume assessment, by ultrasonography (US) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), could be utilized as a marker of beta cell function in high risk patients, non-invasive pancreatic imaging could become an important part of staging diabetes risk. As such, the primary goal of this study is to measure pancreatic volume and compare differences in volume between new onset T1D patients, antibody positive subjects at risk for diabetes, antibody negative individuals, and healthy controls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will have blood tests and two imaging tests. The blood tests will tell us how well the pancreas is working. The imaging tests will measure the volume of the pancreas. There is one study visit associated with this study. Blood will be drawn for 5 different blood tests. The participant cannot eat or drink for about 8 hours before the blood test (water is allowed). The blood will be sent to a lab. The amount of blood taken is equal to about 1 table spoon. Here are the blood tests that will be performed: 1. C-peptide - is used to measure the insulin being made by the cells in the pancreas. 2. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) - is a measure of blood sugar control over the last 2 to 3 months. 3. Serum trypsin - is used to measure exocrine pancreatic function. 4. Glucose - is used to measure the amount of blood sugar in your body. 5. Autoantibodies (diabetes related) - are proteins that are made by the body's immune system. They are a sign that the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin could be damaged. For the imaging procedures the participant cannot eat for at least 8 hours before the imaging procedure (water is okay). Your empty stomach will allow us to picture the pancreas better. 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a procedure that allows doctors to look inside the body by using a scanner that sends out a strong magnetic field and radio waves but involves no radiation exposure. 2. Ultrasound (US) is a device that consists of computer and a transducer that is used to scan the body. A transducer is a small hand-held device about the size of a bar of soap that is attached to the scanner by a cord. A lubricating gel is spread on the skin over the area being examined, and then the transducer is pressed firmly against the skin to obtain images. These imaging tests will allow us to measure the volume of your pancreas. You will not get any sedation for these tests. If you cannot tolerate the MRI, then we will only do the US.</detailed_description>
