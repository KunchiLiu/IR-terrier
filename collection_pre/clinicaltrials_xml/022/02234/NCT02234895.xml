	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread problem in Canada, leading to decreased quality of life and increased economic burden. Current research has focused on expensive, invasive treatments, whereas inexpensive conservative treatments have received less attention. One such treatment is the use of orthotics to reduce pain and increase function in people with knee OA. Currently, clinical practice guidelines for the use of orthotics are vague and contradictory, and could benefit from more research taking into account foot posture. This study aims to compare the use of two orthotics designs in people with knee OA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>i) age 50 80 years (to meet the American College of Rheumatology clinical definition of OA) ii) medial tibiofemoral OA, defined as medial knee pain on most days of the past month and evidence on radiographs of a definite osteophyte in the medial tibiofemoral compartment iii) pronated feet, defined as a foot posture index that is 0.5 standard deviations above the reported population mean. i) low pain score on a numerical rating scale of pain (average knee pain on walking â‰¤3 out of 10 over previous week) to allow detection of treatment response ii) knee surgery or intraarticular corticosteroid injection within the previous six months iii) current or recent (within 4 weeks) oral corticosteroid use iv) any muscular, joint or neurological condition affecting lower limb within the past 6 months v) ankle/foot pathology or pain that precludes the use of orthotics vi) current use of foot orthotics vii) use of footwear unable to accommodate an orthotic viii) unable to walk without a gait aid ix) inability to speak English or have a family member present to translate (required for the validity of the questionnaires)</criteria>
