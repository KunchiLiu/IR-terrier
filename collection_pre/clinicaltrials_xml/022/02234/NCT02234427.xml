	<detailed_description>In this clinical trials we will select individuals from GeneSTAR cohort based o their platelet function. Equal number of individuals will be selected from each race and gender and from low or high platelet aggregation. We will have baseline platelet functions performed and baseline platelet gene expression examined. Participants will be given 2-week supply of aspirin(81 mg/daily) and will be examined at the end of 2-weeks with platelet aggregation studies and a repeat platelet gene-expression (using RNA-seq). The ultimate goal is to examine platelet gene expression differences due to aspirin and across different gender, race, platelet-aggregation groups.</detailed_description>
