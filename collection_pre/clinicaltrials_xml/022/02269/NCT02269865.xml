	<brief_summary>Study to focus on the defining and managing the neuropsychological abnormalities of myotonic dystrophy and to find out if the neuropsychological abnormalities have any correlation with changes seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given the prevalence of DM, and assistance from The Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation (letter), we anticipate full recruitment of 8-17 year old subjects with DM1. The genetic counselor will help recruit 20 DM1 subjects, and 20 comparably aged controls, all of whom will complete MRI and neuropsychological tests. We anticipate full participation in evoked potential and blood tests, but estimate 30% will permit a lumbar puncture for CSF evaluation - done at the LPCH Ambulatory Procedure Unit with sedation as necessary. In total 40 MRIs will be done over 2 years, or 20 annually. Testing of Subjects All neuropsychological evaluations will be performed in the morning in attempt to standardize wakefulness and stamina. Dr. Day's assessment of clinical status (~45 min) utilizes the Stanford myotonic dystrophy questionnaire, the University of Rochester MDHI, and the muscular impairment rating scale (MIRS)57, and records vital signs, current medications, spirometer, and disease history and progression. Given the frequency of sleep disorders in DM, subjects will complete the Affiliated Sleep Questionnaire, an online collection of extensive information in standardized format (see letter Dr. Mignot). After the clinical and neuropsychological assessments the subject and family members will have lunch prior to the MRI(75 min). In the mid-afternoon subjects will have evoked potentials in the Electrodiagnostics Lab(~90 min) followed by a lumbar puncture (if consenting) and blood draw in the LPCH APU(90 min). Subjects return home the same day, and Ms. Paulose contacts them several days later for feedback.</detailed_description>
