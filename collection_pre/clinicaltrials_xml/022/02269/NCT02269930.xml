	<brief_summary>The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the cumulative area under the concentration time curve (AUC) over 2 weeks, as measured by AUC from time 0 to 336 hours post dose (AUC0-336h), for serum concentrations of BIIB017 and Rebif. The secondary outcomes are to evaluate the maximum observed serum concentrations (Cmax) of BIIB017 and Rebif and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB017 and Rebif over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
