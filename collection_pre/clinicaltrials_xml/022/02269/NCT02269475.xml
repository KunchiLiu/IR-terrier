	<brief_title>A Phase3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MEDI3250 in Healthy Japanese Children Age 7 Years Through 18 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study will enrol 1008 subjects. The study is designed to gather the efficacy, safety and tolerability data in Japanese children 7 through 18 years of age that would support approval of MEDI3250 in Japan. For children age 7 years through 18 years, the recommended dosage schedule for intranasal administration is 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril). For children age 7 years through 8 years not previously vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks. For the efficacy endpoint, data will be gathered on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness in the two treatment arms. Laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness would include cases of influenza diagnosed using culture-confirmation and/or PCR-based methods. For the safety and tolerability endpoint, data will be gathered on solicited symptoms, AEs and SAEs. Subject will be randomized 2:1 to receive MEDI3250 or placebo.</detailed_description>
