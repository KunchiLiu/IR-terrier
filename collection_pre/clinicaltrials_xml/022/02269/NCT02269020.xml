	<brief_summary>The main hypothesis of this study is that it is possible to make a unilateral selective dissection of ganglion levels IIa, III and IV using an endoscopic transaxillary approach via the da Vinci robotic system to reduce scarring, while respecting patient safety. Feasibility will be assessed by two combinded criteria: 1) performance of the surgical procedure respecting the different stages of visualization and dissection of key anatomical elements; 2) obtain a minimum of 9 lymph nodes when analyzing pathological evidence of the dissection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives include the following: A. Describe certain technical variables: surgical time, extent of blood loss, need for conversion to open surgery, anesthesia procedure used, the level of difficulty and speed associated with each surgical step, length of stay, B. Describe the pathological findings for each patient, C. Evaluate neurological complications (function of cranial nerve pairs X, XI, XII, brachial plexus, cervical sympathetic) D. Identify specific complications, E. Evaluate post-operative pain, F. Evaluate the scar outcome at 6 and 12 months G. Describe the oncological results at 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
