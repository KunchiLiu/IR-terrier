	<brief_summary>PRIMe is a prospective, case-only trial designed to measure the impact of MammaPrint on physician chemotherapy intention in the two discordant groups (ET/POOR, CT/GOOD) in stage 1 and 2 HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer patients. The design also provides for assessment of several important secondary indicators. Eligible patients will have their tumor sample analyzed for MammaPrint, BluePrint and TargetPrint. Patients cannot start treatment before the MammaPrint result is received and taken into consideration for the adjuvant treatment plan.</brief_summary>
