	<brief_title>Mealtime Symptoms in Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, basic training programs do not adequately teach nursing home (NH) staff to handle behavioral symptoms at mealtime that typically accompany dementia. When persons with dementia (PWD) exhibit mealtime symptoms (e.g. turning away of the head, pushing food away), these symptoms may be interpreted as lack of interest in eating, and feeding attempts ceased. This misinterpretation poses serious health risks to PWD including under-nutrition and increased risk for more aggressive medical treatment (e.g. feeding tube). The Aims of this study are to: 1) Identify the adaptive leadership challenges of NH staff for alleviating mealtime symptoms for PWD; 2) Determine NH staff evaluation of a dementia feeding skills training program that combines adaptive leadership approaches with technical approaches to mealtime symptoms; and 3) Conduct a 12-week feasibility study implementing this dementia feeding skills training program with NH staff, linking training to resident outcomes. Focus groups will be conducted in four NHs during which NH staff will describe adaptive challenges around: mealtime symptom recognition, communication patterns, typical responses to mealtime symptoms, and feelings when interventions are met with success or failure. Focus group interviews will be transcribed and content analysis conducted. Findings from the focus group interviews will be used to revise a dementia feeding skills program. The revised training program will be evaluated by NH staff to determine how NH staff perceives the coaching intervention, and if case scenarios are realistic and compatible with current workplace practices. The training program will be implemented in two skilled NHs over a five week period. NH staff outcomes include mealtime knowledge and self-efficacy. Through meal observations, NH staff will be assessed for time spent assisting with feeding and feeding skill behaviors; and PWD outcomes assessed by quantifying meal intake and aversive feeding behaviors. Findings from this study will describe adaptive leadership challenges for NH staff, revise and implement a training program teaching NH staff adaptive and technical interventions for alleviating mealtime symptoms for PWD in the NH setting.</detailed_description>
