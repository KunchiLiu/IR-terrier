	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-486 in previously treated subjects with locally advanced or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma having failed one to two previous regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Approximately 51-55 subjects will be enrolled according to a Simon two-stage design; if the predefined activity is met (&gt;4 responses [complete response; partial response {CR/PR}] out of the first 17 evaluable subjects based on independent radiological assessment), then the study will continue to enroll an additional 34 subjects. If &lt; or = 4 responses out of 17 are observed, then the study enrollment will be stopped.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age = or &gt; 18 years Histological or cytological diagnosis of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma that is locally advanced or metastatic. Disease progression either clinically or radiographically after 12 previous regimens. Patient has received a platinum containing regimen. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02. Radiographicallydocumented measureable disease. Adequate organ and bone marrow functions. Willingness to follow pregnancy precautions. History of, or current brain metastasis. Any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization with the exception of adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, uteri, or nonmelanomatous skin cancer (all treatment of which should have been completed 6 months prior to enrollment), in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the breast, or incidental prostate cancer. Previous treatment with azacitidine (any formulation), decitabine, any other hypomethylating agent. History of Gastrointestinal disorder or defect. Impaired ability to swallow oral medication. Persistent diarrhea or malabsorption. Active cardiac disease and HIV infection Active Bleeding; Pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding; risk of pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery and carotid blowout syndrome. Major surgery within 14 days prior to starting Investigational Product or has not recovered from major side effects. Another investigational therapy within 28 days or 5 half lives of randomization/enrollment, whichever is shorter. Patient has not recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior anticancer therapy, radiation, or major surgery/significant trauma. Radiotherapy &lt; or = 4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation &lt; or = 2 weeks prior to starting with the investigational product. Pregnancy/Breast feeding Any condition that places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.</criteria>
