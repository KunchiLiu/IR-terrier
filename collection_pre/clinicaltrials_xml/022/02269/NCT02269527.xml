	<brief_title>Effects of an Live Music on the Perception of Noise in the SICU: A Patient, Caregiver, and Medical Staff Environmental Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we are looking at the effect of the live music provided by a trained music therapist, created through incorporating the noises in the SICU - such as the beeping of the machines as part of the elements in the music, to organize the sound environment as well as introducing familiar songs, chosen according to the cultures and ages of the patients, caregivers and staff, to increase a sense of familiarity and comfort. Through the intervention, we hope to ameliorate the sound environment, which may reduce the stress level of the staff and increase their acuity level while decrease patients and caregivers' anxiety level and improve their mood state and the quality of hospitalization</detailed_description>
