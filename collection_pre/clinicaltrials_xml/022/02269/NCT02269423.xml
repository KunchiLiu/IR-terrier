	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to assess whether this vaccine is safe, and if it causes the body to create an infection-fighting response. Between 1994 and the present, there have been many Ebola virus outbreaks caused by 4 different strains of the virus, affecting mostly people living in central Africa and the health care providers trying to treat them. Ebola viruses are members of the filoviridae virus family, which also includes the dangerous Marburg virus. Ebola virus causes severe and often deadly infection called a viral hemorrhagic fever, characterized by organ failure, bleeding, and death. To date, the virus is found primarily in Central and West Africa. It is not clear where these viruses come from, but it is thought that bats are the most likely source of the human outbreaks that occur. Once an outbreak occurs, the virus is spread from person to person through direct contact with infected blood or body fluids with and infected individual. Given the recent increase in Ebola virus infections occurring in Africa, there is interest in making an effective vaccine to protect against the infection.. BPSC-1001 is an experimental Ebola vaccine candidate demonstrating protection against Ebola virus in animal experiments. This phase 1 protocol provides a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of BPSC-1001 in healthy adult participants. Participants will be randomized to receive BPSC-1001 or Placebo by intramuscular injection. Three dose levels will be assessed with follow-up visits through 180 days after the injection.</detailed_description>

This would include a known hemoglobinopathy or coagulation abnormality. Any baseline laboratory screening tests which is outside of acceptable range as defined in the protocol.: alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, total white blood cell count, urine protein, urine occult blood, urine glucose Any serologic evidence of hepatitis B or C infection Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including HIV infection, cytotoxic therapy in the previous 5 years, and/or diabetes Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including migraines, seizures, and epilepsy, excluding a single febrile seizure as a child Have an active malignancy or history of metastatic or hematologic malignancy Suspected or known alcohol and/or illicit drug abuse within the past 5 years Moderate or severe illness and/or fever &gt;100.4F within one week prior to vaccination Pregnant or lactating female, or female who intends to become pregnant during the study period Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 120 days preceding study entry or planned administration during the study period History of blood donation within 60 days of enrollment or plans to donate within the study period Administration of chronic (defined as more than 14 days) immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs within 6 months of study entry. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day, Intranasal and topical steroids are allowed) Unwilling to allow storage and use of blood for future vaccine research Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the investigator would increase the risk of the individual having an adverse outcome from participating in this study</criteria>
