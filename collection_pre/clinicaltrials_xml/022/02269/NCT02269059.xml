	<brief_summary>This is a two-part dose-finding trial of MK-7680 in participants with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection of genotype (GT)1 (Part I) and GT3 (Part 2). The primary hypothesis is that daily administration of a safe and well tolerated dose of MK-7680 will produce a decrease in HCV viral load.</brief_summary>
