	<brief_summary>The purpose of Part I of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) doses of MK-2640 in healthy participants and to obtain preliminary plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of MK-2640. The purpose of Parts II and III of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV doses of MK-2640 and regular human insulin (RHI), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of MK-2640 and RHI in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Part II will be initiated only if Part I general safety, tolerability and other observed data are supportive of progression to Part II. Part III will be initiated only if Parts I and II general safety, tolerability and other observed data are supportive of progression to Part III.</brief_summary>
