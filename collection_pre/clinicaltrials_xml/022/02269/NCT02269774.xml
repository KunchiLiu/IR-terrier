	<brief_summary>There is accumulating evidence for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as an independent risk factor for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and for high recurrence rates of atrial fibrillation after ablation therapy. We have previously shown that simulated OSA triggers premature atrial beats (PABs) by acute changes in intra-thoracic pressure. Most episodes of atrial fibrillation are initiated by PABs. However, the origin of PABs induced by intra-thoracic pressure swings is unknown. This study investigates the origin of premature atrial beats induced by intra-thoracic pressure changes that simulate obstructive sleep apnea in patients with atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
