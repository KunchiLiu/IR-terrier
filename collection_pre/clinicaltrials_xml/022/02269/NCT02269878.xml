	<brief_summary>To Study the Effect of Polymorphisms in Fas Ligand Gene Promoter Region (rs 763110) and Fas gene (rs1800682) on Platinum-Based regimens used in treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of FAS and FAS Ligand Polymorphisms on Patients With Platinum-Based -Treated Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study tries to find a correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) found in promoter region of Fas Ligand gene (rs 763110) and Fas (rs1800682) and clinical outcome on patients with MPM treated with platinum-Based agents as first line. the patients will have one of three following genotypes : Thymine/Thymine, Thymine/Cytosine or Cytosine/Cytosine (for Fas ligand polymorphism) and Adenine/Adenine, Adenine/Guanine or Guanine/Guanine ( for Fas polymorphism).</detailed_description>
