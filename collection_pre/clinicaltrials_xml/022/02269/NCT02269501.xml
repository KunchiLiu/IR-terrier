	<brief_title>Exercise in Migraine and Co-existing Tension-type Headache and Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine and tension-type headache are among the most common neurological diseases and are causing reduced quality of life, private and socio-economic consequences in terms of medical consumption and work-related absenteeism. The clinical experience shows that physical activity, like cycling and brisk walking, can prevent migraine attacks, but the evidence of the efficacy is sparse. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the acute and the long term effect of exercise on patients suffering from migraine and co-existing TTH and neck pain. The project will be the first of its kind that explores the effect of an exercise program on patients who both suffer from migraine, tension-type headache and neck pain. We expect that the participants from the exercise program will achieve a reduced pain impact on everyday life, an improved fitness and quality of life, and a decrease of absence days and medication use.</detailed_description>
