	<brief_summary>A 4 week prospective, randomized controlled study was carried out to assess the impact of a care delivery intervention which focused on blood glucose (BG) management among adults with type 2 diabetes presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with BG &gt; 200mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). The intervention was designed by a multi-disciplinary team of ED physicians and nurses, endocrinologists and diabetes educators. The intervention incorporated three components: a guideline-based algorithm for diabetes medication management; survival skills diabetes self-management education (DSME); and support for health system navigation. The control group received usual care per the ED's policies and procedures for management of high blood glucose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Synergy to Control Emergency Department Hyperglycemia Program for Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We evaluated a concise diabetes care delivery intervention designed to advance glycemic medications and deliver diabetes self-management education (DSME) among adults with type 2 diabetes presenting to the emergency department (ED) with uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The primary hypothesis was that there would be improvement in HbA1c. A 4 week, randomized controlled trial provided algorithm-based antihyperglycemic medications management, survival skills DSME and navigation to primary care for ED patients with BG &gt; 200mg/dL. Medications were titrated and DSME delivered by endocrinologist-supervised certified diabetes educators. Controls received usual care.</detailed_description>
