	<brief_summary>Vulvovaginal irritation due to dryness is a frequent complaint among post- and some premenopausal women. International guidelines recommend non-hormonal products as first line therapy. Efficacy and safety of the medical device Vagisan® Moisturising Cream (VMC), a non-hormonal vaginal cream for the treatment of vulvovaginal dryness and Gynomunal Vaginal Gel (GVG), a non-hormonal gel should be compared in a 12-week multicentre, open-label, randomised, two-period cross-over phase III trial. The hypothesis was that VMC is non-inferior to GVG. The primary endpoint was the sum of subjective symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) added up over each treatment period. Furthermore, objective symptoms of VVA and adverse effects were planned to be assessed. 120 women should be randomly allocated to either of the two treatments, each given over a period of 4 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study was to test the non-inferiority of the medical device Vagisan® Moisturising Cream (VMC) in comparison to Gynomunal® vaginal gel (GVG) in 6 centres in 120 women who suffered from "vaginal dryness". The main objective criterion was to compare the sum of 4 subjective symptoms of "vaginal dryness" measured daily over a period of 28 days. VMC should be applied daily, while GVG had to be administered daily during the first week and twice weekly thereafter. The main objective parameter for efficacy analysis was the sum of the subjective symptoms of vaginal dryness (feeling of dryness, itching, burning sensation and pain) before, during (patient diaries) and after the 28-day therapy period. The per-protocol analysis and of the intent-to-treat analysis should prove non-inferiority of VMC compared to GVG, despite a possible carry-over effect to the detriment of VMC. To avoid the problem of any possible carry-over effect the analysis of the first period was chosen for the primary comparison of both products. Furthermore, objective symptoms of vaginal dryness detected via colposcopy, the vaginal secretion's pH, the efficacy assessment by the patients and the treating doctor and patients' questionnaires with regard to the product characteristics of the medical devices should be evaluated.</detailed_description>
