	<brief_summary>There is emerging research detailing the relationship between balance/gait/falls and cognition. Imaging studies also suggest a link between structural and functional changes in the frontal lobe (a region commonly associated with cognitive function) and mobility. People with Parkinson's disease have important changes in cognitive function that may impact rehabilitation efficacy. Our underlying hypothesis is that cognitive function and frontal lobe connections with the basal ganglia and brainstem posture/locomotor centers are responsible for postural deficits in people with Parkinson's disease and play a role in rehabilitation efficacy. The purpose of this study is to 1) determine if people with Parkinson's disease can improve mobility and/or cognition after partaking in a cognitively challenging mobility exercise program and 2) determine if cognition and brain circuitry deficits predict responsiveness to exercise rehabilitation. Design: This study is a randomized cross-over controlled intervention to take place at a University Balance Disorders Laboratory. The study participants will be people with Parkinson's disease who meet inclusion criteria for the study. The intervention will be 6 weeks of group exercise (case) and 6 weeks of group education (control). The exercise is a cognitively challenging program based on the Agility Boot Camp for people with PD. The education program is a 6-week program to teach people how to better live with a chronic disease. The primary outcome measure is the MiniBESTest and the secondary outcomes are measures of mobility, cognition and neural imaging. Discussion: The results from this study will further our understanding of the relationship between cognition and mobility with a focus on brain circuitry as it relates to rehabilitation potential.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Aged 5090 years old. No musculoskeletal or peripheral or central nervous system disorders (other than idiopathic Parkinson disease (iPD) or parkinsonism) that could significantly affect balance or gait . Capable of following directions. iPD subjects: UK Brain Bank criteria, i.e., bradykinesia and at least one of the following: rest tremor, muscular rigidity, and postural instability not cause by visual, vestibular, cerebellar or proprioceptive dysfunction. Unilateral onset, response to levodopa. Parkinsonism subjects: Gait characterized by slow short steps, shuffling gait and may be widebased, with FoG, postural instability. Exclusion criteria: Inability to stand or walk for 2 min without an assistive device Recent changes in medication Excessive use of alcohol or recreational drugs, Contraindications to MRI scans (eg, claustrophobia, metal in body) Intervention subjects will be excluded if: 1) participating in a vigorous exercise program more than 2 x/week, 2) A medical condition that contraindicates exercise participation. Parkinsonism subjects: iPD and Parkinson plus syndromes such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multiple System Atrophy, Corticobasal Syndrome, or Cerebellar Ataxia. Idiopathic PD subjects: Same as above and deep brain stimulation electrodes. Significant tremor that would interfere withMRI scan. Control subjects: Will be matched for age and gender to iPD and parkinsonism groups.</criteria>
