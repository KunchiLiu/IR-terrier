	<brief_title>A Study of BBI608 in Combination With Standard Chemotherapies in Adult Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, multi-center, multi-arm, dose-escalation study of BBI608 administered in combination with either Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin. A study cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in combination with Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin. Combination treatment will continue in 28 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or another discontinuation criterion is met. BBI608 may be continued post-progression if the patient is obtaining potential clinical benefit, in the opinion of the investigator. If administration of Gemcitabine and/or nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin is discontinued due to chemotherapy backbone-related toxicities, the administration of BBI608 can be continued.</detailed_description>

Patients enrolling onto Arm A (Gemcitabine and nabPaclitaxel) or Arm B (mFOLFIRINOX) are allowed to have up to two prior lines of systemic therapy, with adjuvant therapy counted as one line of therapy as long as disease recurrence occurred &gt; 6 months of last dose of therapy. Prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting is allowed for as long as the therapy contained BBI608 in combination with either Gemcitabine and nabPaclitaxel or mFOLFIRINOX. Toxicities related to prior therapy must have completely resolved (except for alopecia and anemia), or be deemed irreversible. 1. Patients who received Gemcitabinebased therapy in an adjuvant setting will be allowed to be enrolled on Arm A of the trial (Gemcitabine with nabPaclitaxel) as long as their last Gemcitabine administration was at least 6 months prior to the first dose of BBI608. 2.

Patients enrolling onto Arm C (FOLFIRI) or Arm D (MM398 with 5FU and leucovorin) must have failed one prior line of gemcitabinebased therapy with or without BBI608 in the metastatic setting. No additional lines of therapy in the metastatic setting are allowed. Prior adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine is allowed as long as disease recurrence occurred &gt; 6 months of last dose of therapy.

Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1. 8.

Patients with biliary or gastroduodenal obstruction must have drainage or surgical bypass prior to starting chemotherapy. 11. Significant or symptomatic amount of ascites should be drained prior to first dose of BBI608. 12. Patients on Warfarin/Dabigatran/Rivaroxaban anticoagulation may be enrolled for as long as they undergo weekly INR checks for the first 2 months of therapy. a. Patients who switch to low molecular weight heparin may be enrolled and weekly INR labs are not mandated for these patients. 13. Aspartate transaminase (AST) level ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). For patients with liver metastases, AST ≤ 5 ULN, and AST ≤ 5 ULN may be enrolled if agreed upon by the investigator and medical monitor for the sponsor. 14. Patients must have a total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 2 x ULN if it is nonrising for a period of 10 days prior to initiation of therapy). 15.
