	<brief_summary>This observational study aims to monitor the vital sign changes in both mother and baby that occur during kangaroo care in preterm infants and to investigate any potential correlations between maternal measurement values and those of the infant. The purpose of this observational study is to look for a method to track the earliest responses that could, theoretically, be considered as 'social responses' in hopes of providing developmental interventions earlier to at-risk infants.</brief_summary>
