	<brief_summary>Background: - About 17 million adults had an alcohol use disorder in 2012. Researchers want to follow people that have alcohol problems and want treatment, as well as those who do not want treatment and healthy volunteers. They also want to gather information on people with and without alcohol problems, including information on genes and biological processes in the body.. This will help them better understand, prevent, and treat alcohol problems. Objective: -To look at a broad range of traits in people who are healthy people and people with alcohol problems. To study them for potential eligibility for other research protocols conducted at the NIH Clinical Center. Eligibility: - Adults age 18 and older. - Not being pregnant or imprisoned. Design: - Participants will have a physical exam. They will answer questions about their health and alcohol and drug use. They will have an electrocardiogram to check their heart. They will have blood, urine, and breath alcohol tests. - Participants without alcohol problems, or who have them but do not want treatment, can sign the second consent for screening and research. - Participants that have alcohol problems and want treatment will be treated at the NIH Clinical Center. They will be offered to sign the second consent at a later time. - Participants may join an inpatient treatment and detox program. It could last up to 6 weeks. Or they may join an outpatient program. Some may do both. - After discharge, participants may be called and asked questions about their drinking and health. - If participants sign the second consent, they: - will complete paper- and computer-based questionnaires. - will give blood samples. - may have a brain scan using magnetic resonance imaging. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder that takes pictures. The machine makes loud noises. They will get earplugs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study represents the natural history protocol for NIAAA with the main objectives of providing assessment, clinical care, evaluation, characterization and screening. The specific goals of this protocol are the following: - To provide clinical care, including but not limited to medically assisted withdrawal from alcohol ( detoxification ), as well as standard behavioral and/or pharmacological therapies where indicated to those who wish to receive treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUD) and related clinical conditions. - To gather characterization measures for individuals wishing to participate in this protocol and in future NIH protocols (for which this protocol serves as the screening protocol), including a standardized set of clinical, behavioral, biochemical and structural MRI-based phenotypic assessments, as well as whole genome genotypes - To screen and evaluate individuals wishing to participate in NIH clinical protocols (both those providing treatment and those that do not provide treatment for AUD) for which the present protocol serves as the screening platform. Participants may be individuals with no current or past AUD, as well as individuals who meet current or past DSM criteria for AUD. Healthy volunteers and other volunteers will also be enrolled in this protocol. - Finally, this protocol may also serve for training purposes, as it may provide opportunities for training of fellows and other staff members of the NIAAA Clinical Programs. We will collect information including such items as psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms, biomarkers of liver and other organ damage, quantitative alcohol use history, other substance use, and family history of alcoholism. Using this information, investigators will be able to clinically manage any disorders in need of clinical attention, and determine whether subjects are eligible for any NIH research studies (for which this protocol serves as the screening platform) based on results of screening evaluations and the participants interest in receiving treatment for AUD. We will also acquire whole genome data, with which investigators will be able to examine the relationship between genetic variation and alcohol-related phenotypes. Consenting for this protocol will be a two-step process. The first consent (named Clinical Management Consent) will allow Investigators to assess the acute needs and provide appropriate clinical care. The second consent (named Screening and Research Consent) will allow Investigators to conduct screening and research data collection and analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any individual with greater than or equal to 18 years of age who expressed interest in participating in this study and/or other research studies offered at NIAAA during the brief telephone prescreening may be enrolled. Age is verified at the NIH Clinical Center (CC) Admissions team at the time the patient signs the NIH Clinical Center General Admission Consent. This is standard operating procedure at the NIH CC for both outpatient and inpatient participants. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Given that this is a screening protocol, there are no exclusion criteria per se that apply after a participant signs the Clinical Management consent. In fact, we will evaluate participants (including medical and psychiatric evaluations) only after the firststep Clinical Management Consent form is signed. However, potential participants are prescreened on the phone and, based on the information provided on the phone, the following categories are excluded because they are not suitable study participants: Women who are pregnant Individuals &lt; 18 years of age Prisoners It is important to keep in mind that after participants sign the consent, new information may be made available during the study that can lead the Investigators to withdraw a participant. For example, a participant may have a positive pregnancy test (i.e., she was not aware or did not report during the telephone prescreening). In this case, the participant will be referred to appropriate care that can best manage and followup with their specific clinical needs. Another scenario may be that a participant may be arrested during their participation in the study based on new found information obtained by proper authorities (including NIH Police); in this case, a member of the NIH Clinical Center Social Worker Department will be notified. Finally, at the time of the consent process, those participants who are unable to complete all of the questions in the NIDA/NIAAA Evaluation of Potential Research Participants Ability to Consent will not be enrolled (i.e., they will not sign the consent form) and will be referred for appropriate care.</criteria>
