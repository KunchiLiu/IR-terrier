	<detailed_description>In 50 Patients who are undergoing a planned surgical procedure which require a central venous catheter the diameter of the subclavian vein is measured by ultrasound under 6 different conditions. The conditions are 1. neutral positioning, PEEP 0 cm H2O, 2. neutral positioning, PEEP 5cm H2O, 3. neutral positioning, PEEP 10cm H2O, 4. Trendelenburg positioning -20°, PEEP 0 cmH2O, 5. Trendelenburg positioning -20°, PEEP 5 cmH2O, 6. Trendelenburg positioning -20°, PEEP 10 cmH2O After these measurements a central venous catheter is used to measure the central venous pressure.</detailed_description>
