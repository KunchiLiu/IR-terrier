	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to test SAGIT (Signs and symptoms - Associated comorbidities - GH concentration level - IGF-1 - Tumour). SAGIT is a Clinician-Reported Outcomes (ClinROs) tool developed to describe patients with acromegaly. This study will determine the potential use of a finalised operational version for patient classification in clinical practice and studies. In addition, this study intends to carry out a qualitative evaluation of the acceptability of SAGIT by the practicing endocrinologist in terms of relevance, ease of use, applicability and usefulness of the tool in practice.</brief_summary>
