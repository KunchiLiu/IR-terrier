	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Relative Bioavailability of Orally Administered JNJ-42756493 Tablet Versus JNJ-42756493 Capsule in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), 2 way crossover (method used to switch participants from one study group change to treatment group), single-dose study in healthy participants. The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening Phase (Day -21 to Day -2), Treatment Phase (consists of 2 single-dose treatment period, either JNJ-42756493 capsule or JNJ-42756493 tablet) and Follow-up Phase (12-14 days after last dose). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences to ensure that they receive both of the treatments, 1 in each period. Each treatment regimen will be separated by a washout period of at least 15 days. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative bioavailability of two dosage form of JNJ-42756493 (test and reference) will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

Retesting of abnormal lab values that may lead to exclusion will be allowed once</criteria>
