	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg and Temozolomide in patients with progressive gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) graded as G1 or G2 (G1/G2). All progressive tumours classified according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST, 1.1).</brief_summary>
