	<brief_summary>Ideally, the postoperative inflammatory response is part of a well-orchestrated mechanism that contributes to tissue healing and rapid recovery. An exaggerated uncontrolled inflammatory response, however may lead to catabolism, tissue damage and organ failure. Omega-3 fatty acids may provide a means to alter cellular immune responses to the benefit of the patient. When omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into membranes of inflammatory cells, they trigger intracellular signalling pathways that result in a less pro-inflammatory response. They modify gene and protein expression, modulate membrane protein activity and act as a reservoir for bioactive molecules. They also have a strong anti-inflammatory effect by mediating resolution of the inflammation. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids improve erythrocyte function, which is vital for an adequate microcirculation, tissue oxygenation and wound healing. The investigators hypothesize that the perioperative administration of intravenous omega-3 fatty acids results in a rapid incorporation in immune cells and erythrocytes, thereby reducing the postoperative inflammatory response and improving erythrocyte function in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.</brief_summary>
