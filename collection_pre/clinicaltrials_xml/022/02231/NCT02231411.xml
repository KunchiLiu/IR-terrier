	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether providing ventilation during delayed umbilical cord clamping provides greater placental transfusion and improved hemodynamic transition at birth.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive 1 minute of delayed cord clamping in both arms. One arm will receive routine care, warm dry and stimulate during the 1 minutes transfusion. The second arm will receive routine care PLUS administration of CPAP and if need positive pressure ventilation. The outcome is to determine whether the addition of ventilation provides a larger placental transfusion and a smoother transition at birth.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Gestational Age: Women admitted 23+0 to 31+6 weeks (Reason: Highest risk for IVH) Gestational Age: Parents decline consent (Reason: Can only perform intervention at time of delivery) Congenital anomalies of newborn (Reason: Exclude the effect of abnormal hematological function) Placental abruption (Reason: Exclude pregnancies at risk for hemorrhage at the time of delivery) Twin to twin transfusion (Reason: Exclude possible loss of blood from other twin during delayed cord clamping) Placenta Accreta Prolonged premature rupture of membranes (&gt; 2 weeks) prior to 23 weeks gestation</criteria>
