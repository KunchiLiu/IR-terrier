	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one the most commonly encountered conditions in a daily outpatient Hepatology clinic. Secondly our country is the diabetic capital of the world and so the incidence of NAFLD (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) is expected to rise in the future. It is a spectrum of hepatic pathology, ranging from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, to cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more advanced form of disease where steatosis is accompanied by hepatocyte injury as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells. Approximately 10-20% of patients with NASH may progress to cirrhosis. NASH is felt to be a major etiology of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Around 6230 human studies out of which 49 RCTs have been done till date to define the appropriate treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. However, still a controversy and no recommended treatment available till date. Recently published PIVENS trial has shown that Vitamin E has proven benefit in NASH. Other trials have also shown that pentoxiphylline has shown benefit in the form of histological improvement and biochemical improvement in the form of liver enzymes. Role of SAMe has been studied in alcoholic liver disease and showed to improve in both biochemical and histological features. However the usefulness of SAMe in NAFLD is not known till now. Hence this study has been designed.</brief_summary>
