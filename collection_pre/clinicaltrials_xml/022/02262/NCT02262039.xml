	<brief_title>Reducing Operative and Post-operative Morbidity in Living Kidney Donors With the Airseal System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis is that Airseal Insufflation System will provide reduced mean operative insufflation pressure and operative mean ETCO2, resulting in improved post-operative pain control and improved operative safety. The Airseal System has demonstrated decreased variability in intra-abdominal pressure, less post-operative shoulder pain, lower mean ETCO2 and reduced narcotic pain administration. These metrics have been demonstrated in human subjects undergoing gynecologic, urologic and bariatric procedures. The established benefits in a human model provide a foundation for translating this technology to living kidney donors. The advantage lies in the ability to improve pain-related outcomes in this population, which translates into increased living donation; the single solution to reduce mortality for patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease.</detailed_description>
