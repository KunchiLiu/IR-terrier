	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the drug-drug interaction between VX-787 and oseltamivir, when co-administered at steady-state in healthy participants. In addition the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of VX-787 will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Drug-Drug Interaction Between VX-787 and Oseltamivir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving), randomized (treatment group assigned by chance), 3-way crossover (a method used to switch participants from one treatment group to another in a clinical trial) study to estimate drug-drug interaction between VX-787 and oseltamivir. It consists of 3 phases: a Screening phase, a Treatment phase and a Follow-up phase. Treatment phase will include 3 treatment sessions, each of the participant will receive Treatment A (VX-787, 600 milligram [mg] 2 times a day on Day 1 to 4, followed by a single dose of VX 787, 600 mg on Day 5); Treatment B (Oseltamivir, 75 mg 2 times a day on Day 1 to 4, followed by a single dose of oseltamivir 75 mg on Day 5) and Treatment C (VX-787, 600 mg 2 times a day + oseltamivir, 75 mg 2 times a day on Day 1 to 4, followed by a single dose of VX-787, 600 mg + a single dose of oseltamivir, 75 mg on Day 5). Each treatment session will be separated by a wash-out period of 5 days. The order each participant will receive treatments A, B and C will be decided at randomization. Part 2 is double-blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the subjects is receiving), randomized, placebo-controlled. It consists of 3 phases: a Screening phase, a Treatment phase and a Follow-up phase. In Treatment phase participants will be randomly assigned VX-787, 600 mg or placebo 2 times a day, on Day 1 to 9, followed by a single dose of VX-787 600 mg or placebo in the morning on Day 10. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female participants must be of nonchildbearing potential: postmenopausal for at least 2 years (amenorrheal for at least 3 years and a serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level greater than [&gt;] 40 international unit per liter [IU/L]), or surgically sterile (have had a total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clips without reversal operation), or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant Participants must be nonsmoking or smoking no more than 10 cigarettes, or 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day for at least 3 months prior to screening Participants must have a Body Mass Index (BMI: weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per meter square [kg/m^2] Participants must be willing/able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the protocol and study procedures Participants must be healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the absence of any clinically significant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical history, vital signs and the results of blood biochemistry, blood coagulation and hematology test and a urinalysis performed at screening Participants with a past history of heart arrhythmias (for example, extrasystoli, tachycardia at rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (for example, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome) Participants with a history or evidence of use of alcohol, barbiturates, amphetamines, recreational or narcotic drug use within the past 1 year, which in the Investigator's opinion would compromise participant's safety and/or compliance with the study procedures Participants with current hepatitis A infection (confirmed by hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B infection (confirmed by hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]), or hepatitis C infection (confirmed by hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody), or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) or HIV2 infection at study screening Participants having a positive urine drug test or alcohol breath test at study screening. Urine will be tested for the presence of amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opioids, methadone and barbiturates Participants with known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to VX787, oseltamivir, or excipients of the drug products used</criteria>
