	<brief_summary>This study will help researchers learn about the best dose of radiation to be used when treating large early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a treatment called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Current treatments with SABR for early stage NSCLC show positive response. But, for large early stage NSCLC it may be better to give different SABR doses than what is used in routine early stage NSCLC treatment. It is not understood which dose is best for treating large early stage NSCLC. Therefore, this study can help researchers learn if giving a higher dose using SABR over a period of 5-10 treatment days can increase the chance of cure for large early stage NSCLC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment Plan: 7.5 Gy x 10 daily fractions delivered with VMAT or regular IMRT. - Optional schedule of 12 Gy x 5 daily fractions can may also be used ONLY in situations where dose constraints for organs at risk can be EASILY met while optimal PTV coverage is achieved; but the 7.5 Gy x 10 daily fractions schedule is preferred. - All doses are prescribed to the tumor periphery. For this protocol, patients will be followed only up to 2 years post radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
