	<brief_title>Evaluate the Interest of the Pre-conceptional Endometrial Immune Profiling to Increase Birth Rates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Birth rates following an embryo transfer with a mean of two embryos transferred stagnate around 23% per transfer (annual report of the Agency of Biomedicine). Some estimates that half of infertile patients treated are partially or totally concerned by problem of inadequate uterine receptivity. The investigators' hypothesis is that a pre-conceptional immune endometrial evaluation may increase significantly birth rates since successful implantation results from both the matching of a competent embryo within a competent endometrium. The identification of endometrial biomarkers documenting the immune uterine environment during the implantation window would be able to improve the efficacy of ART through a personalization of treatment accordingly to the ability of the patients to receive their embryos. All patients with all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be included. Only patients with a deregulation (immune analysis) will be randomized.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Infertile patients will be included at the beginning of their medical care in reproduction once the indication to perform either an IVF with or without ICSI has been established. The indication for IVF will be: tubal infertility, endometriosis, ovarian dysovulation with failure of intrauterine insemination, idiopathic infertility The indication for ICSI will be: male infertility (oligoasthenoteratospermia), previous failure of oocytes fertilization in IVF Patients should be younger than 38 years old (Age &lt; 38) with a normal ovarian reserve (AMH&gt;1.5ng/ml, FSH&lt;10 IU/l on day3, antral follicles count (AFC) over 6 on day3 of the cycle by ultrasound) The range of the IVF or ICSI attempt should be lower than 3 or equal at 2 (first or second IVF/ICSI). If a live birth occurred in the past by IVF/ICSI, the range of the new attempt is 1. With a signed informed and consent form With medical insurance Azoospermia or cryptozoospermia (Patient's partner) IVF/ICSI attempt scheduled in another ART unit Contraindication to any experimental treatment (Cortancyl, Intralipids, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Maternal serology positive for hepatite C or B</criteria>
