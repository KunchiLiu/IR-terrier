	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that PF-06649751 with continuous co-administration of trimethobenzamide hydrochloride (TMB) with will be safe and well tolerated. Single doses of PF-06649751 will be tested in this study, starting at a low dose and escalating to a dose projected to be under the current limits for drug concentration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of PF-06649751 Co-administered With Trimethobenzamide Hydrochloride in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>

	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female subjects of non childbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing). Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever is longer). Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
