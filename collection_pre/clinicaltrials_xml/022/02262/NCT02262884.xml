	<brief_title>SurgiQuest AirSeal in Robotic Partial Nephrectomy - (TARPAN Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center clinical Study designed to evaluate Physician Preference related to the use of the SurgiQuest AirSealTM Insufflation System (AIS) vs. Conventional Insufflation Systems (CIS) for the Management of pneumoperitoneum during Robotic Partial Nephrectomy. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 treatment device to control ratio into one of three (3) different study arms: 1) AIS @ 12mmHg pressure, 2) AIS @ 15mmHg pressure, and 3) CIS @ 15mmHg pressure. 189 randomized subjects distributed in three arms of 63 patients. The three study sites are targeted to enroll 63 patients each, 21 patients in each of the three (3) study arms. It is expected that this will take up to 6 months.</detailed_description>
