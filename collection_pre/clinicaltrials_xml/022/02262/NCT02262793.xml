	<brief_summary>To investigate the relative bioavailability of telmisartan respectively of dipyridamole after concomitant administration of 80 mg telmisartan in Micardis® and 25 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)/200 mg extended release (ER) dipyridamole (DP) in Aggrenox® (Test 1) relative to ER-DP in Aggrenox® alone (Reference 1), respectively relative to telmisartan in Micardis® alone (Reference 2). To investigate the relative bioavailability of dipyridamole respectively of telmisartan administered as 25 mg ASA/200 mg ER-DP 30 minutes after intake of 80 mg telmisartan (Test 2) relative to dipyridamole in Aggrenox® alone (Reference 1), respectively relative to telmisartan in Micardis® alone (Reference 2).</brief_summary>
