	<brief_title>Effects of STM 434 Alone or in Combination With Liposomal Doxorubicin in Patients With Ovarian Cancer or Other Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body), and anti-tumor activities of STM 434 (an inhibitor of activin A) in patients with ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 3 phases (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3). In the first part of the study (Part 1), which will enroll patients with multiple solid tumor types, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STM 434 will be determined for use in the second and third parts of the study (Parts 2 and 3). In the second part (Part 2), which will enroll patients with ovarian cancer, STM 434 will be administered alone, and in the third part (Part 3), which will enroll patients with ovarian cancer, STM 434 will be given together with a chemotherapy called liposomal doxorubicin. Doses of STM 434 (starting at 0.25 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg/kg) will be taken on one of three dosing schedules to determine the MTD. Patients will continue taking STM 434 until their tumor progresses. Serial blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing and safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
