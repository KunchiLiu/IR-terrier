	<brief_summary>This is a 2-arm, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized-controlled study using DLBS2411 at a dose of 250 mg twice daily (before morning and evening meals), or omeprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily (before morning meal), for an 8-week course of therapy, for the treatment of patients with any non-bleeding peptic ulcers. DLBS2411 is a bioactive fraction of an Indonesian native herbal, Cinnamomum burmanii, locally known as kayu manis have been proven at cellular and genetic levels to have an antiulcer effect through both suppressing the gastric acidity and enhancing gastric mucosal protection. The anti-secretory effect of DLBS2411 is exerted through the inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase 'pump' as well as down-regulation of the H+/K+ ATPase gene expression, thus suppressing gastric acid secretion; while its gastro-protective defense mechanism works through the promotion of COX-2 derived prostaglandin (PgE2) synthesis, stimulating gastric-epithelial mucous and bicarbonate secretion; anti-oxidative activity; and endothelial-nitric oxide (NO) formation. Recent study of DLBS2411 in healthy volunteers demonstrated the effective role and safety of DLBS2411 in suppressing intragastric acidity. Having such mechanisms of action, DLBS2411 is hypothesized to benefit in peptic ulcers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 140 subjects will be allocated into 2 groups of treatment; each group will consist of 70 subjects with the treatment regimens: Treatment I : 2 capsules of Omeprazole 20 mg, once daily and 1 placebo caplet of DLBS2411, twice daily Treatment II : 1 caplet of DLBS2411 250 mg, twice daily and 2 placebo capsules of omeprazole, once daily DLBS2411 will be administered twice daily at least 30 minutes before morning and evening meals, while omeprazole, once daily before morning meals, for 8 weeks of study period. The eligible subjects will receive either study medication (Treatment 1 or Treatment 2), for 8 weeks of treatment; and will be instructed to come to the clinic every 4-week interval throughout the study period. Subjects will be evaluated for treatment efficacy at baseline and at interval of 4 weeks over the 8-week course of therapy. The safety profile of study medication other than vital signs and adverse event will be measured at baseline and end of study. Vital signs and adverse event will be measured at baseline and every follow-up visit including end of study.</detailed_description>
