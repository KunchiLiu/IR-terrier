	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the potential benefit of enhancing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery using some of your own cells taken from fat tissue that may be able to help recovery and repair of knee tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adipose-Derived Regenerative Cells in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Your participation in this study will require that you allow the surgical team to use a fat pad in your knee that is usually discarded during surgery to harvest regenerative cells. The fat pad will be processed using the Transpose RTTM system (InGeneron, Inc., Houston, TX, USA) to produce adipose-derived regenerative cells. These cells will be re-injected in your knee during the surgery. These cells may encourage healing at the surgical site, although whether or how much they encourage healing is unknown. Determining whether such improved healing occurs is the purpose of this study. All patients will have the infrapatellar fat pad removed as part of the normal total knee arthroplasty surgery. Some patients will have the fat pad processed and cells inserted back in their knee. Other patients will have saline inserted into the knee in the same manner as the fat pad cells. To which group of patients/participants you would be assigned is determined by a random process, similar to flipping a coin. The surgery is the same in all other ways for all patients. Your participation will require that you attend your regularly scheduled postoperative visits. You will not have to make any extra clinic visits for this study. After you leave the hospital, you will be asked to rate your pain daily until you return for your first postoperative visit at 7-10 days. At your postoperative visits at 7-10 days, 1 month and 3 months, you will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire and your knee swelling, range of motion and function will be evaluated by Dr. Burke. Your participation in this study would also allow the investigator (Dr. Burke) to use certain information from your medical records, although your name or identity will not be revealed publicly in any resulting report or summary of the study.</detailed_description>
