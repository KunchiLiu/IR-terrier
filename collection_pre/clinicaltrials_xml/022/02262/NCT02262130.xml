	<brief_summary>Solar urticaria is a rare disease, with a usual favourable outcome with photoprotection and with anti H1 histamines. Nevertheless, some cases can be severe and refractory to this usual treatment, leading to a large impact on quality of life. New treatment options are warranted. The investigators aim to test the efficacy and the safety of omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody recently approved in chronic spontaneous urticaria, in this setting.</brief_summary>
