	<brief_summary>The main objective of our study is to determine the diagnostic performance of an ultra-portable ultrasound (V-Scan®) device for emergency compression ultrasound when used by experienced ermergency doctors searching for proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with no history of DVT. The gold standard is Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs performed by a vascular exploration expert.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: - to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography performed with and ultra-portable device (V-Scan®) with that of emergency compression ultrasonography performed with a classic device - to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography between patients suspected of having DVT arriving through the emergency department versus similar patients sent in by their generalist - to compare the diagnostic performance of emergency compression ultrasonography among patients with suspected DVT according to pre clinical probability testing based on the Wells score (low, medium or high probability). Currently, the use of ultra-portable ultrasound in this indication is not part of routine care, and this study is therefore considered interventional in nature.</detailed_description>
