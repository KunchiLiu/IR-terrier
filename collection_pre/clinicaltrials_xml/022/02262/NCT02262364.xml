Has undergone at least two prior conservative OA therapies without satisfactory pain relief. Patient has failed to get satisfactory pain relief from either HA or steroid injections or would be considered an appropriate patient to receive either HA or steroid injections Presence of active infection or abnormal effusion in the knee immediately preceding treatment injection. Presence of symptomatic OA in the nonstudy knee Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, chondromalacia, arthritis secondary to other inflammatory diseases, or of metabolic origin; HIV, viral hepatitis; chondrocalcinosis, Paget's disease, villonodular synovitis, and other nonOA joint disease. Disease of spine, hip or other lower extremity joints of sufficient degree to affect assessment of the index knee Untreated symptomatic injury of index knee (e.g., acute traumatic injury, anterior cruciate ligament injury, meniscus injury, cartilage lesion). Knee radiographs showing boneonbone or other gross cartilage deficits. Presence of surgical hardware or other foreign body in the index knee. Intraarticular steroid injections in the index knee within 3 months of screening. Intraarticular HA in the index knee within 6 months of screening. Other intraarticular therapy in the index knee within 6 months prior to screening. Systemic steroid use within 2 weeks of screening. Planned/anticipated surgery of the index knee during the study period. A history of local anesthetic allergy Use of systemic immunosuppressants within six weeks of treatment. Currently on anticoagulant therapy Any documented clinically significant condition (e.g., diabetes, malignancy), finding, or psychiatric illness at screening which could compromise patient safety or interfere with the assessment of the safety and treatment effects of the study injection. Skin breakdown at the index knee where the injection is planned to take place. Pregnant or nursing mothers or women who are planning on getting pregnant during the time they will be participating in the study. Known drug or alcohol dependence currently or within the last year. Used any investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to screening. Used any investigational biologic within 60 days prior to screening</criteria>
