	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for stroke. The identification and treatment of AF is one of the best way to prevent stroke. The problem is that because AF may cause minimal symptoms, it often goes undetected before a patient suffers a stroke. Also, it is known that as many as half of all patients with known AF may not be receiving appropriate anticoagulation for their condition. New technologies are making it possible to improve AF detection. Subjects in this study will be screened for AF using three simple methods: a 30-second pulse check, a hand-held single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device and a blood pressure monitor with built-in AF screening capabilities. If more patients with AF can be detected, more patients will be able to receive guideline-recommended anticoagulant therapy, and more strokes, deaths, disability, and dementia will be prevented.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Program for the Identification of "Actionable" Atrial Fibrillation in the Family Practice Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be screened for AF using three simple methods (pulse check, single-lead ECG, blood pressure machine with automated AF detection algorithms). Subjects screening positive on any test will attend for a 12-lead ECG within 24 h. For all patients with AF detected, clinical characteristics and medications will be compared at baseline and 90±14 days later.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥65 years. 2. Attending their usual Primary Care Clinic. 3. Provide written informed consent. 1. Patients considered by the Investigator to be unsuitable for study followup because the patient: 1. is unreliable concerning the followup schedule 2. cannot be contacted by telephone 3. has a life expectancy less than the anticipated study duration due to concomitant disease. 2. Presence of an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator. 3. Inability to have a BP cuff applied. 4. Documented significant allergy to ECG electrode adhesive. 5. Previously screened as part of this study.</criteria>
