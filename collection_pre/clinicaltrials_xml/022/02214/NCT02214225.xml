	<brief_summary>This is a study to assess the immune (antibody) response and safety of a bioCSL split virion, inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine, in comparison with a US licensed 2014/2015 trivalent influenza vaccine (bioCSL TIV-1), and a trivalent influenza vaccine containing the alternate B strain (bioCSL TIV-2), in healthy adult volunteers aged 18 years and above.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of bioCSL Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) in Adults Aged 18 Years and Above.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted during the 2014-2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza immunization season to evaluate the non-inferior immune response of bioCSL QIV to that of bioCSL TIV-1 and bioCSL TIV-2 along with safety in healthy male and female adults aged ≥ 18 years. Each vaccinated subject had a maximum 25 day on-study period with a six month safety follow-up.</detailed_description>
