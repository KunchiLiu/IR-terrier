	<brief_summary>Rumination syndrome is characterized by effortless recurrent regurgitation of recently ingested food into the mouth, with consequent expulsion or re-chewing and swallowing. In a previous study the investigators showed that rumination is produced by an unperceived, somatic response to food ingestion. After having identified the key mechanisms of rumination, the investigators developed an original EMG guided biofeedback technique with specific targets for correction, based on EMG-guided control of abdomino-thoracic muscular activity, and in a pilot study the investigators showed the potential effectivity of this treatment. The current aim is to validate this previous uncontrolled observation by a formal placebo-controlled, randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Rumination by Biofeedback - a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdomino-thoracic muscle activity after a challenge meal will be recorded by EMG and the signal displayed on a monitor and front in the patients: in the biofeedback group, patients will be instructed to control muscle activity, whereas in the placebo group patients will receive a pill of placebo. In each patient 3 sessions will be performed over a 10-day period. Physiological (muscular activity by EMG) and clinical outcomes (number of rumination events by questionnaires administered daily for 10 days) will be measured before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
