	<brief_title>Treatment of Port Wine Stains Using Pulsed Dye Laser, Erbium Yag Laser and Topical Sirolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the first treatment period all patients will receive a total of five treatments with two week intervals. Every patient will receive the following four treatments (utilizing a template with separate squares of 1cm2): 1) PDL treatment followed by topical sirolimus application after Er:Yag laser ablation of the stratum corneum compared with 2) PDL treatment followed by topical sirolimus application without Er:Yag laser ablation of the stratum corneum, 3) PDL treatment only and 4) sirolimus application only. After the six months follow-up period, during the second treatment period, patients will receive an additional five treatments of the adjacent cosmetic unit of the treated part of the PWS, employing the most successful of the four treatment modalities as evaluated after the first treatment period.</detailed_description>
