	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine the differential effectiveness of integrated care (IC) and lower extremity strength training (LEST) among community-dwelling frail older adults in Taiwan. Method: The investigators randomize participants at Bei-Hu site from the "Intervention study of Geriatric Frailty, Osteoporosis, and Depression in a Community Based Randomized Trial" into 12 weeks of either IC or LEST. Outcome assessments are performed at baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months after initiation of the interventions. Interventions: 1. IC: Participants visit the study site with health education, social activities, warm up, stretch, and low intensity resistance exercise for about 1 hour per week. If any medical problems or functional decline suspected during the visit, the case manager refers participants to their primary care physicians for further managements. 2. LEST: Participants receive 2 sessions of 30-minute lower extremity strength straining using isotonic strength training machines each week. The intensity is set at 60-80% of 1 repetition maximum (RM). Evaluation of the exercise protocol are repeated every 2 weeks for individualized adjustments</brief_summary>
