	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if a two-way texting platform to be used as an adjunct tool for breastfeeding peer counselors can improve breastfeeding behaviors among women enrolled in the WIC program in Connecticut. The hypothesis of the study is that providing additional information and support through text messaging starting in pregnancy and continuing after the birth of the child will increase exclusive breastfeeding rates during the first six months of life.</brief_summary>
