	<brief_summary>The embryokinetics may be a new prognostic factor for choosing the human embryos with the highest implantation potential. In order to identify the factors that may affect the rate of embryo cleavage, there are many studies about morphokinetics and culture medium, oxygen tension, oocyte quality or type of medication used for ovarian stimulation. However there are no published data with respect to the influence of sperm DNA fragmentation in the embryo kinetic.</brief_summary>
