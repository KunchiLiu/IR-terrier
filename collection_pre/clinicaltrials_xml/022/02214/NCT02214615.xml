	<brief_summary>This research study is designed to investigate brain response using fMRI scan, and behavioral responses, to treatment with the drug carbamazepine (CBZ) in patients with the painful sodium channelopathy inherited Erythromelalgia (IEM). This study is designed to identify the central nervous system (CNS) regions that are activated during ongoing or evoked pain attacks, and the altered CNS response to CBZ treatment. This will advance our understanding of how IEM affects the brain. We also hope to validate a pharmacogenic approach to the study of IEM by use of an FDA approved drug. We hope, but cannot be sure, that subjects will directly benefit from this study.</brief_summary>
