	<brief_summary>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) can severely deteriorate balance and gait in patients, thereby increasing risk of fall and injury. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual reality game based exercise training for improving postural body sway and gait in diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy. The exercise training has been specifically designed for DPN patients with lost lower extremity joint perception and uses state-of-the-art inertial sensors (body-worn) to acquire joint movement and provide real-time joint feedback through an interactive interface on a LCD monitor. The investigators hypothesize that tailored exercise with real-time visual joint feedback during exercise will reduce improve balance and gait.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The game includes a series of ankle reaching tasks and crossing of virtual obstacles on the monitor screen; these exercises are aimed to improve weight shifting capabilities and medial-lateral movement of body.</detailed_description>
