	<brief_summary>Anxiety, stress and depression are common during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The lack of empirically supported, non-pharmaceutical interventions for psychological distress in pregnancy is a significant gap in the literature, especially given many pregnant women's preference for non-pharmaceutical treatments. This study will evaluate the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program in reducing measures of psychological distress (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety) in a group of pregnant women endorsing high levels of distress.</brief_summary>
