	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Cervicothoracic Manipulative Treatment in Unilateral Shoulder Impingement Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Objective: to determine the effects of manipulative techniques for the ervicothoracic spine versus home exercises on pain, disability, and range of movement in patients with unilateral shoulder inmingement syndrome. Methods and Measures: ninety-two subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Intervention: For 5-weeks, the groups 1 will undergo tratment comprising manipulative protocol techniques for the cervicothoracic spine (2/week) and the group 2 will develop a home exercise (2/week). Main Outcome Measures: Intensity of pain, disability, and range of motion data will be collected at baseline, and 24hr after the last therapy application. Mixed-model analyses of variance will be used to examine the effects of the treatment on each outcome measure.</detailed_description>
