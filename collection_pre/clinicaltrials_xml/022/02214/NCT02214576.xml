	<brief_summary>Tracheal intubation in the ICU is associated with significant complications and morbidity. Desaturation is among the most frequent and hazardous complication, occurring in almost one out of four intubations, that may in some instances lead to cardiac arrest; despite appropriate preoxygenation. Non-invasive ventilation may help improve preoxygenation but does not allow for apneic oxygenation and may not be performed in patients with neurological impairment. High flow nasal canula oxygen is increasingly used in the ICU in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and may be used to improve preoxygenation. It is currently used in our ICU for that purpose. Because high flow nasal canula oxygen is our first line oxyten therapy for patients with acute respirtory distress syndrome, we sought to determine its use as a means to ensure preoxygenation in those ARDS patients that require intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal Canula Oxygen Helps Preoxygenate ARDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High flow nasal canula oxygen is increasingly used to provide heated and humidified oxygen in patients with acute respiratory failure. One of the major advantages of high flow nasal canula oxygen is the possibility to maintain oxygenation during laryngoscopy and thereby providing high flow apneic oxygenation. In addition, and contrary no non-invasive ventilation, preoxygenation may be used in patients with neurological impairment. Finally, the interest of this device is that it is the same that is maintained throughout the whole management of the patient, from ICU admission to intubation.</detailed_description>
