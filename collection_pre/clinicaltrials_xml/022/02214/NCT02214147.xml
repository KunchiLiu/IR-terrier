	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Alisertib in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma With Varying Degrees of Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to assess how it is processed by the body in participants with advanced solid tumors or relapsed/refractory lymphoma with varying degrees of liver function. This study will also assess laboratory results and safety. The study will enroll approximately 48 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups based on the status of their liver function: Normal hepatic function (Total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of the normal range [ULN] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level ≤ ULN), moderate hepatic impairment (Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5-3 x ULN and ALT level = Any), or severe hepatic impairment (Total bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN and ALT level = Any). All participants will be administered one 50 mg dose of alisertib on Day 1, Cycle 1. Alisertib will be administered again on Days 8 through 14 of Cycle 1, followed by a 14-day rest period. Doses administered on Days 8-14 will be 50, 30, or 20 mg of alisertib, depending on hepatic function. Alisertib may then be continued at the same dose as in Cycle 1, Days 8-14 in 21-day cycles (7 days of alisertib followed by a 14-day rest period) for up to 1 year (approximately 16 cycles). This multicenter trial will be conducted in USA only. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 13 months unless it is determined by the investigator, with agreement by the sponsor, that a participant would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months. Participants will make up to 51 visits to the clinic including an end-of-study visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Lymphoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Male or female participants 18 years of age or older. 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or advanced solid tumors or lymphomas for which standard curative or lifeprolonging treatment does not exist or is no longer effective or tolerable. 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. 4. Female participants who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). 5. Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). 6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 7. Suitable venous access for the studyrequired blood sampling, including pharmacokinetics. 8. Ability to swallow tablets. 9. Participants with biliary obstruction for which a stent had been placed are eligible provided that the stent has been in place for more than 14 days before the first dose of alisertib and liver function has stabilized. 10. Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic therapy (ie, ≤ Grade 1 toxicity or baseline). 11. Clinical laboratory values as specified below: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL and platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL. Participants with normal hepatic function: Total bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be ≤ upper limit of the normal range (ULN). Participants with moderate hepatic impairment: total bilirubin must be &gt; 1.5 to 3 x ULN with any ALT level. Participants with severe hepatic impairment: total bilirubin must be &gt; 3 x ULN with any ALT level. Measured creatinine clearance or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/minute. Note: If a calculated creatinine clearance is used, it should be calculated according to the CockcroftGault formula. Hemoglobin must be ≥ 8 g/dL. 1. Participants of North/East Asian ethnicity (ie, Japanese, Chinese, Korean) will be excluded. 2. Recurrent nausea and/or vomiting within 14 days before the first dose of alisertib or known gastrointestinal (GI) abnormality or GI procedure that could interfere with or modify the oral absorption or tolerance of alisertib. Examples include, but are not limited to, diseaserelated bowel obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, use of pancreatic enzymes, a gastric condition (such as severe reflux or active peptic ulcer disease) that requires chronic and uninterrupted use of proton pump inhibitors, partial gastrectomy, history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease. 3. Participants requiring treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as the enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine, primidone, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, or St. John's wort within 14 days before the first dose of alisertib or requiring the use of these medications during the study. 4. A medical condition requiring use of pancreatic enzymes; daily, chronic, or regular use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); or histamine 2 (H2) receptor antagonists. Participants who intermittently use these medications, must meet the following criteria: No use of PPIs within 5 days before the first dose of alisertib. No use of H2 antagonist or pancreatic enzymes within 24 hours before the first dose of alisertib. 5. Inadequate bone marrow or other organ function (excluding hepatic impairment per eligibility criteria). 6. Female participants who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the Screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first dose of alisertib. 7. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol. 8.

Participant must have recovered from infection before first dose. 14. Lifethreatening illness unrelated to cancer. 15. Symptomatic brain metastasis. Participants with brain metastases: Must have stable neurologic status following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at least 2 weeks after completion of the definitive therapy AND Must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic or other adverse events (AEs). 16. Clinically significant coagulopathy or bleeding disorder. 17. Severe central nervous system, pulmonary, or renal disease not related to the participant's cancer. 18. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. 19. Known hepatitis B surface antigen positive or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection. 20.
