It is a well studied phenoma that Brimonidine and a miotic effect on the pupil, however the combined effect of alpha agonist and beta blocker has not been studied. The study subjects will be examined twice, two weeks apart. On the first exam the subject will receive Combigan eye drop to the right eye and a Brimonidine drop to the left eye. The effect on pupil size before and 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 240 minutes, and 300 minutes after instillation of eyedrops. On the second exam the subject will receive Timolol (0.5%) eye drop to the right eye and a Brimonidine drop to the left eye.
