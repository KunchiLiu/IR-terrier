	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Supplementation for Anemia and Mineral and Bone Disorder in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are 4 arms in this study: (1) Thrice-weekly cholecalciferol supplementation (3,000 IU), (2) Monthly cholecalciferol supplementation (equivalent to 9,000/week), (3) Thrice-weekly placebo, and (4) Monthly placebo. The primary analyses will be done regarding 2 cholecalciferol groups and 2 placebo groups as one group each, and we will evaluate the effect of cholecalciferol regardless of the supplementation regimen. As the secondary analyses, we will examine if there is any difference between thrice-weekly and once-monthly supplementation regimen.</detailed_description>
