	<brief_title>Improving Clinical Staging for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Through Molecular Profiling and Improved Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in the study, a piece of the tumor that is removed during the biopsy will be collected for research purposes. The tissue will be sent to the laboratory for genetic testing. If you have had a computed tomography scan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) recently, information collected from the scan will be collected. If you have not had one recently, you will have an MRI with contrast as part of this study. You will receive a separate consent form for this MRI scan. The results of the test will be given to your doctor, but the results will not be used to decide your treatment. After you have surgery, information will be collected from your medical records, such as your diagnosis. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over once your surgery is completed. This is an investigational study. Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
