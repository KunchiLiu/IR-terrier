To determine the percent change in women who experience grade 3 or 4 radiation dermatitis as defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System during radiation treatment for breast cancer compared to historical experience using standard skin care. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility of daily application of the hypochlorite solution (Dakin's solution), and to assess levels of pain during radiotherapy treatment. OUTLINE: Patients apply Dakin's solution topically daily over 10 minutes within 60 minutes of radiation therapy for up to 6 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks.</detailed_description>
