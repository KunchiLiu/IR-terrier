	<brief_summary>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and emotions as well as marked impulsivity. When patients have children, they are at high risk of severe emotional and relational disturbances (withdrawal, low self-esteem, depression, suicidal thoughts). In addition, studies support the effectiveness of parental guidance group to reduce emotional and behavioral difficulties of children. To our knowledge there are no programs directed to mothers with BPD who received a controlled evaluation. From experience with parental guidance, data from the observation of children of patients with BPD and psychosocial programs directed to patients BPD, we have built for preventive intervention. The Supportive Program for Mothers with BPD (SuPMother-B) consists of 10 group sessions providing information (education, childcare, care specific to BPD) and promotes mother-child interactions (observation, games). Purpose: Compare the effect of a program (SuPMother-B) group, of 10 sessions, offered to mothers with a BPD in addition to a minimal intervention (diagnostic announcement and provision of health care resources) on behavior withdrawal of children at 6 months compared to a group of mothers receiving only minimal intervention. Primary outcome: Difference at 6 months between the experimental and control groups on scores on the assessment scale withdrawal (Alarm Distress Baby (ADBB)).</brief_summary>
