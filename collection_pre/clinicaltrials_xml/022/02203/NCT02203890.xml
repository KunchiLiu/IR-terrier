	<brief_summary>This study will provide the researchers with an opportunity for the investigation of the biomarkers and different human biology component variable interactions in children; information that can generate new correlations between markers not known at the moment. Regarding their analysis, variation could have multiple connotations. A categorical that refers to a specific state, established with a diagnostic standard. And a numerical, referring to a range or the absolute value limits in a continuous spectrum; this research will allow us to express variability in the distance amplitude of the obtained values level, as well as classifications or categories previously established in the possible cases. OBJECTIVES PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE To estimate the inter and intra-individual variety in a selected series or biological variables determinant of growth, body composition, infection, oxidation, inflammation and hydration, in preschool children sharing the same institutional-based diet. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES - To determine the inter and intra-individual variation of growth in preschool children, with a similar diet, who attend Secretariat of Beneficial Works of the First Lady system daycare centers and to compare between semi-urban and rural. - To describe the inter-individual variation of the red blood cells circulating mass in preschool children, with a similar diet, who attend day care centers and to compare between semi-urban and rural. - To determine the inter-individual variation of systemic and intraintestinal oxidation in preschool children, with a similar diet, who attend daycare centers and to compare between semi-urban and rural. - To describe the inter-individual variation of systemic and intraintestinal inflammation in preschool children, with a similar diet, who attend daycare centers and to compare between semi-urban and rural. - To determine the inter and/or intra-individual variation of urinary tract infection and gastrointestinal parasite infestation in preschool children, with a similar diet, who attend daycare centers and to compare between semi-urban and rural. - To describe the inter and intra-individual variation of the hydration status in preschool children, with a similar diet, who attend daycare centers and to compare between semi-urban and rural. - To explore intra-individual associations in variables of the same research component or different component variables.</brief_summary>
