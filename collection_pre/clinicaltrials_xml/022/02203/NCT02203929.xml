	<brief_summary>Knowledge of the natural history and progression of macular holes is mainly limited to the studies from the pre-optical coherence tomography era. By observing macular holes preoperatively we are able to determine the extent of the preoperative macular hole progression. At our institution macular holes are treated in an elective setting. The majority of macular holes undergo a 2-step sequence of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation followed by vitrectomy. We wish to observe the effect of time and cataract surgery on the progression of macular holes prior to vitrectomy.</brief_summary>
