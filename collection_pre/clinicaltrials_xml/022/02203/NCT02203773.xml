	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety of orally administered ABT-199 combined with decitabine or azacitidine and the preliminary efficacy of these combinations. In addition, there is a DDI sub-study only at a single site, to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of ABT-199 in combination with posaconazole.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject must have confirmation of AML by WHO criteria25 and be ineligible for treatment with a standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction regimen due to comorbidity or other factors. 2. Subject must have received no prior treatment for AML with the exception of hydroxyurea. 3. Subject must be ≥ 60 years of age. 4. Subject must have a projected life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. 5. Subject must be considered ineligible for induction therapy defined by the following: ≥ 75 years of age; OR ≥ 60 to 74 years with at least one of the following comorbidities: ECOG Performance Status of 2 or 3; Cardiac history of CHF requiring treatment or Ejection Fraction ≤ 50% or chronic stable angina; DLCO ≤ 65% or FEV1 ≤ 65%; Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min to &lt; 45 ml/min Moderate hepatic impairment with total bilirubin &gt;1.5 to ≤ 3.0 × ULN Any other comorbidity that the physician judges to be incompatible with intensive chemotherapy must be reviewed and approved by the study medical monitor before study enrollment 6. Subject must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status: 0 to 2 for subjects ≥ 75 years of age OR 0 to 3 for subjects ≥ 60 to 74 years of age. 7. Subject must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min; determined via urine collection for 24hour creatinine clearance or by the Cockcroft Gault formula. 8. Subject must have adequate liver function as demonstrated by: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3.0 × ULN* alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 × ULN* bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN* ○ Subjects &gt; 60 to 74 years of age may have bilirubin ≤ 3.0 × ULN* * unless considered due to leukemic organ involvement. 9. Nonsterile male subjects must use contraceptive methods with partner(s) prior to beginning study drug administration and continuing up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation from initial study drug administration until 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 10. Female subjects must be either: Postmenopausal; defined as Age &gt; 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause; OR Permanently surgical sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy). 1. Subject has received treatment with the following: hypomethylating agent and/or chemo therapeutic agent for Myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) CART cell therapy Other experimental therapies for AML. 2. Subject has history of Myloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN). 3. Subject has favorable risk cytogenetics as categorized by the NCCN Guidelines Version 2, 2016 for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Appendix D). 4. Subject has t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16) or t(15;17) karyotype abnormalities. 5. Subject has acute promyelocytic leukemia. 6. Subject has known active CNS involvement from AML. 7. Subject is known to be positive for HIV. Note: HIV testing is not required. 8. Subject is known to be positive for hepatitis B or C infection with the exception of those with an undetectable viral load. Note: Hepatitis B or C testing is not required and subjects with serologic evidence of prior vaccination to HBV (i.e., HBs Ag, antiHBs+ and antiHBc) may participate. 9. Subject has received a strong and/or moderate CYP3A inducer within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment. 10. Subject has consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit within 3 days prior to the initiation of study treatment. 11. Subject has any history of clinically significant condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study including, but not limited to: cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class ≥ 2. Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or anginal pain. renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, hepatic, cardiovascular disease, or bleeding disorder independent of leukemia, chronic respiratory disease that requires continuous oxygen use. 12. Subject has a malabsorption syndrome or other condition that precludes enteral route of administration. 13. Subject exhibits evidence of uncontrolled systemic infection requiring therapy (viral, bacterial or fungal). 14. Subject has a history of other malignancies prior to study entry, with the exception of: Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the breast or cervix uteri; Basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; Previous malignancy confined and surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent. 15. Subject has a white blood cell count &gt; 25 × 109/L. Note: Hydroxyurea is permitted to meet this criterion.</criteria>
