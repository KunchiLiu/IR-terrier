	<brief_summary>Septic shock is a condition that is marked by severe infection causing hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs. The Surviving Sepsis campaign, an international organization formed for the purpose of guiding the management of sepsis and septic shock, currently recommends norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor for septic shock. Phenylephrine, a vasopressor FDA-approved for use in septic shock, is recommended as an alternative vasopressor when septic shock is complicated by tachyarrhythmia to mitigate cardiac complications. This recommendation is based solely on experience with no scientific evidence to support this recommendation. The investigators will conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) directly comparing phenylephrine and norepinephrine, two FDA-approved vasopressors that are both used in clinical practice for the management of septic shock. The investigators will perform this study with a population of patients that have septic shock to complete the following aims: Aim 1: Determine the incidence of tachyarrhythmias. Aim 2: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with a lower heart rate. Aim 3: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with a higher incidence of new tachyarrhythmias. Aim 4: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with less time in tachyarrhythmia. Aim 5: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with fewer complications, including cardiac complications. The investigators hypothesize that in this setting, phenylephrine will improve the management of septic shock when used as a "first choice" vasopressor by: 1. Decreasing the mean heart rate 2. Decreasing the incidence of new tachyarrhythmias 3. Decreasing the amount of time spent in tachyarrhythmia for patients who develop new onset and recurrent tachyarrhythmias 4. Decreasing the number of cardiac complications</brief_summary>
