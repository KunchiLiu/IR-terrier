	<brief_title>Minocycline Hydrochloride in Reducing Chemotherapy Induced Depression and Anxiety in Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate anxiety and depression in women with stages I-III breast cancer during the first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to receive either minocycline (minocycline hydrochloride) or placebo. II. To evaluate markers of neuro-inflammation as assessed by blood based inflammatory cytokines and C11-choline positron emission tomography (PET) in women with stages I-III breast cancer during the first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to receive either minocycline or placebo. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive minocycline hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 9 weeks. ARM II: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive placebo PO BID for 9 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>
