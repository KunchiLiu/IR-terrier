	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of carfilzomib combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CCyd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRd) followed by autologous transplantation ASCT or 12 cycles of carfilzomib combined with dexamethasone and lenalidomide for patients eligible for ASCT with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. As a secondary endpoint this study will evaluate the best maintenance treatment between lenalidomide and lenalidomide combined with carfilzomib. Four hundred seventy-seven patients, males and females aged &gt; 18 years, enrolled in several sites, will take part in this study. The duration of the study is approximately 5 years.</brief_summary>

Patient has measurable disease according to IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) criteria. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent. Patient agrees to use acceptable methods for contraception. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60% Pretreatment clinical laboratory values within 30 days of enrolment: Platelet count ≥50 x 109/L (≥30 x 109 /L if myeloma involvement in the bone marrow is &gt; 50%) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 109/L without the use of growth factors Corrected serum calcium ≤14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) Alanine transaminase (ALT): ≤ 3 x the Upper Limit Normal (ULN) Total bilirubin: ≤ 2 x the ULN Calculated or measured creatinine clearance: ≥ 30 mL/minute.
