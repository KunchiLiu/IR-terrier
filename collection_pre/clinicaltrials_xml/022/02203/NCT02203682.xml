	<brief_title>Doxycycline Treatment in Mild Graves' Orbitopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graves'orbitopathy is an autoimmune disease that can be treated by corticosteroids and surgery. But they often cause severe side-effects and are usually used for treating moderate-sever and sight-threatening GO. Wait and see will be the first choice for the patient with mild GO. Subantimicrobial dose (SD) doxycycline displays a strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory function, which is independent of its antibiotic properties. Data from clinical trials demonstrated that SD doxycycline was effective in moderating inflammation in a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, rosacea and periodontitis. We propose to test the effect of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for mild GO.</detailed_description>
