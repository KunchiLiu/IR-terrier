	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to determine the effects of intraoperative tourniquet use during total knee arthroplasty (TKA), compared to TKA without the use of a tourniquet (NOTQT), for strength and functional recovery following simultaneous bilateral TKA. During the procedure, each patient will receive tourniquet-assisted TKA (TQT) on one lower extremity while the contralateral lower extremity undergoes TKA without the use of a tourniquet (NOTQT), except for briefly during component cementation. Tourniquets are commonly used in TKA to improve visualization of the surgical field and limit blood loss. However, studies suggest that tourniquet use may be associated with higher rates of medical complications and poor functional outcomes, including increased swelling, decreased muscle strength and altered neuromuscular activity. We will measure strength, voluntary muscle activation, and other functional outcomes for each lower extremity at 4 time points (preop; inpatient (24-72 hrs after surgery); 3 weeks; and 3 months following TKA). We hypothesize that lower extremities in the NOTQT group will demonstrate improved strength and performance when compared to lower extremities in the TQT group.</brief_summary>
