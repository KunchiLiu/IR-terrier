	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: - Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. - The outcome for patients with this diagnosis is significantly worse than for that of systemic DLBCL. Most treatment approaches in the past have included high dose methotrexate and radiation treatment. - Most PCNSLs appear to be of activated B-cell (ABC) origin. - Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and effective for systemic DLBCL of ABC origin. - We propose doing a study in which ibrutinib is combined with a novel chemotherapy platform called dose adjusted temozolomide, etoposide, doxil, dexamethasone, ibrutinib, rituximab (DA-TEDDI-R). OBJECTIVE: - Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib or the dose that achieves adequate CSF concentrations, whichever comes first, when ibrutinib is given with DA-TEDDI-R. ELIGIBILITY: - Newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory PCNSL. - Age greater than or equal to 18 years. - No pregnant or breast-feeding women. - Adequate organ function (defined in protocol). STUDY DESIGN: - This is a phase 1 study of 40 patients. - The study will have two components. 1. Phase 1: MTD of ibrutinib will be identified or the dose at which ibrutinib achieves a concentration of less than or equal to 100 nM in the CSF, when given in combination with DA-TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy, whichever comes first. 2. Expansion cohort: Safety and tolerability of the regimen in relapsed/refractory or previously untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at the final ibrutinib dose with DA-TEDDI-R in 10 patients. Secondary objectives will be PFS and OS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed primary central nervous system diffuse large Bcell lymphoma. Both newly diagnosed patients and patients with relapsed or refractory disease are eligible. At least 2 weeks have passed since prior chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, major surgery, other investigational or anticancer therapy that is considered diseasedirected. Ibrutinib must be discontinued 7 days before (when possible) until 7 days after major surgery, and 3 days before (when possible) until 3 days after minor surgery. Thus, patients to be enrolled on an ibrutinib trial must have completed major surgery &gt; 7 days before initiating treatment, and/or must have completed minor surgery &gt; 3 days before initiating treatment. Recovered from prior toxicities to Grade 01 at least 2 weeks prior to investigational therapy. Men and women age greater than or equal to 18 years. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2(Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%) unless due to CNS Lymphoma. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below, independent of growth factor or transfusion support. Patients should not receive growth factors or transfusions for at least 7 days prior to first dose of study drug with the exception of pegylated GCSF (pegfilgrastim) and darbopoeitin which require at least 14 days prior to screening and randomization.. absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to750 cells/mcL (0.75 x 10(9)/L) platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000 cells/mcL (50 X 10(9)/L) hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dL total bilirubin less than or equal to1.5 times ULN (unless Gilbert s syndrome or disease infiltration of the liver is present) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3.0 times institutional ULN Serum Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min/1.73m2 unless lymphoma related. Prothrombin time/INR (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN); except if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the aPTT is elevated because of a positive Lupus Anticoagulant. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40% as assessed by echocardiogram or MUGA The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry. Female patients who are of nonreproductive potential (i.e., postmenopausal by history no menses for (Bullet)1 year; OR history of hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal ligation; OR history of bilateral oophorectomy). Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry. Male and female patients who agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (e.g., condoms, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], complete sexual abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the period of therapy and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Patient or appointed surrogate decisionmaker or legally authorized representative must have ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and willingness to provide a signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations). EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Chemotherapy less than or equal to 21 days prior to first administration of study treatment and/or monoclonal antibody 6 weeks prior to first administration of study treatment. Prior exposure to a BTK inhibitor History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ibrutinib or other agents used in study. Patients who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor within 7 days prior to the first dose of ibrutinib or patients who require continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequentlyupdated list such as; medical reference texts such as the Physicians Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new overthecounter medicine or herbal product. HIV positive patients will be excluded with the exception of patients without CD4 depletion (i.e. above the institutional lower limit of normal) and who have no other AIDS related complications and who have EBV negative tumors. The number of patients in this category is expected to be very low and the PI will decide their eligibility on a case by case basis. Systemic cytotoxic therapy within 2 weeks of treatment. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or an infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Recent infections requiring systemic treatment need to have completed therapy greater than 14 days before the first dose of study drug. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Pregnant women are excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ibrutinib. Uncontrolled Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia or ITP resulting in (or as evidenced by) declining platelet or Hgb levels within the 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. Presence of transfusiondependent thrombocytopenia. Patients requiring daily corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent of greater than or equal to 20 mg daily should not be enrolled. If corticosteroids can be discontinued (or reduced to less than 20 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent), the discontinuation or dose reduction should be done at least 7 days prior to first dose (see Section 5.3.1 for instructions regarding onstudy use of corticosteroids).
