	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and Anti-HBV antibody persistence of hepatitis B vaccine with different doses and schedules. Hepatitis B vaccine with the regimens of 20μg, 0-1-6 mon and 60μg,0-1 or 0-2 mon will be administered to young adults, and the comparative immunogenicity among the three groups will be measured at 1 mon post-a series vaccination, 1- and 2-year after the first dose of the regimen. Furthermore, the safety of hepatitis B vaccine with different doses and schedules will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
