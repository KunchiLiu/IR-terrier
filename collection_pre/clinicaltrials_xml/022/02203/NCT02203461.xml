	<brief_summary>Changes in insulin resistance in healthy volunteers with normal body weight (BMI 18-25) after 14 days of STRIBILD®-, Truvada®/Kaletra® or Truvada®/Prezista®/Norvir® intake, measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Insulin Resistance in Healthy Volunteers on STRIBILD® Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement of insulin resistance will be performed in 30 HIV-negative healthy non-obese (BMI 18-25) male volunteers before and after 14 days (+/- 2 days) of treatment with STRIBILD® (treatment 1, n=10), as compared to TVD, LPV/r (treatment 2, n=10) and TVD, DRV/r (treatment 3, n=10). The volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. The measurement of insulin resistance, lipid and glucose metabolism will be performed; before and immediately after the treatment. Furthermore, the therapy compliance will be verified using the method of drug counting and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).</detailed_description>
