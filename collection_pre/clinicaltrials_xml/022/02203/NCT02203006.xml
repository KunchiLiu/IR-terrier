	<brief_title>HIV Patients Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since the arrival of highly active tritherapies, HIV infection became mainly an ambulatory chronic pathology centred on a long term care taking into account the complication of long-term treatment as well as the arisen of new problem bound to a prolonged survival and ageing. So the care is more and more in a prevention and screening approach with in particular the care of metabolic and cardiovascular complication due to antiretroviral treatment. As a reorganization of the coverage of the HIV infected people take place on the Hotel Dieu Hospital it thus seems important to double this care optimization with a clinical research side. This will be done in constituting an HIV patient cohort including a blood sample collection to contribute to the vigilance of the complication to due the infection. Our ultimate objective is to optimize the selection of the treatment. It is important to do it to be able to have, on many years duration, precise clinical information and biological sample allowing to realize later some assay and analyse the influence of some genetic markers.</detailed_description>
