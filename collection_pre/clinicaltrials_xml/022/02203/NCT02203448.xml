	<brief_summary>A Multi-centre, Prospective, single-arm post market clinical follow up study (PMCF) of the FACET WEDGETM spinal system to assess outcomes in subjects with chronic low back pain due to Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD), facet joint disease and/or pseudo arthrosis post anterior instrumentation. The objective of this study is to assess outcomes following implantation of the FACET WEDGE spinal system when used to provide fixation of lumbar motion segments. The primary objective of this study is to determine the rate of re-operations at the index level(s). The secondary objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the device and to collect patient reported outcome data.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects diagnosed with at least one of the following: Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD); Degenerative facet joint disease (isolated facet based symptomatic back pain); Pseudoarthrosis post anterior instrumentation; 2. Subjects who are a fusion candidate for single or multiple levels fusion between L1S1; 3. Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this clinical investigation, cooperate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to the hospital for all the required postoperative followups. Preoperative exclusion criteria: 1. Segmental instability of the index level in case of planned standalone FACET WEDGE usage; 2. Unilateral application , except in combination with pediclescrew fixation on the contralateral side; 3. Compromised facets due to decompression techniques; 4. Spondylolisthesis; 5. Fracture or other instabilities of the posterior elements; 6. Tumor; 7. Acute or chronic systemic or localized spinal infections; 8. Nursing mothers or women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the time of the study; 9. Subjects aged below 18 years; 10. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would compromise their participation and followup in this clinical investigation; Intraoperative exclusion criteria: 11. Intraoperative decision to use implants other than the device under investigation.</criteria>
