	<brief_title>Efficacy of Thalidomide in Preventing Chemotherapy-induced Delayed Nausea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, aimed to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of thalidomide in improving prevention of chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and vomiting (CINV) in chemotherapy-naive patients after highly emetogenic chemotherapy(HEC) (cisplatin-based regimen or cyclophosphamide combination with doxorubicin/epirubicin). A total of 820 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study. Patients treating with highly emetogenic chemotherapy will be randomized into two groups, and be treated with Thalidomide+ Palonosetron+ Dexamethasone or Placebo + Palonosetron+ Dexamethasone, respectively. The primary end point is complete response rate (CRR) for delayed CINV, and the secondary end points include the safety and quality of life (QOL).</detailed_description>
