	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a breakthrough in the field of hepatobiliary surgery in recent years，which stimulates the remnant liver volume(RLV) grew by 74%-87.2% in 9 to 13 days。The published literature reported that the two stages of ALPPS are the conventional laparotomy surgery，Patients need to undergo the injury of two open operations in a short time. The incidence of postoperative complications and mortality rate is as high as 53% -73% and 12%-27%.The aim of this study was to evaluate the results with laparoscopic ALPPS procedure in a single center, with special emphasis in validity, feasibility and limitations. Results: Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed. Statistical method:groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank survival curves were used.</detailed_description>
