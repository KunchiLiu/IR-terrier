	<brief_title>Evaluation of Lactobacillus Fermentum CECT5716 on the Incidence of Mastitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have demonstrated that L. fermentum CECT5716, a probiotic strain previously isolated from breast milk, can be used as an effective treatment of mastitis and painful breastfeeding by reducing pathogen counts in breast milk. This is a randomized double blinded controlled study to evaluate the effect of L.fermentum CECT5716 on mastitis incidence and Staphylococcus load in breast milk. Women will be recruited 1-6 days after child birth and distributed into two groups: Probiotic group receiving 1 capsule/day containing L.fermentum 3x109cfu; Control group receiving 1 placebo capsule/day containing maltodextrin. The intervention period is 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
