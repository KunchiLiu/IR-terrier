	<brief_summary>The oral cavity is mostly influenced by general health. The oral microbiota which is as complex as the gastro-intestinal or vaginal microbiota are considered to be difficult therapeutic targets. The effects of probiotics in different fields of health care have resulted recently in the introduction of probiotics for oral healthcare. Probiotics have been clinically proved effective in different fields of oral healthcare such as halitosis, oral candidiasis and tooth decay. They have also been inducted in the field of periodontal healthcare because of the current views on the etiology of plaque- related periodontal inflammation.</brief_summary>
