History of latent or active TB prior to screening, except for patients with documented completion of an adequate treatment regimen, at least 6 months prior to the first administration of study agent. Positive QuantiFERONTB Gold InTube test (IGRA) within 2 months prior to the rollover visit (if available), in which active tuberculosis has not been ruled out. This does not apply to patients with history of latent tuberculosis with documented completion of an adequate treatment regimen, at least 6 months prior to the first administration of study agent.
