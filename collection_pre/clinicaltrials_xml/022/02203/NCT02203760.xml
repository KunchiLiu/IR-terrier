Indication: Relapsed or metastatic uterine leiomyosarcomas or carcinosarcomas Randomization: Patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas will be randomized in a 1:1-fashion to receive the following therapy - Arm A: Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily plus Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 min d 1 and d 8 q3w or - Arm B: Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily Patients with uterine carcinosarcomas will be treated according to Arm A. Planned number of patients: 87 patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas 20 patients with uterine carcinosarcomas Treatment schedules: Patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas will be randomized in a 1:1-fashion to receive the following therapy • Arm A (experimental arm / combination arm): Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily plus Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 min d 1 and d 8 q3w or • Arm B (control arm / monotherapy arm): Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily Patients with uterine carcinosarcomas will be treated according to Arm A. Planned treatment duration per subject: Patients continue on study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent for any reason.</brief_summary>

Subjects may not have had a transfusion within 7 days prior to screening assessment. 2. Concomitant elevations in bilirubin and AST/ALT above 1.0 x ULN are not permitted 3. If UPC &gt; = 1, then a 24hour urine protein must be assessed. Subjects must have a 24hour urine protein value &lt;1g to be eligible. 4. Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation 11. Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who has had: A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value &lt; 40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L). Subjects using HRT must have experienced total cessation of menses for &gt;= 1 year and be greater than 45 years of age OR have had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH and estradiol concentrations prior to initiation of HRT OR Negative serum pregnancy test of women of childbearing potential performed within 1 week prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception.
