If female, is currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become pregnant (for 4 weeks before the SV and throughout the duration of the study), and is of nonchildbearing potential, defined as: ≥1 year postmenopausal (6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea is permitted, provided there is a local record of serum follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 mIU/mL and this is source documented) or Surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, or hysterectomy) Or is of childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control, as defined below, for the duration of the study: Systemic contraception used for ≥1 month prior to screening, including birth control pills, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, implants, or injectables or Double barrier methods (spermicide with any of the following: condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm, and vaginal contraceptive film) or Intrauterine device (IUD) with a low failure rate defined as &lt;1% per year (use of copper IUDs is not acceptable) Or is of childbearing potential and is not sexually active, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and, in the event the patient becomes sexually active, is willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control, as defined above, for the duration of the study. At the discretion of the investigator, total abstinence is acceptable in cases where the age, career (eg, priest), lifestyle, and/or sexual orientation of the patient ensures compliance. 7. Current or exsmoker with ≥10 packyear smoking history (number of cigarette packs smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked; eg, 2 packs/day for 3 years equals a 6 packyear history). 8. Patient is free of any other medical conditions or concomitant treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the study. 9. Able to perform technically acceptable and reproducible spirometry per American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) 2005 guidelines and study guidelines, as defined in the protocol and study reference manual; this includes able to tolerate withdrawal of applicable medications during required spirometry assessments. 10. Able to perform acceptable peak expiratory flow measurements. 11. Able to maintain records (patient daily diary) during the study period as required by the protocol. 12. Able to demonstrate the proper inhalation techniques required for correct use of all delivery devices (BAI and dry powder inhaler [DPI]) required in the study. 13. Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation, and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed consent and being compliant with all study requirements. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 1. Pregnancy, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days following the patient's last study related visit (for eligible patients only, if applicable). 2. Current evidence of a clinically significant or uncontrolled disease including, but not limited to: cardiovascular (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease), hepatic, renal, hematological, neuropsychological, endocrine (eg, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome), gastrointestinal (eg, poorly controlled peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease), or pulmonary (other than COPD such as asthma, sarcoidosis, non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or a diagnosis of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation, or which could affect the endpoint analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the study. 3. History of and/or current diagnosis of asthma. 4. History of a lifethreatening COPD exacerbation defined for this protocol as a COPD episode that required intubation or was associated with respiratory arrest. 5. Thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. 6. Current congestive heart failure, history or current evidence of myocardial infarction (within 1 year of the SV), or current history of active ischemic heart disease (exertional or intermittent angina). 7. History or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or abnormality, including a diagnosis on screening ECG. Findings that are always considered clinically significant and will exclude the patient from study participation include, but are not limited to, the following: ventricular rate &lt;45 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt;100 bpm PR interval &gt;240 msec evidence of 2nd or 3rddegree atrioventricular block (excluding MobitzI) evidence of supraventricular or ventricular ectopy or arrhythmias corrected QT interval (QTc) (Bazett's or Fridericia's method) &gt;500 msec nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay &gt;120 msec STT wave abnormalities (excluding nonspecific STT wave abnormalities) indicative of acute ischemia/infarction right or left complete bundle branch block artificial pacemaker 8. The patient has a medical condition that may potentially be aggravated by an anticholinergic drug such as tiotropium, eg: The patient has a history or presence of glaucoma (particularly angleclosure glaucoma) The patient has symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia. The patient has a known history or any current evidence of renal impairment or urinary retention (eg, bladder outlet obstruction). This includes abnormal renal function test results at screening. 9.

Treatment with orally administered (excluding orally inhaled) βadrenergic agonists (ie, oral albuterol). 20. Recent initiation of treatment or dose titration with βadrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, nonselective βreceptor blocking agents such as βblocking antihypertensive products) administered by any route. Permitted exceptions are: (1) Patients treated on a stable dose of nonselective βreceptor blocking agents for 3 months prior to SV or longer may be considered for enrollment if expected to maintain the same dose throughout the study and (2) Patients on a stable dose of cardioselective β1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, atenolol, metaprolol, bisoprolol) for at least 1 week prior to the SV are permitted if expected to maintain the same dose throughout the study. 21. Treatment with drugs commonly recognized to prolong the QTc interval (eg, quinolones, amiodarone, disopyramide, quinidine, sotalol, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, ketoconazole, terfenadine, cisapride, and terodiline). 22.
