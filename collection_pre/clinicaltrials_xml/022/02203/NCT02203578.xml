	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies romidepsin in treating patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that has not responded to treatment with steroids. Romidepsin may be an effective treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Romidepsin in Treating Patients With Steroid-Refractory Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if romidepsin should be developed as a therapy for patients with steroid-refractory GVHD. OUTLINE: Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
