	<brief_summary>Although electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are now widely used, very little information exists regarding the effect of electronic cigarette use (vaping) on the respiratory system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the acute effect of one e-cig vaping session (30 puffs 30 seconds apart) on cough reflex sensitivity in healthy adult nonsmokers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Electronic Cigarette Use on Cough Reflex Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 adult nonsmokers will have their cough reflex sensitivity measured at baseline, 15 minutes after an e-cig vaping session, and 24 hours subsequently. One e-cig vaping session will consist of 30 puffs of an e-cg (Blu) 30 seconds apart, which will deliver the approximate nicotine amount delivered by one tobacco cigarette. Cough reflex sensitivity, defined as C5, the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs, is the standard end point of cough challenge studies.</detailed_description>
