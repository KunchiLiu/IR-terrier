	<brief_summary>Sjogren's Syndrome is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own glands in the body. Some of these glands are responsible for providing lubrication for the eye. As a result, individuals with Sjogren's Syndrome often experience dry eye. Recently, a study had shown that dry eye symptoms were improved by removing debris and old skin cells along the eyelid margin. This technique is called eyelid debridement-scaling. The purpose of this study is to determine how well this technique works in improving dry eye signs and symptoms in individuals with Sjogren's Syndrome.</brief_summary>

Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.</criteria>
