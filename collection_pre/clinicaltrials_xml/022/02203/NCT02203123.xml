	<brief_summary>- There is no definite tool for measurement of dehydration in children - Subjective clinical dehydration scale is considered as valuable scoring system, but it cannot be reliable among clinicians sometimes. - Some authors found Inferior vena cava/Aorta ratio can be a objective marker for dehydration - However, there is no evidence of correlation between clinical dehydration scale and inferior vena cava/aorta ratio - We will observe correlation between clinical dehydration scale and inferior vena cava/aorta ratio and change of the ratio according to hydration with intravenous normal saline infusion.</brief_summary>
