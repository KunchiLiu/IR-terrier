	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different dosing methods of epoetin alfa and their effectiveness in maintaining a Hemoglobin level between 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL. Study Hypothesis: An alternative dosing method to the United States package insert specified method can increase the percent of time Hemoglobin is within a prespecified range of 10.0 to11.0 g/dL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>If Alternate Dosing is Superior at Maintaining Hb Between 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL in CKD Subjects on HD vs the Current USPI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate if an alternative dosing algorithm using epoetin alfa is superior in maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) within10.0 to11.0 g/dL in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis (HD) when compared to dosing consistent with the United States package insert (USPI)</detailed_description>
