	<brief_summary>Despite improvements in analgesic treatment following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthrosis, a substantial part of patients still have severe acute pain after surgery. It has been suggested that preoperative degree of intraarticular inflammation is associated to postoperative degree of pain and level of function. Furthermore it is known, that patients with preoperative inflammation have hyperalgesia and severe movement related pain. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a preoperative intraarticular injection of Methylprednisoloneacetate in reducing acute postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty in patients with signs of severe pre-operative inflammation and pain.</brief_summary>
