	<brief_summary>The prevalence of cervical neoplasia in Cambodia is not known. There are no screening programs in place. The investigators plan on introducing a screening program based on WHO criteria and utilizing visualization with acetic acid. Patients who are positive will be offered same-day cryotherapy if indicated or will be referred for biopsy, LEEP and hysterectomy as indicated. The planned patient pool for this study is 1000 women, half of whom will be HIV positive (and thus have a presumed higher incidence of cervical neoplasia).</brief_summary>
