	<brief_summary>The latest randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of resistance training performed by older adults reported that the systematic use of exercise in machines improves muscle strength and power, functional abilities, body mass and body balance. However, the effect of resistance training with elastic tubes exercises have not been studied in all the variables described above. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of elastic tubes exercises on muscle mass, muscle strength, functional performance and postural control in elderly untrained.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Resistance Training in Untrained Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized clinical trial study (RCT) with 2 parallel arms. The subjects will be divided in 2 groups with a randomized block technique: Elastic Training Group (ETG) and Machine Training Group (MTG). The subjects will be submitted to a two-week familiarization period and then a sixteen-week of strength training program will be performed twice a week. This regimen of resistance training in both groups will consist of four exercises for lower limbs and four exercises for upper limbs which will be alternately performed with a one-minute interval between them during familiarization and training periods. Lower limb exercises will consist of: hip extension and abduction, and knee flexion and extension. Upper limb exercises will consist of: bench press, rowing, triceps and high pulley exercise.</detailed_description>
