	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to explore the relative bioavailability of increasing doses of BILR 355 BS, as a sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing solid formulation (SDS), in combination with ritonavir 100 mg and to explore the dose-concentration proportionality of increasing doses. A secondary objective was to explore the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of BILR 355 (SDS)</brief_summary>
