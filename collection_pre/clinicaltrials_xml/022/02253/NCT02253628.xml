	<brief_title>The Acute Effect of Coffee Consumption on Stomach, Self-reported Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Stress.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coffee consumption is very common in Greece. Many of the consumers support that certain types of coffee and especially instant coffee cause gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy individuals. Up to now, few studies have investigated the relationship between coffee consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms and stress in healthy individuals with conflicting results.Coffee consumption is related with increased gastric acid and gastrin secretion, however it does not seem to affect stomach or stomach walls. Stress, which characterizes modern lifestyle, also is found to increase gastric acid and gastrin secretion and seems to be exclusively responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms.</detailed_description>
