	<brief_summary>The investigators will recruit and enroll individuals that may have the KRAS-variant or other microRNA binding site mutations to join registry studies. The investigators will allow individuals to obtain their results through a physician at the completion of the studies. The investigators current focus is breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Validation of the Role of microRNA Binding Site Mutations in Cancer Risk, Prevention and Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have identified germ-line microRNA binding site mutations that predict an increased risk of cancer, endometriosis and associated infertility, and unique tumor biology and response to treatment. The goal of this protocol is to further determine the mechanisms of these mutations, such as the KRAS-variant, and their associations with human health, such as cancer. The investigators will collect saliva samples from individual patients who are eligible and choose to enroll in these studies, to test for the KRAS-variant and/or other mutations under study. With specific permission, the investigators will keep excess DNA to further investigate and discover additional similar mutations. The investigators purpose is to have participants answer questionnaires about lifestyle factors in an ongoing manner, to understand the impact of different factors on cancer risk for patients with these mutations.</detailed_description>
