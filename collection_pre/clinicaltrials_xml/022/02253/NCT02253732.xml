	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine specific changes in muscle secretory profile (myokines, miRNA) in association with neurodegenerative disease progression and metabolic dysfunction. Next the investigators would like to determine the shift in the muscle secretory activity induced by regular exercise intervention, which the investigators think could be translated into the beneficial changes in clinical phenotypes, determined by neuroimaging, cognitive function tests and metabolic phenotyping.</brief_summary>
