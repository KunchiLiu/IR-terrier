	<brief_summary>Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the most common route of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. After given standard immunoprophylaxis, MTCT still occurred in some infants born to a HBsAg positive mothers with high HBV DNA load. The main purpose of this study is evaluating the efficacy of methods used in blocking MTCT of HBV in infants born to a HBsAg positive mothers with high serum HBV DNA loads.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study contain 600 patients and compose groups as follow: (ⅰ) infants born to a HBsAg positive mothers with high HBV DNA load before delivery receive standard immunoprophylaxis( injection of HBIG 200IU at birth plus HBV vaccine at 0,1 and 6month); (ⅱ) infants born to a HBsAg positive mother with high HBV DNA load before delivery, and based on standard immunoprophylaxis receive addition injection of HBIG 200IU at 1 month after birth; (ⅲ) infants born to a HBsAg positive and high HBV DNA load mothers but treated with antiviral therapy in late pregnancy, receive standard immunoprophylaxis; (ⅳ) infants born to a HBsAg positive mothers treated with antiviral therapy during entire pregnancy for hepatitis receive standard immunoprophylaxis; (ⅴ) infants born to a HBsAg positive mother with serum HBV DNA negative receive standard immunoprophylaxis.</detailed_description>
