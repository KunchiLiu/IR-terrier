Laboratory values are considered to be acceptable if severity ≤ Grade 1 based on the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases / National Institutes of Health) (DAIDS) Grading Scale.

Subjects were excluded for these disorders greater than sixty days, if in the opinion of the investigator, the subject did not qualify as a healthy volunteer History of alcohol abuse Excessive cigarettes smoking defined as greater than 10 cigarettes per day Blood or plasma donations within 30 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2) Subjects with a seated systolic blood pressure either &lt;100 mm Hg or &gt;150 mm Hg; resting heart rate either &lt;50 beats/min or &gt;90 beats/min. For subjects with a resting heart rate below 50, due to high fitness level, the investigator could discuss exclusion with medical monitor on a casebycase basis Subjects with a history of any illness or allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering tipranavir, ritonavir or efavirenz to the subject Subjects who have an acute illness within 2 weeks prior to Day 0 (Visit 2). Subjects who are taking any overthecounter drug within 7 days prior to Day 0, (Visit 2) or are taking any prescription drug that, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation with the BIPI clinical monitor and pharmacokineticist, might interfere with either the absorption, distribution or metabolism of the test substances Subjects suffering from active forms of depression Subjects that had a history of suicidal ideations Known hypersensitivity to tipranavir, ritonavir, or efavirenz</criteria>
