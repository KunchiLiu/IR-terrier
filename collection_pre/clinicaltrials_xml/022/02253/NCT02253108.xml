	<brief_title>The OCT SORT-OUT VIII Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, open label, single blind, randomized study with inclusion of 160 patients in two equal sized cohorts (A and B). Angiographic follow-up with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed at 1 month (Cohort A) and 3 months (Cohort B). Randomization 1:1 to SYNERGY or BioMatrix Neoflex. The Cohorts are included consecutively, Cohort A first.</detailed_description>
