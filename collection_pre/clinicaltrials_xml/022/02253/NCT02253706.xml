	<brief_summary>In general bronchoscopy is a safe procedure with low rate of complications. Indeed, contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy are mostly relative rather than absolute. This is the case of preexisting decreased blood oxygen levels which may be present in patients requiring further bronchopulmonary investigation. To avoid the deleterious effects of oxygen drops oxygen supplementation is recommended. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of oxygen supplementation obtained with the use of a high flow nasal cannula compared with a low flow nasal cannula during flexible bronchoscopy. Consecutive patients referred by their treating physician for bronchoscopy will be offered to take part in the study. Those who wish to participate and give their consent will be randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups (supplemental oxygen given via low flow nasal cannula or via high flow nasal cannula). Assignment to either treatment arm will not affect in any way the intended purpose of the bronchoscopy. All patients will be closely monitored during the procedure and 2 hours following its completion. Monitoring will be conducted, using strictly non-invasive measures.</brief_summary>
