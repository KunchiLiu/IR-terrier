	<brief_title>Motivational Interviewing (MI) to Reduce Khat Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The leaves of the khat tree are traditionally chewed in some African and Arab countries. They contain the mild central stimulant cathinone. In recent years, the production, trade and use has dramatically increased and excessive patterns of use as well as a specific dependence syndrome have been described. So far, no experiences exist in psychological treatment of khat addiction. In this study, we use a brief motivational intervention based on the WHO's ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention and Motivational Interviewing to support users who have the intention to reduce or stop their khat use. Khat users will be recruited in the community. Trained local staff will assess participant's khat and other substance use at study entry and one month later. Users will be assigned randomly to intervention or waiting list control groups. The intervention group will receive a single 20-minute brief intervention. The waiting list will receive the same intervention after the second assessment. After two months, a final assessment will be made in both groups.</detailed_description>
