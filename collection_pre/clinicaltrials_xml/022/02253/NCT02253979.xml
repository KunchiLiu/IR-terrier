	<brief_summary>Double lumen tube (DLT) is an enotracheal tube that facilitates one lung ventilation. The DLT exact position in the airways is verified by fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) after intubation. The VivaSight TM DL is a single use left DLT with a camera embedded in the tube's right side port. This study was designed to compare the VivaSightTM DL to the standard DLT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of VivaSightTM Double Lumen Tube With a Conventional Double Lumen Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double lumen tube (DLT) is an enotracheal tube that facilitates one lung ventilation. The efficiency of the DLT depends on its exact position in the airways, as verified by fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) after intubation, and re-verified after positioning the patient on the lateral position. The VivaSight TM DL is a single use left DLT with a camera embedded in the tube's right side port. The view from the camera appears continuously on a monitor. This study was designed to compare the VivaSightTM DL to the standard DLT. The primary end point is the time required for intubation with visual confirmation of DLT position.</detailed_description>
