	<brief_summary>The primary goals of this study are to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (blood vessel mapping) to: 1. diagnose the presence of new blood vessels in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 2. evaluate patients undergoing treatment for wet AMD 3. determine if reduced flow to the choroid is a risk factor for developing wet AMD.</brief_summary>
