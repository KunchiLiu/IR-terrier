	<brief_summary>In summary, copanlisib is metabolized mainly by the CYP3A4 enzyme, thus a study to evaluate potential DDI (drug-drug interaction) of copanlisib with concomitant CYP3A4 modulators such as Itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) and Rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) is necessary. With this regard this study aims to evaluate the effect of Itraconazole or Rifampin on the absorbtion, distribution, metabolization and elimination of Copanlisib (BAY80-6946) . In addition, as parameters of cardiovascular safety , the effect of copanlisib on the heart's ability to pump blood and to rule out copanlisib's potential for causing a specific type of life-threatening arrhythmia, QT/QTc intervals and left ventricular ejection fraction will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copanlisib (BAY80-6946) Drug-drug Interaction and Cardiovascular Safety Study in Advanced Solid Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is one of the prominent pathways that promote cellular survival and constitutively is activated in many types of cancer. Class I PI3K receptor is downstream of most cancer associated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors. PI3K inhibitors are expected to be effective not only in PI3K pathway-driven tumors but also in combination with other chemotherapy agents. The management of metabolic effects is an issue that must be addressed in the development of anticancer agents targeting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) is a novel PI3K inhibitor being developed for the treatment of advanced and refractory malignancies.</detailed_description>
