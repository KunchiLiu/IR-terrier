	<brief_summary>The use of compression bandages in elective orthopaedic knee surgery is well regarded, however, there is a lack of robust, well-designed evidence to support this. The aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised control trial comparing the use of a compression bandage worn post-operatively for 24 hours after elective total knee replacement, compared to standard practice (wool and crepe, non-compressive dressing).</brief_summary>
