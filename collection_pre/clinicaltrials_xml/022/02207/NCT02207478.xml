	<brief_title>ENB-GS-TBLB for the Diagnosis of PPLs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and bronchial brushing using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) with a guide sheath (GS) for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) with radiographic fluoroscopy.The study is designed as a two-center prospective randomized controlled trial. The participating centers are Department of pulmonary medicine and endoscope department, Shanghai chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University, China. Department of pulmonary medicine, Shanghai ZhongShan Hospitial affiliated to Shanghai FuDan University, China.Patients are divided into two groups, ENB-GS-TBLB-X-ray group and GS-TBLB-X-ray group.Each subject will be randomized to each group.The study is expected to enroll 60 patients at 2 centers (Shanghai Chest Hospital: 40, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital: 20).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. clinical and imaging characteristics suggestive of maligancy 2. CT scan appearance of the PPLs showed the longest diameter was more than 1 cm and solid lesions. 1. The lesion is close to the pleural membrane 2. Refusal of participation 3. Severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and other indications that can't receive bronchoscopy</criteria>
