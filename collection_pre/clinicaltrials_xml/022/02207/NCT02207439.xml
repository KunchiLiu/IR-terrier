	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) given with the protease inhibitor,Nelfinavir (NFV), in patients with locally advanced head and neck. Eligible patients will receive a "lead-in" period of Nelfinavir (1250 mg po bid) for 7-14 days prior to initiation of CTRT. Nelfinavir will then be given concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy (planned total dose of 70 Gy over 7 weeks).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 years old. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx stages III, IVa, or IVb, p16negative on immunohistochemistry Determined by the treating physician to be a candidate for organ preserving, concurrent standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the head and neck with definitive intent. ECOG Performance Status 02 Patients must sign an informed consent document that indicates they are aware of the investigational nature of the treatment in this protocol as well as the potential risks and benefits. The effects of EF5 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, during study, until 1 month after completion of the final 18FEF5 PET/CT scan. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Serum pregnancy testing will be required for women of childbearing potential. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria Prior radiation therapy to the head and neck Prior chemotherapy within the past 5 years Previous therapy with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients with known HIV disease. These patients have a high probability of treatment with antiretroviral therapy which may interact with the nelfinavir. Absolute Neutrophil Count ≤ 1500 per mm3 Platelet count ≤ 100,000 per mm3 Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal Serum AST or ALT &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.2 mg/dl Weight loss of &gt; 10% over the past 6 months which is due to tumor wasting syndrome Distant metastases Patients receiving the following drugs that are contraindicated with NFV will be excluded: Antiarrhythmics:amiodarone, quinidine, Antimycobacterial: rifampin, Ergot Derivatives:dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, Herbal Products: St.John's wort (hypericum perforatum), HMGCoA Reductase Inhibitors: lovastatin,simvastatin, Neuroleptic:pimozide, Proton Pump Inhibitors, Sedative/Hypnotics: midazolam, triazolam, Patients receiving the following drugs will be clinically evaluated as to whether dosage/medication can be changed to permit patient on study: AntiConvulsants: carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, AntiConvulsant:phenytoin, AntiMycobacterial:rifabutin, PDE5 Inhibitors: sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, HMGCoA: Reductase Inhibitors: atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine,tacrolimus, sirolimus, Narcotic Analgesic: methadone, Oral Contraceptive:ethinyl estradiol, Macrolide Antibiotic:azithromycin, Inhaled/nasal steroid fluticasone, Antidepressant: trazodone. Women of childbearing potential who have a positive result on screening urine pregnancy test. Subjects with moderatesevere renal disease. History of allergic reactionsattributed to Flagyl (metronidazole), which has a chemical structure similar to EF5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
