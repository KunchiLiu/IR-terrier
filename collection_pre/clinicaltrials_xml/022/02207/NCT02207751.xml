	<brief_summary>The objective is to understand the best way to place Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) catheters, and the best way to collect data regarding their function in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Phase 1: We will carry out a detailed examination of existing returned pilot data with emphasis on data fields with poor data completeness and perform root cause analysis, and assess deficiencies in data field definition to identify improvements to be implemented. We will construct and disseminate electronic survey material to all study centres with targeted visits by the Principle Investigator undertaken. These visits will facilitate insight into local organization of data collection including interaction with designated individuals responsible for data returns. PD training days will be organized with emphasis on clinical practice feedback utilizing data acquired in the initial phases. Hospital Episode Statistics will be linked to existing acquired PD patient information to ensure the accuracy of collected data. An online data acquisition system will be developed to allow direct data entry from centres. Phase 2: On-going and sustained data acquisition performed on a prospective basis. Phase 3: Primary data analysis including clinical practice variation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to identify site specific PD catheter functionality variation. Additionally, patient and site specific characteristics that predict clinical outcomes in PD will be identified and characterised. Phase 4: Clinical guidelines will be developed.</brief_summary>
