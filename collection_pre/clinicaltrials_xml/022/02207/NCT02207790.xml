	<brief_summary>This study is primarily designed to bridge the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data for E2609 between Japanese subjects and non-Japanese (ie, white) subjects. To bridge these PK characteristics, the proposed study includes a cohort of white subjects treated for comparison with the cohort of Japanese subjects treated at the same dose. This comparison serves as a key PK bridge in assessing ethnic factors that may contribute to differences in plasma concentrations. Pharmacokinetic assessments in the proposed study will include confirmation of dose proportionality in Japanese subjects. This study will also evaluate safety and tolerability in Japanese subjects.</brief_summary>
