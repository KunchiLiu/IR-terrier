	<brief_summary>Recurrent herpes labialis are usually a minor malady of limited duration, although they are often painful and are uniformly discomforting for patients. Oral antivirals represent an advance in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis, but the clinical implications are modest. Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown that oral antivirals decrease the duration of lesion episodes and pain by approximately one day. In recurrent HSV infections including herpes labialis, many instances of viral re-activation occur without symptoms, and can only be identified by detection of virus on the lips of infected individuals. In these cases, the virus is cleared from the local site without the development of a classical ulcerative herpes lesion. In the other cases, the triggered specific immune response rapidly stops viral replication in the skin and also causes the development of the herpes lesion prodrome and a considerable part of the symptoms associated with a classical ulcerative herpes lesion. One could therefore predict that treatment with an antiviral drug alone would help the immune system in shortening the virus replication, but may not substantially reduce the disfiguring symptoms caused by the immune reaction. In dermatology, the principle of using an anti-inflammatory drug improve clinical outcomes by reducing inflammation-related symptoms associated with the infection has been well established. We have found that a topical formulation of VDO is useful for alleviating pain and inflammation associated with infection caused by herpes virus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of Topical VDO for the Treatment of Herpes Simplex Labialis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the treatment of oral herpes labialis, it is desirable to have local absorption of the drug to provide pain relief directly at the lesion sites while minimizing overall exposure. The present study is designed to elucidate the effects of VDO ( on recurrent herpes simplex labialis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female in the age group 20 to 75 years old. History of recurrent herpes labialis with at least one recurrence occurred during the past twentyfour months. Onset of prodrome, erythema or vesicle within 72 hours of initiation of treatment with the study drug. Subjects with previous herpes simplex labialis episodes must be healed for at least 14 days before the baseline. Must be willing and able to participate and to provide written informed consent. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and agree to use a proper contraceptive method during the study. Women during pregnancy, lactation or breastfeeding. Subjects using topical steroids on or near the face or systemic (oral, intravenous) steroids within 7 days prior to study drug administration; use of inhaled or nasal spray steroids does not exclude a subject from the study. Subjects have used antiviral agents or NSAID in the preceding 7 days. Subjects are unwilling to stop for using topical medical, OTC, cosmetic or facial skin care products in or around the oral area during the study period. Subjects with immunodeficiency disorders such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or receiving cancer chemotherapy. Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to diclofenac, lidocaine or propylene glycol. Subjects who have a known hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type, diclofenac, aspirin, or other NSAIDs. Subjects who are taking antiarrhythmics drug during screening visitï¼› Subjects who have a history of asthma, urticaria, or other allergictype reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Subjects who use during the perioperative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within 6 months before the study drug using. Subjects have history of substance abuse or psychiatric illness that would preclude compliance with the protocol. Subjects who have serious, unstable, or clinically significant medical or psychological conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator(s), would compromise the subject's participation in the study (including clinically significant dehydration or unstable vital signs). Subjects taking or having taken any other experimental drugs, drugs not approved in Taiwan, or participating in or having participated in other clinical studies in the 30 days prior to this clinical trial. Subjects who are considered unreliable as to medication compliance or adherence to scheduled appointments, or inappropriate for inclusion determined by the investigators.</criteria>
