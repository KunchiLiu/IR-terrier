	<criteria>1. Positive for antiHCV Ab (Antibody) and HCV RNA &gt;1,000 IU/mL at Screening. 2. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1 infection. 3. Subject has never received antiviral treatment for hepatitis C infection (treatmentnaive subject) or subject has received previous treatment with peginterferon with or without RBV with nonresponse (HCV RNA quantifiable at end of treatment or relapsed after end of treatment). 4. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 as estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method. 1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 2. Positive test result for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antiHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV Ab). 3. Any current or past clinical evidence of ChildPugh B or C classification or clinical history of liver decompensation such as ascites (noted on physical exam), variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy.</criteria>
