	<brief_summary>To investigate the effect of anteroposterior weight shifting training with visual biofeedback on step length asymmetry. Reduced speed and asymmetry of stepping is a specific characteristic of hemiplegic gait. Asymmetry of stepping is characterized by shorter step length of the unaffected limb compared to the affected limb. Causes of this phenomenon are difficulty in weight bearing at the affected limb, weak propulsive force of the affected limb, and decreased strength of hip extensors. To correct these factors. we have developed an anteroposterior weight shifting training system with visual feedback and studied its effects.</brief_summary>
