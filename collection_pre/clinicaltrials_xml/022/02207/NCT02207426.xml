	<brief_summary>This study compares pharmacokinetic profiles of tobramycin delivered by TobrAir® 6.0 device with TOBI® nebulizer system and the TOBI® Podhaler™ device. In addition, lung deposition of tobramycin delivered by TobrAir® 6.0 device and by TOBI® nebulizer system will be determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacoscintigraphic Comparison of TobrAir® 6.0 With TOBI® and TOBI® Podhaler™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, cross-over study in healthy subjects. Each subject receives tobramycin with 3 different inhalation devices: - 75 mg tobramycin delivered to the airways via TobrAir® 6.0. - 300 mg tobramycin (TOBI®) delivered to the airways via the PARI LC® PLUS/PARI TurboBoy® SX. - 112 mg tobramycin (4x28mg dry powder capsules) delivered to the airways via the TOBI® Podhaler™. Each dose is separated by a minimum washout of at least 68 h. Blood samples for PK analysis of tobramycin will be collected at regular time intervals until 24 h post-dose. For TobrAir 6.0 and TOBI/PARI only, all dosed subjects will undergo scintigraphic assessments.</detailed_description>
