	<brief_summary>This protocol describes the investigation of the use of hyperpolarised helium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in reflecting the regional differences in lung function of moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. Since finalisation of the original protocol, new medications for COPD have received Market Authorisation Approvals. Protocol Amendment 02 has been prepared to include these medications in the protocol eligibility criteria and restrictions for the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Helium-3 MRI Imaging Study in COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide. COPD is characterized by progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. It has become clear that simple measures of airflow obstruction are inadequate to relate lung function to exercise capacity or symptoms, and that complex expressions such as dynamic hyper-inflation need to be invoked in seeking to understand overall physiology. In addition to abnormalities of air flow, gas exchange is also deranged. Therefore in considering new treatment approaches, both abnormalities need to be addressed. Techniques to study ventilation variation and perfusion matching across the lung exist but are invasive and exacting, and do not give an indication of the anatomical distribution of changes. There is a clear need for techniques which can provide sensitive, useful and safe repeated measures reflecting regional changes in ventilation and gas exchange in COPD. This study investigates use of hyperpolarised helium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in reflecting the regional differences in lung function of moderate to severe COPD patients. A Beta2 bronchodilator - Salbutamol - and a anticholinergic - Ipratropium - will be used in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) diagnosis: an established clinical history of chronic pulmonary disorder in accordance with the following description by the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society [ATS / ETS, 2004] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences. The patient is clinically stable with no change in symptoms or medication, no admissions to hospital, and with neither antibiotic therapy nor systemic steroid use for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. (Screening may be rescheduled after an appropriate period of stability) Male and female patients aged ≥50 years A female patient is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥40 M1U/mL and estradiol ≤ 40 pg/mL (≤140 pmol/L) is confirmatory). Subjects have refrained from shortacting bronchodilators for 8 hours, longacting β2agonists (including any longacting β2 agonist containing inhaler) and theophyllines for 24 hours and Tiotropium, phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) inhibitors (e.g. Roflumilast) and ultra longacting betaadrenoceptor agonists (e.g. Indacaterol) for 48 hours prior to admission to the unit on study days. Subjects with a postbronchodilator FEV1 to FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC) &lt; 0.7 Subjects with a postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 30% and ≤ 80% of predicted normal for height, age and sex at screening. Subjects with a cigarette smoking history of ≥10 pack years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year or the equivalent). Both current and former smokers are eligible to be enrolled. Resting SpO2 of &gt;90% on room air QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block (based on a single ECG value). The patient is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions, and to give informed consent. Unstable cardiac disease or history of clinically significant arrhythmia (including established atrial fibrillation). Patients with a primary diagnosis of α1 antitrypsin deficiency. Patients with other significant respiratory disorders. Patients with any acute infection, exacerbation of COPD or other unstable medical condition. Patients in whom inhaled beta2 agonists or anticholinergics are contraindicated. Patients who have undergone thoracic surgery including lung volume reduction surgery or have conditions that prevent them from performing spirometry and other physiological testing. Patients who are non Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible (ferromagnetic metallic implants, pacemakers) as per the MRI questionnaire. Patients with renal complaints relating to potential adverse reactions to GdDTPA intravascular MRI contrast agent. Patients who suffer from claustrophobia. The patient has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first study day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) of that study. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Subjects must abstain from taking prescription (not related to their COPD) or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins and dietary or herbal supplements), within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first study day until completion of the followup visit, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.</criteria>
