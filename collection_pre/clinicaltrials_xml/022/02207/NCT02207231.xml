	<brief_title>A Study of Guselkumab in the Treatment of Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque-Type Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab in participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis (scaly skin rash). The active comparator study drug is adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100 mg dose regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). All participants will receive guselkumab every 8 weeks (q8w) from Week 52 through Week 148 (open label treatment period). The end of the study is defined as the time the last participant completes the Week 160 visit. Participants will primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16. The total duration of the study will be approximately 164 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants will be monitored for safety throughout the study.</detailed_description>
