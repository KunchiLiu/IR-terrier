	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the total costs of care associated with uncomplicated elective or low-risk urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) through 30-day follow up are lower among patients who are randomly assigned to same day discharge (SDD) or overnight hospital stay (ON).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Costs Realized After Percutaneous Coronary intervenTion Employing Same Day Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized clinical trial of same day discharge versus overnight stay for patients undergoing uncomplicated elective or low-risk urgent PCI with uncomplicated post-PCI recovery. The outcome is total cost accrued by patients from the time of index hospital presentation through 30-day post-PCI follow-up. Conduct of PCI procedures and provision of post-PCI care will be in accordance with routine institutional practices and will not be protocol-driven. Consented patients will be assigned to SDD or ON stay using a block randomization schedule. Randomization will occur once the patient has completed an uncomplicated 6-hour post PCI observation period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Consecutive patients who undergo elective or lowrisk, (i.e., in the setting of unstable angina but not nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction) urgent PCI. No sociodemographic factors that would preclude SDD (prohibitive factors include no family member/friend available to remain with patient until nurse phone call the following day, no working phone, no reliable transportation, home &gt; 60 minutes from medical infrastructure, unable to obtain/pay for medications). PCI procedures performed between 08/04/14 and 08/03/16. Short term risk of inhospital death, transfusion or contrastinduced nephropathy during the index hospitalization at or below 1% using Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) PCI registry risk prediction models. No inlab complications (prolonged angina, acute closure, no reflow, significant or untreated dissection, vessel perforation, side branch occlusion, rescue glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation requiring cardioversion/defibrillation, tamponade, pulmonary edema, stroke or transient ischemic attack, shock). Contrast Volume/Calculated Creatinine Clearance ratio &lt; 3 No recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, hemodynamic instability, bleeding or vascular complications during 6 hours in recovery area postPCI Use of rotational atherectomy Use of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion postPCI</criteria>
