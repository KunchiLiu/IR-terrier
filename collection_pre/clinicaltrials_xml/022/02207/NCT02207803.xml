	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in Latin America experience high levels of disability and extremely poor functional outcomes, and their informal caregivers play a key role in their rehabilitation and care. To improve TBI rehabilitation through stronger informal caregiving, the proposed study will develop and evaluate an evidence--based and culturally sensitive Transition Assistance Program for informal caregivers of patients with TBI in Latin America during the patient's transition from hospital to home. This study will generate findings that can provide empirically supported guidance to clinicians regarding the provision of culturally tailored rehabilitation services for TBI caregivers in Latin America and in the U.S.</brief_summary>
