	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to document the left and right ventricular function in patients with sclerodermia associated pulmonal arterial hypertension via 3D echocardiography. The results of this study should help to generate hypothesis for further future studies. The primary hypothesis is that the increased use of modern image guided methods could provide essential aspects for the follow up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Echo Evaluation of the Ventricles in Sclero Associated Severe PAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 3D echocardiography could provide early and detailed information about the changes in the left and right ventricle. The prediction of sclerodermia associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is rather adverse, so it makes sense to evaluate relevant changes of the left-ventricular longitudinal strain soon to adapt the PAH specific therapy accordingly.</detailed_description>
