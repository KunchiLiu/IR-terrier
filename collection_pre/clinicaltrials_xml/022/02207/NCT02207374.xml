	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate safety and efficacy of semaglutide once weekly in monotherapy or in combination with one OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes who are insufficiently controlled on diet/exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy. All subjects will continue their pre-trial treatment (diet and exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy in addition to diet and exercise therapy) during the trial.</brief_summary>
