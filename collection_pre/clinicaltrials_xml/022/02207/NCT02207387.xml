	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of a contingency-based musical walking intervention program called Ambulosono on neural mechanisms in the brain. The investigators will investigate the long-term impact of Ambulosono on brain plasticity with functional MRI technique. Participants will undergo 3 months of Ambulosono training and their pre-training and post-training fMRI brain scans will be compared to understand the neural networks and brain mechanisms following this intervention. The investigators hypothesized that Ambulosono may induce functional compensatory reorganization of neural networks in the brain. This project will allow us to address the important potential confound of placebo influence and to aid in optimizing this intervention program. Additionally, the investigators are hoping to investigate the synergistic effects of rasagiline and exercise; the investigators' hypothesis is that there will be a positive synergistic effect, and that exercise will augment the effectiveness of rasagiline in treating Parkinson's symptoms.</brief_summary>
