	<brief_summary>Gut microbiota are involved in the regulation of mammalian metabolic pathways through host-microbiota metabolic, signaling, and immune-inflammatory interactions that physiologically connect the gut, liver, brain, and other organs. Correlation of these metabotypes with gut microbial profiles facilitates deciphering inherent host-microbe relationships. Microbiome sequencing have generated novel insights into the role of gut microbial composition in health and disease, but are limited in addressing the microbial contribution to host metabolism and the gut microbial dysbiosis in disease. This is an exploratory trial, aiming to examine how gut microbial conditions determine response to dietary challenge by measuring urine, plasma and stool metabolites resulting from metabolism of protein, polyamines and bile acids in combination with stool bacterial composition. The focus of this trial is to evaluate impact of protein based food challenges, based on cross-over design of two diet challenges of animal and vegan protein sources.</brief_summary>
