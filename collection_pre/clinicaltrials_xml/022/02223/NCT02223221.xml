	<brief_summary>Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial disorder which affects about 1% of all couples and challenges both patients and clinicians technically and emotionally. IVF clinics see higher prevalence of RPL, since many RPL patients are seeking for assist reproduction treatment with or without other infertile factors. Guidelines for evaluation and treatment of RPL patients include screening for uterine abnormalities, parental chromosomes, autoimmune antibodies and cure gynecological infections, but there are still half of RPL patients remain unexplained. The documented high incidence of chromosomal errors in first-trimester miscarriages and an increased rate of aneuploidy in patients with RPL has led to the theory that screening embryos before implantation for aneuploidy may decrease the risk of a subsequent loss and serve as a possible treatment. The technology, indications of use, and even terminology for genetic testing of embryos have greatly changed since the first PGD(pre-implantation genetic diagnosis) baby was born in 1990. The current best evidence shows blastocyst biopsy followed by new rapid comprehensive chromosome screening(termed pre-implantation chromosomal screening or comprehensive chromosome screening, PCS or CCS, or the investigators generally termed PGS) based on array-comprehensive genome hybridization(aCGH), single nucleotide polymorphism array(SNP-array) or next generation sequencing(NGS), to be the most powerful technology. However, for whom this PGS technique is most suitable to achieve improved clinical outcome have not yet been identified by well defined, ITT based research with carefully selected control and adequate sample size. The investigators research is to determine whether in vitro fertilization (IVF)/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) combined with SNP-array based pre-implantation comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) will improve the clinical outcome of infertile female patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion history.</brief_summary>
