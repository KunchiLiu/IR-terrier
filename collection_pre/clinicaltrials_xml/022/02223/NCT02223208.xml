	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter study that includes two phases: 1. A phase I study to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Romidepsin in addition to CHOEP-21 and to test the safety and feasibility of CHOEP-21 in combination with dose escalation of Romidepsin (8, 10, 12, 14 mg). The dose level defined as MTD of Romidepsin will be used for the subsequent phase II study. 2. A phase II study to evaluate the efficacy (response rate, progression free survival and overall survival) and safety of Ro-CHOEP-21 incorporated into a treatment strategy including SCT.</brief_summary>
