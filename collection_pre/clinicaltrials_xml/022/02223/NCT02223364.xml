	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the investigators current total joint regional anesthesia pathway of continuous femoral nerve block plus single-injection sciatic block with multimodal analgesia (MC1156-462rev0114) is more effective than two other pathways utilizing periarticular local anesthesia injections for numeric rating score (NRS) of pain with movement after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on postoperative day 1 morning. The periarticular injections include one consisting of ropivacaine and the other consisting of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel).</brief_summary>
