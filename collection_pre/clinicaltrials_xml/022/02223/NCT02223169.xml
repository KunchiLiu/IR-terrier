	<brief_summary>Heart disease and stroke are the most common cause of death in Ireland today.One of the main risk factors for heart disease and stroke is high blood pressure or hypertension. Research has found that certain specific proteins or peptides found in foods such as dairy, meat, fish and eggs may promote heart health reducing blood pressure in adults with hypertension. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential beneficial effects egg peptides may have on heart health, in particular, effects on blood pressure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor dietary habits of Irish adults has been accompanied by epidemics of obesity and metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes leading to a substantial predicted increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.Hypertension is a major contributing factor to the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Dietary factors play a significant role in the prevention and/or treatment of hypertension and therefore the development of foods with antihypertensive properties could prove beneficial.</detailed_description>
