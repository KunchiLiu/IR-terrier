It is the first study in the world to investigate the safety and efficacy of S1 capsule using in stageⅡ and Ⅲa non-small cell lung cancer patients after the complete resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Observation of S1 Capsule for Stage Ⅱ-ⅢA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Complete Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Only about 15.6% of all lung cancer patients are alive 5years or more after diagnosis. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. For individuals with stage Ⅱ-ⅢA NSCLC after complete resection, platinum-based chemotherapy is the mainstay of first line treatment. Various treatment regimens have been developed to improve survival. S-1 capsule is an novel oral anticancer drug that combines tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, with gimeracil and oteracil potassium. S-1 capsule was considered to be an active single agent against NSCLC.</detailed_description>
