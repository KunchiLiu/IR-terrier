	<brief_summary>Prospective, multicenter study following for 2 years, 250 children who presented during the first trimester of pregnancy an isolated nuchal translucency over the 95th percentile of Nicolaïdes Curves on ultrasound and comparing them to a control group of 250 children whose pregnancy was normal. Evaluating morbidity, mortality, growth and the neurodevelopment of each group by a Brunet Lezine scale. Evaluating anxiety and depression in parents of those children using a scale.</brief_summary>

Matching each child the "nuchal group" on: Maternity Birth: matching the child witness in the University Hospital of the same region as motherhood in which the child with nuchal group is born. gestational age: the child matched group must belong to the same group of gestational age than neck the child with nuchal group ≥ 37 weeks ≥ 32 and &lt;37 weeks with a less than 2 SA difference Weight: if the weight of the child of nuchal group is ≥ 2500g, the weight of the child must also be matched to ≥ 2500g and with a weight difference between the two children ≤ 500g If the weight of the child of nuchal group is ≥ 1500g and less than 2500g, the weight of the child must also be matched to ≥ 1500g and less than 2500 g and with a weight difference between the two children ≤ 200g Apgar score at 5 minutes: the difference in Apgar score at 5 minutes between the two children should be zero or at most equal to 1 birth: same according to the following criteria: primipara Multiparous Consent signed holders of parental authority for neurodevelopmental assessment and monitoring at the age of 2 years.
