	<brief_title>Effect of ACT-451840 Against Early Plasmodium Falciparum Blood Stage Infection in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study was to characterize the activity of ACT-451840 administered orally on clearance of Plasmodium falciparum blood stage parasites from the blood in healthy subjects .The inoculum used for blood stage Plasmodium falciparum challenge (BSPC) contained an estimated 1,800 viable parasite-infected erythrocytes diluted into 2 mL of normal saline for injection. Blood was collected for malaria parasitemia assessment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Parasitemia ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL indicated that the subjects should be treated with ACT-451840 . If PCR counts were &gt; 5,000 parasites/mL and symptomatic they were dosed within 24 hours. Subsequent PCR blood sampling were performed prior to ACT-451840 dosing and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 120, 144 hours post-dosing and then approximately times per week until 2 consecutive negative samples, until Riamet® rescue treatment and at the final visit.</detailed_description>

Clinically significant disease or condition that might affect drug absorption, distribution or excretion. Any investigational product study within the 12 weeks preceding the study. Participation in a research study involving blood sampling greater than 450 mL/ unit of blood, or blood donation to a blood bank during the 8 weeks preceding the reference drug dose in the study. Subject unwilling to defer blood donations for 6 months. Blood donation within 1 month before inclusion. Medical requirement for intravenous immunoglobulin or blood transfusions. Previous blood transfusion. Symptomatic postural hypotension.

Positive alcohol test. Preexisting prolongation of the interval from beginning of the Q wave until end of the T wave corrected according to Bazett's formula (QTcB interval ) and considered clinically significant. Family history of sudden death, congenital prolongation of QTc interval, known congenital prolongation of QTc interval, or any clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or clinically relevant bradycardia. Electrolyte disturbances. ECG abnormalities at screening which in the opinion of the investigator is clinically relevant or will interfere with the ECG analysis. History of clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

Any history or presence of lactose intolerance. Ingestion of any drug since the recruitment interview (other than the doses administered in this study) which, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the study. Ingestion of any drug in the week prior to dosing or during the blood sampling period which, in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the study. Failure to conform to the requirements of the protocol. Detection of any drug listed in the protocol in the urine drug screen unless there was an explanation acceptable to the investigator. Vital signs outside the reference range and clinically significant.</criteria>
