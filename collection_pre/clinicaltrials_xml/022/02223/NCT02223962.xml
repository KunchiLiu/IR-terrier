	<brief_summary>Severe exacerbations are prevalent in a subgroup of patients with COPD and generally warrant a hospitalization. During the hospitalization, patients are extremely physically inactive with only a limited recovery one month after discharge. Physical inactivity is associated with negative health benefits. Therefore intervening in the period after and exacerbation seems useful to improve the levels of physical activity. Physical activity counseling and real-time feedback have already been applied in stable patients with COPD, with beneficial effects.The present study will investigate whether this specific intervention will help to improve the activity level in patients after an acute exacerbation. Further we investigated the effects of the intervention on improvements in functional exercise capacity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Physical Activity Counseling After an Exacerbation in COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After signing the informed consent, the patients will be randomized into a control group, receiving usual care, or the intervention group receiving real-time feedback and physical activity counseling. Intervention: Physical activity counseling will be provided by 3 weekly telephone contacts based on the step count from the Fitbit Ultra. In agreement with the patient and based on the step counts a patients provided, a new goal for the next week was set. The goal was to strive for the highest possible level of physical activity during one month.</detailed_description>
