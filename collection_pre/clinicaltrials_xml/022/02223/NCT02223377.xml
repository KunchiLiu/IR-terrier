	<brief_summary>Currently nearly 70% or more surgeries are being done as ambulatory (day care) procedures as they offer significant benefit to the patients as well as to the hospitals. Inadequate pain relief (30%-40%) and nausea-vomiting form the leading factors affecting the quality of care and hence its efficiency. Opioids form the primary modality to treat moderate to severe pain, but can also cause significant nausea-vomiting and other side effects. Although hydromorphone is five times more potent than morphine, in equianalgesic doses they both could provide similar pain relief. They both exert no ceiling effect for their analgesia, and hence incomplete or inadequate analgesia is related to the appearance of side effects. In this study the investigators shall assess the proportion of patients who satisfy the outcome of 'satisfactory analgesia with minimal nausea-vomiting' in ambulatory surgeries, assessed at 2 hours after surgery. Patients would be randomized to receive either morphine or hydromorphone in the surgical recovery area. All personnel involved with the study would be blinded. The investigators will also look to assess the time to discharge and other side effects. This will help to choose the better drug, thereby improving pain relief and side effects, and also the efficiency of health care delivery.</brief_summary>
