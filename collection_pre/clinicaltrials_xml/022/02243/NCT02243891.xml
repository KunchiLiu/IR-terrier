	<brief_summary>The study will test the hypothesis that ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in hypertensive subjects is more effective when a ROX coupler is inserted concurrently.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AF Ablation With or Without ROX Coupler Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The single blinded, randomised study is planned to commence in October 2014 after obtaining Research Ethics Committee and NHS Research and Development approval. A target of 20 participants with symptomatic paroxysmal AF will be recruited. All participants will be blinded and randomised to AF ablation only or AF ablation + ROX coupler implant. All participants will have right and left heart catheterisation prior to AF ablation +/- ROX coupler insertion. Participants will be followed up 6 weeks, 3, 6 months and 12 months after the ablation. The study will take place at Eastbourne District General. The study duration per patient is 13months. The overall study duration will be 18 months.</detailed_description>
