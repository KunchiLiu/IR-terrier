	<brief_summary>The investigators are creating a data and specimen repository to study causes , early detection, prevention and treatment of colon and rectal cancer. The investigators are collecting data and specimens (blood, stool, urine and tissue) from people who have colon or rectal cancer, or who are risk for developing colorectal cancer or had normal colonoscopies. Data and samples are held in the repository until there are enough to be used for a large study or until there are new techniques that can be used to test them. The GI SPORE Program at the University of Michigan maintains a repository of specimens for colorectal diseases that the investigators hope will help fuel new research. The investigators hope that this work may lead to new treatments or earlier detection of colorectal cancer or improved diagnosis and treatment of other colon and rectal diseases.</brief_summary>
