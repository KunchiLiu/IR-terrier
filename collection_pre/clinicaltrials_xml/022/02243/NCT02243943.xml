	<brief_summary>Suboptimal reversal of neuromuscular blockage after surgery is possibly related to unfavorable postoperative respiratory conditions and elevated pain levels. Rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular block was not possible untill sugammadex was discovered. The investigators hyposthesise that reversal with sugammadex leads to favorable postoperative respiratory conditions and less pain compared to reversal with neostigmine.</brief_summary>
