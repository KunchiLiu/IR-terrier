	<brief_summary>The effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) remain controversial. Many studies have examined the effect IMT has on exercise performance, but any changes to the body that come from IMT have yet to be looked at. This study will look at how someone breathes can change after IMT. Understanding how IMT changes the body can help us use IMT in different treatments.</brief_summary>
