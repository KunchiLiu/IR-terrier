	<criteria>1. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2. Men and women (nonpregnant and using a medically approved birthcontrol method) aged at least 18 years at screening. 3. T2D patients treated with stable metformin monotherapy for at least 8 weeks prior to screening. Metformin dose should be ≥ 1500 mg/day (or individual maximally tolerated dose), but not more than the maximum dose specified in the label 4. HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11.0% at screening or within 4 weeks prior to screening (by local laboratory) and HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 11.0% at prerandomization visit (by central laboratory) 5. FPG ≤ 13.3 mmol/L (≤ 240 mg/dL) at prerandomization visit (by central laboratory) 6. Able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply with the study protocol 1. Women who are pregnant, intending to become pregnant during the study period, lactating females, or women of childbearing potential not using highly effective, medically approved birth control methods. 2. Diagnosis or history of: 1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, diabetes resulting from pancreatic injury or secondary forms of diabetes, eg, acromegaly or Cushing's syndrome. 2. Acute metabolic diabetic complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma within the past 6 months. 3. Previous treatment with any dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitor or GLP1 receptor agonists within the past one year. 4. History of hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, exfoliative skin conditions) to dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitor (DPP4) or Acarbose. 5. Treatment with any antidiabetic medication for more than 7 consecutive days other than metformin in the last 8 weeks prior to screening</criteria>
