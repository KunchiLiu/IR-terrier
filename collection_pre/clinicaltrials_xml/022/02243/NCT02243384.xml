	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Hepatectomy and Radiofrequency Ablation in the Treatment of Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background:The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic hepatectomy(LH) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods:A total of 110 patients with early HCC with nodular diameters of less than 3 cm and up to three nodules were randomly divided into LH (n=55) and RFA groups (n=55). Outcomes were carefully monitored and evaluated during the 3-year follow-up period. Results: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, resection margin, number of micrometastases ,long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed. groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank survival curves were used.</detailed_description>
