	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-493 and ABT-530 (or ABT-493/ABT-530) coadministered with and without ribavirin in adults with chronic HCV genotypes 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection. In part 4, the primary objectives also include to assess the efficacy (SVR12) of treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530 combination regimen in GT2-infected DAA-naive subjects without cirrhosis compared to historical SVR12 rate of treatment with sofosbuvir plus RBV in GT2-infected DAA-naive subjects without cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
