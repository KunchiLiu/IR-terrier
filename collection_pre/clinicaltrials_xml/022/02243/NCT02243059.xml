	<brief_summary>Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer has high morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with advanced stage ovarian cancer often have cancer spread to regional lymph nodes. Imaging strategies to depict involved lymph nodes are currently not successful. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadofosveset trisodium contrast enhancement (GDF-MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DW-MRI) is able to identify involved lymph nodes in a preoperative setting. This could guide the surgeon during surgery to dissect lymph nodes which could lead to an optimal diagnosis/staging with the lowest possible morbidity. We want to determine the optimal imaging settings and feasibility of MRI for the detection of pathological lymph nodes in women with advanced (FIGO stage IIB-IV) ovarian cancer undergoing primary debulking surgery and compare this to conventional imaging with computer tomography (CT).</brief_summary>
