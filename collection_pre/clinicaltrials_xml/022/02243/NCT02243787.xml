	<brief_summary>This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, ascending single-dose, parallel group study to evaluate safety, tolerability, biological activity, and systemic exposure of COVA322 (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) / interleukin 17 A (IL-17A) antibody fusion protein) in patients with stable chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Patients will receive ascending single-doses of COVA322 or placebo as a constant-rate i.v. infusion, followed by 12 weeks of evaluation.</brief_summary>
