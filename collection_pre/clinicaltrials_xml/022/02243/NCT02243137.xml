Saioa Alonso Clinical Research Ethics Committee The Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CEIC) charged with assessing the project will be the CEIC of the San Carlos University Hospital. 1.7. Responsible for Monitoring: MEDITRIALS 1.8. Experimental and control drug • Experimental group: Loading dose (LD) of intravenous lysine acetylsalicylate 450 mg and prasugrel 60 mg orally. • Control group: Loading dose (LD) of aspirin 300 mg orally and prasugrel 60 mg orally. Being a crossover study, subjects will receive both treatment arms in the two treatment periods with a gap of 15 days (washout period) between the two administrations. 1.9. Study endpoints Primary endpoint To compare the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) at 30 minutes after administration of prasugrel loading dose in association with intravenous lysine acetylsalicylate versus prasugrel plus aspirin. Secundary endpoints To compare the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) at 0 (baseline), 1, 4 and 24 hours after the administration of both treatment groups. To compare the inhibition of platelet reactivity (IPR) throughout the time period in both treatment groups. To evaluate the safety of the treatment administered. 1.10. Study design The ECCLIPSE study is a phase I, randomized, single center, open, two-period crossover trial in each of which subjects receive a single dose of certain drugs in each treatment group. 1.11. Pathology study None. 1.12. Population and sample size The study population will be healthy volunteers (total 30 subjects). This is a pharmacodynamic study, with subsequent extrapolation of findings to patients with acute coronary syndrome 1.13. Duration of treatment In each period of treatment, subjects will received a single dose of drugs determined in each treatment arm and the analysis of the parameters under study will be processed over the next 24 hours. After the two weeks washout period, subjects will receive the other study drug regimen in a single dose and it will take place the analysis within 24 hours of the parameters studied. 1.14. Primary variable Inhibition of platelet aggregation measured by light transmission aggregometry at 30 minutes.</detailed_description>
