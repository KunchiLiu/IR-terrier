	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the attachment of a transparent hood ("cap") on the sigmoidoscope. The investigators hypothesis is that this will reduce pain, reduce investigation time, and increases the success rate of the sigmoidoscopy. The study focus on the less-experienced endoscopist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cap-assisted Sigmoidoscopy - Influence on Pain, Duration and Rate of Success</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators randomize study subject to sigmoidoscopy +/- the attachment of the cap. Using a 100mm VAS scale the investigators record pain when the sigmoidoscopy reaches its intubation end-point (60cm from anus). The investigators also register the time spent to this point and the rate of examinations not achieving this endpoint.</detailed_description>
