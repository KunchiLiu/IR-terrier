	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating patients with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma that has grown or returned (come back) after a period of improvement. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-s-malate in Treating Patients With Relapsed Osteosarcoma or Ewing Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib-s-malate (cabozantinib) for Ewing sarcomas, in terms of 6-month objectives response as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Revised (RECIST version [v]1.1). II. To evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib for osteosarcoma, in terms of 6-month objective response (complete response, partial response) and 6-month non-progression (complete response, partial response and stable disease), as per RECIST v1.1. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. 6-month objective response. (Ewing sarcoma only) II. Best overall response (as per the revised RECIST v1.1). (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) III. 1- and 2-year progression-free survival. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) IV. 1- and 2-year overall survival. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) V. Cabozantinib safety. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) VI. To assess the ability of metabolic tumor response as measured by fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) at the end of one cycle of treatment to predict progression-free survival (PFS). (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) VII. Translational research: to determine and compare tumor expression of MET, phosphorylated (phosphor)-MET and circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF-A, and soluble VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of cabozantinib. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) OUTLINE: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.</detailed_description>

however, women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight, ovarian suppression or other reasons Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (see below) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of cabozantinib administration Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used;
