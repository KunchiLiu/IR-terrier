	<brief_summary>Exercise intolerance, muscle weakness and fatigue complaints are frequent and persistent problems in sarcoidosis. These physical impairments are disabling and affect quality of life in a negative way. The aetiology of these physical impairments is multifactorial. Physical inactivity can cause deconditioning, resulting in more perceived fatigue and muscle weakness. These symptoms may be partially reversible following a structured physical training program. However, scientific studies about physical training in sarcoidosis are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine the changes in fatigue complaints, physical functioning and quality of life (QOL) in patients with sarcoidosis following a 13-week physical training program. After obtaining written informed consent, sarcoidosis patients will start a 13-week physical training program for three times a week. This training program includes peripheral muscle training for both the upper and lower extremities (starting at 40% of the multiple-repetition maximum) and endurance training consisting of walking on a treadmill (starting at 60% of the speed of the 6-minute walk test) or cycling on a ergometer (starting at 50% of the Wmax). Participants will be assessed at baseline (week 0), at the end (13 weeks) and 3 months after ending the training. During these assessments, patients perform muscle strength (m. quadriceps and m. biceps) and exercise tests (six-minute walk test and submaximal endurance cycling test). They also complete several questionnaires: Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Small Fiber Neuropathy Screening List (SFNSL), Medical Research Council (MRC), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</brief_summary>
