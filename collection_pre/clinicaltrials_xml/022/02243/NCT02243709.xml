	<criteria>Male or female, 21 to 65 years of age Females must be postmenopausal for at least one year or surgically sterile (proven by medical record) Meet criteria for Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) DSM5 diagnosis Meet drinking criteria (≥3 drinks/day for men; ≥2 drinks /day for women) Must be in good health as confirmed by medical history, physical examination, ECG, lab tests Participants must be willing to take oral medication and adhere to the study procedures Breath alcohol (BrAC) = 0.00 at each visit Be able to understand informed consent and questionnaire in English at an 8th grade level Individuals expressing interest in treatment for alcoholism Premenopausal women Participants who have significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms, defined as a CIWAAr score ≥7 A repeated positive urine drug screen at baseline for any illegal substance except marijuana. Individuals diagnosed with a current "severe" Substance Use Disorder (SUD) diagnosis, other than alcohol or nicotine Meet DSM5 criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychoses An active illness within the past six months of the screening visit that meets the DSM5 criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Anxiety Disorder, or history of attempted suicide Clinically significant medical abnormalities: unstable hypertension, clinically significant abnormal ECG, bilirubin &gt;150% of the upper normal limit, ALT/AST &gt;300% the UNL, creatinine clearance ≤60 dl/min Current use of psychotropic medications that may have an effect on alcohol consumption Current use of any medication involved in the metabolism of alcohol such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and CYP2E1: Cefamandole, Cefotetan, Sulfamethoxazole, Nitroglycerin, Chlorpropamide, Glyburide. Current use of any medication (CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) that may interact with mifepristone: cyclosporine, fentanyl, heparin, escitalopram, lovastatin, simvastatin, warfarin Current use of any medication (CYP2D6 inhibitor and substrate) that may interact with yohimbine: amitriptyline, doxepin, nortriptyline, venlafaxine Medical contraindications for use of mifepristone or yohimbine A history of adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to mifepristone or yohimbine History of suicide History of seizure disorders Hypokalemia (low potassium level)&lt;3.5mEq/L Participated in any behavioral and/or pharmacological study within minimum the past 30 days Neuroendocrine disorders Taking corticosteroids Bleeding disorders Preexisting QT prolongation on ECG History of porphyria (Mifepristone progesterone receptor antagonist is an inducer of CYP450 and therefore may have the ability to precipitate or exacerbate attacks of acute porphyria) Not willing to engage in protected sex (condom). This risk includes both women and men. Mifepristone long halflife (t1/2 = 18 hrs) and its three main metabolites retain considerable affinity toward human progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, with serum level similar to the parent mifepristone and there are no studies on the presence of mifepristone or metabolites in semen</criteria>
