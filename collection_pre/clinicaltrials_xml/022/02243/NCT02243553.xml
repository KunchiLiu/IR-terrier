	<brief_summary>Primary: To quantify the influence of single-dose and steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg on intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) biomarkers, as a means of predicting drug interactions. The AUCs for biomarkers caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and digoxin will be assessed.</brief_summary>
