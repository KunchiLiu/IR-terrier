	<brief_summary>GSK1278863 is an orally-active, novel small molecule agent which inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl -4- hydroxylases (PHDs) and is in development for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As the kidney represents a major site of elimination for many drugs and their metabolites, and GSK1278863 will be administered to subjects with various stages of renal disease, it is important to characterize the pharmacokinetics in this target patient population. The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 and its metabolites in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This will be a repeat-dose, open-label, parallel-group study. Approximately 30 subjects with ESRD will be enrolled in two cohorts (15 subjects in each cohort) to ensure that 6 subjects on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (cohort 1) and 6 subjects on automated peritoneal dialysis APD (cohort 2) complete dosing and critical assessments. GSK1278863 will be administered once daily for 14 days. Primary pharmacokinetic assessments will be made on Days 1 and 14.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>SAFETY: Satisfactory medical evaluation based upon medical history, medication history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory data obtained at the Screening visit. The determination of clinical significance will be made by the Investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor and will require that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors or interfere with the study procedures, or the integrity of the study. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt;470 milliseconds (msec) OR QTc &lt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. These should be based on average of triplicate values obtained over a brief recording period at Screening and on Day 1 and the single reading on Day 17. The same QT correction formula should be used to determine inclusion and discontinuation for any individual subject throughout the study. Vitamin B12 and folate above the lower limit of normal at Screening. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). EFFICACY: A subject is eligible to enroll and participate in this study if he/she has ESRD and is on peritoneal dialysis for at least 2 months with an average urine output of &lt;750 mL/daily with a combined weekly (urine and peritoneal dialysis output) Kt/V urea &gt;1.7 measured at any time within last 3 months. No history of peritoneal dialysisassociated peritonitis, peritoneal catheter tunnel (exit site) infection or leakage for at least 3 months before study. Meets the following erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) criteria: Is ESA naive (i.e., no ESA use within the previous 12 weeks of screening) OR agrees to discontinue ESA (if currently using ESA) for at least 7 days prior to first dose of GSK1278863 until completion of Followup visit (If the subject has a scheduled ESA interval which is &lt;=7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least 7 days prior to first dose of GSK1278863. If the subject has a scheduled ESA interval which is &gt;7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least the scheduled interval length [e.g., if ESA interval is 14 days, then ESA must be discontinued for &gt;=14 days] prior to the first dose of GSK1278863) Has a haemoglobin value: For ESA na√Øve subjects: &lt;10.0 g/dL (UK site(s) only: &lt;=11.0 g/dL); For subjects receiving ongoing ESA treatment: &lt;=11.0 g/dL at Screening (UK site(s) only: &lt;=12.0 g/dL at Screening). OTHER: Subjects who are &gt;=18 years of age at the time of Screening. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: (a) Childbearing potential, and agrees to use one of the contraception methods described in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of Screening until completion of the Followup Visit; (b) Nonchildbearing potential, defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 23.0116.3 international units (IU)/litre (L) and estradiol &lt;=10 picograms (pg)/mL (or &lt;=37 picomoles [pmol]/L) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods described in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 months must elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.
