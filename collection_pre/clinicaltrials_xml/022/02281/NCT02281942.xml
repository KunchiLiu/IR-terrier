	<brief_summary>Low self-control has been associated with a number of unhealthy behaviors with low treatment success. Alternative non-pharmacological approaches have the potential for enhancing self-control. This pilot study will investigate if the practice of yoga and/or health and wellness education improve self-control in the context of nicotine addiction, and will set the stage for larger clinical trials using behavioral interventions to supplement or replace existing treatments and increase the rates of recovery from disorders in which low self-control is a susceptibility factor.</brief_summary>
