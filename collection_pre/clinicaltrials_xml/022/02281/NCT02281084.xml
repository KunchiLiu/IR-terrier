	<criteria>1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document 2. Documented diagnosis of MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES), classified according to FAB (FRENCHAMERICAN BRITISH)classification criteria 3. Adequate course of treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent (azacitidine for injection or decitabine) as the last therapeutic intervention for MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES) prior to beginning screening for this study. Adequate is defined as: having received at least 6 consecutive 4week treatment cycles with azacitidine for injection, or having received at least 4 consecutive 6week treatment cycles with decitabine (3day regimen) or at least 6 consecutive 4week treatment cycles with decitabine (5day regimen), or having demonstrated inability to tolerate treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent because of unacceptable drugrelated toxicity after at least 3 months of attempted treatment: Three 28day cycles of azacitidine for injection or decitabine 5day regimen; two 42day cycles of decitabine 3day regimen. 4. Documented disease progression or stable disease as best response to treatment (or attempted treatment) with azacitidine for injection or decitabine. Those achieving an objective response to the most recent treatment regimen with an injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) are excluded from participation in this study. Definitions of disease progression are modified from IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP) 2006 criteria and include: Preinjectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline bone marrow myeloblasts: 1. Less than 5%: ≥ 100% increase to ≥ 8% blasts 2. ≥ 5%: ≥ 50% increase to ≥ 10% blasts Note: ≥ 30% blasts is considered AML (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIAT) per FAB (FRENCHAMERICAN BRITISH)classification. Subjects known to have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study. RECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)nizing limitations of blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects with preenrollment bone marrow blast counts up to 33% on the screening bone marrow examination to be considered for inclusion. Assessment may be made according to local bone marrow examination to facilitate enrollment of eligible subjects into the treatment phase of the study. Any clinical worsening from preinjectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline condition, including: a. sustained clinicallysignificant worsening (investigator's assessment) from baseline granulocyte, platelet, or hemoglobin values (≥ 2 values, separated by ≥ 2 weeks) worsening granulocytes should be ≥ 50% decrease from preinjectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value worsening platelets should be ≥ 50% decrease from preinjectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value (untransfused) worsening hemoglobin should be ≥ 1.5 g/dL decrease from preinjectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value in subjects not receiving RBC (RED BLOOD CELL) transfusions b. meaningful worsening in RBC (RED BLOOD CELL) or platelet transfusion requirement Definition of stable disease is based on modified IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP) 2006 criteria: Failure to achieve any objective response (CR complete remission, PR partial remissino, mCR marrow complete remission, or HI hematologic improvement), but no evidence of disease progression within the 8 weeks leading to the subject's first dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) in this study (Cycle 1, Day 1) 5. Have the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) azacitidine for injection or decitabine) not more than 12 weeks prior to screening for this study (date of informed consent signature). 6. No less than 3 weeks between the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) azacitidine for injection or decitabine) and the planned date of first dose of IP (IINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT). 7. Have an ECOG (EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1 may participate, providing they meet the following conditions: Agree to use at least two effective contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; true abstinence; or vasectomized partner) throughout the study, and for 90 days following the last dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT); and Have a negative serum pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at screening; and Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within 72 hours prior to starting treatment with IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) (Cycle 1, Day 1), and before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment. Note that the screening serum pregnancy test can also be used as the test prior to starting IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) if it is performed within the 72hour timeframe. 9. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use at least two physicianapproved contraceptive methods throughout the course of the study and should avoid fathering a child during the course of the study and for 90 days following the last dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT). 10. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any studyrelated assessments or procedures conducted. 11. Understand and voluntarily sign a biomarkerspecific component of the informed consent document prior to any studyrelated procedures conducted. 12. Be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements 1. Rapidlyprogressing MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES), defined as: Known clinicallysignificant doubling in marrow or perIP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT)heral blood blast percentage (to ≥ 20%) in the 8week period leading to the first dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) (Cycle 1, Day 1) ≥100% increase in WBC count (myeloid cell line and monocyte series) within the 8week period leading to Cycle 1, Day 1 2. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA) FAB (FRENCHAMERICANBRITISH) classification: ≥ 30% blasts in bone marrow). Subjects known to have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study. Recognizing limitations of blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects with preenrollment (screening/baseline) bone marrow blast counts up to 33% to be considered for inclusion. 3. Prior allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant 4. Prior exposure to the investigational oral formulation of decitabine, or other oral azacitidine derivative 5. Prior or ongoing response (IWG (International Working Group) 2006: hematologic improvement [HI], partial response [PR], complete remission [CR], or marrow CR) to treatment with azacitidine for injection or decitabine, including relapsed disease 6. Ongoing medically significant adverse events from previous treatment, regardless of the time period 7. Use of any of the following within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT): thrombopoiesisstimulating agents ([TSAs]; eg, Romiplostim, Eltrombopag, Interleukin11) ESAs (Erythropoiesis stimulating agent) and other RBC (Red blood cell) hematopoietic growth factors (eg, interleukin3) hydroxyurea 8. Concurrent use of corticosteroids unless the subject is on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ 1 week prior to enrollment for medical conditions other than MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES) 9. History of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease (ie, sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) and/or predispose the subject to an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity 10.
