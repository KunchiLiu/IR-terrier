	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of a Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC), BE1116. BE1116 will be used for the rapid reversal of coagulopathy induced by vitamin K antagonists in Japanese subjects who require immediate correction of international normalized ratio (INR) due to a major bleed or emergency surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female Japanese subjects greater than or equal to 20 years Subjects currently on vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy INR greater than or equal to 2 within 3 hours before start of BE1116 infusion Urgent reversal of VKA therapy for a surgical or invasive medical procedure is required within 24 hours of the start of BE1116 infusion, or presentation with an acute major bleed Subjects for whom administration of I.V. vitamin K and VKA withdrawal, alone, can adequately correct the subject's coagulopathy before the infusion of BE1116 Subjects in whom lowering the INR to within the normal range is not a treatment goal Use of anticoagulants other than VKAs (or expected use within 1 day) Medical history for which PCCs are contraindicated History of thromboembolic event within 3 months of screening Congenital or acquired abnormality of hemostasis other than receipt of VKAs Administration of whole blood, plasma, plasma fractions, or platelets within 2 weeks prior to the start of BE1116 infusion For subjects with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) &lt; 7 Intracerebral hematoma volume &gt; 30 cm3 as assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan For subdural hematomas: maximum thickness ≥ 10 mm, midline shift ≥ 5 mm, or acute subdural hematomas (based on neurosurgeon review) For subarachnoid hemorrhage: any evidence of hydrocephalus, or Hunt and Hess Scale &gt; 2, or concomitant subdural hematoma Infratentorial ICH location Epidural hematomas Intraventricular rupture of hemorrhage Requires surgical intervention</criteria>
