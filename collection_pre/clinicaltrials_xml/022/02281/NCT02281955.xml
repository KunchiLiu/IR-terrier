	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of using lower-intensity radiation and chemotherapy to treat human papillomavirus (HPV) associated low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. The cure rate for this type of cancer is estimated to be high, &gt; 90%. The standard treatment for this cancer is 7 weeks of radiation with 3 high doses of cisplatin. Sometimes surgery is performed afterwards. This standard regimen causes a lot of side effects and long term complications. This study is evaluating whether a lower dose of radiation and chemotherapy may provide a similar cure rate as the longer, more intensive standard regimen. Patients in this study will receive 1 less week of radiation and a lower weekly dose of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>De-intensification of Radiation and Chemotherapy for Low-Risk HPV-related Oropharyngeal SCC: Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a follow-up study to NCT01530997. In NCT01530997, patients with HPV positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) received de-intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by a limited surgical evaluation. The primary endpoint of NCT01530997 was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT. Power computations were performed for N=40 and were based on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR for de-intensified chemoradiotherapy is at least 87%, the historical rate. The type 1 error for this calculation was 14.2%. 43 patients enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The observed pCR rate was 89% (34/38). Since the observed pCR rate was excellent in NCT01530997 and was in concordance with the expected rate, in the proposed study we will not mandate a post-CRT surgical evaluation. Instead a PET/CT 10 to 16 weeks post-CRT will be used to determine whether a surgical evaluation is needed.</detailed_description>
