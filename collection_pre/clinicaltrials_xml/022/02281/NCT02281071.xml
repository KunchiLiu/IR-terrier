	<brief_summary>The benefits of microsurgical approaches in periodontal therapy have been described. The main focus of this study is to determine if using microsurgical LMCAF technique would improve the outcomes of the therapy for the Miller Class III isolated recession-type defects. Six months results of this study showed that LMCAF with microsurgical approach offered better complete and mean root coverage results over macrosurgical LMCAF technique. The superior effect of microsurgical approach on post-operative morbidity can make this technique more preferable for the patients who expected comfortable postoperative period. This study supports that using the microsurgical aproach with LMCAF procedure significantly affects the clinical and patient-centered success of treating Miller Class III isolated typed defects.</brief_summary>
