	<brief_summary>Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy allows a local long-term control of the order 85 to 95% with a survival rate equivalent to that of the totally mastectomy. The diminution of the local recurrence rate after irradiation post- lumpectomy is also associated to a best global survival than only the surgery. The adjuvant radiotherapy after partially or totally mastectomy for the progressive tumors is a therapeutic standard (Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group 2011). The aim of our trial of routine care is to record our practices under this breast adjuvant radiotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients responding criteria for selection and not objecting to participate in this trial will address the quality of life questionnaires at baseline and during their standard follow-up (1, 6, 12 and 24 months after the end of radiotherapy).
