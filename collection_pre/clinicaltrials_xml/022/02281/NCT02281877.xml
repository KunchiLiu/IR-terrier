	<brief_summary>The overall goals of this work are: 1) to elucidate alterations in gene expression and downstream protein synthesis 2 weeks after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) to better explain quadriceps muscle atrophy after TKA and 2) understand the mechanisms responsible for improved maintenance of muscle strength with Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) utilization. Furthermore, this investigation seeks to expand previous findings regarding attenuation of strength and functional performance deficits with NMES application to better understand how altered gene expression influences muscle function.</brief_summary>
