	<brief_summary>This multicenter phase 2 clinical trial is designed to assess safety of P28GST (protein 28 Kd glutathion S Transferrase), aiming to control inflammation in moderate Crohn's Disease (CD), before or after intestinal resection surgery. P28GST is a parasite enzyme molecule from Schistosoma with potent immunogenic and anti-oxidant properties. Based on experimental evidence of its anti-inflammatory properties, the investigators hypothesized that administration of P28GST could protect against recurrence after intestinal resection surgery in CD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of P28GST Treatment in Crohn's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To carry out this study, 24 moderate CD patients will be enrolled in a safety phase 2a study. CD patients will be included after intestinal resection surgery or in moderate Crohn's Disease (CD). Drug therapy will consisted in 3 injections of 100 µg of P28GST within 3 months (one injection per month). The main objective of this study is to follow-up monthly rate and seriousness of adverse events during one year. Secondary objectives are to control immunologic and inflammatory blood and tissue markers, appearance or not of a clinical recurrence assessed by CDAI (Crohn Disease Activity Index).</detailed_description>
