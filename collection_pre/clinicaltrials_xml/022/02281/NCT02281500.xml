	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, and Safety of Human Plasma-Derived Fibrinogen (FIB Grifols) in Patients With Congenital Afibrinogenaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase I-II, multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial to evaluate PK, efficacy, and safety of human plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols in adult and pediatric patients with congenital afibrinogenaemia. Approximately 10adult subjects (≥ 18 years) with congenital afibrinogenaemia will be administered with a single dose of study drug at 70 mg/kg body weight. and will be followed for PK, efficacy, and safety assessments. After the safety of fibrinogen concentrate FIB Grifols is assessed in at least 10 adult subjects and no safety issues are raised by the sponsor, the study will start to enroll approximately 10 pediatric subjects who will be dosed with study drug and followed for PK, efficacy, and safety assessments. All enrolled subjects (both adult and pediatrics) will have documented congenital fibrinogen deficiency manifested as afibrinogenaemia but will not have received any fibrinogen-containing product therapy within the preceding 21 days before the infusion of study drug. All subjects (both adult and pediatrics) will be infused with the investigational product at 70 mg/kg body weight. PK parameters that will be calculated from plasma fibrinogen levels measured at different time points] include: in vivo recovery [IVR], area under the curve (AUC) calculated as AUC from zero to 14 days (AUC0-14days) and AUC from zero to infinity (AUC0-∞), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to the observed maximum plasma concentration (tmax), half-life (t1/2), mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (Vd), and clearance (Cl). Hemostatic efficacy of the investigational product will be assessed by means of thromboelastographic measure of Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) at baseline and one-hour post-infusion. Other thromboelastographic measures as well as standard coagulation tests will be also determined pre- and post-infusion. Clinical safety, viral safety, and immunogenicity will be assessed in this clinical trial. Safety variables include adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical assessments, laboratory tests, viral markers, and antibodies against human fibrinogen. A monitoring plan will be implemented by the sponsor to carefully monitor and evaluate allergic/hypersensitivity reactions and thrombotic events (TE) during the study. Stopping criteria will be established for immunogenic and thrombogenic events. If a single case of any these events is reported after a subject being dosed with study drug, any further enrollment and dosing of subjects in the study will be suspended until the event can be adequately assessed by the sponsor. The enrollment and dosing will only reassume if the sponsor deems it is safe to do so.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female subjects less than 70 years old 2. Sign the written Informed Consent Form (ICF), or the patient's parent or legal guardian signs the ICF where applicable, and the Subject Authorization Form (SAF) where applicable. Pediatric patients, as defined by local regulations, will be asked to sign an age appropriate assent form 3. Subjects diagnosed with congenital fibrinogen deficiency manifested as afibrinogenaemia 4. Subjects with a fibrinogen level equal or less than 20 mg/dL determined by both Clauss and antigen methods at baseline (sample drawn within 24 hours prior to infusion on Day 0 FP visit) 5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative test for pregnancy serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCGbased assay) at baseline (sample drawn within 24 hours prior to infusion on Day 0visit) 6. Female subjects of childbearing potential has agreed to practice contraception using a method of proven reliability (i.e., hormonal methods; barrier methods; intrauterine devices methods, abstinence) to prevent a pregnancy during the course of the clinical trial 7. Subjects must be willing to comply with all aspects of the clinical trial protocol, including blood sampling, for the whole duration of the study Women of childbearing potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilisation (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea for &gt;12 consecutive months or women on hormone replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone level &lt;35 mIU/mL). Even in women who are using oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile, e.g. vasectomy, should be considered to be of child bearing potential 1. Subjects who received any fibrinogencontaining product within 21 days prior to Day 0 visit infusion day 2. Subjects who present with active bleeding within 10 days prior to infusion on Day 0 visit 3. Subjects with acquired (secondary) fibrinogen deficiency 4. Subjects diagnosed with dysfibrinogenemia 5. Subjects with documented history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism or arterial thrombosis within 1 year prior to enrolment in this clinical trial 6. Subjects with known antibodies against fibrinogen 7. Subjects with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions or reactions to any bloodderived product 8. Subjects with a history of intolerance to any component of the investigational products (test or control) 9. Females who are pregnant or are nursing an infant child 10. Subjects with renal impairment [i.e., serum creatinine exceeds more than 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)] at baseline (sample drawn within 24 hours prior to infusion on Day 0 visit) 11. Subjects with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels exceeding more than 2.5 times the ULN at baseline (sample drawn within 24 hours prior to infusion on Day 0 visit) 12. Subjects with a history of chronic alcoholism or illicit drug addiction in the preceding 12 months prior to enrollment in this clinical trial 13. Subjects with any medical condition which is likely to interfere with the evaluation of the study drugs and/or the satisfactory conduct of the clinical trial according to the investigator's judgment (e.g. congenital or acquired bleeding disorders other than congenital fibrinogen deficiency, planned surgery needing blood transfusion) 14. Subjects received aspirincontaining products and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 7 days prior to Day 0 visit 15. Subjects currently receiving, or having received within 3 months prior to enrolment into this clinical trial, any investigational drug or device 16. Subjects who are unlikely to adhere the protocol requirements, or are likely to be uncooperative, or unable to provide a storage serum sample prior to investigational drug infusion</criteria>
