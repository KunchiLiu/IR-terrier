	<brief_summary>Background: Among the instrumental devices that have been proposed over the years to integrate the clinical evaluation of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), imaging techniques are the most studied, showing that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique most need to describe the anatomy of the TMJ and to evaluate the correlation of imaging findings with the clinical diagnosis . Despite the amount available studies on the use of MRI for evaluation of TMJ disorders and treatments, there is a lack of studies that evaluate the imaging findings after physical therapy. Purpose: To evaluate the influence of nonspecific mandibular mobilization about the positioning of the articular disc by MRI in individuals with TMD diagnosis of anterior disc displacement with and without reduction according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Analyze the behavior of pain through the numerical scale of pain assessment (END) at baseline and after each treatment session, the quality of life of individuals with TMD at baseline, immediately, three and six months after the treatment sessions by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL - BREF), and The Patient's Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) at baseline and after treatment. The treatment will be performed three times a week during four weeks. Metodology: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, blind study designed to assess the effects of techniques nonspecific mandibular mobilization x placebo. Individuals will be randomized and divided into two groups: Group A (intervention) and Group B (placebo). Statistic analysis: The positioning of the articular disc, extracted through the use of MRI, will be considered the primary outcome and, as a secondary outcome will be assessed the quality of life, pain and function after treatment. The adherence of the data to a Gaussian curve will be verified by the Shapiro-Wilk and the data are expressed as mean values and standard deviation. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test will be used for inter-and intra-group comparisons. The significance level is adjusted p â‰¤ 0.05.</brief_summary>
