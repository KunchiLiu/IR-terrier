	<brief_summary>This study aims at improving the prediction of type 2 diabetes among high-risk individuals by examining glucose excursion patterns in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. In addition, this study will show whether the currently used diagnostic test could be replaced by an easier and less expensive method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Variation of Glucose Values at Early Stages of Diabetes - Continuous Glucose Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease of glucose metabolism leading to various disabling conditions. The onset of type 2 diabetes is a gradual shift from normal to abnormal, giving rarely noticeable symptoms at its early stages or even in later stages when damage has already been caused. Due to the gradual onset, the diagnosis is often delayed, and as much as half of the asymptomatic patients remain undetected. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes are based on artificial boundaries reflecting the risk of complications related to diabetes. The golden standard of diagnosis of diabetes is a 2 hours oral glucose tolerance test, which is both time consuming and costly. This study aims at improving the prediction of type 2 diabetes among high-risk individuals by examining glucose excursion patterns in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. In addition, this study will show whether the currently used diagnostic test could be replaced by an easier and less expensive method.</detailed_description>
