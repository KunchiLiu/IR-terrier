	<brief_summary>Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of aseptic techniques to reduce surgical site infection. The traditional surgical antisepsis involves scrubbing the skin with povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate. Recently, a waterless surgical hand rub formulation containing 61% ethyl alcochol, 1% chlorhexidine and moisturizers was developed to provide a comparable antiseptic effect. The investigators perform a randomized controlled trial to compare the antiseptic effectiveness of the waterless hand rubbing, the classic surgical handwashing with povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine solutions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Antiseptic Outcome of Traditional Hand Scrubbing Versus Hand Rubbing in Surgical Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre, randomized trial recruited surgical team members in Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital at November 2014. 255 episodes of hand washing are enrolled. The participants are assigned equally to use either a waterless hand rub (Group R), or traditional scrub formation with 10 % povidone-iodine (Group I) and 4% chlorhexidine (Group C). Hand washing time, microorganisms on hands before and after scrubbing is recorded. The primary outcome is the colonies grown on bacterial culture plates and expressed as colony-forming units (CFU) on plates after hand washing. The secondary outcomes is hand microbial flora after surgery and duration of hand washing.</detailed_description>
