	<brief_title>Vit D3 and Omega 3 in Chemo Induced Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of mammalian oil Omega 3 FA with Vitamin D3 supplementation on resolution or prevention of Taxanes or Platinum induced peripheral neuropathy compared with placebo. Patients will be allocated to receive the Omega 3 FA &amp; Vitamin D3 supplements or placebo for 6 months. Approximately 600 patients in total will be enrolled in the 2 study arms. The evaluation of neuropathy will be accomplished by electromyography (EMG), Total neuropathy score(TNS), Brief pain inventory (BFI) and the 11-item FACT/GOG-Ntx, version 4 questionnaire (a subscale validated to assess neuropathy due to chemotherapy). In addition, other validated functional measures such as "Time to button a six hole shirt" and "50 ft walk speed test" will be used to test patients physical limitations imposed by peripheral neuropathy. All our patients will undergo an EMG at their first visit, in 3 months and after 6months. Previously mentioned functional measures will also be completed at the patients' first visit, in 3 months and after 6 months.</detailed_description>
