	<brief_summary>Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is defined as a chronic cardiac dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis. It is suspected that this specific cardiac dysfunction contributes to the onset of complications in liver disease. The purpose of this prospective, randomized controlled trial is to determine whether carvedilol can revert cardiac dysfunction i.e. left ventricular diastolic dysfunction secondary to cirrhosis, and prevent complications (renal dysfunction, worsening cardiac function, and mortality).</brief_summary>
