	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators are testing whether cognitive training can lead to improvements in speech perception for individuals with hearing loss. Individuals will complete 20 hours of cognitive training that is designed to improve cognitive abilities such as short term memory and attention. The investigators predict that cognitive training that improves the cognitive abilities affected by hearing loss will improve speech perception.</brief_summary>
