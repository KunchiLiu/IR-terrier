	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good and bad effects) of carfilzomib given as a 30-minute infusion and at a dose of 70 mg/m2 to treat patients with multiple myeloma (MM), who are currently showing progressive disease (worsening) and had progressed (did not respond to treatment) within 8 weeks of receiving treatment with 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib. Carfilzomib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used only in certain U.S. patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that have tried and failed other therapies. Carfilzomib is considered an investigational drug for this study because the dose and regimen included in this study are different from the FDA approved carfilzomib regimen. Carfilzomib is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor. Carfilzomib is thought to work by preventing breakdown of abnormal proteins in cells, causing the cells to die. Cancer cells are more sensitive to these effects than normal cells. Carfilzomib has been previously given to more than 1800 people in clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weekly 70 mg/m2 Carfilzomib for Multiple Myeloma Patients Refractory to 27 mg/m2 Carfilzomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 30-minute infusion of 70 mg/m2 of carfilzomib among MM patients who are currently showing progressive disease (PD) and had failed their last treatment with 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib alone or as part of a combination regimen. The study will consist of 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3) maintenance treatment; 4) a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 5) a follow-up period.The study will enroll a total of 45 patients who are currently showing PD and had progressed within 8 weeks of receiving their last treatment with 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib alone or as part of a combination regimen. Patients will be enrolled from 15 hematology/oncology sites across the United States. During the treatment period, all doses of carfilzomib will be given at 70 mg/m2 infused over 30 minutes. Among patients who received steroids at the equivalent of &gt; 8 mg of dexamethasone weekly with carfilzomib, steroids will be administered using the same drug(s) at the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as they received during their previous carfilzomib treatment. Patients who did not receive steroids or received the equivalent of less than 8 mg of dexamethasone weekly will be given 8 mg of dexamethasone prior to each carfilzomib administration. Carfilzomib will be administered at a facility capable of managing hypersensitivity reactions. Pre- and post-dose intravenous (IV) hydration (between 250 mL and 500 mL normal saline or other appropriate IV fluid formulation) may be given at the discretion of the treating physician. Subjects should be monitored periodically during this period for evidence of fluid overload. Subjects that complete 8 cycles without showing PD will be eligible to receive maintenance therapy on a 28-day cycle with carfilzomib and steroids as administered during the last cycle of the treatment period.During maintenance (cycle 9 and beyond) carfilzomib will be administered at the dose received during the last cycle of study treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15, and steroids will be administered using the same drug(s) at the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as given during the last cycle of study treatment. Patients will remain on maintenance therapy until documentation of PD as defined by the modified Bladé criteria or until they develop toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD) will remain on maintenance therapy. Dose reductions of carfilzomib and steroids will be permitted as per protocol guidelines.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Has a diagnosis of MM based on standard criteria1 as follows: Major criteria: Plasmacytomas on tissue biopsy. Bone marrow plasmacytosis (greater than 30% plasma cells). Monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) spike on serum electrophoresis IgG greater than 3.5 g/dL or IgA greater than 2.0 g/dL; kappa or lambda light chain excretion greater than 1 g/day on 24hour urine protein electrophoresis. Minor criteria: bone marrow plasmacytosis (10% to 30% plasma cells) monoclonal immunoglobulin present but of lesser magnitude than given under major criteria lytic bone lesions normal IgM less than 50 mg/dL, IgA less than 100 mg/dL, or IgG less than 600 mg/dL Any of the following sets of criteria will confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma: any 2 of the major criteria major criterion 1 plus minor criterion 2, 3, or 4 major criterion 3 plus minor criterion 1 or 3 minor criteria 1, 2, and 3, or 1, 2, and 4 2.
