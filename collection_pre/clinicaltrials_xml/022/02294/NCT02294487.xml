	<brief_summary>This study will collect blood samples from healthy volunteers and volunteers with multiple myeloma who are going to get the seasonal flu, pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae B (HIB), and/or meningococcus vaccines. The main goal of the study is to start to identify differences in the immune response between multiple myeloma patients and people who don't have multiple myeloma. We hope this will provide important information about the best way and time to vaccinate multiple myeloma patients to flu, pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae B (HIB), and/or meningococcus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Immune Response After Vaccination in Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of a prospective blood sample collection to gather baseline data to confirm antibody protection from vaccines in the Aurora Health Care multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The overall goal of this study is to obtain a normative dataset for MM patients and non-MM control populations as well as determining baseline IgG levels to seasonal influenza A, influenza B, pneumococcal polysaccharide, and tetanus toxoid and confirmation of antibody protection from vaccines with assays based upon WHO standards of detection. This is part of a series of studies designed to provide important information about the best way and time to vaccinate MM patients to flu, pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae B (HIB), and/or meningococcus and to gather additional information about MM and immune function.</detailed_description>
