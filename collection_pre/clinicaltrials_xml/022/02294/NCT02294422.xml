	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at establishing whether use of loss of resistance syringe (LOR) that is traditionally used for identifying epidural space, is a better method for providing safe cuff pressures in adults intubated with cuffed endotracheal tubes. The conventional method is the use of pilot ballon palpation (PBP) to approximate cuff pressures but this is associated with airway damage. The study hypothesis states that both the loss of resistance syringe method and the pilot balloon palpation methods achieve the recommended endotracheal tube intracuff pressures.</brief_summary>
