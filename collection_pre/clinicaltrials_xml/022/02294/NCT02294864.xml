	<brief_summary>It is estimated that nearly 27 million US adults have osteoarthritis (OA) and suffer from pain . Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF) is one method that has been successfully used in treatment of various etiologies of pain. However there are limited studies and research that prove its effectiveness in treating articular pain. The proposed study's primary aim is determining if PRF is an effective treatment for chronic osteoarthritic knee pain. This study hypothesizes that PRF has analgesic properties immediately after treatment and at least 3 months afterwards compared to control treatment with physical therapy. Additionally this research project addresses several other objectives including: 1. Provide a controlled study to determine the effectiveness of PRF for intra-articular pain 2. Determine how effective PRF is 1 month and 3 months after treatment for articular pain. 3. Further scientific evidence on the overall effectiveness of PRF 4. Provide evidence that PRF likely has other mechanism of action besides direct nerve stimulation of inhibitory pain pathways. 5. Compare the effectiveness of PRF vs Physical Therapy in treating chronic knee osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
