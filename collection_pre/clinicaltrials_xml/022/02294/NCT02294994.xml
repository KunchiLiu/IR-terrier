	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety different dose of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor (tirofiban) in interventional treatment of complex coronary artery disease ,which include bifurcation lesion, left main lesion, multiple vessel disease, intracoronary thrombus, SYNTAX score&gt;26,chronic total occlusion disease. The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints are incidence of major bleeding and the rate of site access complication.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients were recruited from those undergoing PCI with a planned placement of an intracoronary stent Including patients with unstable angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome or NSTEMI Experienced ischaemic pain at rest Lasting 10 minutes and occurring within 7 days before enrollment As well as one of the following: ECG changes: New or presumably new STsegment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV (1 mm), or transient (&lt; 30 minutes) STsegment elevation greater than or equal to 0.1 mV (1 mm) in at least 2 contiguous leads Abnormal cardiac enzymes within the 24 hours before enrollment, defined as elevated Troponin I defined as elevated Troponin I (above the normal reference Highrisk angiographic features :lesion/anatomy related bifurcation lesion, left main lesion, multiple vessel disease, intracoronary thrombus, SYNTAX score &gt; 26 and chronic total occlusion disease. Increased bleeding risk: ischaemic stroke within the last year or any previous haemorrhagic stroke, tumour or intracranial aneurysm; Recent (&lt;1 month) trauma or major surgery (including bypass surgery); Active bleeding Unexplained clinically significant bleeding, thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L) or history of thrombocytopenia with GP IIb/IIIa, heparin or enoxaparin therapy Angina from secondary causes such as severe uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg despite treatment) Valvular disease, congenital heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Thrombolytic therapy within preceding 24 hours Receiving antiIIb/IIIa therapy Creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min</criteria>
