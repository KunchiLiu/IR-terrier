	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the Visceral Manifold and Unitary Device Study is to assess the use of the thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold or the unitary device to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate anatomy. The primary intent of the study is to assess safety and preliminary effectiveness of the device. Additionally, the study will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow-up interval.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>An aneurysm with a maximum diameter of &gt; 5.5 cm or 2 times the normal diameter just proximal to the aneurysm using orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular to the centerline) measurements Aneurysm with a history of growth &gt; 0.5 cm in 6 months Saccular aneurysm deemed at significant risk for rupture Symptomatic aneurysm greater than 4.5 cm Axillary or brachial and iliac or femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular access techniques, devices or accessories, with or without use of a surgical conduit Proximal landing zone for the thoracic bifurcation stent graft: •≥ 2.5 cm of nonaneurysmal aortic segment including previously placed graft material (neck) distal to the left subclavian artery (LSA) Diameter in the range of 2642 mm Adequate distance from the celiac artery, in order to accommodate cannulation from the antegrade access point when considering the total deployed length of the thoracic bifurcation and visceral manifold Proximal landing zone for the unitary manifold stent graft: Nonaneurysmal aortic segment including previously placed graft material (neck) with a minimum seal zone length of 3 cm Diameter in the range of 1932 mm Minimum branch vessel diameter greater than 5 mm Iliac artery or aortic distal fixation site greater than or equal to 15 mm in length and diameter in the range of 8 25 mm Age: ≥ 18 years old Life expectancy: &gt; 1 year General exclusion Patient is a good candidate for and elects for open surgical repair Can be treated in accordance with the instructions for use with a legally marketed Is eligible for enrollment in a manufacturersponsored IDE at the investigational site Unwilling to comply with the followup schedule Inability or refusal to give informed consent Urgent or emergent presentation Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding Patient has a contained rupture Patient has a ruptured aneurysm Patient has a dissection in the portion of the aorta intended to be treated Obstructive stenting of any or all of the visceral vessels Poor performance status including two major system failures (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatobiliary, and neuromuscular) Medical exclusion criteria Known sensitivities or allergies to the materials of construction of the devices, including nitinol (Nickel:Titanium), polyester, platinumiridium, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulation or contrast media that cannot be adequately medically managed Uncorrectable coagulopathy Body habitus that would inhibit xray visualization of the aorta or exceeds the safe capacity of the equipment Patient has had a major surgical or interventional procedure unrelated to the treatment of the aneurysm planned &lt; 30 days of the endovascular repair Unstable angina (defined as angina with a progressive increase in symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina) Systemic or local infection that may increase the risk of endovascular graft infection Baseline creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL History of connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan Syndrome, Ehler's Danlos Syndrome) Anatomical exclusion criteria Thrombus or excessive calcification within the neck of the aneurysm Anatomy that would not allow maintenance of at least one patent hypogastric artery Anatomy that would not allow primary or assisted patency of the left subclavian artery Expanded Selection Arm Inclusion Criteria Patient that meets the criteria for inclusion in the primary study arm but has one or more of the following criteria which would exclude them from the primary study arm: Minimum branch vessel diameter less than 5 mm Urgent or emergent presentation Patient has a contained rupture Patient has a ruptured aneurysm Patient has a type B dissection (subacute or chronic) in the portion of the aorta intended to be treated Poor performance status including two major system failures (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatobiliary, and neuromuscular) Baseline creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL Anatomy that would not allow for maintenance of at least one hypogastric artery Anatomy that would not allow for primary or assisted patency of the left subclavian artery</criteria>
