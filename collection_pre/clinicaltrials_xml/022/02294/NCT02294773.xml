	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the timing of intrauterine insemination (IUI) in relation to the natural surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), as detected by home ovulation predictor kits, on pregnancy rates per treatment cycle. The study will take place at the offices of Midwest Fertility Specialists and include patients who have been independently recommended by their primary physician to undergo ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (CC) or letrozole and IUI as therapy for infertility.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Timing of Intrauterine Insemination in Relation to Positive Home Ovulation Prediction Kit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine insemination is a procedure that is performed in the physician's office. During the procedure the sperm from the male partner are placed directly into the female partner's uterus around the time of ovulation (release of oocyte or egg). Ovulation predictor kits, available over the counter at pharmacies, test for the presence of luteinizing hormone in the urine. When the test result is a positive, it means the hormone is present in the urine. This is a sign of ovulation. Physicians typically choose to perform intrauterine insemination either the day of a positive ovulation test or the day after a positive ovulation test. The purpose of this study is to determine if the day when intrauterine insemination is performed influences the chance of becoming pregnant.</detailed_description>
