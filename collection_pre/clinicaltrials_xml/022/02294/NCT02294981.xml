	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the best dosing strategy when using Excimer Laser to treat plaque-type psoriasis. In this study, half of the body's psoriasis will be treated with a new dosing strategy, and the other half will be treated with the conventional method. We hope to show that the new dosing strategy will result in faster improvement of psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Excimer Laser Phototherapy Outcomes in the Treatment of Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, assessor-blinded clinical trial to determine whether a novel plaque-based dosimetry strategy can improve the speed of response to excimer laser treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis. Each patient will receive plaque-based dosing on one side of the body and conventional dosing on the contralateral side. This design is based on the assumption that psoriasis usually affects patients in a symmetric distribution (e.g., knees and elbows) and the effect of excimer laser phototherapy is limited to the treated plaque. The side of the body treated with plaque-based dosimetry will be assigned using a table of random numbers. The assessor will be blinded to the treatment group. Each patient will be treated 1-2 times per week at the discretion of the investigator for a maximum of 10 treatments.</detailed_description>

The bilateral target lesions must be present in the same category of anatomical region (e.g., bilateral lower extremities, bilateral upper extremities or bilateral trunk). 1. active or past history of erythrodermic psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, or pustular psoriasis 2. history of photosensitivity disorder 3. history of malignant melanoma 4. active, invasive nonmelanoma skin carcinoma 5. Fitzpatrick Skin Type I 6. Subject has received ultraviolet B phototherapy or any topical antipsoriatic therapy within two weeks prior to starting the study. 7. Subject has received systemic or topical psoralenultraviolet A photochemotherapy within four weeks prior to starting the study. 8. Subject has received biologic therapy within three months of starting the study.</criteria>
