	<brief_summary>Clinical-noninvasive recording of sounds from the knees through a brief loaded range of motion. Description in phase 1 analytic but descriptive as well in phase 2. No samples other than a sound recording. The device is known microphone attached to the skin of the knee with elastic material. Sound recorded and analyzed on a lap top computer with Adobe software.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Joint Sounds in the Diagnosis of Knee Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a need for a less expensive and more universally available screening device for the knee, and other joint pathology. The equipment used for ultrasound is much less expensive and cumbersome than that of an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging. The equipment we will use for the analysis of sound produced by the body itself is an order of magnitude less expensive than ultrasound; such as a laptop computer with currently available software and an inexpensive transducer. Analysis of sound has proved useful in Pulmonology and Cardiology. We believe sound analysis will provide a useful yet inexpensive tool for primary care physicians as well as musculoskeletal specialists. Phase 1: Establish the normal sound patterns emanating from the uninjured knee; we will look for the influence of age, height and weight. Phase 2: To record and analyze the preoperative sound patterns from the knees with pathology, known by MRI and arthroscopy, then compare them with the normal sounds from Phase 1.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Phase I Healthy Individuals. No neurological problems. No knee complaints. No previous Surgery or Knee injuries. Phase II Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy who have preop MRI. The inclusion will be based on age group, 20 years of age, 40 and 60. Neurologic Disease Previous serious injury (Fracture or dislocation). Previous Ligament reconstruction. Major nonsubtitle problems with their knees. (This would create overwhelming noises).</criteria>
