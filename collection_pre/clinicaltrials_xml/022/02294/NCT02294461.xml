	<brief_title>An Asian Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Oral Enzalutamide in Progressive Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multinational Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of oral enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100) in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects with progressive metastatic prostate cancer who have disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy. Subjects must not have been previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Approximately 30 Chinese subjects will be allocated to the PK cohort. The subjects in PK cohort will be requested to be hospitalized from one day before the date of randomization to at least the completion of all the assessments planned on Day 3. All subjects in PK cohort will undergo blood sampling for PK analysis of unchanged enzalutamide and its major metabolites regardless of treatment arm.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH analogue or bilateral orchiectomy Progressive disease despite androgen deprivation therapy as defined by rising PSA levels or progressive soft tissue or bone disease No prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic from prostate cancer Severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbidity that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease History of another malignancy within the previous 5 years other than curatively treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer History of seizure including febrile seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization).</criteria>
