	<brief_summary>The complete removal of colorectal polyp is required to prevent tumor recurrence and development of potential interval cancers. However, several studies have shown high incomplete resection rate in endoscopic removal of neoplastic colorectal polyps larger than 5 mm. The polypectomy techniques using hot snare are usually used for the removal of these polyps. However, the optimal technique for complete resection of these polyps is unknown. There are few data comparing hot snare polypectomy with hot snare polypectomy after saline injection for complete resection of colorectal polyps (5mm or larger). The aim of this study is to compare hot snare polypectomy with hot snare polypectomy after saline injection for removal of 5-10mm sized colorectal polyps.</brief_summary>
