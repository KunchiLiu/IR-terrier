	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Biological Activity of ATYR1940 in Adult Patients With Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study ATYR1940-C-002 is a multi-national, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamic effects of ATYR1940 in patients with FSHD. Up to 44 patients are planned to be enrolled at multiple study centers in the U.S. and Europe; the actual number of patients enrolled will depend on the number of cohorts initiated. Patients will be screened for study eligibility during the Screening period within 3 weeks before Baseline (i.e., Day 1, the first day of Study Drug administration). Eligible patients, based on Screening assessments, will be randomly assigned to treatment with ATYR1940 or placebo. Patients who are randomized are considered to be enrolled in the study. After enrollment, patients will enter the 1-week single-blind placebo period during which all patients will receive a single 30-minute IV infusion of placebo. Thereafter, patients will enter the double-blind treatment period and will receive 30-minute IV infusions of Study Drug (ATYR1940 or placebo) according to their random treatment assignment.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient is a male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive. Patient has an established, geneticallyconfirmed, diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy with clinical findings meeting existing criteria. Patient has provided written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained and prior to the performance of any researchrelated procedures. Patient is, in the Investigator's opinion, willing and able to comply with all study procedures. Cohorts ≥2 only: Patient has imaging findings meeting defined criteria for muscle inflammation in at least 1 skeletal muscle Patient is currently receiving treatment with an immunomodulatory agent or has a history of such treatment, including targeted biological therapies (e.g., etanercept, omalizumab) within the 3 months before Baseline; corticosteroids within 4 weeks before Baseline; or highdose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) within 2 weeks before Baseline. Patient is currently receiving curcumin or albuterol or requires such treatment during study participation. Patient has evidence of an alternative diagnosis other than FSHD, based on prior muscle biopsy or genetic test findings. Patient has a presumptive diagnosis of FSHD, based on clinical assessment, but does not yet have genetic confirmation of the diagnosis. Patient has a severe retinopathy. Patient has a history of obstructive or restrictive lung disease (including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, or asthma), or evidence for interstitial lung disease on Screening chest radiograph. Patient has a history of antisynthetase syndrome, prior Jo1 antibody (Ab)positivity, or has a positive or equivocally positive Jo1 Ab test result during Screening. Patient has acute or clinically relevant EpsteinBarr virus or cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation. Patient has a chronic infection such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus or a history of tuberculosis. Patient has received a vaccination within 8 weeks before Baseline or vaccination is planned during study participation. Patient has symptomatic cardiomyopathy or severe cardiac arrhythmia that may, in the Investigator's opinion, limit the patient's ability to complete the study protocol. Patient has anemia (as defined for patient's age and gender by local laboratory range). Patient has gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) or serum creatinine levels &gt;2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). Patient has abnormal baseline findings, medical condition(s), or laboratory findings that, in the Investigator's opinion, might jeopardize patient's safety or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objectives of the study. Patient has evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematological, metabolic, dermatological, or gastrointestinal disease, or has a condition that requires immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe participation. Patient has used any investigational product or device (other than a mobility assistance device) within 30 days before Baseline. Patient has received a product intended to enhance muscle growth within 30 days before Baseline. Patient underwent muscle biopsy within 30 days before Baseline. Patient initiated treatment with a statin or had a significant adjustment to their statin regimen within 3 months before Baseline. (Stable, chronic statin use is permissible.) Patient has received a product that putatively enhances muscle growth (e.g., insulinlike growth factor, growth hormone) or activity (e.g., Coenzyme A) on a chronic basis within 4 weeks before Baseline. Patient is unwilling to abstain from strenuous physical activity for 24 hours prior to each study center visit. Patient previously received ATYR1940. If female and of childbearing potential (premenopausal and not surgically sterile), patient has a positive pregnancy test at Screening or is unwilling to use contraception from the time of Screening through 1 month after the last Study Drug dose. Acceptable methods of birth control include abstinence, barrier methods, hormones, or intrauterine device. If male, patient is unwilling to use a condom plus spermicide during sexual intercourse from the time of Screening through 1 month after the last Study Drug dose. Cohorts ≥2 only: Patient has a known contraindication for MRI assessments (e.g., metal prosthesis or pacemaker) as per local site MRI protocol</criteria>
