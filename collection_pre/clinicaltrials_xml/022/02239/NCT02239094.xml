	<brief_title>Biosignatures of Latuda for Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to enroll 20 participants with a bipolar disorder who are currently in an episode of major depression.We shall conduct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), recordings of brain electrical activity (EEG), and psychological testing to explore possible predictors of lurasidone treatment response. Blood samples will be collected for a future study of blood protein predictors of response. After testing, participants will receive an open-label 8-week trial of lurasidone (Latudaâ„¢) at approved dosage levels. Participants who attain remission of their major depressive episode will be eligible for a six-month continuation phase to explore predictors of sustained response to continuation treatment. Data analyses will use statistical testing to explore potential biological predictors of lurasidone response. This will provide a framework for clarifying which patients are best suited to this treatment and begin to develop a model for precision treatment of this difficult-to-treat disorder.</detailed_description>

Allergy to, or other medical contraindication to lurasidone treatment 13. Currently enrolled in another research study, and participation in that study contraindicates participation 14. Clinically significant screening laboratory abnormalities (* see below) 15. Currently taking an effective mood stabilizer and/or antidepressant regimen 16. Inability to undergo a three week medicationfree period, including history of significant clinical deterioration from past periods off medication or when medication dosage was reduced, including mania, severe depression, etc. 17. Any reason not listed herein that would make participation in the study hazardous *Medical criteria for exclusion: Untreated hypertension: &gt; 140/90 Torr on repeated measurement (If hypertension becomes stabilized, subject may enroll in study) Hepatitis: any liver function test &gt; 2x the upper limit of normal Renal failure: estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR, corrected for body surface area) repeatedly &lt; 30 mL/min Hypothyroidism: thryrotropin stimulating hormone level &gt; upper limit of normal (unless accompanied by other euthyroid indices and the confirmation by an internist or endocrinologist that this does not represent hypothyroidism) Anemia: hemoglobin &lt; 10 grams/deciliter (borderline hemoglobin must be of known origin, stable, and not clinically significant)</criteria>
