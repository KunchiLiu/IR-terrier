	<brief_title>A Study of Patient-reported Outcomes in Patients With Lung or Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A patient-centered approach to lung cancer surveillance following resection needs to incorporate patient reported outcomes. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) was designed to revolutionize the assessment of patient reported outcomes by establishing a national resource for the measurement of patient-reported symptoms and other health outcomes. The PROMIS Assessment Center, the management tool within the larger PROMIS system, will be used to securely store de identified data, provide automated accrual reports and data export for this specific study. This study will have it's own study specific website. Patients seen at the University of Virginia Cancer Center will be identified and invited to participate in an assessment of their reported outcomes over multiple domains available in PROMIS. Collecting this information on lung cancer survivors may provide a robust platform to design a patient-centered surveillance strategy following resection. The study team hypothesizes that patient reported outcomes will vary according to the presence of recurrence or metastasis of lung or esophageal cancer. The study team also believes including patient reported outcomes into routine post-treatment surveillance will improve patient satisfaction and improve outcomes.</detailed_description>
