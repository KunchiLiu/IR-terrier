	<brief_title>Intervention Study on the Health Impact of Air Filters in Chinese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial among 35 healthy college students in Shanghai, China in 2014. These students lived in dormitories that were randomized into two groups and alternated the use of true or sham air purifiers for 48 hours with a 2-week wash-out interval.All participants and research staff were blinded to the group assignment. We requested all participants to stay in their dormitory room with the windows/doors closed throughout each 48-hour intervention period. We delivered foods and drinks to each room during the intervention period. All interventions started at 8 a.m. to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. We evaluated health endpoints and drew blood immediately after the completion of each 48-hour intervention. We measured 14 circulating biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and vasoconstriction, lung function, blood pressure (BP), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).</detailed_description>
