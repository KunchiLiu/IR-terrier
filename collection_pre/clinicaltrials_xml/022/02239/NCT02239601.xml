	<brief_summary>The cause of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) is still unknown. A theory is that the microtubule-stabilizing agents that prevent division of cells also affect healthy peripheral nerves. Symptoms of CIPN are in the hands/feet and include: pain, numbness, and loss of function. An estimated 55-60% of patients will experience lasting symptoms affecting function for years post-treatment. Research on nerve disorders identifies that a nerve already entrapped/damaged at one site may be at greater risk when combined with chemotherapy (double crush syndrome). Physical therapy is an established, effective treatment for entrapped nerves and neuropathic pain. This study seeks to identify additional risk factors and provide evidence for the role of physical therapy in the treatment of CIPN. Hypotheses 1. Physical therapy will assist in managing symptoms (sensory, pain, edema) compared to the control group during chemotherapy. 2. Positive tests for mechanical entrapment prior to chemotherapy will result in more severe symptoms of CIPN. 3. The treatment group will have greater resolution of CIPN symptoms compared to control at the six month follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosed with stage IIII breast cancer undergoing regular docetaxel treatment either docetaxelcyclophosphamide (TC) or 5FUepirubicincyclophosphamidedocetaxel (FECD). Patients that have not had chemotherapy in the past and do not have identified risk factors (listed below in the exclusion criteria). All patients must be able to communicate in english or be able to have a translator present at all appointments. Patients diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer or who have comorbid conditions that are known to cause peripheral neuropathic symptoms, including previous chemotherapy, exposure to toxins (such as lead), Diabetes, Shingles, B12 deficiency, Alcoholism, Lyme disease, Syphilis, HIV, Hereditary disorders such as CharcotMarie Tooth. Patients not planned to receive Docetaxel therapy. Patients who cannot communicate in English and unable to bring an interpreter will also be excluded.</criteria>
