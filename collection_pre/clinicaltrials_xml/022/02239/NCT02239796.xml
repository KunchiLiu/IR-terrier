	<brief_title>Feasibility Controlled Trial of Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Stroke Related Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke-related urinary incontinence (UI) persists in more than one third of stroke survivors. It is associated with significant burden including reduced quality of life, increased morbidity and disability. Urgency UI, together with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms (frequency, urgency, nocturia), is most commonly experienced. Current continence care is limited to lifestyle advice and behavioural interventions such as voiding programmes. There is a reliance on containment approaches and a lack of available options for active treatment. Intermittent electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve (TPTNS) is effective for treating non-stroke neurogenic UI and OAB, but has not been tested in the stroke population. This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the potential effectiveness of TPTNS for stroke-related bladder dysfunction. Adults with stroke-related UI will be randomised to TPTNS or sham. They and/or their carer will be taught to self-deliver a programme of TPTNS over a six week period. Bladder function, associated healthcare costs and quality of life outcomes will be measured at 6, 12 and 26 weeks. A nested process evaluation will be conducted. Pilot RCT and process evaluation results will inform the design of a phase III RCT of TPTNS to treat urinary incontinence in the stroke population.</detailed_description>
