	<brief_summary>Objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of tipranavir (TPV) in combination with ritonavir (TPV/r) compared with a standard dual PI combination of saquinavir (SQV) and ritonavir (RTV) and to evaluate the dose response of two different doses of TPV in combination with RTV for efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical failure while on the current PIcontaining regimen of indinavir, nelfinavir, or amprenavir In the investigator's opinion, adherence to the present PIcontaining regimen Exposure of &gt;=6 months to the current PI therapy Stable PIcontaining regimen, i.e., receiving the current two reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) for at least 2 months prior to study entry HIV1 RNA &gt;=1000 copies/mL (assayed using the Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method at the initial screening visit) No limit in CD4+ cell count at the initial screening At least two new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) options available Age &gt;=18 years Acceptable screening laboratory test values that indicated adequate baseline organ function at the time of screening. Acceptable laboratory test values consisted of the following: severity &lt;=Grade 1 (ACTG Grading Scale). Stable Grade 2 abnormalities were permitted if the values had been demonstrated and documented for at least &gt;=2 months. All laboratory values &gt;Grade 2 were subject to approval by the P&amp;U Clinical Program Leader or designated personnel and subsequently by the BI designated personnel Acceptable medical history, physical examination, ECG, and chest radiograph prior to entry into the treatment phase of the study Use of a barrier contraceptive method of birth control for at least 30 days prior to study drug administration, during the study, and 30 days after study completion Ability to swallow numerous tablets and capsules without difficulty Ability to understand and provide informed consent. Minors had to have approval of a parent or legal guardian Treatment with more than one PIcontaining regimen Clinically significant active or acute (onset within the month previous to study entry) medical problems, including the following: opportunistic infections, e.g., active cryptococcosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, herpes zoster, histoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus; nonopportunistic diseases, including but not limited to the following: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, lymphoma, or malignancy requiring systemic therapy Prior exposure (&gt;7 days) to tipranavir, saquinavir, or ritonavir History of clinically significant nervous system or muscle diseases, seizure disorder, or psychiatric disorder that might impair adherence to the protocol Taking of any known P450 3A enzymeinducing drugs within 30 days of study entry and including the following: rifabutin, rifampin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sulfadimidine, sulfinpyrazone, or troleandomycin Hypersensitivity to tipranavir, saquinavir, or ritonavir Use of interferons, interleukins, HIV vaccines, or any active immunizations within 30 days of study entry Taking of any investigational medication with the exception of adefovir dipivoxil (Preveon™) within 30 days of study entry Pregnancy or lactation (serum βhuman chorionic gonadotrophin test had to have been negative within 14 days of study entry) Evidence of substance abuse, which in the investigator's opinion could affect adherence to the protocol In the investigator's judgment, inability to comply with the protocol requirements for reasons other than those specified</criteria>
