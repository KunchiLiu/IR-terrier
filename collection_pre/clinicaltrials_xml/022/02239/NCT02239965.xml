	<brief_summary>Monitoring the degree of neuromuscular blockade in general anaesthesia reduces complications and patient discomfort. However, monitoring is not applied consistently by Danish anaesthesia personnel. Surveys show that part of the explanation is that the anaesthetists often experience problems with the equipment used for monitoring, though the problems have not been described in detail. We hypothesise that the lack of consistent monitoring in general anaesthesia is caused by insecurity in the anaesthesia personnel's set-up and use of the equipment, as well as in interpreting the measurement results.</brief_summary>
