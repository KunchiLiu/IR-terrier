	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted through a practice-based research network of community pediatric practices. Participating sites will be randomized to the intervention or control condition (usual care) using a pre-specified randomization scheme derived using computer generated random numbers. The intervention sites will participate in a 30-minute training for using the "Milk. Water. Period" intervention (brochures, posters, key talking points and phone messages) in their office. The goal is for them to discuss beverage consumption and encourage "Milk. Water. Period" for all children 12 months to 12 years old (not yet reached their 13th birthday) at their checkup visit. The primary care provider (PCP) will use the talking points to facilitate the discussion about drink milk and water only and will give a brochure to each family. Assessments will be by telephone interview of the parent 2 to 4 weeks after a check-up visit for the index child.</detailed_description>
