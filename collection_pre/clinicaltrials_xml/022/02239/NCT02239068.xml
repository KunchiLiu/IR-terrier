	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that more than 50% of the patients receiving enteric contrast material (ECM) &lt; 2 hours of anesthesia/sedation would have residual gastric fluid volume (GFV) &gt; 0.4 ml/kg. The investigators also hypothesize that measuring GFV by using region of interest in the CT technique is accurate compared to blind aspiration of the gastric contents with a syringe and a multi-orificed orogastric tube.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Residual Gastric Fluid Volume</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of our study is to examine the residual gastric fluid volume when oral contrast is administered within 2 hours of anesthesia /sedation and to validate the accuracy of measuring the residual gastric volume by using region of interest in the CT image by using blind aspiration of the gastric contents with a syringe and a multi-orificed orogastric tube.</detailed_description>
