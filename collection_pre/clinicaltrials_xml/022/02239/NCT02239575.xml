	<brief_summary>This study will enroll specimens from subjects diagnosed with various cancers and who have either: 1. RETROSPEFCTIVE / ARCHIVAL SAMPLES already undergone surgical resection of their tumor and have one or more formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks on file within the local (or affiliated) pathology archive (replicate blocks from same tumor) or blocks no longer required to be maintained on file - discard blocks, or 2. PROSPECTIVE SAMPLES are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment and who prior to scheduled surgery, provide informed consent and donate a 10-20 ml blood sample. After surgery, surplus tissues (including tumor and adjacent normal tissues) not required for diagnosis will be collected. Subject clinical information will be collected, including basic demographic information, medical history, current cancer history and treatment. A final pathology report will be obtained for each subject's surgical specimen. In some instances, and based on the cancer indications required, longitudinal data may also be collected at a frequency of every 6 months to once per year. Longitudinal data will include information on study subject survival and disease recurrence.</brief_summary>
