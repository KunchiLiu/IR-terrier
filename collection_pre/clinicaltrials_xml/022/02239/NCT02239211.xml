	<brief_summary>This is a phase II study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of a human monoclonal antibody (BTT1023) which targets the vascular adhesion protein (VAP-1) and its use in the treatment of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of BTT1023 in Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive immune mediated biliary disease characterised by bile duct inflammation and fibrosis, and accompanying hepatic fibrosis. For patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in particular, progressive disease is predicted, that currently results in a need for liver transplantation in the majority. No current medical therapy has as yet been shown to be effective in altering the natural history of disease. For this reason patients with PSC with elevated ALP values will be recruited to this study, to evaluate the impact of Vap-1 blockade by BTT1023, in an early phase study focused on biochemical efficacy and safety. This is an early phase study of BTT1023 in immune mediated liver disease, with the rationale to identify biochemical efficacy of effect (reduction in ALP) and safety, in an orphan disease indication for PSC that presently lacks any other medical therapy. The study design therefore focuses on identifying early biochemical efficacy signals to justify larger scale, randomised controlled studies over longer duration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females 18 75 years of age who are willing and able to provide informed, written consent and comply with all study requirements. Clinical diagnosis of PSC as evident by chronic cholestasis of more than six months duration with either a consistent MRI showing sclerosing cholangitis or a liver biopsy consistent with PSC in the absence of a documented alternative aetiology for sclerosing cholangitis. In those on treatment with UDCA, therapy must be stable for at least 3 months, and at a dose not greater than 20mg/kg/day. Serum ALP greater than 1.5xULN. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to starting study treatment. For the purposes of this study, a female subject of childbearing potential is a woman who has not had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or medicallydocumented ovarian failure. Women ≤ 50 years of age with amenorrhea of any duration will be considered to be of childbearing potential. All sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from the Screening Visit throughout the study period and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug. If using hormonal agents the same method must have been used for at least 1 month before study dosing and subjects must use a barrier method as the other form of contraception. Lactating women must agree to discontinue nursing before study investigational medicinal product administration. Men, if not vasectomized, must agree to use barrier contraception (condom plus spermicide) during heterosexual intercourse from screening through to study completion and for 90 days from the last dose of study investigational medicinal product. Presence of documented secondary sclerosing cholangitis on prior clinical investigations. Presence of alternative causes of liver disease, that are considered by the Investigator to be the predominant active liver injury at the time of screening, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients with possible overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis are excluded if the Investigator considers autoimmune hepatitis as the predominant liver injury. AST and ALT &gt; 10 x ULN or Bilirubin &gt;3xULN or INR&gt;1.3 in the absence of anticoagulants. Serum creatinine &gt;130μmol/L or Platelet count &lt;50x109/L. Any evidence of hepatic decompensation past or present, including ascites, episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Harmful alcohol consumption as evaluated by the investigator. Flare in colitis activity within last 90 days requiring intensification of therapy beyond baseline maintenance treatment; use of oral prednisolone &gt;10mg/day, biologics and or hospitalisation for colitis within 90 days. Diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma or high clinical suspicion over dominant stricture. Active malignancy (within 3 years of diagnosis), other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer. Major surgical procedure within 30 days of screening or prior organ transplantation. Known hypersensitivity to the investigation product or any of its formulation excipients; inability to receive simple antiinflammatory agents' periinfusion. Participation in an investigational trial of a drug or device either within 60 days of screening or 5 halflifes of the last dose of investigational drug, where the study drug half life is greater than 12 days. Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator renders the subject a poor risk for inclusion into the subject a poor risk for inclusion into the study. Positive screening test for tuberculosis (including TSPOT.TB TB test), unless respiratory review confirms false positive test results. Receipt of live vaccination within 6 weeks prior to baseline visit.</criteria>
