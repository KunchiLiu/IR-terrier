	<brief_summary>The current standard of care for pregnant women deemed to be high-risk often involves recommending varying levels of activity-restriction, up to and including hospitalization. High levels of activity-restriction can lead to physical deconditioning of the mother, which can be difficult to recover from after birth. The proposed study will investigate whether a mild muscular conditioning program conducted in bed and given to hospitalized activity-restricted high-risk pregnant women will improve functional ability, cardiovascular deconditioning and overall quality of life in the postpartum period compared to a control group with no in hospital bed-rest exercise program. We hypothesize that women with a in-hospital muscle conditioning program will be better able to perform functional ability tasks and activities of daily living than a control group with no exercise program.</brief_summary>
