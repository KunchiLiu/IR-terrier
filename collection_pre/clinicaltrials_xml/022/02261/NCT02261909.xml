	<brief_summary>NephroCheck is measuring the concentration of a certain protein combination in the urine of patients. In elevated values there is a probability of renal failure (already proven in intensive care patients). The investigators would like to investigate whether the investigators can predict renal failure in patients receiving contrast enhanced CT's in the emergency department. That would lead to an earlier nephrologist consult in those patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use of contrast agents can - especially in already in impaired renal function - lead to a decline in real function. The contrast enhanced CT is especially in emergency patients an important diagnostic tool for example in the detection of pulmonary embolism or mesenteric ischemia. Creatinine has been used as a marker for real function so far. But the investigators all know that creatinine is not a perfect marker especially as it is influenced by age, sex, weight and muscle mass. Especially in the diagnosis of acute renal failure creatinine does not allow and recent change in the kidney function. This prospective, unicentric study should therefore investigate two new markers in emergency patients who need an emergency contrast enhanced CT to early predict pending kidney function decline.</detailed_description>
