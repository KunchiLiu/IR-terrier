	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of TG01 and Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) when given in addition to gemcitabine (chemotherapy) and - Understand any possible side effects of the additional use of TG01/GM-CSF with gemcitabine - Investigate whether TG01/GM-CSF when given with gemcitabine can produce an immune response - Investigate if the treatment can delay or reduce recurrence of the disease</brief_summary>
