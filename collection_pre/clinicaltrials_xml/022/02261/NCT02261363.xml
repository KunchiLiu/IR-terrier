	<brief_summary>The universe of tobacco products is expanding, with new noncombustible products gaining popularity even as the reduction in prevalence of cigarette smoking slows or stalls. E-cigarettes, or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), are the most prevalent of these emerging noncombustible products. With sales increasing rapidly and more efficient pulmonary delivery devices under development, ENDS are likely to play an increasing role in the future tobacco market. Little is known about the cognitions and behaviors leading to or sustaining ENDS use. Smokers may use ENDS to subvert smoking restrictions, to reduce perceived smoking harms, or for smoking cessation. Evidence about ENDS use is emerging from national surveillance and laboratory research, but the majority of information on ENDS is limited to retrospective surveys and convenience samples of White male ENDS users. The investigators research suggests Black smokers are less likely than White smokers to try and be current ENDS users, perhaps due to a greater degree of perceived harm associated with ENDS, a preference for menthol, or cultural norms. Thus, it is timely and critical to study how all smokers, including Blacks and menthol smokers, experience and initiate ENDS use employing valid, innovative research methods.</brief_summary>
