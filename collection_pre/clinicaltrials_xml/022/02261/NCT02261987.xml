	<brief_summary>This trial aims to analyze whether the resistive inspiratory manoeuvre (RIM) performed previously to autogenic drainage (AD) technique improves the effectiveness in terms of mucus clearance during a typical bronchial drainage session in adults, stable CF patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistive Inspiratory Manoeuvre as Airway Clearance Technique in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a multicenter study. 4 different Spain Cystic Fibrosis Foundations are included in the study (Madrid, Valencia, Murcia and Aragón). All patients will perform three different arms of treatment in a crossover randomization. Each arm of treatment will be apply only in one session. The wash-out period will be one week. Before starting the trial, all patients will perform a control session without any intervention, only the outcome measures will be assess. During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged</detailed_description>
