	<brief_summary>Femoral component rotation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been considered an important factor for outcome. However, measurement of femoral component rotation is difficult to perform. Femoral TKA component rotation can be assessed on special radiographs (Kanekasu technique), axial CT slices and 3D reconstructed CT images. It was the hypothesis that measurements on radiographs are comparable to measurement on CT images. Measurements of femoral TKA rotation will be measured three times by three different observers and inter- and intraobserver reliability is calculated. The absolute values of each measurement method is noted in degrees.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Femoral component rotation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been considered an important factor for outcome. However, measurement of femoral component rotation is difficult to perform. Femoral TKA component rotation can be assessed on special radiographs (Kanekasu technique), axial CT slices and 3D reconstructed CT images. It was the hypothesis that measurements on radiographs are comparable to measurement on CT images. In agreement with our standard diagnostic algorithm for patients with pain and problems after TKA CT images as well as Kanekasu radiographs are performed. If the Kanekasu radiograph is comparable reliable, it could be possible to use this radiograph instead. Measurements of femoral TKA rotation will be measured three times by three different observers and inter- and intraobserver reliability is calculated. The absolute values of each measurement method is noted in degrees. The measurements are performed with two weeks interval and the different observers are blinded to their previous and the measurements of the others. The absolute difference of femoral TKA rotation is calculated between and inter the groups investigated. Intra class correlation coefficients are calculated for inter- and intraobserver reliability.</detailed_description>
