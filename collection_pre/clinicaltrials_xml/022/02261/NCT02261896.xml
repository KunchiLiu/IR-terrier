	<brief_title>Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of infection after a pancreatic cyst fine needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS-FNA) is not well known. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in clinical guidelines despite the lack of evidence of its usefulness. Our hypothesis is that the risk of infection will not be higher with placebo, and risks associated to the use of antibiotics might even increase with the use of prophylaxis. The main objective of the project is to assess the risk of infection after the procedure and to determine whether the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriate. The study is a phase IV, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, and non-inferiority trial . We have designed a study with two parallel treatment groups. Patients will be randomized to the prophylaxis or to the placebo group. All patients will be followed for 21 days or until resolution of complications. To evaluate this primary objective with a non inferiority study, we have estimated that a total of 218 patients will be needed (109 per group) . The main secondary objective is to assess the incidence of complications related to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e. allergic reactions, secondary infections or drug-resistant infections).</detailed_description>
