	<brief_summary>The main purpose of follow-up in asymptomatic breast cancer patients during and after adjuvant treatment is to detect breast cancer recurrence and metastatic disease.The aim of this trial is to verify if, in asymptomatic patients, the serial measurement of serum CEA and CA 15.3, with diagnostic imaging procedures (18FDG-PET) performed only in case of a critical increase of serum CEA and CA 15.3 level, can anticipate the diagnosis of breast cancer local and distant recurrence compared to the usual follow-up practice.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female ≥18 years. Histologically confirmed stage IIII epithelial breast cancer. Adequate surgery of breast and axilla: 1. patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or breast conserving surgery 2. surgical margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor. Signed informed consent obtained prior to any studyspecific procedures. Histologically confirmed stage 0 epithelial breast cancer (carcinoma in situ). Special histologies with a high or low risk of relapse (i.e. sarcoma and tubular carcinoma) T1a and T1b tumors with all the following characteristics: G12 and N0 and RE &gt; 10%, RPg &gt; 10% and HER2 negative and Ki67≤14% Evidence of distant metastases Patients participating to other clinical trials requiring followup not equal to standard Previous history of cancer within 5 years from randomization (except for appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, stage I uterine cancer, or other nonbreast malignancies with an outcome similar to those mentioned above)</criteria>
