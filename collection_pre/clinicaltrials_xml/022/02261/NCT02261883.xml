	<brief_title>Remodulin as Add-on Therapy for the Treatment of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll subjects with PPHN who do not show an adequate response to inhaled nitric oxide with the hypothesis that the addition of intravenous (IV) Remodulin will reduce the rate of clinical worsening as compared to standard of care. Additionally, this study aims to evaluate the treatment effect of Remodulin and better understand the dosing and pharmacokinetics in the neonatal population.</detailed_description>
