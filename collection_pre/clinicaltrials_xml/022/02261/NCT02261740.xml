	<brief_summary>The POPPY Study is a pilot of an Iyengar-based, therapeutic yoga program, used to treat pelvic or genital pain, in up to 16 women. Women aged 21 years and older who report persistent or recurrent pelvic or genital pain for at least 6 months that interferes with sexual activity will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area. Those who meet eligibility criteria will take part in a 6-week yoga therapy program designed by an expert yoga panel. Women will attend twice-weekly group classes focusing on Iyengar-based yoga techniques that have been carefully selected for their potential to improve women's genito-pelvic pain and practice yoga at home one additional hour a week. The investigators will evaluate changes in the severity and impact of women's pain using validated questionnaires and diaries.</brief_summary>
