	<brief_title>Off-Label Use of Ribavirin in Management of Mucocutaneous Extrahepatic Manifestations of HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and represent public health problem. The Egyptian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS), a cross sectional survey including hepatitis C virus (HCV) biomarkers, was conducted in 2008 on a large nationally representative sample. It estimated HCV prevalence among the 15-59 years age group to be 14.7% . Accordingly, Egypt has the highest HCV prevalence in the world. Although HCV is a hepatotropic virus, in some patients the primary manifestations of infection occur outside the liver. There is a growing body of evidence to support the idea that HCV can replicate efficiently in extrahepatic tissues including the Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Autoimmune manifestations are common in patients chronically infected by HCV . These manifestations can be dominant, whereas the hepatic disease can be quiescent or mild. More recently, there has been growing interest in the relationship between HCV and Sjogren's syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Of those , this article is interested in cutaneous and mucous membrane manifestations where many reports have shown that cutaneous manifestations are often the first signs of chronic HCV infection and these are indicated in 20-40% of the patients presenting to the dermatology clinics, therefore dermatologists must be aware of skin disorders associated with viral infection. The most commonly encountered dermatological manifestations of HCV infection includes mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), cutaneous and/or oral lichen planus (LP), urticaria, pruritus, thrombocytopenic purpura and cutaneous vasculitis. Although majority of skin manifestations of chronic HCV infection represent the clinical impression of autoimmune phenomena, however, precise pathogenesis of these extra-hepatic complications is not well understood. The aim of the study is to assess efficacy of Ribavirin in the management of mucocutaneous extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection This study will be conducted on 30 patients with mucocutaneous complaints and documented HCV infection. The study will be done at Tropical medicine department , Tanta university. It will be conducted between June2014 and November 2014.</detailed_description>
