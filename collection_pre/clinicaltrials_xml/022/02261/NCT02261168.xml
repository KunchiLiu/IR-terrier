	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the existence of a day-night rhythm in skeletal muscle energy metabolism in healthy lean subjects. Subjects will stay at the research facility for 44 hours with a standardized living protocol during which several measurements of skeletal muscle and whole body energy metabolism will be performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Day-Night Rhythm in Human Skeletal Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence from both observational and experimental studies indicates that disobeying our normal day-night rhythm negatively influences our metabolic and cardiovascular health, possibly leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An important hallmark of obesity and T2DM is a decreased skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Interestingly, recent research indicates that also skeletal muscle mitochondrial function under the influence of a day-night rhythm. The main objective of this study is to investigate the presence of a day-night rhythm in skeletal muscle energy metabolism (in particular mitochondrial function) of healthy young participants. Therefore, subjects will stay at the research unit for 44 hours, with standardized meals and sleeping time. During this period we will take five muscle biopsies, perform indirect calorimetry measurements and blood draws.</detailed_description>
