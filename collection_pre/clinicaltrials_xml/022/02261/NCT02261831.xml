	<brief_title>Identify Bacteria Associated With Metabolic Diseases That Reside Both in Intestinal Crypts and in Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental evidence suggests that bacterial translocation from gut to tissue could be an initial step leading to diabetes. To test this hypothesis, a bacterial component that is highly conserved between different species of bacteria, the 16S rDNA gene will be analysed both in intestinal crypt and in blood in patients with type 2 diabetes, obese patients and control.</detailed_description>
