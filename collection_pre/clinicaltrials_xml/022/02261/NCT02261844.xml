	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Resveratrol, a nutritional supplement, shows a beneficial effect in the cellular function of normal liver cells and diseased liver cells (cancer cells) in samples of liver tissue taken during elective liver surgery. Outcomes based on 3 measures will test the hypothesis that Resveratrol when used as a nutritional supplement will 1)improve metabolic function in liver cells, 2)reduce cellular growth and proliferation of cancer cells, 3)decrease inflammation in the liver.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatic function will be assessed by standard laboratory techniques. Hepatocyte signaling pathway proteins will be measured using western blot analysis for protein expression and polymerase chain reaction for gene expression. Activation of signaling pathways in both native hepatocytes and carcinoma will be analyzed by multi-plex signal array. The effect on transcription factors that may be important in gene expression will be analyzed by transcription factor array. The effect of resveratrol in altering hepatocyte and cancer cell metabolism will be analyzed by proteomic analysis.</detailed_description>
