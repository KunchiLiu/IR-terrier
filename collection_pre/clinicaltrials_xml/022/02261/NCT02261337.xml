	<criteria>All patients with chronic respiratory disease who are able to complete the assessments. Significant comorbidities that would limit walking ability, exercise capacity or make exercise unsafe (e.g. unstable ischaemic heart disease, neuromuscular disease, severe hip/lower limb joint pain, peripheral vascular disease, lower limb amputation). Any patient whom the Chief Investigator feels it is unsafe to exercise (e.g. unstable cardiovascular disease).</criteria>
