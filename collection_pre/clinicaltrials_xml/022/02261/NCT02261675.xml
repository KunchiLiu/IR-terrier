	<brief_summary>The study was designed to define the interaction of intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine, an a2-adrenergic agonist, and sevoflurane in children having surgery by using the minimum alveolar concentration which can block adrenergic and cardiovascular responses to incision(MACbar) of sevoflurane as the measure of anesthetic potency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction in MACbar of Sevoflurane by Dexmedetomidine in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators observed the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine on the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane to blockade adrenergic response to surgical incision in 50% of children (MACBAR). And to explore the safety of use of dexmedetomidine in pediatric patients.</detailed_description>
