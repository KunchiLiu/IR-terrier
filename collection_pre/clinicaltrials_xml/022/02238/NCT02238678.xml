	<brief_summary>It has been demonstrated that ligaments, both cardinal and uterosacral contain a considerable amount of autonomic nerve tissues. The resection of deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules at the level of the uterosacral ligaments or the rectovaginal space is supposed to damage the supplying autonomic nerve fibers of the lower urinary tract. The bladder receives motor and sensitive innervations from both the sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and the parasympathetic fibers, which arise from the pelvic splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus; therefore, even bladder function may be impaired in women affected by deep endometriosis. Very few data have been published regarding the urodynamic functional evaluation of bladder in patient with deep endometriosis.So far, it is unknown if the surgery itself causes the postoperative bladder dysfunction or if the surgery unmasks a subclinically pre-existing detrusor pathology. Since the urinary postoperative complications have a strong impact on quality of life of the deep endometriosis patients and often requires management (due to a poor spontaneous remission), it is crucial a better understanding of the problem. That will help for a more appropriate pre-operative counselling. Aims of this study are to evaluate the bladder function before and after deep endometriosis surgery, using standardized validated instruments and to correlate the localisation of the endometriosis lesion, the type/area of surgical dissection with the postoperative bladder function. This is a prospective multicenter cohort study involving the Department of General Gynaecology and Gynecological Oncology of Medical University of Vienna (Austria) and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Insubria University, Varese (Italy). A total of 50 patients are planned to be included. The study protocol consider a Preoperative Assessment (clinical examination, transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, preoperative specific questionnaire including obstetric, medical, and surgical history and standardized questions on pelvic floor dysfunctions, standardized instrumental assessment of the pelvic floor) a Intraoperative Assessment (during laparoscopy, the localizations of endometriotic lesions recorded and identified by anatomical sites, numbers, and depth of infiltration). Before and 3 months after surgery a Urodynamic assessment is planned.</brief_summary>
