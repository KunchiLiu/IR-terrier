	<brief_summary>Sepsis-associated Purpura fulminans (SAPF) is a rare life-threatening condition. It is characterized by multiple skin lesions which rapidly progress to necrosis and gangrene. SAPF is a manifestation of widespread clot formation in small blood vessels which emerges secondarily to severe bacterial and viral infections. The clinical presentation of SAPF is dominated by symptoms of severe sepsis and multiple organ failure which are further aggravated by the massive skin lesions. At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the medical management of SAPF. With numerous therapeutic approaches in use, there are no consistent comparisons of their efficacy. Altered role of causal pathogens following the introduction of meningococcal and pneumococcal prophylactic vaccines also remains to be investigated. The goal of the registry is comprehensive collection and evaluation of information concerning the epidemiology, morbidity, therapy and outcome of SAPF.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpura fulminans is the clinical manifestation of disseminated thrombosis in dermal and systemic microcirculation. This rare disease is frequently associated with multiple organ failure and represents a life-threatening condition with mortality exceeding 50 %. In the vast proportion of cases, the condition has been shown to emerge secondary to acquired Protein C deficiency associated with severe sepsis, mostly of meningococcal or pneumococcal origin. A consistent therapeutic approach to sepsis-associated Purpura fulminans (SAPF) has not been established yet. With exaggerated pro-coagulant activity being confirmed as the key pathogenic aspect, several treatment modalities aiming at the balance restoration in the coagulation cascade have been considered. SAPF causality might have been substantially altered in the wake of widespread meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccination. There are neither evidence-based treatment guidelines nor comparative evaluation of the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches. The present registry aims at a) large-scale data accumulation and comprehensive evaluation of the incidence, causality and current treatment strategies of SAPF, b) comparative assessment of treatment strategies including or not including protein C supplementation c) identification of patient subgroups of particular eligibility for Protein C treatment, as judged by established criteria of disease severity assessment, d) feedback of aggregated data to registry contributors, thus permitting quality management and standard updates, e) dissemination of data evaluation summaries and recommendations for the use of Protein C formulations in clinical routine, f) elaboration of a framework for SAPF treatment recommendations and guidelines. The registry comprises prospective, multicentric open-label data collection on the current state of incidence and management of SAPF, regardless of the etiopathogenic background. It will include comprehensive records on diagnosis, morbidity and management of SAPF, supplied in the form of eCRFs by the participating centers over a period of three years.</detailed_description>
