	<brief_summary>The primary focus of this intervention trial is to understand the effect of quitting smoking on TB treatment outcomes. The investigators will compare a cessation strategy based on guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUTLD). This is currently not utilized in TB directly observed therapy (DOT) clinics in Pakistan. The investigators study will provide comprehensive data towards understanding the effectiveness of these strategies for TB patients who smoke in Pakistan, and most importantly, on the effect of quitting smoking on TB treatment outcomes. These findings will guide development of effective smoking cessation strategies in a region with high prevalence of TB and increasing tobacco use.</brief_summary>
