	<brief_title>The Effect of Ganoderma on Patients With Head-and-neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ganoderma is known to modulate immunity and improve health. However, the mechanism is not clear. We hypothesize that patients who have completed standard treatment with/without radiotherapy might require biological modifier such as Ganoderma to improve life quality and immunity status. A total of 100 patients are randomized to study and control groups. In study group, Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules are given to the patients for 6 weeks, In control group, only placebos are given during the same period. Then the patients in study and control groups are switched, Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules and placebos are given for 6 weeks. The data pertaining to their Life quality are collected using Quality of Life Questionnaire after the first 6 weeks and the second 6 weeks. The immunity status is also studied at the same time.</detailed_description>
