	<brief_title>Assuring and Defining Outcomes Through Procedural Training Using a Proctorship Model That Collects Patient Outcomes A Single-Arm, Case-Series to Determine the Feasibility of Safe Skills Transfer for Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair Utilizing a Hands-On Proctorship Model.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ADOPT- Ventral Hernia project is designed as a prospective, single arm, case series. The proctor will select a limited number of licensed surgeon trainees (up to 5) as agreed upon by Covidien and the proctor. The proctor will then train through clinical immersions, hands on proctorship and video training for proper technique on minimally invasive surgical (MIS) repair of ventral hernia. After the training, the data will be collected on the trainee's next 10 MIS ventral hernia repair cases, pending subject consent to collect data. Procedural and Post-Operative details will be captured for each of these subjects who have undergone the laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.</detailed_description>
