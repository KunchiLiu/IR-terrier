	<brief_summary>Up to now, only little research has been performed inn tailoring treatment of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). It would be interesting to evaluate a biopsychosocial intervention in patients with a moderate to high level of disability and in whom the contributing role of psychosocial factors to this disability is mild to moderate (WPN3-). Nowadays, these patients receive cognitive behavioral-based treatments in multidisciplinary rehabilitation settings but might also benefit from treatments based on these multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment principles when provided by specifically trained primary care physical therapists. Therefore, the aims of this pilot-study are to evaluate the feasibility of a specifically for primary care physiotherapist developed biopsychosocial intervention ("Back on Track" intervention) in WPN3- classified patients, and to evaluate whether this "Back on Track" intervention results in a significant improvement in functional disability in this subgroup of patients.</brief_summary>
