	<brief_summary>This study will be a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 40 elderly subjects with previous evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction to evaluate whether the administration of MTP-131 will change either hand skeletal muscle energetics or muscle performance in age-related skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Impact of MTP-131 (Bendavia™) on Skeletal Muscle Function in Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Are male and female adults aged ≥60 and ≤85 years 2. Female subjects must be postmenopausal 3. Have in vivo 31P MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) and OPS (Optical Spectra Scan) determined ATPmax (Maximal ATP synthetic rate) &lt; 0.70 mM/sec 4. Have in vivo 31P MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) and OPS (Optical Spectra Scan) determined P/O (Phosphate/Oxygen ratio) &lt; 1.9 5. Are ambulatory and able to perform activities of daily living without assistance 1. Have significant disease(s) or condition(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator, may put the subject at risk because of his/her participation in the study or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 2. Have been hospitalized within 3 months prior to screening for major atherosclerotic events (e.g. myocardial infarction, targetvessel revascularization, coronary bypass surgery or stroke) or other major medical condition (as deemed by the primary investigator) 3. Have any metal implants that cannot be removed from the body that in the opinion of the investigator are a contraindication for undergoing the MRS procedure or any other protocolrelated procedure) 4. Have an implanted cardiac pacemaker or other implanted cardiac device 5. Have chronic, uncontrolled hypertension as judged by the Investigator 6. Have a BMI of &lt; 16 or &gt; 32 kg/m2 7. Have a creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min as calculated by the CockcroftGault equation 8. Subject's right hand has history of mobility impairment, fractures, arthritis, hand surgery, muscle disease or other injury that may interfere with any study procedure Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
