Priority #2 of the plan underlines the need to improve practices and access to opioid substitution treatment. Priority 3 stresses the importance of articulation and coordination between specialized structures and community medicine to optimize the quality of care and to ensure continuity in the followup of these patients. This study focuses on the followup of patients under substitution therapy from the moment they enter a specialized care center for addicts to the period they are monitored by a general practitioner outside the specialized care center.
