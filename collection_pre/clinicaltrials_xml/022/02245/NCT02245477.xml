	<brief_title>Maternal Serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Pregnant Women With Foetal Growth Restriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small-for-gestational age (SGA) is defined as an estimated foetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference (AC) less than the 10th centileand severe SGA as an EFW or AC less than the 3rd centile. Foetal Growth Restriction refers to failure of the foetus to achieve its predetermined growth potential for various reasons.Foetus with foetal growth restriction (FGR) greatly contributes to perinatal mortality and short- and long-term morbidity. There is a 3-10 fold increase in perinatal mortality in pregnancies complicated by this FGR .The incidence of FGR in newborns ranges between 3 and 7% of the total population .FGR is thought to stem from placental hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction of the fetoplacental vessels, leading to placental hypoperfusion and thus fetal undernutrition. However, the effects of hypoxia on the fetoplacental vessels have been surprisingly little studied.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the factors that take part in placental angiogenesis. It is highly expressed during embryonic and foetal development..Angiogenesis involves the branching of new microvessles from pre-existing larger blood vessels.Angiogenesis plays a role in the development of the villous vasculature and the formation of terminal villi in human placenta. IUGR occurs as a result of the failure of elongation, branching and dilatation of the capillary loops and of terminal villous formation.</detailed_description>
