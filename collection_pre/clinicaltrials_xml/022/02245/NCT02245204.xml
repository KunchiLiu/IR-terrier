	<brief_title>Tolerance and Pharmacokinetic Study of Chlorogenic Acid to Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Investigate the tolerance of Chlorogenic acid for injection in human body, determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Chlorogenic acid for injection in the advanced malignant tumor subjects; 2. Determine the human pharmacokinetics characteristic of Chlorogenic acid for injection; 3. Preliminary observation the effectiveness and effective dose; 4. Provide the basis for the dosage regimen of phase II/III.</detailed_description>
