	<brief_summary>Videolaryngoscopes become widely used. The aim of this study is to compare anesthetic induction when patients are tracheally intubated using a MacGraph Mac videolaryngoscope or a conventional MacIntosh laryngoscope. Tracheal intubation induces a nociceptive stimulation. Hypothesis is that the use of a videolaryngoscope induces a less pronounced nociceptive stimulation and, consequently, that it modifies the anesthetic drugs requirement. .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does the Use of a Videolaryngoscope Modifies Anesthetic Induction ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will received a standardized anesthetic procedure : combined closed-loop anesthesia system using bispectral index as control variable and two proportional-differential control algorithms, a propofol and a remifentanil target-controlled infusion system. The effectiveness of such a closed-loop anesthesia system has been demonstrated in a prospective, randomized study. Patients will be randomized in two groups : intubation using a conventional MacIntosh laryngoscope or intubation using a videolaryngoscope. If our hypothesis is confirmed, the required concentration of remifentanil, an opioid agent, will be reduced in the group using a videolaryngoscope.</detailed_description>
