	<brief_summary>This study is designed to compare the short-term effects of two different thoracic spine thrust manipulation techniques on neck range-of-motion, pain, and self-reported disability in people with neck pain. The null hypothesis is that there will be no differences between the two manipulation techniques for short-term effects on neck range-of-motion, pain, and self-reported disability in people with neck pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be involved in the study over a 4 week period. Each participant will be asked to attend 4 sessions, with one week in between each session as follows: Week 0 = baseline assessment and treatment 1; Week 1= treatment 2; Week 2 = treatment 3; and week 4 = follow-up assessment. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either a supine or prone thoracic spine thrust manipulation intervention.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Between 22 and 50 years of age Primary complaint of neck pain with or without symptoms that spread down into one arm Overall rating of neck pain intensity is at least 3/10; the overall rating is the overall average of the participant's rating of current, least, and worst pain experienced over the previous 24 hours on separate numeric pain rating scales where 0 corresponds to "no pain" and 10 corresponds to "worst pain possible". Neck Disability Index (NDI) score &gt; 10 points (measure of selfreported disability with a 0 to 50 point scale where higher scores indicate higher levels of disability). Proficient in speaking and reading English to complete outcome questionnaires Neck pain related to a motor vehicle accident or other trauma within the previous 6 weeks Neck pain that spreads down into both arms Low back pain or thoracic origin of pain Nerve root involvement; defined as the presence of two or more neurological findings (e.g. decreased strength, diminished deep tendon reflex, or decreased sensation) at the same nerve root level Diagnosis of cervical spine stenosis (narrowing of the central canal that contains the spinal cord) History of spinal tumors, spinal infection, cervical spine fracture, or previous neck surgery Pending legal action related to current episode of neck pain Contraindications to thoracic spine thrust manipulation 1. serious pathologies or conditions (tumor, fracture, metabolic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, history of prolonged steroid use) 2. hyperreflexia 3. unsteadiness during gait 4. Nystagmus 5. Loss of visual acuity 6. Impaired sensation of the face 7. Altered taste 8. The presence of pathological reflexes 9. pregnancy or considering pregnancy</criteria>
