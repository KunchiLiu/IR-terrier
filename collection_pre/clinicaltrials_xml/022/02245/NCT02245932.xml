	<brief_summary>The overall objective is to investigate the efficacy of resveratrol in modulating metabolism and CVD risk profile in patients with COPD. The primary objective is to investigate the effect of resveratrol on CRP as clinical marker of low grade systemic inflammation. The secondary objective is to investigate the effect of resveratrol on body composition, inflammatory status and mechanistic markers in blood, adipose and muscle tissue as well as a comprehensive assessment of metabolicand physical performance profile known to be affected by low grade systemic inflammation and by resveratrol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resveratrol In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients (CARMENS-trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: In the general population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and it is well established that obesity (body mass index &gt;30 kg/mÂ²) is an important determinant. The risk is even further increased in COPD, due to smoking behaviour and accumulation of visceral fat combined with a decreased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Enhanced systemic inflammation is identified as important driver in recent epidemiological and translational research. Aerobic exercise training (AET) is an established way to improve metabolic health and decrease CVD risk in the overweight general population but modulating potential is limited in COPD due to ventilatory limitations and related disease symptoms. Interventions which mimic the effects of AET are therefore considered as unmet medical need. Evidence is emerging that the nutritional supplement resveratrol is an interesting candidate that requires further investigation in COPD. Study design: Proof-of-concept randomized placebo-controlled double blinded clinical trial of 4 weeks. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Subjects may be confronted with certain inconveniences and risks. Subjects will be asked to wear an accelerometer two times for one week. During the entire study period subjects will visit the MUMC+ 2 times for various non-invasive measurements (questionnaires, anthropometry, and physical function test) as well as some minor invasive procedures (venous blood sampling and muscle and fat biopsies) which can cause a local haematoma afterwards. However, the patients will be informed about their metabolic and cardiovascular health, which we expect to be positively affected by the intervention. In addition, all patients will receive a lifestyle advice tailored to their health status.</detailed_description>
