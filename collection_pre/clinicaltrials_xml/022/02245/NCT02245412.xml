	<brief_summary>The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and efficacy of intravenous (IV) ALXN1007 in subjects with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2a Study of ALXN1007 in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Acute GI GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Graft vs Host Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects must be males or females age 18 years or older. Subjects with Stage 14 (per the Modified Keystone Grading Schema) acute GVHD of the lower GI tract, without signs of chronic GVHD, at the time of diagnosis, which developed in the first 180 days following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood; or after preplanned donor lymphocyte infusion. Subjects are willing to undergo or must have had an endoscopy of the upper and/or lower GI tract and biopsy to confirm GI GVHD. Subjects must be receiving systemic corticosteroids. Subjects with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;500/Î¼L at Screening. Subjects and spouse/partner who are of childbearing potential must be using high effective contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control (at least 1 of which much be barrier method) starting at Screening and continuing through the entire study (for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALXN1007 if study treatment is stopped early or subject withdraws consent). Male subjects must not donate sperm during the Screening and Treatment periods, and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALXN1007. Stage of acute GVHD of the lower GI tract will be determined using the Modified Keystone Grading Schema. Subjects with a body weight &gt; 140 kg (for Cohorts dosing 20 mg/kg of ALXN1007 and higher only). Subjects with signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD. Subjects with an active uncontrolled infection. Subjects who test positive for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) at Screening. Subjects with relapsed/persistent malignancy requiring rapid immune suppression withdrawal. Subjects who received an unplanned (not part of the original transplant therapy plan) donor lymphocyte infusion. Subjects who received previous systemic treatment for acute GVHD, except for a maximum of 3 days (72 hours) of 2 mg/kg corticosteroid therapy. Subjects with unresolved venoocclusive disease of the liver. Subjects with creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/minute at Screening, as calculated by the CockroftGault formula. Subjects known to be infectged with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Subjects known to have an uncontrolled thyroid disorder. Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or sexually active and unwilling to use effective birth control for the duration of the study. Subjects who participated in any other investigational drug trial or had exposure to any other investigational agent, device or procedure &lt;4 weeks prior to Screening and throughout the entire trial, with the exception of investigational drugs administered prophylactically for CMV post allogeneic HCT.</criteria>
