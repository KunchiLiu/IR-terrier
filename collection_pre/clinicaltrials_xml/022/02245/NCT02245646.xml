	<brief_summary>This study aims at capturing for the first time at which frequencies and sound intensities hearing distortions are perceived after successful stapedotomy surgery. Also, the portion of patients perceiving these sound distortions and the length of time over which the distortions occur are assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Distortion Product After Stapedotomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If the stapes footplate is fixed in position, e.g. by otosclerosis, rather than being normally mobile, a conductive hearing loss results. This conductive hearing loss is usually compensated with hearing aids or through stapedotomy. During stapedotomy, the diseased stapes bone is removed and is replaced with a piston prosthesis that conveys the sound stimulus from the incus to the footplate of the removed stapes. After surgery subjects sometimes state that the quality of sound is suboptimal, even though their hearing ability has improved significantly. Some subjects subjectively hear distorted sounds, which often disappear several weeks after surgery. This study aims at capturing for the first time at which frequencies and sound intensities these distortions are perceived. Additionally, the portion of patients perceiving these sound distortions and the length of time over which the distortions occur are assessed.</detailed_description>
