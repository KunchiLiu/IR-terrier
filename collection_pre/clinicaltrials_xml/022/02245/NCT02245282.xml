	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer detection and disease progression monitoring relies on systematic multi-core biopsies. Minimal invasive imaging capacities for lesion targeting and monitoring are badly needed. The purpose of this study is to determine if a new MRI technique can identify prostate lesions or to monitor prostate disease progression. If so biopsy core number can be reduced to as small as one, and frequency for biopsy repeat can be reduced. The new technique is about a new way of analyzing the pictures taken as part of prostate MRI exam. This part is called dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. It involves an injection of contrast reagent (or dye) through the arm vein during a time period when prostate MRI pictures are continuously taken.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced MRI of the Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to perform contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at OHSU on subjects with suspicious prostate lesions or subjects with diagnosed prostate cancer. This pilot project will study 20 subjects prior to their next scheduled clinical procedures (biopsy or radical prostatectomy). Data from this project will be used to explore new capabilities of the software platform developed under current SBIR funding. CE-MRI will involve the use of an extracellular (Gadolinium based, Gd) contrast agent. When Gd is used, (dynamic-contrast-enhanced) DCE-MRI signal intensity time-course data will be analyzed analytically using the so called "shutter-speed" paradigm which takes into account of the effects of finite water exchange kinetics. Region of interest (ROI) and high resolution (~millimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE-MRI data. All parameters will be compared to literature results for software validation and correlated with pathology for clinical potential.</detailed_description>
