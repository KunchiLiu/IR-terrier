	<detailed_description>Despite advances in management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, mortality is still 10%. We previously reported a prediction score for ulcer bleeding related mortality developed from a local cohort. The risk factors for mortality included patients older than 70, presence of co-morbidity, more than one listed co-morbidity, hematemesis, SBP &lt; 100 mmHg, in-hospital bleeding, rebleeding, and need for surgery. Study objective This study aimed to validate the prediction of mortality among patients with bleeding peptic ulcers from different Asian countries. Method Consecutive patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who presented to the study centers in Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan were recruited after successful primary endoscopic hemostasis. The baseline demographics, ulcer characteristics, the predictive factors, 30 days mortality, rebleeding, hospital stay and need of surgery were recorded. The accuracy of prediction for adverse events including mortality and rebleeding with the prediction risk scoring system would be analysed.</detailed_description>
