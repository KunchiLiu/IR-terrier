	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to investigate how Brazilian fruits peel affect acute/postprandial glucose and insulin responses, inflammatory markers, appetite control peptides, antioxidative capacity, as well as subjective appetite ratings (VAS-visual analogue scales) in healthy volunteers. We hypothesize that certain Brazilian fruits peel added to a standardized meal will improve postprandial glucose tolerance and other metabolic biomarkers in healthy volunteers, compared with a similar meal without the corresponding plant materials.</brief_summary>
