Subjects with a history of any illness or allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, might have confounded the results of the study or posed additional risk in administering tipranavir, ritonavir or methadone to the subject. Subjects who had an acute illness within two weeks prior to Visit 1. Subjects who were currently taking any overthecounter drug within fourteen days prior to Visit 1 or who were currently taking any prescription drug. Hypersensitivity to tipranavir, ritonavir, or methadone.
