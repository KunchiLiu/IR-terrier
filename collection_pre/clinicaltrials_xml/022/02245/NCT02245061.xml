	<brief_summary>The identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) during pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy presurgical assessment frequently requires intracranial recordings like stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG). Cortical direct electrical stimulation (DES) is commonly used during SEEG for functional mapping or to induce seizure. However, the recording of seizures is sometimes insufficient to circumscribe the EZ and development of new biomarkers is necessary. The cortex within the EZ is thought to be hyperexcitable. The "paired pulses" paradigm, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), allows determining the hemispheric cortical excitability level. The investigators hypothesize that paired pulses DES during SEEG could provide useful information for EZ identification.</brief_summary>
