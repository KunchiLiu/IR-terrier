	<brief_summary>In this study we would like to clarify the effect of long lasting Crohn's Disease on motility of the gastrointestinal system in patient and the effect regarding sleep disturbances. This will be done with a newly developed 3D-Motility-and-Transit-detector (Motilis Medica, Schweiz) and the well known polysomnographic equipment. Our hypothesises are: Patients with ileocoecal and/or colonic CD in remission and gastrointestinal symptoms have abnormal colonic transit (primary endpoint). 1. Patients with ileocoecal and/or colonic CD in remission and gastrointestinal symptoms have abnormal gastric emptying and small intestinal transit (secondary endpoints). 2. Total and segmental transit times found in patients with CD will be compared with corresponding transit times in healthy volunteers found in a previous study. 3. Patients with ileocoecal and/or colonic CD in remission have abnormal sleep patterns. 4. Nocturnal basic colonic activity, have changed in patients with ileocoecal and/or colonic CD in remission and sleep disturbances.</brief_summary>
