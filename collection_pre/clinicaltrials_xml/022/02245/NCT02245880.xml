	<brief_summary>Intubation must be done with utmost care in cervical trauma patients. cervical spine motion must be minimized and intubation must be fast. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of fastrach and glidescope. 18-65 years of age , ASA I-II 100 patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in this trial. After standard monitorisation including EKG , noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl. rocuronium was then administered for muscle relaxation. Patients were divided into two groups glidescope and fastrach. Rigid collar was placed then patients were intubated with one of these devices. Mask ventilations with or without collar were recorded. insertion times, intubation times of the devices were recorded. Peroperative hemodynamic parameters and postoperative minor complications were also recoded.</brief_summary>
