	<brief_summary>The goal is to evaluate the best way for paramedics and hospitals to work together to treat septic patients as quickly as possible. The investigators think that the best thing to do for septic patients is to identify and treat them as early as possible. This research will test this. The investigators think that if paramedics identify septic patients and begin treatment with fluids in the ambulance, then the patient will do better in the long run. The paramedic will also tell the hospital that a septic patient will be there soon. The caregivers can prepare and be ready to provide care as soon as the patient arrives. With this research, the investigators would like to see if these steps help patient outcomes.</brief_summary>
