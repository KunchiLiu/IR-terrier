	<brief_title>A Patient-Centered Strategy for Improving Diabetes Prevention in Urban American Indians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed research is to identify effective patient-centered strategies to prevent diabetes in high-risk populations in real world settings. The investigators will accomplish this by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing an enhanced Diabetes Prevention Program addressing psychosocial stressors to a standard version in a high-risk population of urban American Indian and Alaskan Native peoples within a primary care setting. Diabetes is disproportionately prevalent among low-socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority populations in the US. The high prevalence of psychosocial stressors such as depression, discrimination, and exposure to trauma among these populations contributes to the high prevalence of diabetes and interferes with successful completion of lifestyle interventions. The investigators hypothesize that a DPP that directly addresses these psychosocial stressors will be superior to the standard DPP in addressing this disparity in diabetes.</detailed_description>
