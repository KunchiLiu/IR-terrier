	<brief_title>Hyperglycemia and Effects of Daily 100 mg Versus 200 mg of Hydrocortisone Therapy in Patients With Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention group will be received 100 milligrams per day of hydrocortisone on the first three day the taper off, whereas the control group will be received 200 milligrams per day of hydrocortisone on the first three day the taper off.
