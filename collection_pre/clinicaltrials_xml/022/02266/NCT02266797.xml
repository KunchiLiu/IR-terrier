	<brief_title>Effect of Intravenous Corticosteroid Injections on Dysphagia After Cervical Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to examine the effect of local intravenous steroids following anterior cervical spine surgery on the development of dysphagia in patients. This study aims to investigate if there is a difference in the efficacy of intravenous steroids compared to a placebo of physiological saline for patients undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery. Furthermore, this study aims to investigate the correlation between radiographic measurements of soft tissue swelling and the severity of dysphagia for patients. Finally, this study aims to examine the impact of intravenous steroids on nausea and radicular pain in patients. Secondary outcome measures will include patient focused outcomes questionnaires, pain medication requirements, and fusion rates.</detailed_description>
