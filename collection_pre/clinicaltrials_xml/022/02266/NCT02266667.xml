	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the device "NEMOST" on maintaining of the correction of the scoliosis with growth preservation and avoiding iterative surgeries. Objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the growing device "NEMOST" associated to physiotherapy at 12 months postoperatively in patients treated for progressive scoliosis and to evaluate its safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment of Progressive Scoliosis With "NEMOST" Growing Rod</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of scoliosis in the child remain progressive despite conservative treatment well conducted. Nowadays the most used treatment is early surgical treatment by the spinal instrumentation without graft called "growing rods". The use of growing rods in patients with progressive scoliosis requires several repeated surgeries (every 6 to 12 months) in order to follow the growth of children. These repeated surgeries lead to a significant increased risk of complications, that's why many teams around the world have been seeking solutions which allow to obtain a rod expansion without repeated surgery. The purpose of our study is the evaluation of the use of medical device that will perform the correction of scoliosis and, at the same time, preserve the growth of the child's spine. In addition, the purpose of clinical investigation is to test the theory that distraction effort may be exercised without surgery thanks to traction manoeuvres and physiotherapy. This could allow to obtain in patients with progressive scoliosis, correction of spinal deformity while avoiding many repeated surgeries. Our reference device is growing rod "NEMOST". When implanted, NEMOST rod is immediately turned on, for correcting and maintaining the correction of spinal deformity. After implantation, depending on development in Cobb angle, one or more elongations can be made by sliding the notched portion of the rod in its tunnel by a distraction effort (traction equipments and physiotherapy). Therefore, the growth device NEMOST will allow to continue, on request, the correction of spinal deformity by performing a distraction by external manoeuvres on the notched part without the need for surgery.</detailed_description>
