	<detailed_description>This retrospective study in an academic tertiary center will review the files of patients who underwent endoscopic drainage and debridement of abdominal abscesses secondary to bariatric surgery leaks . The decision for endoscopic treatment was made by the medico-surgical team in charge of this type of surgery, who had to weigh the high risk of mortality in case of re-intervention, along with endoscopic access to abscesses via the transluminal or percutaneous route based on abdominal imaging. Data collection will lead to the evaluation of the technical success rate, the clinical success and potential complications.</detailed_description>
