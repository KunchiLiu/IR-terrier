	<brief_title>Stenosis of Arteria-Venous Fistula in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients: Early Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligibility Criteria: 1. Patients with long-term maintenance hemodialysis with AVF as the vascular access; 2. Positive clinical examination signs of AVF stenosis （not all required） : (1) the visual examination: edema, prolonged bleeding time, hematoma, aneurysm or constriction of the fistula .(2) the palpation examination: a narrowing of the outflow vein or aneurysm formation. (3) the auscultation examination: high pitch and/or discontinuous murmur. 3. Doppler ultrasound /DSA/magnetic resonance angiography show the diameter of AVF fistula is &gt;50% narrow than the adjacent segment of the fistula lumen. 4. Blood flow of the AVF is &lt;500ml/min or monthly declines of the blood flow&gt;25%. 5. Patient signed the informed consent.</detailed_description>
