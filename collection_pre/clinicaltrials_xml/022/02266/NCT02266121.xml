	<brief_title>Improving Cognitive Aptitudes With tDCS in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>tDCS will be used in a sham-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over control trial in MS patients suffering from cognitive impairments and/or motor deficits. After informed consent and recruitment, patients will be randomly (computer method) allocated to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied during working memory and attentional tasks. A few days/weeks after completing one arm, the patients will enter the other arm (double-blind cross-over design). Baseline and follow-up outcomes about cognitive aptitudes, motor tasks and fatigue will be collected.</detailed_description>
