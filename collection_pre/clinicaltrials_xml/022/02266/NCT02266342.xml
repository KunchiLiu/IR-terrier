	<brief_summary>This is a French Registry mandated by the French National Health Authority assessing long-term (5-years) safety of the GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis treating diseases of the thoracic aorta.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis French Mandatory Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endovascular therapy to treat thoracic disease seems to provide a plausible benefit compared to surgery in terms of operative mortality and severe morbidity. The French National Health Authority (HAS) requires a 5-year follow-up as part of the renewal of reimbursement for these endoprostheses in order to collect long-term follow-up data under real-life conditions of use.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient where a GORE® TAG® or Conformable GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis is implanted (successfully or not) for the treatment of disease of the descending thoracic aorta. Patient who had previously consented to the collection and processing of personal medical data. Patient older than 18 years at the time of treatment. Patients who have already received treatment with a thoracic endoprosthesis other than the GORE® TAG® or Conformable GORE® TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis and for whom 'revision' or reintervention is required. Patients whose clinical followup is not possible (i.e. patients who cannot return for control visits because they live abroad).</criteria>
