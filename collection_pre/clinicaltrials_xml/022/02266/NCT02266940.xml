	<brief_summary>This is an open label, randomised, 3 treatment, 3 period crossover study. This study is designed to assess the relative bioavailability of DS 1971a from a tablet formulation and a reconstituted oral suspension and the effect of a high fat meal on the relative bioavailability of DS 1971a from the tablet formulation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive Subjects must be in good general health as determined by medical history, physical examination and screening investigations, and be taking no regular medication A body mass index (BMI) in the range 18 to 30 kg/m^2, inclusive, and weighing between 50 and 100 kg. BMI is calculated as weight [kg]/(height [m])^2 Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential as follows: Must be postmenopausal (the last menstrual period was at least 12 months before Screening, and a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] test at Screening confirms postmenopausal status); or Must be surgically sterile having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and/or bilateral tubal ligation Willing and able to consume a standard Food and Drug Administration (FDA) high fat meal Willing to comply with all study restrictions, including the use of contraception, concomitant medication, and dietary and lifestyle restrictions Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the study and any hazards of participating in it. Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and to participate in, and comply with the requirements of, the entire study Have given written consent to participate after reading the information and consent form, and after having the opportunity to discuss the study with the Investigator or his/her delegate Have given written consent to have his/her data entered into The Overvolunteering Prevention System (TOPS) Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory values that could interfere with the objectives of the study or the safety of the subject Presence of or history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to) liver or kidney disease, hypertension, seizures, or any known impairment of endocrine, or other specific bodyorgan dysfunction Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any medicine Presence or history of malignant disease Acute or chronic infectious disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or C virus (HCV) infection Surgery (eg, stomach bypass) or medical condition that might affect absorption of medicines Significant illness within 4 weeks before the dose of study medication Participation in another clinical study of a new chemical entity or a prescription medicine within the previous 3 months, or unwilling to abstain from participating in other clinical studies during the study and for 3 months after receipt of their final dose of study medication Participation in another clinical study with DS1971a Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in semi supine position at the screening examination outside the ranges 90140 mmHg systolic, 4090 mmHg diastolic; heart rate 40100 beats/min. Subjects with Stage 1 hypertension (systolic 140 160 mmHg; diastolic 90 100 mmHg) may be enrolled provided they do not have evidence of end organ damage, diabetes or a 10 year cardiovascular risk &gt;20% Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;80 mL/min/1.73m^2 or an absolute creatinine value above the upper limit of normal (ULN). eGFR will be estimated at Screening using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation Abnormal ECG waveform morphology at Screening that would preclude accurate measurement of the QT interval duration Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula) (QTcF) interval duration &gt;430 msec for men or &gt;450 msec for women, obtained as an average from the measurements on duplicate screening ECGs Use of any prescription medicine or overthecounter (OTC) medications, herbal remedies (such as St John's Wort), or food known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of cytochrome (CYP) enzymes (also known as CYP450 enzymes) during the 30 days before the dose of study medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine, including dietary supplements or herbal remedies, during the 7 days before the first dose of study medication Consumption of certain foods or beverages before the dose and throughout the study period Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the study, eg, as a blood donor Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of study medication, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly (for men) or 14 units of alcohol weekly (for women) Use of tobacco products or nicotine containing products during the 3 months before the dose of trial medication Likely possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the protocol Objection by General Practitioner (GP) to volunteer entering the study</criteria>
