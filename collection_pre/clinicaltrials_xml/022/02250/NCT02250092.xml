	<brief_summary>Hemiparetic cerebral palsy influences motor function in children during development and throughout their lifetime. The deficits one sees are the result both of the congenitally induced brain lesion and the subsequent plasticity that can impair function of the surviving neurons in the damaged brain. Many current treatments have limited influence on children's neurorecovery. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) involving constraining the unaffected limb to encourage use of the affected limb has shown promise, yet with new technology revealing the potential to directly influence the brain, there is an urgent need to study the synergy of combined techniques. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) as a direct neuromodulatory intervention has the potential to act synergistically with CIMT to influence neurorecovery. Combining behavioral therapies, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), with a novel form of neuromodulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we will investigate the influence of this intervention on improved motor outcomes in children with cerebral palsy. The study hypotheses surround the safety, feasibility and efficacy of combined CIMT and tDCS wherein those children who receive the combined intervention will reveal no major adverse events, yet improved hand function and cortical excitability.</brief_summary>
