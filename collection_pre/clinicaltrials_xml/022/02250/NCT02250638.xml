	<brief_summary>To obtain sufficient specimens and correlating clinical data from a well-controlled prospective clinical trial collecting longitudinal specimens from subjects diagnosed with any stage of pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Pancreatic Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objectives are described below: 1. Obtain serum and plasma specimens longitudinally collected from approximately 140 subjects diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and are about to or are currently undergoing treatment and follow-up. Specimens will be used to evaluate CA 19-9 assays, currently under development, as an aid for monitoring recurrence or progressive disease. 2. To store any remaining specimens for use in future cancer research and to evaluate as yet undetermined biomarkers for the development of IVDs, including additional CA 19-9 assays, for monitoring the course of disease and therapy in subjects diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
