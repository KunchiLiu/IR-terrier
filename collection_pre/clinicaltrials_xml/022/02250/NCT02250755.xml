	<brief_summary>This study therefore aims to assess current treatment recommended by scientific societies [ 6-13 ] , brain MRI with injection of contrast for the diagnosis and monitoring of brain metastases . The recommended dose of this examination gadolinium is from 0.1 to 0.3 mmol / kg [ 14 ] . Sequences infusion different from one center to the other made : some use the infusion T1, other infusion T2 * . No recommendation establishes whether it is preferable to use one or the other of these sequences. No examination is added for the purposes of protocol. Indications for MRI and the number and timing of MRI checks under this protocol are consistent with what is done in practice . The used type of gadolinium and the injected dose will be identical for both sequences infusion . The assessment shall not in any case the contrast but the interpretation of the sequence itself. Special procedures monitoring implemented embodiment correspond to the two sequences instead of infusion (one of T1-weighted and T2 * in the other ) , in the original MRI and MRI of the first control , in order to compare their effectiveness</brief_summary>
