	<brief_summary>Body position during sleep influences the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The AHI is the number of times per hour of sleep that the airway temporarily collapses at the level of the tongue or soft palate. In a significant number of individuals with OSA, the severity of the condition as measured by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), increases in the supine (back) position and lowers in the lateral (side) position. This is called positional OSA. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether sleeping with a novel sleep surface (Wave sleep surface) that is used on top of a regular bed reduces the AHI in those with positional OSA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether sleeping with the novel device (Wave sleep surface) reduces the AHI in those with supine position-related OSA, also known as positional OSA. A secondary aim is to determine the effects of the sleep surface on subjective and objective measures of sleep in patients with positional OSA.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We will recruit subjects who are: 18 years of age and above Willing and able to give informed consent Prior sleep study done based on previous clinical evaluation by the subject's treating physician in the course of usual clinical care and performed no more than 12 months prior to enrollment that meets the following: overall AHI 530 events/hr at least 20 minutes of recorded sleep in the supine and nonsupine postures positional OSA defined as &gt; 50% reduction in the AHI between the supine and nonsupine postures and AHI &lt; 5hr in the nonsupine position central apneas &lt; 50% of the total number of apneas and hypopneas Patients who meet the above criteria who have been prescribed CPAP therapy but are noncompliant will be enrolled in the study. CPAP noncompliance will be defined as average nightly use &lt; 4hrs/night based on a download of the CPAP machine, or self acknowledged discontinuation of CPAP use.
