	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION: Hypothermia in the newborn causes morbid conditions. In developing countries in the basic technology for neonatal adaptation may not be available. Polyethylene bags may be an alternative to lamp radiant heat to prevent hypothermia OBJECTIVE: To characterize the differences between babies undergoing body bag with polyethylene or conventional drying during neonatal adaptation in the Hospital de la Victoria and Hospital de Engativá, Bogotá, Colombia, 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Groups: dried conventional (control) or polyethylene body bag (intervention). The procedure lasted 10 minutes, the bag body and / or radiant heat lamp was removed. Environment temperature and humidity, temperature in the body segments 1-5-10-60-120 minutes and APGAR was measured. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive bivariate statistical inference and calculated. Risk ratio (RR) and confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using contingency tables for risk analysis of the outcome. The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee of victory.</brief_summary>
