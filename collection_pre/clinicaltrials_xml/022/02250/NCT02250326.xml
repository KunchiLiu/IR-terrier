	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of second/third-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel in combination with the epigenetic modifying therapy of CC-486 or immunotherapy of durvalumab, and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Nab®-Paclitaxel With CC-486 or Nab®-Paclitaxel With Durvalumab, and Nab®-Paclitaxel Monotherapy as Second/Third-line Treatment for Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study will test the hypothesis that epigenetic modifying therapy of CC-486 or immunotherapy of durvalumab can improve the anti-tumor activity of nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for their advanced disease. It will further assess efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in this setting. Each subject will receive study therapy as second- or third-line of treatment. Approximately 240 male and female subjects with advanced NSCLC will be assigned to one of the following treatment arms (approximately 80 subjects per group): nab-paclitaxel /CC-486 combination therapy, nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy prior to receiving first dose of Investigational Product. A permuted-block randomization method will be employed to assign the subjects among the treatment arms that are enrolling simultaneously, when applicable, stratified by the following baseline factors: ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), gender (males versus females), and smoker (yes versus no). Treatment assignments of subjects to the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will be conducted completely in a randomized fashion.</detailed_description>

Have a negative pregnancy test (ßhCG) as verified by the study doctor within 72 hours prior to starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. 2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting investigational product (IP), during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 3 months after discontinuation of study therapy.

Prior taxane used in the adjuvant setting does not exclude eligibility, provided there is no disease recurrence within 12 months upon completion of chemotherapy in that setting. 2.
