	<brief_summary>The study will establish data on the function of trunk muscles in healthy and low back pain patient's pre and post dry needling treatment. This will help in understanding the underlying mechanism of this treatment and reveal the effect of dry needling on muscle performance. Study hypothesis is that an improvement of back muscle function following dry needling procedure will be found.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Dry Needling on Trunk Muscle Function in Low Back Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry needling of muscles is mainly used for the management of pain in musculoskeletal disorders. Yet, the association between dry needling and motor performance of muscles is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the immediate effect of dry needling on lumbar multifidus muscles' function in healthy and low back pain subjects. The sample will be divided into: low back pain group and control (healthy) group. Both groups will receive dry needling to the lumbar multifidus muscles using a deep insertion technique with 4 needles (2 on each side of the spine). The needles will be left in situ for 10 minutes. Ultrasound imaging will be used to measure multifidus muscles' thickness, pre and post- procedure during rest in a prone position and during contralateral active straight leg extension.</detailed_description>
