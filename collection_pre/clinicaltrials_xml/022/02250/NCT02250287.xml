	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish normal Magnetic Resonance quantitative values (tissues stiffness, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient values and Blood Oxygen Level Determination values for both renal cortex and medullary tissues and total renal blood flow) for young Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease patients with normal renal function, and normal young adult controls without Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and normal renal function. Hypothesis: Newer Magnetic Resonance quantitative imaging parameters (tissue stiffness, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, Blood Oxygen Level Determination levels, Magnetization Transfer and renal blood flow) will have different values in young adult ADPKD patients as compared to normal volunteers.</brief_summary>
