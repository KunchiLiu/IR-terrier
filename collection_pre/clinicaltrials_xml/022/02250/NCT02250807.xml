	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show superiority of simeprevir (SMV) in combination with sofosbuvir for 12 weeks versus a historical control. Historical control will be a composite of the observed historical sustained virological response at Week 12 (SVR12) rates of SMV in combination with (pegylated) interferon (PegIFN)/ribavirin (RBV) of the subpopulations in study HPC3011 (NCT01567735) and will depend on the percentage of treatment-naive, prior relapser, prior non-responder, interferon (IFN)-intolerant and other subjects enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Simeprevir in Combination With Sofosbuvir in Subjects With Chronic Genotype 4 Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, multicenter study (conducted at multiple sites). The study consists of 3 periods: a Screening period (up to 4 weeks), Treatment period (12 Weeks) and Post treatment follow-up period (until 24 weeks after end of treatment). The duration of the subjects' participation will be approximately 40 weeks. In the treatment period subjects will receive oral capsule simeprevir along with oral tablet sofosbuvir once daily for 12 weeks. Primarily efficacy will be evaluated as percentage of subjects with sustained virologic response at Week 12 after the end of treatment. Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

Subjects must have documentation of a liver biopsy or fibroscan or agree to have one during screening Subjects with cirrhosis must have an hepatic imaging procedure (ultrasound, CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) within 6 months before the screening visit (or during the screening period) with no findings suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Women of childbearing potential or men with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective form of contraception, or not be heterosexually active, or of nonchildbearing potential Evidence of clinical hepatic decompensation Any liver disease of nonHCV etiology Subjects with a past history of treatment with an approved or investigational DAA Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or type 2 (HIV1 or HIV2) (positive HIV1 or HIV2 antibodies test at screening) Infection/coinfection with HCV nongenotype 4</criteria>
