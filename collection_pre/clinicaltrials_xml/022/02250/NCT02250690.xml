	<brief_summary>The aims of the present study was to analyze the effect of consecutive sessions of Transcranial direct current stimulation associated to kinesiotherapy about gait performance of Parkinson' s disease. For this, the primary outcome was evaluation of gait performance by means of space and temporal parameters as speed (meter/second ), stride frequency (steps/min) and stride length (m). The secondary outcome is motor cortex excitability which is analyzed by means of single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intends to determine: motor evoked potential amplitude (MEP) and rest motor threshold (rMT).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist by interventions involving screening followed by evaluation, where volunteers were subjected to the many tests: history, session III of the Unified Scale Modified Parkinson's Disease - Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale, Ten meters walk test - Walk Test 10 meters and shoot gait, (using Studio Version 8 software). On the same day, the subjects underwent assessment of brain excitability to determine motor threshold and amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP). The randomization of the volunteers was conducted by an external search through opaque envelopes ordered according to a random distribution. The subjects were divided into two groups : control group , this group submitted to Transcranial Stimulation sessions a sham Continuous Current (sham tDCS) and gait training , and Experimental group, subjected to the stimulation by Transcranial Direct Current sessions (active tDCS ) and gait training.</detailed_description>
