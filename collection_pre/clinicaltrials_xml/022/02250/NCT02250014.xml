	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot phase I trial studies how well sargramostim after cryotherapy works in treating patients with prostate cancer. Biological therapies, such as sargramostim, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Cryosurgery, also known as cryotherapy, kills tumor cells by freezing them. Giving sargramostim after cryotherapy may work better in treating prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Immuno-Response to Primary Cryotherapy for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine an unknown normal immune response (T cell and B cell) to post-cryotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. II. Detect the altered immune response (T cell and B cell) post-GM-CSF (sargramostim) response and post-cryotherapy for the prostate cancer. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (TREATMENT): Patients undergo cryotherapy on day 0 and receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12. ARM II (CONTROL): Patients undergo cryotherapy on day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>
