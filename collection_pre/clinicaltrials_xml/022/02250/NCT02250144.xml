	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral pain syndrome is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders. It is defined as an anterior knee pain. Its origin is a conflict during patellar tracking, due to patellofemoral malalignment and soft tissue overload. A few recent studies seem to show a benefit of prefabricated feet orthoses in patellofemoral pain syndrome, alone or in association with rehabilitation. However, no one has analyzed the outcome of morpho-specific foot orthoses in a prospective randomized study. The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare clinical outcomes in daily living and in sports activities, between morpho-specific and placebo foot orthoses. Morpho-specific foot orthoses are designed according to the patient's morphotype. They are intended to correct structural defects of the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot, in the aim to correct abnormal overload during patellofemoral tracking.</brief_summary>
