	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare pholcodine exposure in patients having presented with a perianaesthetic anaphylactic reaction to a NMBA (cases) to pholcodine exposure in matched anaesthetised patients with injection of NMBA, who did not present with an anaphylactic reaction (controls). The secondary objectives of the study are: - To compare anti-pholcodine IgE, anti-ammonium IV IgE and total IgE levels between the case and control groups. - To study the concordance between exposure to pholcodine in cases and controls, by means of a patient self-questionnaire on the one hand and, on the other hand, by a computerized drug history, supplemented where relevant by the drug master file. - To study the impact of taking 1, 2 or 3 sources in account for pholcodine exposition. - To study the association between exposure to pholcodine and the presence/levels of pholcodine-specific IgE, reflecting sensitisation to pholcodine. - To study NMBA and pholcodine cross-sensitisation by testing skin reactions to pholcodine in case patients allergic to (at least) one NMBA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, age â‰¥ 2 years old. Referred to anaesthesiaallergy consultation within (approximately) 6 to 12 weeks of occurrence of peranaesthetic anaphylactic reaction during anaesthesia with administration of NMBAs (only for case patient). Having given his/her consent (or the 2 parents consent for minors). Affiliated with a social security scheme or dependent. Able to answer a medicinal product intake questionnaire In a clinical condition compatible with skin tests (no skin disease or psychiatric illness, etc.) (only for case patient) Having stopped any antihistamine treatment at least 8 days previously (only for case patient). With positive skin test for the suspected NMBA (ony for case patient).
