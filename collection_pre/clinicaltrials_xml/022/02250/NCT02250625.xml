	<brief_summary>To obtain sufficient specimens and correlating clinical data from a well-controlled prospective clinical trial collecting specimens from healthy subjects t on vitamin D assays, and to establish a collection of specimens that will support future assay discovery and validation efforts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vitamin D in Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Obtain matched serum and plasma specimens collected from a minimum of 50 healthy subjects in two geographic areas. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range for a vitamin D assay, used as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in adults. 2. Obtain serum specimens collected from a minimum of an additional 450 healthy subjects in two geographic areas. Specimens will be used to determine a reference range for a vitamin D assay, used as an aid in the assessment of vitamin D sufficiency in adults. 3. To store any remaining specimens for use in future vitamin D assay development and to evaluate as yet undetermined assays for the development of IVDs, including additional vitamin D assays</detailed_description>
