	<brief_summary>The main hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate that the use of the ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer test in previously biopsied patients improves urologists' patient management by reducing unnecessary repeat biopsies, attendant procedure costs, and potential adverse events in men being considered for a repeat procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PASCUAL (Prostate Assay Specific Clinical Utility at Launch) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The results of the study will reveal the clinical utility of this test by analyzing the physicians' use of negative or positive assays compared to patients managed using SOC methods without assay findings. The repeat biopsy rate at 12 months from study entry will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. All patients will be followed for 24 months from the date of the previous negative biopsy to evaluate an extended period of observation to track repeat biopsies and cancer detection. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a lower repeat biopsy rate by using the negative results of ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer in practice rather than current SOC. All patients will have the tissue from their previous negative biopsy tested with the assay. Only data from Cases (informed of ConfirmMDx assay results) and Controls (blinded of the ConfirmMDx assay result) patients with negative test results will be used for the primary objective.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males aged 40 to 75 years old* that underwent a previous cancernegative prostate biopsy within 15 months and being considered for a repeat biopsy due to persistent or elevated cancerrisk factors The previous negative prostate biopsy must have collected a minimum of 8 tissue cores and remaining FFPE tissue from all cores should be available for testing Minimum tissue volume criteria of 20 microns of prostate biopsy core tissue should be available (40 microns preferable) The presence of HGPIN (highgrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), PIA (proliferative inflammatory atrophy), or glandular inflammation reported in the first biopsy histopathology report is acceptable for entry. Prior diagnosis of prostate cancer or cellular atypia suspicious for cancer (ASAP) in a previous biopsy histology report. Patients being managed by Active Surveillance for low stage prostate cancer Men greater than 75 years old (generally not considered for repeat biopsy) Most recent biopsy was a saturation biopsy (&gt; 24 tissue cores). Tissue extracted using transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedures rather than standard patterned biopsy core extraction. Subjects who had been previously tested with ConfirmMDx.</criteria>
