	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether EGFR-TKI can control the development of intracranial lesions in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer patients with asymptomatic brain metastases, and the difference in progression free survival between exon 19 and exon 21 mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of EGFR-TKI to Asymptomatic Brain Metastases of NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A open, positive control of phase II clinical trials, divided into selection period, treatment period and follow-up period , comply with the standard set of participants signed a written informed consent, according to different divided into 19 patients with EGFR mutations outside show son mutation group) and 21 extra show mutations, and according to the ECOG physical status, age, previous systemic treatments such as hierarchical analysis, regular follow-up and to assess efficacy, life care and safety.</detailed_description>
