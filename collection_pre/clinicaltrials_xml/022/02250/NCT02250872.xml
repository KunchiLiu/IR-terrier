	<brief_summary>Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent, however, its nephrotoxicity manifested by acute kidney injury (AKI) often limits applicability. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors are well known to improve glucose intolerance by augmentation of endogenous glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). DPP4 inhibitor also has the potential anti-apoptotic and renoprotective effect in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced AKI. This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, prospective study to investigate the renoprotective effect of DPP4 inhibitor on cisplatin-induced AKI. A total 182 patients, who are scheduled to treat with cisplatin, will be recruited and randomly assigned to either Gemigliptin or placebo groups. Subjects will take study drugs for 8 days starting from one day before cisplatin treatment. Serum creatinine (Cr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be measured at 7 days after cisplatin treatment.</brief_summary>
