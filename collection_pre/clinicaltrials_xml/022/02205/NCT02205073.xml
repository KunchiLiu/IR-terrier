	<brief_summary>This is a single site, randomized, double-blind, three period cross-over, placebo-controlled, proof of mechanism study in healthy male subjects. The study will investigate whether the directionality of brain activity and connectivity in response to intranasal vasopressin treatment is similar to earlier studies and explores the effect of short-term treatment with RG7314 on functional MRI as a pharmacodynamic marker. While in the scanner, the participants will be asked to perform a face matching task and a Theory of Mind task, among other assessments. Participants' exposure to study drug will be assessed and all participants will receive follow-up examination 1 and 4 weeks after last dose.</brief_summary>
