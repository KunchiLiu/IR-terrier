	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether either trastuzumab or the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with standard chemotherapy shows more activity against gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma than standard chemotherapy given before and after surgery and it can be safely administered.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Study Using Trastuzumab or Trastuzumab With Pertuzumab in Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized phase II trial with an internal control. The randomization will be a 1:2:2 randomization (control: experimental arm 1: experimental arm 2). Potentially eligible patients will be screened centrally for the HER-2 status. After confirmation of HER-2 positive disease, eligible patients will be centrally randomized through the EORTC randomization system. A minimization technique will be used for random treatment allocation between the three treatment arms. Stratification will be done by histological subtype (intestinal/non-intestinal); Korea versus Europe; stage II versus III; node positive versus node negative.</detailed_description>

Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods for contraception.
