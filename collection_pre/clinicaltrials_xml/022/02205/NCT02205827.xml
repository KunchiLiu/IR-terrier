	<criteria>1. Signed and dated, written informed consent (Institutional Review Board [IRB]approved informed consent form [ICF]). 2. Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with suitable veins for venipuncture. (Healthy as determined by medical history) 1. Healthy subjects who do not conform to the above inclusion criteria. 2. Healthy subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator. 3. History of major bleeding or major trauma within the past 6 months 4. Healthy volunteer with a propensity to bleed (i.e. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, peptic ulcer, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding from hemorrhoids). 5. Significant infection or known inflammatory process within 2 weeks of screening. 6. Treatment with any investigational products or therapies within 30 days (or 5 half lives, whichever is greater) prior to screening. 7. Received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) or medications (including any type of anticoagulant or aspirin [ASA]) with a direct effect on hemostasis within 7 days of testing 8. Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol. 9. Subjects who are concurrently enrolled in any other clinical study.</criteria>
