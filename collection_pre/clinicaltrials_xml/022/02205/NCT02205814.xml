	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, four parallel arm, dose-finding study, to be conducted in approximately 26 sites, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single intra-articular (IA) injections of fasitibant in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Approximately 400 male and female patients 40-80 years old, with BMI &lt; 30 kg/m² and with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee will be randomised to a total of 4 treatment arms. Each arm includes a single intra-articular injection of one of three dosages of fasitibant (low, intermediate and high dose) OR placebo. The randomisation ratio will be 1:1:1:1. The primary efficacy variable will be the change of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Visual Analogue Scale 3.1 A (WOMAC VA 3.1 A) (total pain) subscore from baseline up to 2 weeks after randomisation. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and clinical laboratory tests; local tolerability at the injection site will also be assessed. In addition, the population pharmacokinetics and the exposure-response relationship will be evaluated. The individual experimental clinical phase will last up to maximal 15 weeks encompassing 7 planned visits at site, including screening, randomisation, 4 follow-up visits and the End of study visit.</brief_summary>
