	<brief_summary>Cognitive training has emerged as a promising method to maintain, enhance, and rehabilitate cognitive function in older adults and individuals with dementia. In recent years, such training has become particularly appealing in the clinical context, with many paradigms aimed specifically at adults experiencing various stages of cognitive decline due to Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementias. However, basic questions remain. For example, uncertainty persists regarding factors that influence observed improvements as well as the conditions that would maximize transfer and sustainability of training effects. The objective of this study is to evaluate factors that may maximize the benefits of computerized cognitive training in older adults.</brief_summary>
