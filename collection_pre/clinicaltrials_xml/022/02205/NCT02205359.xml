	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to test the hypothesis that market released Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices which contain the AdaptivCRTÂ® (aCRT) algorithm have a superior outcome compared to standard CRT devices in CRT indicated patients with normal atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction and left bundle branch block (LBBB).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is willing to sign and date the study Patient Informed Consent Form. Subject is indicated for a CRT device according to local guidelines. Sinus Rhythm at time of enrollment Complete Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) as documented on an ECG (within 30 days prior to enrollment). Strauss Criteria used for LBBB. Intrinsic, normal AV conduction as documented on an ECG by a PR interval less than or equal to 200ms (within 30 days prior to enrollment). Left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (documented within 180 days prior to enrollment). NYHA class II, III or IV (documented within 30 days prior to enrollment) despite optimal medical therapy. Optimal medical therapy is defined as maximal tolerated dose of Betablockers and a therapeutic dose of ACEI, ARB or Aldosterone Antagonist. Subject is less than 18 years of age (or has not reached minimum age per local law). Subject is not expected to remain available for at least 2 years of followup visits. Subject has permanent atrial arrhythmias for which pharmacological therapy and/or cardioversion have been unsuccessful or have not been attempted Subject is, or previously has been, receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy. Subject is currently enrolled or planning to participate in a potentially confounding drug or device trial during the course of this study. Coenrollment in concurrent trials is only allowed when documented preapproval is obtained from the Medtronic study manager. Subject has unstable angina, or experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or received coronary artery revascularization (CABG) or coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within 30 days prior to enrollment. Subject has a mechanical tricuspid heart valve or is scheduled to undergo valve repair or valve replacement during the course of the study. Subject is post heart transplant (subjects on the heart transplant list for the first time are not excluded). Subject has a limited life expectancy due to noncardiac causes that would not allow completion of the study. Subject is pregnant (if required by local law, women of childbearing potential must undergo a pregnancy test within seven days prior to device implant). Subject meets any exclusion criteria required by local law.</criteria>
