	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether two different types of forearm exercise, performed before fistula creation surgery, can improve surgery success and fistula maturation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double blinded controlled trial to study the impact of handgrip exercise prior to surgical creation of hemodialysis fistula on vascular remodelling and fistula maturation in chronic kidney disease patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult (age&gt;18 years old) with chronic kidney disease 2. Hemodialysis is their renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality 3. Deemed eligible for an arteriovenous fistula 4. Anticipated RRT start &lt; 3 months (from the time of vascular surgery assessment) if predialysis 5. Scheduled surgical creation of fistula aniticpated &gt;= 8 weeks 6. Able to follow instructions for an exercise intervention 7. Able to provide informed written consent 1. Life expectancy &lt; 6 months 2. Need for urgent vascular access (i.e. &lt;4 weeks) 3. Preexisting fistula distal to site of newly scheduled fistula 4. Ipsilateral central stenosis or occlusions not amenable to correction 5. Contraindications or unable to perform handgrip exercise Unable to withstand transiently raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 35 mmHg, and diastolic (DBP) by 25 mmHg severe upper extremity arthritis or other pain 6. Contraindications to general exercise Poorly controlled blood pressure SBP&gt;180, DBP&gt;90; SBP&lt;110, DBP&lt;50 NYHC IV heart failure</criteria>
