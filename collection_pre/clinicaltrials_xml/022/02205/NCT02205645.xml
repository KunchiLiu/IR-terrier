	<brief_title>Initial Safety Evaluation of FibroFix™ Meniscus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety of the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold will be evaluated in 10 patients scheduled for elective arthroscopic medial meniscus partial resection or treatment of asymptomatic medial meniscal defect</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The subject (or guardian, if appropriate) has signed and dated a specific informed consent form The subject is over the age of 18 The subject is able to comply with the protocoldefined preoperative procedures, the postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations and the recommended rehabilitation regimen as determined by the investigator The subject has a diagnosis of an MRI or arthroscopically confirmed irreparable medial meniscus defect The meniscal defect should represent 25% or more of the meniscus and be amenable to repair The peripheral meniscal rim must be present The subject has a functionally intact anterior cruciate ligament Haemoglobin &gt;9g/dL and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 prior to Day 1 No contraindication to general anaesthetic Female subjects of childbearing potential: a negative urine pregnancy test The subject has a functionally deficient anterior cruciate ligament The subject has concomitant posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency of the involved knee or a concomitant injury that interferes with the subject's ability to comply with the recommended rehabilitation program The subject has a diagnosis of untreatable Grade IV Outerbridge Scale degenerative cartilage disease in the involved knee joint Patients demonstrating an active local or systemic infection Any condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude adequate evaluation of the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold and clinical outcome. The subject has a history of confirmed anaphylactoid reaction The subject has received local administration of any type of corticosteroid or systemic administration of antineoplastic, immunostimulating, or immunosuppressive agents within 180 days prior to the scheduled surgery The subject has evidence of osteonecrosis of the involved knee The subject has a medical history that includes a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid or inflammatory arthritis, or relapsing polychondritis If female and of childbearing potential: evidence of a positive pregnancy test or a stated intention to become pregnant in the next 612 months</criteria>
