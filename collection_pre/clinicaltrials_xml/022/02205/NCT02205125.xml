	<brief_summary>Removal of polyps at colonoscopy reduces colon cancer. Snare polypectomy is the conventional method for removal however the snared area after removal can occasionally appear uneven raising the possibility that complete removal has not occurred. The significance of this irregularity has not be studied. This study aims to separately sample the irregular area and determine the constituents while recording how frequently this occurs during routine colonoscopy and polypectomy. We hypothesize that the irregular areas are submucosal tissue and do not represent polyp tissue left behind.</brief_summary>
