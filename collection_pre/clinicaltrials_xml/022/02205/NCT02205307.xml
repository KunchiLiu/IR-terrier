	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter study to determine the difference in post-operative anastomotic leak rate in low anterior resection procedures where colon and rectal tissue perfusion is evaluated using PINPOINT as an adjunct to standard surgical practice compared to surgical procedures performed according to standard surgical practice alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Be 18 years of age or older. Be undergoing open, or minimally invasive LAR for the treatment of a rectal or rectosigmoid neoplasm (Subjects with rectal or rectosigmoid neoplasm(s) may be treated with or without neoadjuvant therapy. Longcourse neoadjuvant therapy must have been completed ≥6 weeks prior to LAR surgery (Day 0). Have a planned low circular stapled or transanally hand sewn anastomosis ≤10 cm from the anal verge. Have a colorectal or coloanal reconstruction with or without reservoir/pouch. Subjects who are women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating, must have a negative pregnancy test at Day 0. Have signed an approved informed consent form for the study. Be willing to comply with the protocol. Undergoing stapled anastomosis with the use of an experimental or nonFDA approved stapler. Undergoing ileoanal reconstruction, total colectomy or proctocolectomy, abdominoperineal resection, Hartmann's procedure, Hartmann's reversal or multiple synchronous colon resections (e.g., LAR and concomitant right colectomy). Has received and completed a course of pelvic radiotherapy ≥ 6 months prior to LAR surgery (Day 0). Has previously undergone a left sided colon resection. Has previously undergone a rectal resection. Has recurrent rectal or rectosigmoid cancer. Has a diagnosis of locally advanced rectal or rectosigmoid cancer undergoing extended en bloc operations. Has a diagnosis of Stage IV rectal or rectosigmoid cancer with any multifocal metastases or single site metastasis with tumor size of &gt; 2 cm (Intraoperative incidental finding or preoperative suspicion of Stage IV cancer with isolated (single site) metastasis (≤ 2 cm) or limited metastases (≤3), with largest lesion ≤ 2 cm in size, does not exclude the subject). Has a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Subjects with rectal or rectosigmoid cancer neoplasms and IBD are excluded. Has hepatic dysfunction defined as Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) Score &gt;12. Renal dysfunction defined as creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. Has known allergy or history of adverse reaction to ICG, iodine or iodine dyes. Has, in the Investigator's opinion, any medical condition that makes the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure, or interferes with the interpretation of study results. Is actively participating in another investigational clinical study which, in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion, would interfere in this study.</criteria>
