	<brief_summary>Bergamot-derived products have shown significant effects on plasma lipids. We aim in the present study to evaluate the effect of bergamot on several cardio-metabolic risk markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bergamot and Cardio-Metabolic Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research hypothesis is to assess whether bergamot reduces plasma lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol), atherogenic lipoproteins, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and liver steatosis in patients with dyslipidemia. The primary objective is to assess whether bergamot reduces plasma lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with dyslipidemia. Primary endpoint: Reduction in plasma lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins. The secondary objective is to assess whether bergamot reduces carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and liver steatosis in patients with dyslipidemia. Secondary endpoint: Reduction in IMT and and liver steatosis. Clinical diagnostic tools will include the measurement of: 1. cIMT, that will be assessed by B-mode real-time ultrasound using a single sonographer (Medison SonoAce Pico, with a probe of 7.5-10.0 MHz) in a standardized manner with fixed angles of insonation; 2. liver steatosis, that will be assessed by by abdominal ultrasound. Biochemical analyses will include the analysis of: 1. Routine testing of plasma lipids; 2. Atherogenic lipoproteins, e.g. the analysis of 11 distinct lipoproteins including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), 3 intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) subclasses and 7 low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses.</detailed_description>
