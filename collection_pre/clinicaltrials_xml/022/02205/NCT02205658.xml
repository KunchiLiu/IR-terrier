	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish normative data for the Adult/Adolescent Sensory History (ASH) and to determine if the ASH is able to discriminate between individuals aged 13-95 years, with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with or without co-morbid Sensory processing Disorder (SPD), individuals with SPD with no co-morbid ASD, and individuals who are typically functioning. It is anticipated that individuals with ASD will have the most problems with sensory processing, those with SPD will also have problems in comparison to typical individuals. It is also hypothesized that the measure will be able to discriminate between the three groups.</brief_summary>
