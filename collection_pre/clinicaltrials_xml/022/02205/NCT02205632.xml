	<brief_summary>Lutein ans zeaxanthin, carotenoids provided by dietary intake are mainly located in the macular area. Its absorption peak at 460 nm may reduce photic damages. The macular pigment density can be evaluated by its optical density. Reduced macular pigment level is a significant risk factor for age-macular degeneration. The nutritional intake can minimise the risk of age-macular degeneration.</brief_summary>
