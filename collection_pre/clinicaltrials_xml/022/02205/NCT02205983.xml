	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will examine the effects of buprenorphine, as compared to placebo, upon physiological, subjective, and hormonal responses to a stressful speech task and a non-stressful control task in healthy adults. There is strong evidence in support of the role of endogenous opioids and opiates in mediating social behavior in humans and other animals, and particularly, in social distress. The investigators have recently shown that buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, reduces cortisol responses to stress. Here, the investigators propose to further explore the role of the opioid system in mediating stress responses in humans through the use of hydromorphone, a full mu opioid agonist, in addition to buprenorphine. The investigators hypothesize that like buprenorphine, hydromorphone will reduce both physiological and subjective measures of stress.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants be randomly assigned to receive .2mg buprenorphine, 2mg hydromorphone, 4mg hydromorphone, or placebo at each of two sessions; one during which they well participate in a stressful speaking task, and one during which they'll participate in a nonstressful control task. Physiological and subjective measures will be taken throughout each session.</detailed_description>
