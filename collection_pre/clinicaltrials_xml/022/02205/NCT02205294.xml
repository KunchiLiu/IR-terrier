	<brief_title>Osteopathic Treatment and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thousands of individuals are affected by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) every year. Medical treatment is aimed at preventing extension and recurrence of the blood clot (DVT) through the use of anticoagulation medication. Compression stockings may be added for reduction of pain and swelling, but this therapy remains controversial amongst physicians. To date, there is limited manual therapies available for individuals affected with DVT. Regular medical treatment, anticoagulation medication, along with osteopathic treatment may offer these individuals improved control of the symptoms associated with DVT. In the long term osteopathic treatment may provide an increase in the quality of life (QOL) and improve the signs and symptoms associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which can be burdensome for both the individual and the health care system. Offering an effective add on treatment could provide individuals and the medical system with an additional means of treatment for the symptoms of DVT and also for the prevention of development of PTS.</detailed_description>
