	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, pharmacokinetic properties (the absorption, distribution and excretion), and analgesic activity of Omnitram (10 mg tablets), Tramadol (Ultram, 50 mg tablet) following oral administration of 9 doses healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omnitram Pharmacokinetic Study In Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period cross-over study to compare the safety, steady-state oral pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of overencapsulated: 20 mg Omnitram (2x10 mg tablets), 50 mg Tramadol (1x50 mg Ultram tablet), and placebo. Forty male subjects in normal health, 21 to 55 years of age, will be randomized to three parallel arms (N=~13 each) to ingest a total of 9 doses of Omnitram, Tramadol, or placebo in a first treatment segment (one dose every 6 hours). Around the 9th dose blood samples are collected to quantify plasma Tramadol and Metabolite 1 (M1) enantiomers. After the 9th dose, pain tolerance is assessed with a cold pressor test (ice cold water immersion). After the 7th dose abuse liability measures and pupil diameter will be assessed. Subjects will washout for 7 days after the first treatment segment and second treatment segment.</detailed_description>
