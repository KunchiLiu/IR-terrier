	<brief_summary>A six courses regimen consisting of a 8 hour infusion (ch14.18/CHOmAb 20 mg/m²) for five consecutive days will be administered every 4 weeks, starting 60-180 days after previous haploidentical stem cell transplantation. Interleukin 2 will be added to cycles 4-6 at days 6,8,10 (1 x 106 IU/m²/d s.c.) Participants will be premedicated with an intravenous antihistamine and ranitidine within approximately 30 minutes prior and during the infusion of the study agent Pain as an anticipated side effect is managed by a standard pain prophylaxis with Morphium hydrochloride Disease status will be evaluated after 3 and 6 courses and after 1 year</brief_summary>

Prior administration of ch14.18 antibody after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (prior administration after autologous transplantation will be acceptable) HIV or Hepatitis B Surface (HBS) Ag positive. As presence of either may influence the ability if the immune system to be stimulated by this treatment.</criteria>
