	<brief_summary>The ability to control our blood glucose (sugar) concentrations after a meal is a strong predictor of the risk of disease. Our bodies respond to glucose ingestion by reducing the amount of glucose from the liver entering the bloodstream. At the same time muscle increases the amount of glucose it take up from the bloodstream. This ensures that our blood glucose levels do not get too high. The investigators want to understand what happens to these processes following exercise after breakfast and after an overnight fast. In addition, the investigators also want to understand whether exercising with or without breakfast influences our appetite, food intake and activity levels later in the day.</brief_summary>
