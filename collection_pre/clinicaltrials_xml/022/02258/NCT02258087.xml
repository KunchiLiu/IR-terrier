	<brief_title>HDR vs LDR Brachytherapy as Monotherapy in the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Permanent implant prostate brachytherapy (LDRPBT) is a well established and proved method in the treatment of patients with low or selected intermediate risk, organ confined prostate cancer. There are number of studies with high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRPBT) as monotherapy with several fractionation schedule treating the same group of patients. One phase II trial showed its effectiveness given in one fraction of 19 Gy. In the trial investigators randomly select patients to treat with either LDR prostate brachytherapy (145Gy) or HDR prostate brachytherapy (1x19Gy) as monotherapy. Patients are stratified into two pretreatment group: 1. low risk, 2. selected intermediate risk group. Brachytherapy is given in spinal anaesthesia, using transrectal ultrasound based real time treatment planning. Dose constraints are defined for both methods.</detailed_description>
