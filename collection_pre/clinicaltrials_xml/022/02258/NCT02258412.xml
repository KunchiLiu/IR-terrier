	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the immediate antimicrobial efficacy and persistence of two hand hygiene products on ICU Health Care Worker's skin flora by measuring bacterial organisms on hands using the hand print method. It is hypothesized that the product containing Chlorhexidine gluconate will provide more persistence than the alcohol product, resulting in less bacterial growth on the hand print plates. In addition, environmental monitoring for cleanliness will be captured from high touch surfaces in ICU patient rooms and common areas using Rodac plates and adenosine triphosphate tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Two Hand Hygiene Products in ICUs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crossover study with 50 Health care workers using each product with a minimum of 3 days in between. Products will be applied twice as per manufacturer's instructions for a Healthcare Personnel Handwash followed by immediate hand print. Persistent hand prints will be collected after exposure to environmental contaminants in the common areas. Hand prints will also be collected from one hand of 60 patients cared for by a participating Health Care Worker and gloved hand of Health Care Worker. All media contain neutralizers to inactivate active ingredients in each product and on surfaces. Each hand print plate's area of growth will be measured for Colony Forming Units using computerized software.</detailed_description>
