	<brief_summary>This proposal is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE). HA has traditionally been used to treat knee osteoarthritis. There are a small number of studies in the literature that suggest that HA injections can be very effective for tendinosis. Although LE has been studied with literally hundreds of articles published, very little treatment has proven to be efficacious. This study will investigate the effectiveness of hyaluronate in treatment of chronic LE. This will include a three arm study with two formulations of HA tested against saline injections as the control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyaluronate Injection for Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized and blinded into one of the two active injections versus the control injection. Patients will receive 3 injections total spaced over a 4 week period. After the injections are completed, patients will return for evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial injection. A total of 120 patients will be divided into the 3 groups. The questionnaires will be administered by a research assistant blinded to the randomization. Three different outcomes measures will be collected, all patient-oriented including the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain while at rest and with maximum grip, and the short form Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (quickDASH). The primary outcome measure will be the VAS for pain at 3 months from the initial injection. All measures will be evaluated at baseline then again at 12 months from the initial injection. HA formulations will be either Intragel (IBSA) or Arthrease (Ferring). Both will include 2cc for each injection with a concentration of 16mg per 2cc for Intragel and 20mg per 2cc for Arthrease. The formulations differ with regards to molecular weight with Intragel averaging 800-1200 kiloDaltons (KDalton) and Arthrease averaging 3000 kDaltons. The syringes will be coded and the injections blinded. The injections will be given 1cm distal to the lateral epicondyle at the site of maximum tenderness. The needle will be introduced to the depth of the bone then withdrawn 1-2mm. The injection will be given in two locations in and around the point of maximum tenderness.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Included will be patients older than 18 years with lateral epicondylitis. The criteria for diagnosis will include pain and tenderness at the lateral epicondyle worse with resisted wrist or finger extension (with the elbow in the extended position). Excluded will be patients with history of prior elbow surgery, history of fracture or dislocation, known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, or known hypersensitivity to HA. Exclusion will also include a known allergy to birds, feathers or egg products. If the patient has complaints of pain or tenderness on exam in the area of the radial neck, then a component of radial tunnel syndrome will be assumed and these patients will be excluded from study. Patients that are pregnant will be excluded.</criteria>
