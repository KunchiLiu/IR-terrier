	<brief_summary>This is a sub-study to the Time-differentiated Therapeutic Hypothermia (TTH48, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01689077). TTH48 compares 24 with 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia at a target temperature of 32-34Â°C in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The overall aim of this sub-study is to examine the hemostasis in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest and treated with 24 and 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia Our specific aims are: - To investigate the whole blood coagulation using the rotational thromboelastometry. - To investigate the function of platelets</brief_summary>
