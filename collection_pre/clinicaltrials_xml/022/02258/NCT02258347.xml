	<criteria>Male or female patient 18 years or older. Patient presenting with at least one thyroid nodule with no signs of malignancy: 1. Non suspect clinically and at ultrasonography imaging 2. Benign cytological diagnosis at fineneedle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) from the last 6 months 3. Normal serum calcitonin 4. No history of neck irradiation Normal thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH). Targeted nodule accessible and eligible to HIFU Absence of abnormal vocal cord mobility at laryngoscopy. Nodule diameter â‰¥ 10mm measured by ultrasound. Nodule volume inferior to 10 cc Composition of the targeted nodule(s) : no more than 30% cystic Head and/or neck disease that prevents hyperextension of neck. Known history of thyroid cancer or other neoplasias in the neck region. History of neck irradiation. Macrocalcification inducing a shadow in the thyroid significant enough to preclude the HIFU treatment Posterior position of the nodule if the thickness of the nodule is &lt;15mm Pregnant or lactating woman Any contraindication to the assigned analgesia/anaesthesia.</criteria>
