	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of pomegranate extract and pomegranate juice on skin inflammation and aging. The information gained from this study may lead to the development of a pomegranate product that can decrease the effects of aging, inflammation and harmful bacteria on the skin. In this study, two pomegranate products (extract and juice) will be compared with a placebo, a study product that looks like pomegranate extract, but contains no active ingredients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Pomegranate on Aging and Inflammation of the Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is grown commercially in the Near East, India, Spain, Israel and the United States (California) where it is of significant economic importance1. Pomegranate fruits and products, including juice, tea, wine and extracts are widely consumed and recognized for their health benefits. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruit possesses strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. In recent years, most health advantages of pomegranate have been attributed to the presence of ellagitannins, mainly punicalagins and ellagic acid. Punicalagin is unique to pomegranate and is part of a family of ellagitannins. The ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid in the gut, and further metabolized by the colon microflora to form urolith A and B. Investigations using pure bacterial cultures have shown that pomegranate by-products and punicalagins significantly inhibited the growth of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridia and Staphylococcus aureus. Oral feeding of pomegranate fruit extract to mice afforded protection to mouse skin against the adverse effects of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation by modulating UVB-induced signaling pathways.5 Hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from pomegranate was reported improving wound healing in vivo. Pomegranate ellagitannins have been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity. Punicalagin is unique to pomegranate and is part of a family of ellagitannins. The ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid in the gut, and further metabolized by the colon microflora to form urolith A and B. Investigations using pure bacterial cultures have shown that pomegranate by-products and punicalagins significantly inhibited the growth of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridia and Staphylococcus aureus. Pomegranate Extract (POMx) is made from pomegranate fruit as a byproduct of pomegranate juice (PJ) production. A second pressing of the fruit liberates a complex mixture of hydrolysable polyphenolic compounds normally ingested with pomegranate juice, and these are purified by spray drying. POMx powder is encapsulated for oral administration, with each capsule containing 1,000 mg of pomegranate polyphenols. The present study will determine whether a pomegranate product (POMx or PJ) can decrease skin photoaging, inflammation and skin pathogenic bacteria.</detailed_description>
