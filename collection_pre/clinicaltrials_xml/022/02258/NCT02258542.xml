	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of benralizumab administration in asthma patients who have completed one of the three predecessor studies: D3250C00017, D3250C00018 or D3250C00020.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Benralizumab (MEDI-563) in Asthmatic Adults and Adolescents on Inhaled Corticosteroid Plus LABA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a minimum of 1200 patients have been enrolled in this study, subsequent patients (up to a maximum of 2200 total for the study), who complete a minimum of 16 weeks, and no more than 40 weeks, in this study, will be given the option to transition to an open-label safety extension study, Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI). Adolescent patients, patients from Japan and South Korea, and any patient who chooses not to enter Study D3250C00037 will remain in this study through IPD or EOT and FU.</detailed_description>

Exclusion criteria 1. Any disorder including but not limited to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator and could: Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study 2. A helminth parasitic infection diagnosed during a predecessor study that has either not been treated, has been incompletely treated or has failed to respond to standard of care therapy 3. Any clinically significant change in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during a predecessor study which in the opinion of the investigator may put the patient at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or interfere with the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of the study 4. Current malignancy or malignancy that developed during a predecessor study (subjects that had basal cell carcinoma, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which was resected for cure, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix that has been treated/cured will not be excluded). 5. Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of treatment in this study, during the treatment period, and for 16 weeks (5 halflives) after the last dose of the investigational product 6. Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 30 days prior to Visit 1 7. Planned major surgical procedures during the conduct of the study 8. Previous participation in the present study 9. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical trial 10. AstraZeneca staff involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study 11.
