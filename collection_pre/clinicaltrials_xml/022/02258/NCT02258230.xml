	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Three-dimensional Versus Two-dimensional Sacral Colpopexy and Paravaginal Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare operative times of laparoscopic sacral colpopexy (LSC) for the treatment of symptomatic vaginal vault prolapse as well as paravaginal repair (PVR) for symptomatic cystocele between two-dimensional and three-dimensional laparoscopic systems. Additionally this study will evaluate postoperative complications from surgeries performed using two-dimensional versus three-dimensional laparoscopic systems.</detailed_description>
