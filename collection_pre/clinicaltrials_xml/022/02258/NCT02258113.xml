	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using a novel reaction-time based visual field device Ocusweep compared to widely used methods. Addition to that. the aim is to validate a novel perimetry method (Visual Search Test, VST) which is based on reaction times in visual decision-making task, where the subject is allowed to move eyes and where the fixation is verified by the subject himself in contrast to standard automatic perimetry (SAP) where prolonged stationary fixation and external fixation monitoring apparatus is required. using a novel reaction-time based visual field device Ocusweep compared to generally used SAP methods. Those tests will be done for healthy volunteers and for persons with diagnosed eye or brain disease.</brief_summary>
