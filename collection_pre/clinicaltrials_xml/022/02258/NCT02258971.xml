	<brief_summary>Primary objectives: To determine the basic pharmacokinetics of BEA 2180 BR, its metabolites CD 1975 ZW and CD 1976 ZW and radioactivity including excretion mass balance, excretion pathways and metabolism following the oral and intravenous administration of [14C] BEA 2180 BR Secondary objectives: To determine safety and tolerability following single dose oral and iv administration of BEA 2180 BR in healthy male volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Healthy males according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests 2. Age ≥35 and Age ≤70 years 3. BMI ≥18.5 and BMI ≤29.9 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) 4. Subjects must agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming pregnant from the dosing day until 3 months after the completion of the study. Acceptable methods of contraception for male volunteers include a vasectomy no less than 3 months prior to dosing, barrier contraception or a medically accepted contraceptive method. For female partners of male volunteers, acceptable methods of contraception include intrauterine device, tubal ligation, hormonal contraceptive since at least two months and diaphragm with spermicide 5. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the local legislation 1. Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR) and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance 2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease 3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders 4. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders 5. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts 6. Chronic or relevant acute infections 7. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to study drug or its excipients) 8. Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial 9. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial 10. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to administration or during the trial 11. Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day) 12. Inability to refrain from smoking during the stay in the trial centre 13. Alcohol abuse (more than 2 units of alcoholic beverages per day or more than 14 units per week (1 unit equals 1 pint [285 mL] of beer or lager, 1 glass [125 mL] of wine, 25 mL shot of 40% spirit)more than 60 g/day). 14. Drug abuse 15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within 60 days prior to study drug administration or during the trial) 16. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the trial until followup examination) 17. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 18. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of study centre 19. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/Heart ratecorrected QT interval (QTc) interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms) Exclusion criteria specific for this study: 20. Veins unsuitable for infusion and blood sampling 21. Pulse rate (PR) interval &gt;220 ms or QRS interval &gt;120 ms 22. Exposure to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental Xrays and plain Xrays of thorax and bony skeleton (excluding spinal column)), during work or during participation in a medical trial in the previous year 23. Irregular defecation pattern (less than once per 2 days)</criteria>
