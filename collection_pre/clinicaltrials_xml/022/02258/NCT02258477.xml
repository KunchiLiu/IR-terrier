	<brief_summary>To compare the effects of ingesting 100, 50 and 10 calories of glucose as compared to a non-calorie placebo (0 calorie beverage) on self-control over resisting snack foods. To test whether there is a threshold of glucose that will result in improved ease of resistance to problem foods (tested by comparing three different levels of glucose).</brief_summary>
