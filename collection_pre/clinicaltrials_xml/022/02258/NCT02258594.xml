	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to refine, implement, and evaluate a multi-component intervention that achieves sustainable and meaningful impact on healthcare quality, safety, and costs while ensuring dignity and respect for adult oncology and intensive care patients and their care partners. The PROSPECT (Promoting Respect and Ongoing Safety through Patient-centeredness, Engagement, Communication, and Technology) framework will achieve this by enhancing the patient-provider relationship and introducing patient-centered approaches to multi-disciplinary communication and patient education. The PROSPECT framework is based upon a validated structured, team-work training model and novel web-based technology. The overarching goals of this project are to achieve the following: 1. Optimize the overall experience of patients (including their family/care partners) by promoting dignity/respect, encouraging engagement, improving care plan concordance, and enhancing satisfaction. 2. Minimize preventable harms in two environments: intensive care and acute care oncology units. 3. Reduce unnecessary healthcare resource utilization and associated costs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This overarching project aims are to refine, implement, and evaluate a multi-faceted intervention composed of the Patient-SatisfActive® model, developed by Drs. Ronen Rozenblum and David Bates at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and a web-based Patient-Centered Toolkit (PCTK), developed by Drs. Dykes and Dalal, on quality, safety, and cost outcomes in the intensive care and oncology units at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The specific aims of the project are as follows: - Aim 1: To refine and implement the Patient-SatisfActive® model to promote respect, dignity, and satisfaction of patients, care partners and staff on intensive care and oncology units. - Aim 2: To refine and implement a web-based, Patient-Centered Toolkit (PCTK), comprised of an electronic bedside communication center (eBCC) and a patient-centered microblog, to promote tailored patient and care-partner education, communication, collaboration, and engagement. - Aim 3: To evaluate the relative impact of this intervention compared to usual care on patient reported outcome measures, adverse events (harms), post-discharge healthcare utilization, concordance in understanding the care plan, and satisfaction among care team members (patients/care partners, profession providers). - Aim 4: To identify the barriers and facilitators of implementing this intervention to support dissemination.</detailed_description>
