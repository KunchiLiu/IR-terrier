For METGLUCO®, the allowable halfmax dose of 1125 mg/day must be applied.).

An exception is shortterm treatment (7 days or less in total) with insulin in connection with intercurrent illness Any disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise subject's safety or compliance with the protocol History of chronic or idiopathic acute pancreatitis Screening calcitonin value of 50 ng/L (pg/mL) or greater Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) Impaired renal function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 per modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula (4 variable version) Acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days before randomisation Heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV</criteria>
