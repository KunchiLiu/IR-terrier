	<brief_summary>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely used for local treatment of gastric neoplasms. Although ESD-related complications such as bleeding and perforation have been reported, data is currently lacking on the development of pain, which is one of the most common adverse events after ESD. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the incidence and clinicopathologic risk factors of pain after ESD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain After Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted evaluating 156 patients with gastric neoplasms treated by ESD at Gangnam Severance Hospital between April 2011 and December 2014. All subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) either before or after ESD.</detailed_description>
