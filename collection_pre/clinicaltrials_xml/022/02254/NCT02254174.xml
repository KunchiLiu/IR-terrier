Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to randomisation 9. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to enrolment in the study or during the study 10. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to randomisation 11. Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day) 12. Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days as judged by the investigator 13. Alcohol abuse (more than 40 g alcohol a day) 14. Drug abuse 15. Blood donation (more than 100 mL blood within 4 weeks prior to randomisation or during the trial) 16. Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial 17. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance 18. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class side effect profile of ß2mimetics: 19. Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity 20. Hyperthyrosis 21. Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment 22. Clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia 23. Paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute) The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class side effect profile of tiotropium: 24.
