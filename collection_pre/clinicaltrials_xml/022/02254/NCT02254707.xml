Liver biopsy consistent with active Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection obtained within the last 24 months showing minimal to mild liver fibrosis and without cirrhosis (Ishak or Metavir grade &lt;= 2) 6. HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) load greater than 100,000 IU RNA per ml serum at screening 7. Willing to abstain from alcohol during the screening, treatment and until completion of the study (visit 11) 1. Males not using an adequate form of contraception (condom, sterilisation at least 6 months post operation) in case their partner is of childbearing potential and is not using an adequate form of contraception (hormonal contraceptives, oral or injectable/implantable, intrauterine device (IUD). 2.

Evidence of decompensated liver disease: ascites, portal hypertension or hepatic encephalopathy 4. Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen at screening 5. Current alcohol or drug abuse, or history of the same, within the past twelve (12) months. All patients must abstain from alcohol from enrolment until completion of the study (visit 11). 6. Any concurrent medical illness or disease requiring treatment or concomitant medications 7.

Planned or concurrent usage of any other pharmacological therapy at screening, or during the trial period, including any antiviral therapy or vaccination 11. Known hypersensitivity to drugs or excipients 12. Patients with any one of the following laboratory values at screening: Alanine transaminase (ALT) or Aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (at screening and during the last 3 months before screening demonstrated by at least 2 further determinations) Total bilirubin &gt; 1x ULN Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.5x ULN Prothrombin time (INR, prolonged) &gt; 1.5 Platelet count &lt; 100,000 / mm3 Hemoglobin &lt; 10.5 g/dL White blood cell count &lt; 2,000 / mm3 13.

To support selection, centers will receive lists of the placebo patients of the previous dose levels, however, only for each center separately 17. Inability to comply with the protocol</criteria>
