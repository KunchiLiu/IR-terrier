	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial (pilot study). 20 participants with diastolic heart failure will be assigned to ventilation therapy (AutoSet CS ™ ASV device; therapy group). The trial will run for 6 months, after which change in echocardiographic parameters of diastolic left ventricular function, sleep and quality of life parameters will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
