	<criteria>Healthy male or female subjects determined by results of screening with a creatinine clearance &gt;80 mL/min (Group 1) Renally impaired male or female subjects determined by results of screening with the following creatinine clearance results: creatinine clearance 5180 mL/min (Group 2) creatinine clearance 3150 mL/min (Group 3) creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min (Group 4) subjects requiring hemodialysis (Group 5) Signed written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Age &gt;=18 and &lt;=75 years BMI &gt;=18.5 and &lt;=29.9 kg/m2 for Groups 1+2 BMI &gt;=18.5 and &lt;=32 kg/m2 for Groups 3, 4 and 5 Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic or hormonal disorders Surgery of gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders Relevant history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Abnormal PT, TT, aPTT (must be within the normal range after no more than one repeated test), thrombocytes &lt; 150000/μl (two repeats of the first test) Evidence of haematuria either macroscopically detectable or microscopic on urinalysis (normal microscopic results after no ore than one repeated test) Evidence of blood dyscrasia, haemorrhagic diathesis, severe thrombocytopenia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, bleeding tendencies associated with active ulceration or overt bleeding of gastrointestinal, respiratory or genitourinary tract or any disease or condition with haemorrhagic tendencies (e.g. cerebral aneurysm, dissecting aorta, CNS trauma, retinopathy, nephrolithiasis) Recent or contemplated diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding (e.g. spinal puncture, lumbar block anaesthesia, surgery of central nervous system (CNS) or eye or surgery resulting in large open surfaces) within 14 days before or after drug administration of this clinical trial Occult blood in 1 of 3 subsequent faecal samples collected for the prestudy examination Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator For women with childbearing potential: no reliable contraception (accepted methods are intra uterine device, hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, condoms) or pregnancy (known or detected by a positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding period Intake of drugs with a long halflife (&gt; 24 hours) (&lt; 1 month prior to administration or during the trial) Use of any drugs, within 14 days prior to administration or during the trial Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (&lt; 2 months prior to administration or during trial) Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day) Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60 g/day) Drug abuse Blood donation or loss &gt; 400 ml, &lt; 1 month prior to administration or during the trial Excessive physical activities &lt; 5 days prior to administration of study drug or during trial Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities Veins unsuited for i.v. puncture and administration of prolonged infusions on either arm (e.g. veins which are difficult to locate, access or puncture, veins with a tendency to rupture during or after puncture, etc.) Renally impaired subjects (Group 2, 3, 4 and 5) who meet any of the following criteria will not be entered into this trial: Moderate and severe concurrent liver function impairment (e.g., due to hepatorenal syndrome) Gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic or hormonal disorders Surgery of gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders Relevant history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Abnormal values for PT, TT, aPTT and thrombocytes considered by the investigator or one of the coinvestigators to be clinically relevant Hemoglobin concentration &lt;9 mg/dl Evidence of blood dyscrasia, haemorrhagic diathesis, severe thrombocytopenia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, bleeding tendencies associated with active ulceration or overt bleeding of gastrointestinal, respiratory or genitourinary tract or any disease or condition with haemorrhagic tendencies (e.g. cerebral aneurysm, dissecting aorta,CNS trauma, retinopathy, nephrolithiasis) considered by the investigator or one of the coinvestigators to be clinically relevant Recent or contemplated diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding (e.g. spinal puncture, lumbar block anaesthesia, surgery of CNS or eye or surgery resulting in large open surfaces) within 14 days before or after drug administration of this clinical trial Occult blood in 1 of 3 subsequent faecal samples collected for the prestudy examination Chronic or relevant acute infections History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator For women with childbearing potential: no reliable contraception (accepted methods are intra uterine device, hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, condoms) or pregnancy (known or detected by a positive pregnancy test) or breast feeding period Faecal occult blood (FOB) in 1 of 3 subsequent samples collected for the prestudy examination Use of any drugs which have an influence on the blood clotting within 14 days prior to administration or during the trial (except heparin for hemodialysis patients) Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (&lt; 2 months prior to administration or during trial) Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day) Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60 g/day) Drug abuse Blood donation or loss &gt; 400 ml, &lt; 1 month prior to administration or during the trial Excessive physical activities &lt;
