	<brief_summary>This study is looking at the efficacy of a sloped insole in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Regularly wearing a sloped insole over the course of one year will result in a wider joint space by x-ray in 60% of the subjects, a significant decrease in knee pain, decreased use of over the counter analgesics, and a clinically important improvement in the Womac pain and stiffness scale.</brief_summary>

Range of motion kneeflexion beyond 100 degrees and not lacking more than 15 degrees of extension. Subtalar and forefoot motion permitting foot/ankle eversion with weight bearing. Sufficient shoe toe box height to allow space for the insole and therefore comfort and compliance. Passive laxity of medial capsule and collateral ligament by knee extension test. All other forms of knee arthritis other than OA. Knee Instability medial pseudoopening of greater than grade 1 or detectable Anteriorposterior instability. Less than Grade 4 KellgrenLawrence radiographic changes in the medial compartment of the knee39. Grade 2 or greater KellgrenLawrence radiographic39 involvement of the patellofemoral or lateral compartment. Inadequate knee range of motion Balance problems requiring the use of a walker or wheel chair ambulation with aid Diabetics with peripheral neuropathy Knee surgery within the past year Intraarticular steroid injection or visco supplementation within 6 months Stiff subtalar or forefoot joints clinical test Inadequate shoe toe box depth to accommodate the test or control inserts Charcot joint Fixed contracture of the medial capsule and/or collateral ligament clinical test</criteria>
