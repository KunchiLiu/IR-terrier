	<brief_summary>In vitro, Vitamin-E diffused, highly cross-linked polyethylene (PE) have been shown to have superior wear resistance and improved mechanical properties as compared to that of standard highly cross-linked PE. There are as of yet no published studies with vitamin-E diffused PE although several trials are ongoing. All of these trials use uncemented acetabular cups intended for biological fixation. In many countries the standard fixation method for the acetabular component is bone-cement. The Vitamin-E used in implants is alfa-tocopherol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant with oily consistency; theoretically affecting cemented fixation when used in acetabular components. The aim of the study is to compare migration, linear wear and clinical results between two types of cemented acetabular cups.</brief_summary>
