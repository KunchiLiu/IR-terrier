	<brief_summary>Delivery of FMT by upper route, including gastroscopy, nasogastric/ nasojejunal tube, and lower route, including retention enema, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy have all been utilized successfully. Endoscopic delivery requires significant health care utilization and associated cost. Therefore, it is extremely desirable if FMT can be infused by a non invasive modality, which would significantly reduce patient discomfort, procedure related risks and health care costs, while offering similar efficacy to colonoscopic delivery in the range of 90%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FMT Delivered by Capsule Versus Colonoscopy for Recurrent C. Diff</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with minimum 3 episodes of Clostridium difficile within 6 months are randomized 1:1 to received FMT by either colonoscopy or capsules. Pts are assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 mon, 3 mon, 6 mon and 1 year post FMT. Stool, urine and blood samples are collected. Medical cost for previous treatment is collected as well at pt perspective and QoL.</detailed_description>
