	<brief_summary>1. To compare the systemic drug exposure of 100 μg Serevent ® Diskus ® with that of 50 μg Serevent ® MDI with sufficient precision so that in combination with a second trial it can be demonstrated that the systemic drug exposure of a new formulation of salmeterol xinafoate is not superior to that of Serevent ® MDI 2. To test a system of ordered null hypotheses regarding the exposure of two dose levels of Serevent ® Diskus ® and Serevent ® MDI 3. To get data about the systemic drug exposure of 25 μg Serevent ® MDI and of 50 μg Serevent ® Diskus ®</brief_summary>
