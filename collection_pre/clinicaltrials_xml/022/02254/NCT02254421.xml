	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of presatovir on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral load in autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with an acute RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), the effect of presatovir on being free of any supplemental oxygen, and rates of respiratory failure and all-cause mortality, and pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of presatovir.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Received an autologous or allogeneic HCT using any conditioning regimen Evidence of new abnormalities on chest Xray obtained &lt; 48 hours prior to screening, determined to be consistent with LRTI by the local radiologist, relative to the most recent previous chest Xray. If chest Xray is not available, a chest Xray must be obtained for screening. Documented RSV in both the upper (eg, nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash) and lower (eg, induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung biopsy, but not spontaneous sputum) respiratory tract as determined by local testing (eg, polymerase chain reaction, direct fluorescence antibody, respiratory viral panel assay, or culture). All samples must have been collected ≤ 6 days prior to Day 1, or as determined at screening as per protocol. An informed consent document signed and dated by the participant or a legal guardian of the participant and investigator or his/her designee. In Sweden ICFs signed by a legal guardian must also be signed by a close relative of the individual. A negative urine or serum pregnancy test is required for female participants (unless surgically sterile or greater than two years postmenopausal) Male and female participants of childbearing potential must agree to contraceptive requirements as described in the study protocol Willingness to complete necessary study procedures and have available a working telephone or email Related to concomitant or previous medication use: Use of nonmarketed (according to region) investigational agents within 30 days, OR use of any monoclonal antiRSV antibodies within 4 months or 5 halflives of screening, whichever is longer, OR use of any investigational RSV vaccines after HCT Related to medical history: Pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating females Unable to tolerate nasal sampling required for this study, as determined by the investigator Known history of HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count &lt;200 cells/μL within the last month History of drug and/or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, may prevent adherence to study activities Related to medical conditions: Requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization Documented to be positive for other respiratory viruses (limited to influenza, parainfluenza, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, or coronavirus), from the lower respiratory tract sample as determined by local testing Clinically significant bacteremia or fungemia within 7 days prior to screening that has not been adequately treated, as determined by the investigator Clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonia within 2 weeks prior to screening that has not been adequately treated, as determined by the investigator Excessive nausea/vomiting at screening, as determined by the investigator, or an inability to swallow pills that precludes oral administration of the investigational medical product (for individuals without an NG tube in place) Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent full participation in this trial or would interfere with the evaluation of the trial endpoints Related to laboratory results: Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min (calculated using the CockcroftGault method) Clinically significant aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase, as determined by the investigator Clinically significant total bilirubin, as determined by the investigator</criteria>
