	<brief_title>Irrigation Endoscopic Decompression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>104 consecutive patients suffering of neurogenic claudication were included in the study. Patients were operated using the irrigation endoscopic decompression technique. Mean Follow up was 28 months Primary outcome measures were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index [19] and the modified Macnab Criteria All statistical calculations were done using computer programs SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) version 15 for Microsoft Windows</detailed_description>
