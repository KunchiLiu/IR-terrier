	<detailed_description>This study will be a dose escalation, cohort staggering (slow enrollment) for the 3 dose levels (low, medium or high dose level) with a placebo-controlled group: - Cohort 1: A first cohort of one hundred nineteen subjects (119) will be randomized; of these, seventy five (75) will be dosed with the lowest dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, and twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be collected and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of the Principal Investigator (PI), the Sponsor's Medical Officer and three external medical experts as voting members, prior to permitting immunization with the cohort 2. - Cohort 2: A second cohort of one hundred subjects (100) subjects will be randomized; of these, fifty six (56) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, nineteen (19) be dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, and twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be collected and reviewed by the DSMB, prior to permitting immunization with the highest dose. - Cohort 3: A third cohort of eighty one subjects (81) subjects will be randomized; of these fifty six (56) dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. Three (3) and 21 days after immunization, key safety (Day 3) and immunogenicity (Day 21) data will be collected and analyzed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 201 (6-month follow up), regardless the phase of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male and female adults, 18 to 49 years of age, inclusive. 2. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥18 and ≤32. 3. Give his/her consent to participate in this study (by signing the informed consent form). In the opinion of the Investigator, competence and willingness to provide written, informed consent for participation after reading the informed consent form. The subject must have adequate opportunity to discuss the study with an Investigator or qualified designee. 4. Healthy as judged by the Investigator or designee and determined by complete general physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and medical history conducted no more than 30 days prior to study vaccine administration. Subjects with a preexisting chronic disease will be allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the Investigator's judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable disease is generally defined as no new onset of exacerbation of preexisting chronic disease 6 months prior to immunization. Based on the Investigator's judgment, a subject with more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible. 5. Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study period, ability to attend scheduled visits, accessible by phone on a consistent basis. 6. If female, have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and negative urine pregnancy test on Day 0 prior to immunization. 7. Female of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception for 1 month prior to immunization and agrees to continue employing adequate birth control measures for at least 60 days postimmunization. Moreover, she must have no plan to become pregnant for at least 2 months postimmunization. Abstinent subjects should be asked what method(s) they would use, should their circumstances change, and subjects without a welldefined plan should be excluded. The following relationship or methods of contraception are considered to be effective: Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., injectable, topical [patch], estrogenic vaginal ring, etc.); Intrauterine device (IUD) with or without hormonal release; Male partner using a condom plus spermicide or sterilized partner (at least 1 year prior to immunization); Credible history of abstinence (selfreported); Heterosexual abstinence at least 60 days postimmunization; Female partner. 8. Nonchildbearing females defines as: Surgicallysterile (defined as bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy performed more than 1 month prior to immunization); Postmenopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent with natural cessation of ovulation). 1. According to Investigator's opinion, presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. "Uncontrolled" is defined as: Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study vaccine administration; Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to study vaccine administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable). 2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and reporting. 3. Any autoimmune disease or any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B or C, or the presence of lymphoproliferative disease. 4. Administration of any vaccine (including any other influenza vaccine) within 30 days prior to study enrolment or planned administration within the period from the vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 21 or within 30 days prior to blood sampling at Day 201. Immunization on an emergency basis will be evaluated casebycase by the Investigator. 5. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine within 1 year prior to the study enrolment or planned administration prior to the end of this study (Day 201). Administration of any 'standard', not adjuvanted influenza vaccine (e.g.: live attenuated Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine (TIV) or Quadrivalent Inactivated Vaccine (QIV) vaccine IN or split TIV or QIV vaccine by either intradermal or intramuscular route) prior to the 30 day exclusion period mentioned above would be acceptable. 6.
