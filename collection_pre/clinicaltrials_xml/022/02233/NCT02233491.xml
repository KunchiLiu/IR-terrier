	<brief_summary>Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common medical complication after kidney transplantation, related to both transplant-specific and generic risk factors, and is associated with major complications after transplantation. The current PTDM Consensus Report recommends lifestyle modification (e.g. weight loss, dietary modification, structured exercise program) as the first line therapy of choice. No recommendation is given with regards to how such guidance should be delivered. In addition no clinical evidence exists to suggest lifestyle modification provides any sustained glycaemic benefits for kidney allograft recipients. While in the general population the benefits of lifestyle modification have been well documented with regards to attenuation of both pre-diabetic and diabetic states in the context of randomised controlled trials, no similar level of evidence exists post kidney transplantation. This prospective randomised controlled trial is designed to compare active versus passive lifestyle intervention post kidney transplantation, to determine changes in cardio-metabolic risk profile over the course of the intervention.</brief_summary>
