	<brief_summary>This Phase IV study is an a multi-centre, randomised open label, two way cross-over design to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NEUMOTEROL 400 in subjects with asthma. The study will be used to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate combination (BFF) 400/12 micrograms (mcg) single capsule inhaler (NEUMOTEROL 400) compared with BFF 320/9 mcg SYMBICORT Forte TURBUHALER® inhaler. The population for this study will be adult subjects (&gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years) with a diagnosis of asthma who have a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40% to 85% of the predicted normal value, and are receiving a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroid inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (LABA) prior to screening. The study will consist of six phases: Prescreening, Screening/Run-in (4 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (4 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (4 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 17 weeks. There will be up to 6 study visits and a follow-up telephone call. Pre-screening Visit will allow subjects who had recent asthma medication changes to be stabilized prior to Screening. During the run-in and wash-out periods, all the subjects will receive budesonide dry powder inhaler (DPI) 400 mcg twice daily (BID) (NEUMOTEX™ 400) and salbutamol 100mcg pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) on demand, as rescue medication. The dose of NEUMOTEROL 400 (400/12 mcg) and SYMBICORT Forte (320/9 mcg) will be one inhalation BID, and each treatment will be given to all subjects for 4 weeks (with a 4-week Washout Period between treatments). The study will include 300 subjects for screening so that at least 210 will be randomised and a minimum of 168 subjects complete the study/are evaluable. Half the subjects will be on Regimen A in Treatment Period 1and will then be crossed over to Regimen B in Treatment Period 2, and vice versa. Regimen A: BFF (400/12 mcg) by single capsule inhaler. Regimen B: BFF (320/9 mcg) TURBUHALER inhaler. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout Period of 4 weeks.

	<criteria>Male or female &gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years of age with a diagnosis of asthma at the time of signing the informed consent A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchild bearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 milliinternational unit/milliliter (mIU/mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picogram/millilitre (pg/mL) [&lt;147 picomol/litre] is confirmatory) ; Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study from Screening to followup contact) if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method; Childbearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment ; Abstinence from penilevaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject Severity of disease: A best prebronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=40% to &lt;=85% of the predicted normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). . Percent predicted will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations. Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL reversibility of FEV1 within 10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) Current antiasthma therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS with or without LABA for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). Two populations are eligible for enrolment: Subjects maintained on ICS monotherapy (Budesonide 400 mcg to 800 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) or Subjects maintained on an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., NEUMOTEROL 200/6 BID or 400/12 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination products or by separate inhalers) for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). Subjects taking budesonide/formoterol as needed must switch to maintenance dosing (excluding the highest dose) with use of a SABA for symptom relief at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit). NOTE: Subjects on low dose ICS monotherapy should only be enrolled, if, in the opinion of the investigator, after review of their medical history and clinical examination, they will be able to benefit from both an increase in ICS dose and the addition of LABA therapy arising from and ICS/LABA combination Ability to withhold LABA therapy : Other than what is provided during the study, LABA therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1(Screening and Runin Visit) and throughout the entire study. The last dose of prestudy LABA and LABA/ICS combinations are to be taken on the day before Visit 1. According to investigators judgement, patients should be able to withhold LABA therapy during the runin and washout period. SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue salbutamol at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) for use as needed for the duration of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold salbutamol for at least 6 hours before each study visit Liver safety criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2×the upper limit of normal (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit) Electrocardiography (ECG) safety criteria : The subject must have no ECG abnormalities that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening and Runin Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &lt;450 microseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period. Investigators will be responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.
