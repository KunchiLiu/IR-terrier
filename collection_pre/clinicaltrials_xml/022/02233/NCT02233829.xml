	<brief_summary>Background: - Dopamine is a chemical signal linked to the rewarding effects of drugs. Certain genes make these effects sensitive to the time of day they are taken. Cocaine can affect these genes in the brain. Researchers want to measure brain dopamine at different times of day. Objectives: - To look for changes to a person s biological clock in the function of the dopamine reward system. To test if cocaine disrupts this. Eligibility: - Adults age 21-55 with a cocaine use disorder. - Healthy volunteers age 21-55. Design: - Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, interview, and blood and urine tests. Their breath will be tested for alcohol and recent smoking. - Participants will have 3 overnight clinic visits. - Visit 1: They will have blood and urine collected and a heart test. - A plastic tube (catheter) will be placed into a vein in each arm by needle. - Participants will have a PET scan in a donut-shaped machine. They will lie on a bed that slides in and out of it, wearing a cap. A radiotracer (measures dopamine) and a drug (blocks dopamine removal) will be injected via catheter. Vital signs will be measured and blood will be drawn throughout. - Visit 2: repeats Visit 1, except at night. - Visit 3, participants will have urine collected. - They will have MRI scans in a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of it, with a coil over their head. - Participants may answer questions, take computer or paper tests, and perform simple actions. - For 1 week, participants will wear a wrist device that measures daily activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: The primary objective is to assess if there is disruption of circadian DA rhythms in cocaine addiction. The secondary objective is to assess if dopamine modulates the sensitivity of the brain reward network in a circadian dependent manner. Study Population: Non-treatment seeking cocaine abusers (moderate or severe cocaine use disorder as per DSM-IV) and healthy controls. Males and females will be included. Design: Participants will undergo two PET scans with [11C]raclopride using a bolus infusion paradigm to assess baseline D2R availability followed by an infusion to assess changes in DA as measured by [11C]raclopride s displacement following an intravenous injection of methylphenidate (MP). They will also undergo a total of 4 MRI scans, two after placebo and two after MP to assess the circadian variations in the sensitivity of the brain reward network. The two [11C]raclopride scans will be done on separate days at least one week apart, one in the morning starting between (7-9 AM) and one in the early evening (5-7 PM) and they will be followed by an MRI scan to assess the sensitivity of the brain reward network under the influence of MP in the morning (9-11AM) and in the evening (7-9 PM). For the Placebo MRI scans participants will be tested either on separate days or on the morning of the evening session or on the evening prior to the morning session. We will use the MRI scans to assess the sensitivity of the brain reward circuit to visual presentation of drug or food cues and to evaluate resting functional connectivity. Outcome Parameters: Main outcome measure is to assess if there are differences in DA release between the morning and the evening (displacement of [11C]raclopride binding after MP) and to determine if these diurnal patterns differ in cocaine addiction. Secondary outcome measures are: To assess if DA signaling correlates with reactivity of brain regions to exposure of food and drug cues and with functional connectivity of the reward network and to assess if the reactivity of the reward network shows circadian variability. We will also assess if differences in DA signaling between morning and evening correlate with circadian typology and with measures of spontaneous motor activity and with sleeping patterns.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ALL PARTICIPANTS: 1. Between 21 and 55 years of age. 2. Ability to provide written informed consent. INCLUSION CRITERIA SPECIFIC FOR COCAINE USE DISORDER (CUD) PARTICIPANTS: 1. DSMIV or DSM5 diagnosis of a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder (established through history and clinical exam). 2. Nontreatment seeking cocaine users (actively consuming cocaine last use within one week of study as assessed by selfreports). 3. Minimum 10 years history of cocaine abuse predominantly via smoking or injection selfreport. 4. Must consume at least 4 grams of cocaine per week selfreport. EXCLUSION CRITERIA ALL PARTICIPANTS: 1. Use, in the past two weeks, of psychoactive medications (four weeks for fluoxetine) or medications that may affect brain function (including but not limited to meperidine, tricyclic antidpressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as determined by medical history and physical exam. 2. Current or past DSMIV or DSM5 diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder (other than cocaine for the cocaine abusers, and nicotine/caffeine for any of the participants) that required hospitalization (any length), or chronic medication management (more than 4 weeks) and that could impact brain function at the time of the study as determined by history and clinical exam. 3. Current or previous chronic treatment (greater than 3 months) with stimulant medications (amphetamine or methylphenidate). 4. Major medical problems that can permanently impact brain function (e.g., CNS including seizures and psychosis; cardiovascular including hypertension [BP &gt; 140/90] and clinically significant arrhythmias except bradycardia; metabolic, autoimmune, endocrine; +HIV) as determined by history. 5. Any clinically significant laboratory finding as determined during the screening procedures that could impact brain function or study procedures as evidenced from clinical laboratory results. Since half of the participants in the study will have a diagnosis of cocaine use disorder, we expect some clinically significant findings that would reflect their recent cocaine use. As an example, a participant might have a mildly elevated Creatinine Kinase as a result of recent cocaine use. The test would reflect an acute rhabdomyolysis due to recent cocaine use, and it would be clinically significant. Nevertheless, if it is a mild episode as expected with cocaine use, it would not affect brain functioning or increase the risk of the procedures for the participants in the study. Therefore, not all abnormal laboratory findings that have clinical significance will be excluded. If a finding reflects altered brain function (e.g., arrhythmias or renal failure) it will be exclusionary for the study. 6. Have had previous radiation exposure (from Xrays, PET scans, or other exposure) that, with the exposure from this study, would exceed NIH annual research limits as determined by medical history and physical exam. 7. Head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes as determined by medical history and physical exam; 8. Positive test for drugs on the day of the PET, the MRI or the NP tests as evidenced from clinical laboratory results. 9. Pregnant or breast feeding: Females must have negative urine pregnancy test and are not currently breastfeeding. Postmenopausal or surgically sterile (tubal ligation or hysterectomy); or not sexually active with a male partner and able to get pregnant; or documented agreement to use an effective form of birth control. Acceptable forms of contraception include: hormonal contraceptives (birthcontrol pills, injectable hormones, vaginalring hormones); IUD; diaphragm with spermicide; condom with spermicide. 10. History of coagulation disorder as evidenced from clinical laboratory results, medical history. 11. History of glaucoma as determined by medical history. 12. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI of the head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments) or fear of enclosed spaces selfreport checklist. 13. Personal or family history for cerebral aneurism. 14. Past or present history of chest pain and trouble breathing with activity. 15. Diabetes as assessed by medical history. 16. High risk for silent heart diseases as evidenced by high levels of highsensitivity Creactive protein or homocysteine in blood, or being overweight or obese. In addition patients with high cholesterol or a family history of heart disease will be evaluated by a cardiologist to determine their eligibility for participation. The cardiologist might request additional tests if he deems it necessary to ensure fitness for participation (ie treadmill stress test). Specifically the cardiologist involved will review the findings of 1) an inability to reach these endpoints, 2) the development of chest pain, 3) significant ST segment changes, 4) significant arrhythmias, and 5) an inability to appropriately increase blood pressure or heart rate with exercise in order to determine if the participant is suitable for inclusion in the study. 17. Cannot lie comfortably flat on your back for up to 2 hours in the PET and MRI scanners selfreport. 18. Weight &gt; 400 pounds which is the maximum weight the PET scanner can hold. 19. Study investigators and staff, as well as their superiors, subordinates and immediate family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings). Note: At any time a subject expresses that he/she wants to get treatment for their cocaine use, we will immediately refer him/her to a treatment program. The subject will be withdrawn from the study at that time.</criteria>
