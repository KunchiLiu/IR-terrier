	<brief_summary>This is a monocenter randomized controlled trial comparing two systems of mesh and fixation device for the laparoscopic ventral and incisional hernia repair with respect to pain. It has been designed as a superiority study to proof the concept of previously published mathematical model of front abdominal wall.</brief_summary>
