	<brief_title>Impact of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition Therapy on Sperm Quality of Patients With Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The highest age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for Crohn's Disease (CD) occur during the peak reproductive years. In addition, gastroenterologists frequently advise and manage patients with CD who desire to conceive. Enteral nutrition therapy is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in reproductive age men with CD. However, there is no available data on the effects of enteral nutrition therapy on semen quality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of enteral nutrition therapy on sperm quality of patients with CD.</detailed_description>
