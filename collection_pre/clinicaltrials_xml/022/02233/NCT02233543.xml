	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of COPD (according to GOLD guidelines, updated 2014) with a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70 Patients with a postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥30% and &lt;60% of the predicted normal value Resting daytime oxygen saturation levels measured by pulse oximetry of ≤95% SpO2 Smoking history of at least 10 pack years (Ten packyears are defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years) An exacerbation of COPD (treatment with oral or parenteral antibiotics and/or glucocorticosteroids and/or hospitalization related to COPD) within 4 weeks prior to screening or during the runin period Diagnosed asthma Patients receiving regular long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) Ongoing / planned rehabilitation during the study period Three or more awakenings during the night leading to toilet visit or other reasons for exiting the bed during the last week prior to the screening visit due to nonCOPD reasons Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
