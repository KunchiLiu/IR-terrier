	<brief_summary>Radical prostatectomy is a common and effective treatment for prostate cancer but is associated with urinary incontinence that can persist for several months after surgery and significantly reduce quality of life. Studies have shown that routine performance of pelvic floor exercises after radical prostatectomy can aid in the recovery of urinary control; however, conventional pelvic floor exercises do not produce consistent results. Research indicates that incorporating other deep abdominal muscles can further activate the pelvic floor making it stronger than by activating the pelvic floor alone. Specifically, 'Pfilates' and 'Hypopressives' are two new techniques that combine traditional pelvic floor exercises with activation of supportive muscles. Our proposed study will be the first to test the effect of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program that includes Pfilates and Hypopressives to treat urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Our primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale RCT of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program, including standard pelvic floor exercises, Pfilates, and Hypopressives techniques on urinary incontinence. Feasibility will be determined by measuring recruitment success, retention, outcome capture, and intervention adherence, tolerance, and safety. We hypothesize men under going radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in the advance pelvic floor training program will report greater improvement in urinary incontinence and health-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
