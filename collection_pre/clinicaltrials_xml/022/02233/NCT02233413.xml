	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out if a specialized helmet that provides low levels of near infrared light, also known as low-level light therapy (LLLT) has any effect on the recovery of people who have recently (within 72h) suffered a moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Light Therapy for Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using the LLLT helmet in patients with moderate TBI and to quantify the response to LLLT using magnetic resonance (MR) and clinical outcome measures. We hypothesize that we will be able to quantify the response to LLLT through MR imaging and clinical outcome measures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least 18 years old; Injury within 72 hours at the time of consent; Head injury requiring hospital admission; A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 912 or 1315 with abnormal imaging. Need for emergency neurosurgical intervention (including placement of intracranial pressure monitoring devices or drainage catheters); Hemodynamic instability as determined by the clinician; History of any of the following: (i) brain tumor; (ii) prior TBI occurring within the past year and requiring hospital admission; (iii) a new diagnosis within the past year of either stroke or epilepsy; (iv) an established diagnosis of any of the following neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's, Picks, Parkinson's, Lewy body dementia, Huntington's, amytropic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia, vascular dementia, HIZassociated dementia, dementia due to metabolic causes (Addison, Cushing, hypothyroidism, renal failure, prophyrias, Wilson, mitochondrial diseases, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, and dementia of unknown etiology. Pregnancy (all women of childbearing age will need to have a negative pregnancy test prior to the start of the interventional portion of the study); Electrical implants such as cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps; Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants, or any other contraindications to MRI. Clinical determination that subject cannot undergo MRI Breastfeeding Unstable cervical fractures Scalp lacerations or surgical wounds severe enough to preclude safe application of device Unreliable to follow up</criteria>
