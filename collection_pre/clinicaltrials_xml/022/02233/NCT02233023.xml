	<criteria>Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease Patients treated consecutively with either pramipexole or bromocriptine (or other dopamine agonists except ropinirole) for at least two and a half years (i.e. 30 months). Interruptions of ongoing dopamine agonists treatment for less than one month per year duration are acceptable, however, interruptions within the last 6 months are not acceptable. Patients currently participating in ongoing openlabel extension trials with pramipexole may be included if they meet the requirement of 30 month treatment Written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation Patients who have been treated less than two and a half years (i.e. 30 months) with their actual dopamine agonist (regardless of the duration of treatment with a previous dopamine agonist) Patient treated with ropinirole Patients with any of the following: Patients with a hereditary retinal disease and/or a family history of hereditary retinal disease Patients with a history of druginduced retinopathies Patients with a history of surgically or lasertreated diabetic retinopathy Patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes due to drugs, metabolic disorders, encephalitis or degenerative diseases (e.g. progressive, supranuclear palsy, multisystem atrophy) Dementia or other disorders that could impair the signing of informed consent Patients who are participating in other drug studies or who receive other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to the first visit (patients currently participating in ongoing openlabel extension trials with pramipexole may be included if they meet the requirement of 30 months treatment duration</criteria>
