	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot complications are a common and costly problem. Excessive plantar pressures due to foot deformities and/or limited ankle dorsiflexion, especially in the presence of peripheral neuropathy, can predispose subjects with diabetes for diabetic foot ulcers. Achilles tendon lengthening surgery has shown to delay or prevent recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers. Studies have shown that Shockwave Therapy (EPAT - Extracorporeal Pulse Activation Technology) was effective in treating subjects with chronic heel pain and Achilles tendonitis with no serious side effects. EPAT, therefore, may allow diabetic patients with ankle equinus to perform more effective stretching exercises and may prevent recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers. The purposed of this RCT is to compare effectiveness of manual manipulation with EPAT versus manual manipulation alone on ankle dorsiflexion and dynamic plantar pressure in at-risk subjects with a history of diabetic foot ulcer.</brief_summary>
