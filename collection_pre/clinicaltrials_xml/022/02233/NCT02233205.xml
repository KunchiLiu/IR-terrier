	<brief_title>Safety Study of Combining Ultrasound Microbubbles and Chemotherapy to Treat Malignant Neoplasms of Digestive System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasonic sonoporation can increase the release of chemotherapeutics, thus increasing the therapeutic effects. 1. Main purpose 1. To identify the safety of combining ultrasonic microbubbles and chemotherapeutics to treat malignant neoplasms of hepatic metastases from alimentary system and pancreatic carcinoma. 2. To explore the largest mechanical index and ultrasonic treatment time which patients can endure. 2. Secondary purpose 1. To observe tumor clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD). 2. To evaluate the preliminary effect,such as time to failure(TTF), time to death(TTD)</detailed_description>
