	<brief_summary>Conflicting guideline recommendations for screening colonoscopy result due to scant data upon which to develop appropriate recommendations. No previous study has compared the prevalence of advanced adenomas or adenomas (any size) among 40-49 year old individuals with a first degree relative (FDR) with colorectal cancer (CRC) versus 40-49 year old average risk individuals with no family history of CRC. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of colon adenomas in 40-49 year old individuals and identify risk factors associated with the presence of advanced adenomas. This data will provide evidence to determine appropriate colon cancer screening guidelines in 40-49 year old persons with a family history of colon polyps or colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
