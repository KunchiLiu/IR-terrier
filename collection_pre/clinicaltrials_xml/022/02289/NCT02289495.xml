	<brief_summary>The proposed study, 200207 is a double blind, placebo controlled, single and repeat dose escalation study to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK of GSK2838232 alone and when co-administered with RTV 100 milligram (mg) Once daily (QD). This study will enable future clinical development of GSK2838232 in healthy subjects and in a Phase IIa proof of concept study in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients. This study is a single and repeat dose escalation study and will be conducted as two Parts. Part A will evaluate GSK2838232 20 mg and 50 mg administered QD for 8 days and Part B will evaluate GSK2838232 10 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg, co-administered with RTV 100 mg, QD for 11 days. The extended period of dosing is to account for the longer terminal phase half-life of GSK2838232 when given with RTV. Dose cohorts will be enrolled sequentially; enrollment into a cohort will commence following review of interim PK and safety data from at least 4 subjects in the preceding cohort. Subjects in both parts will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to first dose and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose. Maximum duration of study participation will be approximately 7 weeks. Approximately 40 healthy subjects will be enrolled, 8 subjects/cohort. Subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive GSK2838232 or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;80 millilitre per minute (mL/min) as determined by CockcroftGault equation where age is in years, weight (Wt) is in kg, and serum creatinine (Scr) is in units of milligram / decilitre (mg/dL); CLcr (mL/min) = (140 age) * Wt / (72 * Scr) (times 0.85 if female). Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg [110 pounds {lbs}]) for men and &gt;= 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.531.0 kilogram per meter square kg/m^2 (inclusive) Male or Female; Female subject of nonreproductive potential : is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until one week after the last dose of study medication. a) Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia, b) Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label, Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.
