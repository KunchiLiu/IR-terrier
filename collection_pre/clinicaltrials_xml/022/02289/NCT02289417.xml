	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Apremilast to Treat Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of apremilast in subjects with active UC (defined as a total Mayo score [TMS] of ≥ 6 to ≤ 11, with an endoscopic subscore ≥ 2). Treatment assignment will be stratified based on concomitant use of oral corticosteroids and previous exposure to immunosuppressants (eg, 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], azathioprine [AZA], or methotrexate [MTX]).The number of subjects with previous exposure to immunosuppressants is targeted to comprise no more than 50% of the subjects enrolled, and no less than 30%. Approximately 165 subjects (55 subjects per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive oral apremilast (30 mg BID or 40 mg BID), or identically appearing placebo BID for up to 12 weeks (Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase), followed by 40 weeks of blinded active treatment with apremilast, either 30 mg BID or 40 mg BID (Blinded Active-treatment Phase). At the end of 52 weeks in the study, subjects who have a Mayo endoscopy score ≤ 1 will have the opportunity to participate in the Extension Phase and will continue to receive blinded, active treatment with apremilast for an additional 52 weeks. All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study for any reason will spend 4 weeks in the Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase, the 4-week period after following the last dose of investigational product (study treatment).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: Male or female aged 18 and over at the time of signing the informed consent. Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form prior to any study related assessments/procedures being conducted. Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. Diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) with a duration of at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit.. Total Mayo Score (TMS) ≥ 6 to ≤ 11 (range: 012) at baseline, prior to randomization in the study. Endoscopic subscore ≥ 2 (range: 03) on the Mayo score prior to randomization in the study. Subjects are required to have a colonoscopy if not performed within 12 months of the Screening Visit. Subjects must have had a therapeutic failure, been intolerant to, or have a contraindication to, at least one of the following: oral aminosalicylates (ie, 5aminosalicylic acid [5ASA] compounds or sulfasalazine [SSZ]), budesonide, systemic corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants (eg, 6mercaptopurine [6MP], azathioprine [AZA], or methotrexate [MTX]). Subjects receiving oral corticosteroids may continue their use during the study, provided that the dose (prednisone ≤ 20 mg/day or equivalent, budesonide ≤ 9 mg/day) has been stable for 3 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. If oral corticosteroids were recently discontinued, discontinuation must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Corticosteroid doses should remain stable until the subject is eligible to start corticosteroids tapering, beginning at the Week 12 Visit. Oral aminosalicylates are permitted during the study, provided that treatment started at least 6 weeks prior to screening with a stable dose of at least 14 days prior to the Screening Visit. The dose of oral aminosalicylates must remain stable through the end of the study. Must meet the following laboratory criteria: White blood cell count ≥ 3000/mm^3 (≥ 3.0 X 10^9/L) and &lt; 14,000/mm^3 (&lt; 14 X 10^9/L) Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 (≥ 100 X 10^9/L) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (≤ 132.6 μmol/L) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) Serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum glutamic :pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ALT (SGPT) 2 X upper limit of normal (ULN). If initial test shows ALT or AST &gt; 2 times the ULN, one repeat test is allowed during the screening period. Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (≤ 34 μmol/L) or albumin &gt; lower limit of normal (LLN). If initial test result is &gt; 2 g/dL, one repeat test is allowed dirng the screening period Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L) Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and the Baseline Visit. While on IP and for at least 28 days after taking the last dose of IP, FCBP who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptives. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on investigational product and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: Diagnosis of Crohn's disease, indeterminate colitis, ischemic colitis, microscopic colitis, radiation colitis or diverticular diseaseassociated colitis. Ulcerative colitis restricted to the distal 15 cm or less (eg, ulcerative proctitis). Subjects who have had surgery as a treatment for UC or who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are likely to require surgery for UC during the study.
