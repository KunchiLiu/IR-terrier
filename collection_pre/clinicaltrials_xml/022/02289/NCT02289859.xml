	<brief_title>Undermining During Cutaneous Wound Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether undermining during cutaneous surgery improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure without undermining. Our aims are to compare outcomes using a split wound model, where half the wound is undermined and the other half is not. This will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument and via wound width. Our hypothesis is that wound undermining will result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.</detailed_description>
