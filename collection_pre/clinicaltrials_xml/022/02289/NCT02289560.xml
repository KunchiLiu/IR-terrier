	<brief_summary>The objective of this prospective, multi site, single-arm study is to capture the efficacy of treatment using the ExAblate Transcranial System and to further demonstrate safety in medication-refractory tremor in patients with essential tremor (ET).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continued Access Protocol: ExAblate Transcranial MR Guided Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Essential Tremors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is evaluating a new technique for performing Thalamotomy for tremor control. While current techniques have possible invasive or radiation effects, the use of ExAblate if totally non-invasive and without any radiation. After informed consent and screening, eligible subjects will be undergo an ExAblate treatment. All subjects will be followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and for up to 5 years as directed by their doctor.</detailed_description>
