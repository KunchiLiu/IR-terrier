	<brief_title>Everyday Practice With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TAVI program in our center started on November 2007. As part of the national policy for quality assurance in medicine a detailed clinical characterization of the TAVI-population was required. Furthermore, a detailed description of the procedure and peri-procedural complications until discharge was required. In our center we designed and are routinely using a TAVI database which fulfills the authority requirements as well as has additional data needed for planning and documentation of TAVI procedure. Since there is already a considerable number of TAVI patients in this database we aim to perform statistical analyses answering different question in this filed.</detailed_description>
