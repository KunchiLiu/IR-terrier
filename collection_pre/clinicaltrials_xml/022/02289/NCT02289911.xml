	<detailed_description>Paramedics were randomized into a classroom group with traditional lectures and a web group that watched narrated lectures online. All participants completed a pre- and post-test, and a second post-test four weeks later. Both groups underwent hands-on training after the first post-test. A control group completed the two initial tests without didactic intervention.</detailed_description>
