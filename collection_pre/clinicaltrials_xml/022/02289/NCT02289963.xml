	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by alirocumab as add-on therapy to stable maximally tolerated daily statin therapy with or without other lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) in comparison with placebo after 24 weeks of treatment in South Korea and Taiwan in high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab in comparison with placebo on LDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment. - To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on other lipid parameters: apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), lipoprotein (a) (Lp [a]), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1). - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab. - To evaluate the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with hypercholesterolemia and established coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents who are not adequately controlled with a maximally tolerated daily dose of statin with or without other LMT, both at stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening visit (Week 3). Exclusion criteria: Aged &lt;18 years or legal age of adulthood, whichever is greater. Patients without established CHD or CHD risk equivalent. LDLC &lt;70 mg/dL (&lt;1.81 mmol/L) in patients with a history of documented cardiovascular disease. LDLC &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.59 mmol/L) in patients without a history of documented cardiovascular disease. Not on a stable dose of LMT (including statin) for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (Week 3) or between screening to randomization visits. Currently taking a statin other than atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin. Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin is not taken daily or not taken at a registered dose. Daily doses above atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg or simvastatin 40 mg. Fasting serum triglycerides &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.52 mmol/L) at the screening period. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
