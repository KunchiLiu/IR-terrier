	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the nervus cutaneous femoral lateralis (NCFL) blockade on postoperative pain after total hip replacement surgery. The NCFL-block is a pure sensory block. We hypothesized that the NCFL-block would reduced the postoperative pain without delaying mobilization.</brief_summary>
