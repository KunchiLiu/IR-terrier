	<brief_summary>Approximately one third of the children and adolescents in the United States are either overweight or obese. Childhood obesity disproportionately affects specific racial and ethnic groups and households with low socioeconomic status and low parental education. The Alternative Learning Center (ALC) within Rochester School District 535 provides viable educational options for students who are experiencing difficulty in regular educational systems. A greater proportion of students at ALC are minorities, qualify for free and reduced lunch and receive special education services. These children are likely to have unique barriers to physical activity and healthy eating. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine the association between BMI and ethnic/ socioeconomic variables and behaviors related to physical activity and eating in ALC students. Aim 2: Develop an age and culturally appropriate on-site program that promotes healthy lifestyle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of a Youth Healthy Living Program With Underserved Adolescents at Rochester Alternative Learning Center</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will assess the relationship between BMI and ethnicity, socioeconomic variables and behaviors related to nutrition and physical activity among 200 ALC students. Investigators will also conduct 6 gender stratified (3 boys, 3 girls) focus groups with students (n=24), up to 3 focus groups with their parents (n=24) and one focus group with staff and volunteers in order to understand perceived barriers towards healthy weight/nutrition/physical activity. Investigators will then utilize this information to co-develop a healthy living program at ALC. Investigators will finally test the feasibility of the program they develop over a period of 3 months in ALC students. Study findings will inform further research to test the efficacy and validity of the program developed at ALC in a subsequent school based trial with the future goal of obtaining funding for cluster randomized controlled trials among other schools in the region.</detailed_description>
