	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the specific properties of a variety of dietary fibres that lead to different postprandial glycemic and satiety responses in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. This is accomplished by utilizing a variety of dietary fibres that demonstrate a wide range of properties in a pudding product, and by examining the ability of each of these to limit gastric emptying, limit glucose absorption, limit insulin secretion, and improve satiety, versus a low fibre control product.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the specific properties of a variety of dietary fibres that lead to different postprandial glycemic and satiety responses in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. This is accomplished by utilizing a variety of dietary fibres that demonstrate a wide range of properties in a pudding product, and by examining the ability of each of these to limit gastric emptying, limit glucose absorption, limit insulin secretion, and improve satiety, versus a low fibre control product. To accomplish this, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover study design will be used, in order to determine the different effects of a variety of fibre-enriched pudding products on markers of type 2 diabetes and satiety response, versus low-fibre control puddings.</detailed_description>
