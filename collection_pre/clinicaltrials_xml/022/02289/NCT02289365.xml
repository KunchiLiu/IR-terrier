	<brief_title>Orally Administrated JBM-TC4 Prevents Acute Radiodermatitis in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in 2 sites in Taiwan. Upon confirmation of meeting all eligibility criteria, will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 2000 mg or 3000 mg JBM-TC4 oral treatment group or to placebo control group. The treatment will start one week prior to radiotherapy and continue through the radiotherapy period for additional 11 weeks of JBM-TC4. The patients will take 3 treatment capsules twice a day, after breakfast and dinner. Screening visit will occur up to 14 days prior to randomization (Day 0), and informed consent form will be signed and patient eligibility criteria will be verified.Medical history information, chemistry/hematology evaluation, serum pregnancy will be conducted and documented. On Day 0, baseline assessment will be done and study drug will be dispensed. The patients will be instructed to start their study medication after breakfast on Day 1 and record the administration time in the study diary. Post-operative radiotherapy will begin for all patients after taking the treatment for 7 days. On Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, 85 and 92, data including radiation dermatitis severity, redness and pain scale will be collected when patients return to the clinic for evaluation. On Days 29, 57, 85 and 92, quality of life questionnaire will be completed by patients and blood will be drawn for chemistry/hematology evaluation. The final study visit will occur one week after the last dose of study medication, which will be around Day 92. ECG will be evaluated on Day 8 and 92. A total of 120 women with breast cancer will be recruited into this study. Safety will be assessed through recording of adverse events, assessment of vital signs, and chemistry/hematology laboratory testing. During each clinic visit, investigator will take down the vital signs of the patients and ask if the patients has experienced any adverse events. All information will be recorded on the case report form. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is to assess the effectiveness of JBM-TC4 for the prevention and treatment of acute radiation-induced dermatitis. The effectiveness will be determined by the recording of the radiation dermatitis severity scale for patients during each weekly study visit. Secondary efficacy endpoint include 1) Presence of moist desquamation and 2) redness at the radiation treated site at any visit. 3)The worst pain related to dermatitis between baseline and follow-up visit at the radiotherapy site. 4) Quality of life and 5) safety evaluation assessment. At the final visit, each investigator will be ask to rate their patients' responses to treatment.</detailed_description>
