	<brief_summary>This study investigates the safety, tolerability and PKs of GSK2838232 with and without Ritonavir, and to evaluate different formulations of GSK2838232 in healthy subjects. This study will evaluate higher single and RTV boosted doses to support continued clinical development of GSK2838232 at clinically relevant doses, and subsequently in those infected with HIV in a dose ranging phase 2 study. The study is conducted in 2 parts: Part A and Part B, study Part A and Part B may be conducted in parallel. Approximately 20 healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study, 8 in Part A and 12 in Part B. Part A is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-period, single dose escalation design. Subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive GSK2838232 or placebo. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo in all four periods. Following completion of Period 2 PK assessments at 96hr post-dose, subjects will begin daily dosing of RTV 100mg for a total of 26 days. Part B is a randomized, open-label, unbalanced, 3-period, cross-over design; subjects will be randomized 1:1 to each sequence. The relative bioavailability of single 100mg doses of powder in a bottle (PIB) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of GSK2838232 versus PIB spray-dried dispersion (SDD) will be assessed. A single dose of GSK2838232 will co-administered on the 10th day of RTV dosing; RTV dosing will continue for an additional 4 days (total of 14 days). Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to first dose and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;80 millilitre per minute (mL/min) as determined by CockcroftGault equation where age is in years, weight (Wt) is in kg, and serum creatinine (Scr) is in units of milligram / decilitre (mg/dL); CLcr (mL/min) = (140 age) * Wt / (72 * Scr) (times 0.85 if female). Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg [110 pounds {lbs}]) for men and &gt;= 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.531.0 kilogram per meter square kg/m^2 (inclusive) Male or Female; Female subject of nonreproductive potential : is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until one week after the last dose of study medication. a) Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia, b) Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label, Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.
