	<brief_title>The Positive Family Support Project - Partnering With Families for a Successful Transition to School</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transition to elementary school is a critical time for the development of key skills that are necessary for school success, including sustained attention, self-regulation, initiating and sustaining successful peer relationships, and academic competence. Parent support at home, such as positive parenting and support for learning, is associated with school readiness indicators that predict successful adaptation to the school context. For many children at risk for poor developmental outcomes this transition can be difficult and may lead to early academic problems, which in turn may define a trajectory that culminates in more severe forms of problem behavior and learning difficulties. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of implementing the Family Check-Up (FCU), a school-based, ecological approach to family intervention, during the transition into elementary school.</detailed_description>
