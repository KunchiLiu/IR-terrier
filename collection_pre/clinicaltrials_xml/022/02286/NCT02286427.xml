	<brief_summary>Skin wounds of Recessive Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica (REBD) involve pain, superinfection, protein-losing, inflammation, and joint contractures are the bed of squamous cell carcinoma. There is no precise data on the kinetics of healing post-bullous erosions but clinical experience suggests that most epidermise in less than a month. Some, however, for unknown reasons, persist for several months. These chronic ulcers (UC), arbitrarily defined for this study as lasting more than three months are a source of major discomfort and could play a decisive role in the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the amniotic membrane on the healing of chronic ulcers REBD on the percentage ulcerated surface re-epithelialised at 12 weeks (M3) from the start of treatment.</brief_summary>
