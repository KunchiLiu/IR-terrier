	<brief_summary>The main objective of the study is evaluation of the safety and tolerability of OpRegen - human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)cells. The study will also include initial exploration of the ability of transplanted OpRegen cells to engraft, survive, and moderate disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of OpRegen for Treatment of Advanced Dry-Form Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OpRegenÂ® is a cell-based product composed of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and administered as a cell suspension in ophthalmic Balanced Salt Solution Plus (BSS Plus). This is a Phase I/IIa, dose-escalation, single-center study, evaluating safety and tolerability of OpRegen transplantation to patients with progressive dry-AMD. The study includes also initial exploration of efficacy. A total of 15 patients will be enrolled. The patients should be 50 years of age and older, with non-neovascular (dry) AMD, who have funduscopic findings of GA in the macula, with absence of additional concomitant ocular disorders. The patients will be divided into four cohorts, according to their best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and administrated OpRegen dose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 50 and older; 2. Diagnosis of dry (nonneovascular) age related macular degeneration in both eyes; 3. Funduscopic findings of dry AMD with progressive geographic atrophy in the macula, above 0.5 disc area (1.25mm^2 and up to 17 mm^2) in size in the study eye and above 0.5 disc area in the fellow eye; 4. Best corrected central visual acuity equal or less than 20/200 in cohorts 13 and equal or less than 20/100 in cohort 4 in the study eye by ETDRS vision testing; 5. Vision in the nonoperated eye must be better than or equal to that in the operated eye; 6. Patients with sufficiently good health to allow participation in all studyrelated procedures and complete the study follow up period (medical records); 7. Ability to undergo a vitreoretinal surgical procedure under monitored anesthesia care; 8. Blood counts, blood chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis without abnormal significance; 9. Negative for HIV, HBC, and HCV, negative for CMV IgM and EBV IgM; 10. Patients with no current or history of malignancy (with the exception of successfully treated basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) based on age matched screening exam (at discretion of the study physician); 11. Willing to defer all future blood and tissue donation; 12. Able to understand and willing to sign informed consent. 1. Evidence of neovascular AMD by history, as well as by clinical exam, fluorescein angiography (FA), or ocular coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline in either eye; 2. History or presence of diabetic retinopathy, vascular occlusions, uveitis, Coat's disease, glaucoma, cataract or media opacity preventing posterior pole visualization or any significant ocular disease other than AMD that has compromised or could compromise vision in the study eye and confound analysis of the primary outcome; 3. History of retinal detachment repair in the study eye; 4. Axial myopia greater than 6 diopters; 5. Cataract Surgery in the study eye in the past 6 weeks and any other ocular surgery in the study eye in the past 3 months 6. History of cognitive impairments or dementia; 7. Contraindication for systemic immunosuppression; 8. History of any condition other than AMD associated with choroidal neovascularization in the study eye (e.g. pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis); 9. Active or history for the following diseases: cancer, renal disease, myocardial infraction in previous 12 months, immunodeficiency; 10. Female; pregnancy or lactation; 11. Current participation in another clinical study. Past participation (within 6 months) in any clinical study of a drug administered systemically or to the eye. 12. Currently receiving aspirin, aspirin containing products and/or any other coagulation modifying drugs which cannot be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery</criteria>
