	<brief_title>Ulthera® System for Treating Axillary Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial. Up to 20 subjects who are naïve to Ultherapy for treatment of hyperhidrosis will be enrolled and treated at a 2.0mm depth at two different treatment densities (Group A and Group B). Group A will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid, 12 treatment squares, 60 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at 0.30 J of energy. Group B will include up to 10 treated subjects. Subjects receiving treatment in a 3 x 4 grid, 12 treatment squares, 40 lines of treatment per square, at one treatment depth (2.0mm), at 0.30 J of energy. Gravimetric sweat production measures and starch iodine tests will be completed at baseline, treatment visit #2, and at all follow-ups for all study groups. Digital images of the starch iodine test will be obtained. Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores will be obtained at baseline, each treatment visit, and at all follow-ups for all study groups.</detailed_description>

Dermal disorder including infection at anticipated treatment sites in either axilla. Previous botulinum toxin treatment of the axilla in the past year. Expected use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of any other disease during the study period. Known allergy to starch powder, iodine, lidocaine, or epinephrine. Secondary hyperhidrosis, for example, hyperhidrosis that is secondary to other underlying diseases including hyperthyroidism, lymphoma and malaria. Previous surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis including sympathectomy, surgical debulking of the sweat glands, subcutaneous tissue curettage and ultrasonic surgery. Unwillingness to wash off deodorants and abstain use 72 hours prior to treatments or assessments. Subjects with a history of a bleeding disorder Active implants (e.g., pacemakers or defibrillators), or metallic implants in the treatment areas.) Use of cholinomimetics, anticholinergics, or any oral herbal medicine treatments for hyperhidrosis. Inability to withhold use of antiperspirants and deodorants, or any other topical treatments for hyperhidrosis within 72 hours prior to study treatments and assessments. Unwillingness for complete shaving or removal of underarm hair within 12 hours prior to study treatments and followup visits. Women who are pregnant, lactating, possibly pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the study period. Inability to understand the protocol or to give informed consent. History of chronic drug or alcohol abuse. History of autoimmune disease. Concurrent therapy that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study device. Subjects who anticipate the need for surgery or overnight hospitalization during the study. Subjects who, in the investigator's opinion, have a history of poor cooperation, noncompliance with medical treatment, or unreliability.
