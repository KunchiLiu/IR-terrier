	<brief_summary>Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is perceived as the optimal method of providing and maintaining a clear and secure airway. The 2010 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines emphasized the importance of minimal interruption during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). These guidelines also suggest that skilled operators should be able to secure the airway without interrupting chest compression. The aim of the study was to compare time and success rates of different available video laryngoscopes and the Miller laryngoscope for emergency intubation during simulated pediatric CPR.</brief_summary>
