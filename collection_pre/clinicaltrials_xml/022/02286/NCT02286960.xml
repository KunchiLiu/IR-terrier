	<brief_summary>Despite the considerable use of oral steroids in the regular management of benign vocal fold lesions there is little evidence base in the literature. This study will investigate the efficacy of oral steroids for the treatment of vocal fold lesions in a controlled manner. The specific aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of of a short course of oral steroids prior to behavioral voice therapy in patients with benign, phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. Enrolled subjects will be randomized using a random numbers table to either receive oral steroids or no steroids prior to the initiation of voice therapy. The therapist and individuals involved in the collection and analysis of data will be blinded as to whether the subject received drug. Prior to initiation of therapy subjects will be asked to return for an interval evaluation during which they undergo videostroboscopy and voice evaluation. Subjects will enter then the voice therapy phase . After an initial evaluation to determine the best mode of therapy they will receive a behavioral voice therapy course, which includes a range of behavioral modifications and motor learning techniques, along with lifestyle measures. In all these phases acoustic and aerodynamic measurements will be collected as well as audio-visual material from the videostroboscopic exams. The investigators hypothesize that oral steroids will lead to a reduction in lesion size, which will substantially aid in the delivery and incorporation of voice therapy techniques, contributing to the improvement of overall laryngeal biomechanics and providing an ideal starting point for behavioral voice therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will investigate the potential added advantage of the use of steroids in patients undergoing voice therapy. Enrolled subjects will be randomized using a random numbers table to either receive oral steroids or no steroids prior to the initiation of voice therapy. The therapist and individuals involved in the collection and analysis of data will be blinded as to whether the subject received drug.

In all these phases acoustic and aerodynamic measurements will be collected as well as audio-visual material from the videostroboscopic exams. The measurements that will be collected in all these phases are the Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10 , the noise to harmonic ratio H/N, the fundamental frequency Fo, The transglottic airflow and subglottic pressure. The investigators hypothesize that oral steroids will lead to a reduction in lesion size, which will substantially aid in the delivery and incorporation of voice therapy techniques, contributing to the improvement of overall laryngeal biomechanics and providing an ideal starting point for behavioral voice therapy.</detailed_description>
