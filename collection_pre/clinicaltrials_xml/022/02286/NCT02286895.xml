	<brief_title>Immune Response to Rotavirus Vaccine After a Supplemental Dose Given at 9 Months of Age With Local EPI Vaccines in Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, individual-randomized, parallel-group, comparative immunogenicity trial. Participating infants randomized to Group A will receive one dose each of measles vaccine (MV), yellow fever vaccine (YFV), and meningitis conjugate vaccine (PsA-TT-5μg) at 9 months of age, and infants randomized to Group B will receive one dose each of MV, YFV, PsA-TT-5μg, and PRV at 9 months of age. The study will simultaneously evaluate two primary objectives, one for noninferiority of the response to MV given with PRV (co-primary objective 1) and one for noninferiority of the response to YFV given with PRV (co-primary objective 2). For evaluation of co-primary objectives, venous blood specimens will be collected immediately prior to receipt of study vaccines and 4 weeks (to plus 1 week) later. Measles immunogenicity will be evaluated by measuring the MV neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates and geometric mean concentration (GMCs) 4 weeks post-vaccination. Yellow fever immunogenicity will be evaluated by measuring the yellow fever serum neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) 4 weeks post-vaccination For the secondary objectives of noninferiority of the response to PsA-TT-5μg given with PRV and superiority of a supplemental dose of PRV, PsA-TT-5μg immunogenicity will be evaluated by measuring the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) seroconversion rates and GMTs 4 weeks post-vaccination. PRV immunogenicity will be evaluated by measuring the anti-rotavirus Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroconversion rates and GMCs 4 weeks post-vaccination. Immediate adverse reactions, solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events, especially intussusception, will be assessed through home visits and study clinic visits on Days 1-5, 7, 28, 56, and 84. As part of safety evaluations, a malaria test will be conducted on Days 0, 28 and 84.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least 9 months of age through 11 months of age (has not yet reached 1st birthday) at the time of administration of study vaccines. Residence in the study area. At least one parent or guardian who is at least 18 years of age and is willing to provide written informed consent. Generally healthy and free of obvious health problems as established by medical history including physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator. A child who is fully vaccinated according to the local EPI schedule (exclusive of oral polio vaccine birth dose). A parent or guardian is willing to attend all planned study visits or allow home visits and mobile phone contacts, as required by the protocol. Previous receipt any measlescontaining vaccine. Previous receipt of any yellow fever vaccine. Previous receipt of any meningitis vaccine. Receipt of rotavirus vaccine within the past 90 days. Administration of any other vaccine within 8 weeks prior to administration of study vaccines or planned vaccination during the 4 weeks after study vaccination. History of allergic disease or known hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines and/or following administration of vaccines included in the local program of immunization Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug within 90 days prior to the administration of study vaccines. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 90 days prior to the administration of study vaccines or planned administration during the vaccine period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying agents since birth (including systemic corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or equivalent, ≥0.5 mg/kg/day; topical steroids including inhaled steroids are allowed). A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of intussusception. Uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusception. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal functional abnormality, as determined by medical history or physical examination, which in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the study objectives. Acute illness at the time of enrollment (acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with fever [axillary temperature ≥38°C] or without fever [severity determined at the discretion of the investigator]. Acute illness is a temporary exclusion. Any condition or criterion that in the opinion of the investigator might compromise the wellbeing of the subject or the compliance with study procedures or interfere with the outcome of the study.</criteria>
