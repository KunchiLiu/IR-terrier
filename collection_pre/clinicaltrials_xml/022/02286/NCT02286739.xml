	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are twofold: 1) Evaluate how intra-operative sensing may assist the surgeon with tibiofemoral rotational alignment by testing the precision and variability of setting tray rotation to the mid-third of the tibial tubercle. 2) Understand if patients with a combined axial rotation couple at the tibiofemoral joint and quantitative intercompartmental balance, achieved with the use of VERASENSE, exhibit less post-operative knee pain and improved clinical outcomes. Radiographic outcomes will also be assessed to measure post-operative alignment and to evaluate the prevalence and location of radiolucency and/or osteolysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Clinical Study Evaluating Tibiofemoral Rotational Alignment Using Intraoperative Sensing During TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: TKA with VERASENSE results in a more reliable and precise option for establishing implant-to-implant congruency and joint balance leading to less knee pain, faster return to normal activities and higher patient satisfaction compared to TKA without VERASENSE.</detailed_description>
