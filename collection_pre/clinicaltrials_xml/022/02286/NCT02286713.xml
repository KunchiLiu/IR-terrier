	<brief_title>PCORI-CER-1306-03385 Informed Decisions About Lung Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is second phase of a larger project funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to help heavy smokers make informed decisions about lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The aim of this phase is to compare outcomes for promoting informed screening decisions about lung cancer screening in a randomized trial of patients who smoke recruited through state-based smoking cessation quitlines, where patients will be randomly assigned to the updated patient decision aid or to standard educational materials on lung cancer screening.</detailed_description>
