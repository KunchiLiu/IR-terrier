	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to test the ability of Transluminal Flow Encoding (TAFE) to evaluate vessel specific ischemia in patients with a clinical indication for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements for suspected coronary disease. TAFE is a novel method that derives coronary blood flow from easily obtainable non-invasive coronary CT angiograms. Participants will undergo a rest coronary CTA, a regadenoson stress CT, and a clinically indicated invasive coronary angiogram. The study aims to determine the accuracy of TAFE compared to invasive fractional flow reserve. We hypothesize that TAFE-derived coronary blood flow, coronary flow reserve, and myocardial CT perfusion imaging can accurately diagnose an abnormal FFR (&lt;0.80) measured in vessels in patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography.</detailed_description>
