	<brief_summary>Trauma victims had to be intubated at the scene of area in different conditions. Face-to-face intubation in an entrapped patient is one of these situations. The investigators want to compare the efficacy of Glidescope, Airtraq and Fastrach in simulating face-ro-face intubation in adult patients aged between 18-60 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Face-to-face Tracheal Intubation: a Comparison of Airtraq, Glidescope and Fastrach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators record the demographic and the airway data of the patients (thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mallampati score, mandibula protrusions, interincisor distance..etc). The hemodynamic data of the patients baseline preoperatively, after induction, after insertion of the device, after intubation, and 2 minutes intervals after intubation during the ten minutes. Cormack-Lehane grade of the videolaryngoscopes, insertion time, intubation time, need of optimisation maneuvers, mucosal damage, teeth and tongue damage, postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, dysphagia were recorded.</detailed_description>
