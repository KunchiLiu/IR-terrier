	<brief_summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting is one of most common complications after general anesthesia. Female sex, history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, motion sickness, non smoker status, opioid administration are known as risk factors for developing postoperative nausea and vomiting. It has been suggest that antagonism of residual neuromuscular block with a mixture of neostigmine and atropine at the end of the surgery increases the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Sugammadex is a very safe drug with almost no serious adverse effects. The known adverse effects include slight coughing, movement, an altered taste sensation in the mouth, transient prolongation of the QT interval, hypersensitivity, and a short term prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time. The aim of this study was to compare the sugammadex versus neostigmine plus atropine for reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in terms of incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.</brief_summary>
