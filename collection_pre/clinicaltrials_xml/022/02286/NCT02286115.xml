	<brief_title>Life-Stress Interview for Women With Chronic Urogenital Pain Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will compare an interview condition to a wait-list control condition. The investigators hypothesize that helping individuals identify the links between their stress, emotions, and physical symptoms will likely increase their awareness and endorsement of the link between stress and physical symptoms, including a willingness to engage in stress management techniques. It is also expected that helping raise an individual's awareness about their symptoms, followed by an experience and expression of unexpressed emotion is likely to influence their physical and psychological well-being.</detailed_description>
