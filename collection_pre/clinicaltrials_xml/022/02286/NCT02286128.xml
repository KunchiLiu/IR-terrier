	<brief_summary>This study determines whether NF-кB dependent proinflammatory state found in type 2 diabetes yield to a higher RAGE activation in the mesenchymal stem cell, as well as the effects of the proinflammation on osteoblast differentiation impairment and cellular apoptosis in type 2 diabetic patients. This study will compare non-diabetic control subjects and type 2 diabetic patients with metformin monotherapy failure in the aspect of 1) serum markers for NF-кB dependent proinflammatory state and its intracellular signals, 2) osteogenic differentiation and apoptosis of the mesenchymal stem cells, and 3) serum AGE, RAGE and cellular RAGE activation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of NF-кB Dependent Proinflammation on Osteogenic Differentiation of the Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to explore whether proinflammation in type 2 diabetes is an mechanism underlined higher RAGE activation and osteoblast differentiation defect demonstrated in the MSC of type 2 diabetes, as well as the effects of the proinflammation on cellular differentiation and apoptosis of the MSC. Type 2 diabetes was known to be in proinflammatory state due to NF-кB-dependent cytokine secretion (for example, TNF-α, IL1 and IL6), which in turn contribute to NF-кB upregulation. Because RAGE expression is partly regulated by NF-кB signal, the NF-кB upregulation in proinflammatory state observed in type 2 diabetes may entail RAGE overactivation in this population. Therefore, the proinflammatory state and its correlation to cellular NF-кB-dependent RAGE activation is noteworthy to be determined in the MSC of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the effect of proinflammation on differentiation potential and apoptosis of the MSC in type 2 diabetes remains to be elucidated.</detailed_description>
