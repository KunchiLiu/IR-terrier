	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain is a common condition that can negatively impact quality of life and that lacks highly effective treatment options. The YMCA developed different iterations of a stretching exercise program as a community based treatment for low back pain from 1974-2004. Though anecdotally successful, the YMCA stretching exercise program(s) was not scientifically evaluated for efficacy and became obsolete. The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of a previously popular YMCA stretching exercise program(s) for back pain. The stretching exercise program that will be studied is a collection of all the resources available for the YMCA stretching exercise program(s). The most recent criteria from a National Institutes of Health sponsored Task Force to study chronic low back pain were applied to this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Low Back Pain Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will employ a two arm parallel group stratified controlled trial. A total of 60 subjects from 18 through 64 years old with low back pain on at least half the days over the previous 6 months will be recruited by the Wilton Family YMCA to participate in the study. The participants within each recruitment cohort will be randomized by a sub-investigator who is a statistician to the two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1 (stretching exercise experimental arm: self-care book active comparator arm). Three cohorts of 10 subjects will receive the intervention stretching exercise program at the Wilton Family YMCA from January 2015 to October 2015. The stretching exercise program consists of 12 standardized weekly stretching exercise sessions that incrementally increase in duration from 15-30 minutes. Participants who receive the stretching exercise intervention will be asked to practice the identical stretches that they did in class on non-class days and will be given handouts and a companion CD to assist in this. Thirty control subjects will receive a self-care book. All analyses will be conducted assuming intent-to-treat principles using SAS statistical software. All P values and 95% CIs will be 2-sided with statistical significance at the P = 0.05 value.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults from 18 through 64 years old who have had low back pain on at least half the days over the previous 6 months We will exclude persons whose back pain is attributed to systemic or specific disease such as known cancer, spinal infection, fracture, or ankylosing spondylitis. Patients with complex conditions will not participate in the study (eg, sciatica, medicolegal issues, or a previous back surgery). We will also exclude persons who do not speak English. Finally, persons who are unable to attend classes or unwilling to do home practice will be excluded.</criteria>
