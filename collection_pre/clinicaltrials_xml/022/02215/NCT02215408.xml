	<brief_title>MEDication Focused Outpatient Care for Underutilization of Secondary Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will conduct a multicenter, cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized CVRS for medical offices with large geographic, racial and ethnic diversity to determine the extent to which the CVRS model will be implemented. Twenty primary care offices (see Appendix I) were randomized to either the CVRS arm or a usual care arm, and 18 continue in the study. Each clinic will enroll 20-25 patients per office for a total of 400 subjects, of which 240 will be from racial minorities. Subjects in the intervention arm clinic will have regular contact by phone, email or text with a CVRS clinical pharmacist housed at the University of Iowa. The pharmacist will communicate with the subject, with the site clinical pharmacist and, as need, with the site provider to optimize both the subject's pharmaceutical regimen and lifestyle behaviors. The CVRS intervention will last for 12 months. A complex algorithm will be used to calculate the degree to which the subject's care and medical regimen follows national guidelines for reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular risk.</detailed_description>
