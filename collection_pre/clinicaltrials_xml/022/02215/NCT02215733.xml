	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to assess whether angiotensin blockers (ARBs) and telmisartan in particular, are associated with an increased overall risk of the four most common cancers, namely, lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. A secondary objective was to explore these effects separately for each of the four cancers and in combination with angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs).</brief_summary>
