	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has gained increasing attention in American society as it is now considered the "signature injury" of the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) campaigns. The chronic changes that often occur in the wake of TBI along with possible physical injuries may run a chronic, unremitting course, imposing great strain and distress upon family members who often assume a caregiver role with little preparation and no formal training for these wounded service members as they reintegrate back into civilian life post-deployment. Unfortunately, research has not adequately addressed the unique long-term needs of informal military caregivers of deployed service members with TBI (i.e., family members/close friends).</detailed_description>
