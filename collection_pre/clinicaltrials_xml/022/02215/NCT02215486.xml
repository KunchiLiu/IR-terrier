	<brief_summary>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) unconsciously regulates the activities of vital organ systems such as the respiratory, circulatory, and urinary systems. It consists of two major components, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which together are in charge of keeping our body in homeostasis. Homeostasis is the state of chemical and metabolic balance within an organism; it is disturbed in situations of uncontrolled stress. Massage has been shown to decrease SNS and stimulate PNS; but most studies focused on full body massage, with limited assessment of ANS function, and lacked control groups. The effects of head massage therapy (HMT) on regulating the activity of the ANS have not been studied before. In this pilot study, we propose that by randomizing 10 participants to sessions of HMT and 'Simple Relaxation' (no HMT), and by using a non-invasive method of measuring the ANS activity (spectral analysis of Heart Rate Variability [HRV] as well as Pre-ejection Period (PEP)), we will be able to investigate the effects of 10 minutes of HMT in comparison with the period of no HMT administered. We expect HMT to reduce stress, with a better and balanced profile of autonomic nervous system after receiving massage.</brief_summary>
