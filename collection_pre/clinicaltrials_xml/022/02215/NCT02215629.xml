	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of VS-4718 in two types of leukemia patients and to find the right dose of VS-4718 for future clinical trials. Other purposes of this study include: - Testing for study drug VS-4718 levels in blood over time and what happens to the study drug in patients. - To find out if there are certain biomarkers in leukemia patients that predict if and how 4718 study drug may or may not work.</brief_summary>
