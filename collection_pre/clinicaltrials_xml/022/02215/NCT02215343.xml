	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to investigate in detail how a high-(prebiotic)fibre diet and a high-PUFA diet affect the gut microbiota composition in a metabolic challenged population, and if the diet-induced modulation of the gut microbiota mediates changes in metabolic risk markers. Intake of both experimental diets over 4 weeks are expected to induce beneficial changes in the gut microbiota composition and to affect markers for insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism and inflammation. The investigators hypothesize that the effect of both interventions on the metabolic risk markers will be partly mediated by the diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota composition.</brief_summary>
