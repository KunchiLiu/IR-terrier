	<brief_title>Study of Autologous Tumor Lysate-pulsed D-CIK Combined With Chemotherapy for Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 patients with stage Ⅰ～Ⅲ Gastric Cancer,who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue,will be randomly divided into group A（receive Ag-D-CIK treatment and chemotherapy) or group B（just receive chemotherapy),and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of Ag-D-CIK treatment (every 1 months) and 4 cycles of chemotherapy (every 2 weeks).Patients in group B will receive only 4 cycles chemotherapy（every 2 weeks).</detailed_description>
