	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Test the walking functionality of people following Acquired brain injury (ABI) 2. Suggesting a new treatment for their walking impairments 3. Follow-up of motor learning ability and balance after intervention within this population The investigators intend to target dynamic stability and gait after ABI, in a group of individuals with ABI who have persistent balance and mobility deficits despite being able to walk independently and having high scores on standard clinical balance measures. Interventions: Training with Re-Step system shoes. In this study there is no control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-Step: Dynamic Balance Treatment of Gait for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Victims</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design: Type of research: Prospective, exploratory, clinical, interventional trial Specific objectives are: To explore the efficacy of Re-step rehabilitation technology to improve dynamic balance in gait of people after Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). The investigators suggest a new technology of intervention that will induce unexpected changes of underfoot slopes, with Re-Step shoes, during walking and will force the central nervous system (CNS) to react and solve walking problems in real time. The investigators propose that the new approach will have a significantly motor function improvement on balance in gait, transferred to real environmental settings and be retained for long periods of time. Research methods: Subjects: A total of 60 subjects of ABI victims will be studied in one treatment group-Re-Step shoes walking training Time flow protocol: Telephone calls to patients of rehabilitation clinics and call for participation in the papers Recruiting subjects according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, after medical examination and consent of subjects Tests and measures (see outcome measures) will be applied to measure changes - TO - before starting the intervention to form a base line - T1 - after 20 sessions of intensive treatments 60 min each, 2-3 sessions a week. For each subject 10-12 weeks of treatment. - T2 - 6 months after T1, a period of normal daily schedule of subjects, of no interventions, to check retaining of training results. For each subject 10-12 weeks of treatment. The treatments will start in a week from T0; the T1 will be performed in a week after training was completed; T2 will be performed 6 months (take or leave 2 weeks) after T1. The recruitment and training of participants will go on according to availability of facilities not more than 24 months.</detailed_description>
