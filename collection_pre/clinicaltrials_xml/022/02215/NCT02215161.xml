	<brief_summary>Abiraterone acetate is now considered the standard of care for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the pre-chemotherapy setting. Patients with primary or acquired abiraterone resistance typically have rapidly progressive, refractory disease for which limited treatment options are available. The development of new therapies in mCRPC requires a focus on patients with primary or acquired resistance to abiraterone. Patients with abiraterone-refractory mCRPC have a poor prognosis overall with median survival after progression of disease at approximately 19 months. While chemotherapy is a standard approach in this setting, it is refused by many patients and clinicians due to toxicity concerns. Selinexor is a first in class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) that specifically blocks the karyopherin protein Exportin 1 (XPO1/Exportin 1). XPO1 is a key regulatory protein responsible for the nuclear export leading to functional inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) and is up-regulated 2-4 fold in all cancers studied to date. Selinexor, given orally, has demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in animal models of prostate cancer including inhibition of PC3 driven bone metastasis.The goal of this trial is to evaluate the potential for a progression free survival benefit associated with Selinexor administration in patients with abiraterone-refractory mCRPC. Single agent phase II open label study of Selinexor in patients with mCRPC with prior therapy with standard hormone ablation agents and abiraterone. A maximum of 54 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study, provided the early stopping criteria are not met. The starting dose for all patients will be an oral dose of 65 mg/m2, given twice per week at least 48 hours apart. Tablets for Selinexor oral administration will be supplied in two (2) strengths: 10 and 25 mg of active ingredient per tablet. Dexamethasone will be coadministered at a dose of 2 mg twice daily on the day of dosing and the day after. Patients will be followed for 30 days after completion of treatment or removal from study, or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable treatment related adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of all treatment related adverse events to Grade 2 or lower.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) on GnRH analogues or have had prior orchiectomy. GnRH analogues must be continued while on study. Progressive disease as demonstrated by a rising PSA (at least two determinations) prior to study entry, and/or radiographic evidence of tumor progression in soft tissue according to modified RECIST criteria or identification of new lesions by bone scan (i.e., ≥ 2 new lesions). Primary resistance or acquired resistance (i.e., acquired resistance will be defined as disease progression following a period of response defined as ≥50% decline in PSA within 12 weeks of starting therapy and not otherwise meeting criteria for primary resistance) to any of the following agents/combinations of therapy: Abiraterone acetate. Primary resistance to abiraterone will be defined as: No PSA decline PSA decline less than 50% after 12 weeks of abiraterone therapy PSA progression within 12 weeks of AA treatment (by PCWG2 criteria), after initial response to therapy Objective progression, by RECIST criteria for soft tissue lesions and by modified PCWG2 criteria for bone lesions within 12 weeks of starting abiraterone treatment Unequivocal clinical progression (per the treating provider's discretion) within 12 weeks of starting abiraterone treatment Enzalutamide. Primary resistance to enzalutamide will be defined as: No PSA decline PSA decline less than 50% after 12 weeks of enzalutamide therapy PSA progression within 12 weeks of enzalutamide treatment (by PCWG2 criteria), after initial response to therapy Objective progression, by RECIST criteria for soft tissue lesions and by modified PCWG2 criteria for bone lesions within 12 weeks of starting enzalutamide treatment Unequivocal clinical progression (per the treating provider's discretion) within 12 weeks of starting enzalutamide treatment Combination therapy with abiraterone and enzalutamide. Primary resistance to combination therapy with abiraterone and enzalutamide will be defined as: No PSA decline PSA decline less than 50% after 12 weeks of abiraterone and enzalutamide therapy PSA progression within 12 weeks of abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment (by PCWG2 criteria), after initial response to therapy Objective progression, by RECIST criteria for soft tissue lesions and by modified PCWG2 criteria for bone lesions within 12 weeks of starting abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment Unequivocal clinical progression (per the treating provider's discretion) within 12 weeks of starting abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment Sequenced therapy, including either of the following: Abiraterone acetate followed by enzalutamide Primary resistance will be defined per criteria for abiraterone monotherapy primary resistance, section 3.3.1, item 5a Enzalutamide followed by abiraterone acetate Primary resistance will be defined per criteria for enzalutamide monotherapy primary resistance, section 3.3.1, item 5b Presence of 1 or more bone metastasis.
