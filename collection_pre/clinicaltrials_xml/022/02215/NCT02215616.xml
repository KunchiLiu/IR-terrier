	<mesh_term>Huntington Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Documentation of prior positive genetic testing for HD, or a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic HD Presence of 3649 CAG repeats, inclusive, in the huntingtin gene based on centralized CAG testing during screening. Male or female between 2155 years of age, inclusive, with an onset of HD at or after 18 years of age Women of childbearing potential (women who are not post menopausal or who have undergone surgical sterilization) must practice an acceptable method of birth control for 30 days before taking the study treatment, and 2 acceptable methods of birth control during all study duration and until 30 days after the last dose of treatment was administered. A sum of &gt;5 points on the UHDRS TMS at the screening visit Able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure being performed at the screening visit. Patients with a legal guardian should be consented according to local requirements Willing to provide a blood sample at the screening visit Willing and able to take oral medication and able to comply with the study specific procedures Ambulatory, being able to travel to the study centre, and judged by the investigator as likely to be able to continue to travel for the duration of the study Availability and willingness of a caregiver, informant, or family member to provide input at study visits. A caregiver is recommended to be someone who attends to the patient at least 2 to 3 times per week for at least 3 hours per occasion, and the suitability of the caregiver should be judged by the investigator For patients taking allowed antidepressant medication, the dosing of medication must have been kept constant for at least 30 days before baseline and must be kept constant during the study Additional criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information Use of immunosuppressive agents, or cytotoxic agents, including cyclophosphamide and azatioprine within 12 months prior to screening Previous use of laquinimod Use of moderate/strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 within 2 weeks prior to randomization Use of inducers of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks prior to randomization Pregnant or breastfeeding Subjects with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition that may put the patient at risk when participating in the study or may influence the results of the study or affect the patient's ability to take part in the study, as determined by medical history, physical examinations, ECG, or laboratory tests. Such conditions may include: A major cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, decompensated congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, coronary revascularization) that occurred during the past 6 months prior to randomization Any acute pulmonary disorder A central nervous system (CNS) disorder other than HD that may jeopardize the subject's participation in the study, including such disorders that are demonstrated on the baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (based on local read) A gastrointestinal disorder that may affect the absorption of study medication Renal disease Cirrhotic patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status. Patients will undergo an HIV test at screening per local requirements, if applicable Any malignancies, excluding basal cell carcinoma, in the 5 years prior to randomization Any clinically significant, abnormal, screening laboratory result which in the opinion of the investigator, affects the patients' suitability for the study or puts the patient at risk if he/she enters the study Unsuitable for MRI (e.g, claustrophobia, metal implants) Alcohol and/or drug abuse within the 6 months prior to screening, as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM IV TR) criteria for substance abuse Patients with active suicidal ideation during the past month as measured by a most severe suicide ideation score of 4 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan) or 5 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent) on the baseline screening ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) or subjects who answer "Yes" on any of the 5 CSSRS Suicidal Behavior Items (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts, or behavior) if the attempt or acts were performed within 1 year of screening, or subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, present a serious risk of suicide Patients with known intracranial neoplasms, vascular malformations, or intracranial hemorrhage Known drug hypersensitivity that would preclude administration of laquinimod or placebo, such as hypersensitivity to mannitol, meglumine or sodium stearyl fumarate Swallowing difficulties that would preclude administration of laquinimod or placebo capsules Treatment with any investigational product within 12 weeks of screening or patients planning to participate in another clinical study assessing any investigational product during the study. Patients in noninterventional and/or observational studies will not be excluded from participating in this study Treatment with tetrabenazine within 30 days of the study baseline visit Treatment with antipsychotic medication within 30 days of the study baseline visit Additional criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information</criteria>
