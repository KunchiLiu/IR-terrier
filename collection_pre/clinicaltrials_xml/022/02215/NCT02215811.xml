	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized controlled trial. Patients with viral-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) will be eligible. Ten patients will be enrolled and receive allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC). Ventilator parameters as well as preoperative clinical characteristics and postoperative clinical outcomes will be registered. Routine blood sampling, radiography, and bronchioalveolar lavage will be performed pre- and postoperatively. Spirometry, quality of life assessment, and 6 minute walk test will be performed postoperatively. All available data will be collected prospectively. Follow-up is 12 months. Informed consent will be obtained from relatives to patients meeting the inclusion criteria before the initiation of any study-specific procedures.</brief_summary>
