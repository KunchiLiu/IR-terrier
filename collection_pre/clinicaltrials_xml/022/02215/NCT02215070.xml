	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the drug, Pasireotide, is safe and effective in reducing the gastrointestinal side effects of the drugs received to prepare for allogeneic stem cell transplant. The study will also evaluate if Pasireotide is effective in reducing acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) after transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pasireotide in Prevention of GI Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design will be a non-randomized phase II. Forty patients receiving an ablative preparatory regimen will receive pasireotide subcutaneous (0.9 mg, b.i.d.) one day prior to initiation of the preparatory regimen and continuing for eight days following the completion of the preparatory regimen not to exceed 14 days total dosing. We select matched controls from existing patients who did not take the drug to minimize the time it takes to complete the trial. TBI is fractionated over four days to a total dose of 1200 Gy. Busulfan is used at an equivalent oral dose of 4 mg/kg daily over four days. These two agents are combined with cyclophosphamide to complete the preparatory regimen. GVHD prophylaxis with methotrexate will be on days +1, +3, +6 and +11. G-CSF is not used as part of the standard of care. The study will collect data prior to initiation of the drug, day 7, day 14 and weekly thereafter until day 100, a standard time to measure acute toxicity related to the stem cell transplantation. The total days on therapy will be recorded as well as any SAE that is outside the expected for stem cell transplantation. We will also follow the occurrence of GVHD and infectious complications. Video capsule endoscopy will be performed in a subset of ten study patients on the last day study drug is administered. Patients will be given detailed instructions to prepare for the procedure. An investigator who is blinded to the group allocation of the patients/volunteers separately will review the images obtained from each of the capsule examinations. Images will be examined for evidence of the four following types of abnormalities: reddened/edema/villous blunting, erosion, ulcer and stenosis. Each of these categories will be scored from 0-3 and summed to obtain an overall index that will range from 0 (normal study) to 12 (severely abnormal in all categories). Citrulline assay Measurement of citrulline concentration has been used as a marker for cytotoxic treatment-induced intestinal damage and it is highly reproducible. The citrulline concentration appears to be a quantitative parameter that is independent of the underlying cause for epithelial cell loss and functions well in the post-SCT setting. Five mls of blood will be collected in heparinized tubes on days 0, 7, and 14. Tubes will be centrifuged according to manufacturer's instructions and the plasma will be collected and stored at -80C until shipment to the laboratory performing the assay. Calprotectin assay Calprotectin has been described as another biomarker of GI injury. During radiation-induced inflammation, leucocytes infiltrate the mucosa and increase the level of fecal calprotectin. At least 50 g stool in a will be collected from patients on days 0, 7, and 14. Samples will be stored at -80C until shipment to the laboratory performing the assay. Calprotectin will be measured with an ELISA kit (CALPRO, Oslo, Norway) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</detailed_description>

Histologically confirmed diagnosis for which an allogeneic transplant is utilized. Eligible patients may include the following: High risk ALL in first complete remission, with high risk being defined by the presence of t(4;11) or t(9;22), or those presenting with extreme hyperleukocytosis or failure to achieve a complete remission after standard induction therapy. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in first complete remission. All patients with AML, Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL) or Acute NonLymphocytic Leukemia (ANLL) in second or subsequent remission. Patients with AML, ALL or ANLL in relapse. Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Patients with Lymphoma Meet standard criteria for allogeneic transplant Screening or baseline Fridericia Correction Formula (QTcF) &lt; 470 msec. No active central nervous system (CNS) disease at the time of study enrollment. No uncontrolled (not being treated) infections at the time of cytoreduction or a history of immunodeficiency, including a positive HIV test result. An HIV test will not be required; however, previous medical history will be reviewed. No uncontrolled diabetes at the time of cytoreduction. All patients with diabetes must be optimized on their diabetes regimen prior to initiating pasireotide. If a patient is diabetic: uncontrolled diabetes as defined by HbA1c &gt; 8%* despite adequate therapy No concurrent involvement in any other clinical trial that affects mucositis or GI toxicity. Moderately impaired hepatic function (ChildPugh B) or severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh C) are excluded. No comorbid condition which, in the view of the Principal Investigator, renders the patient at high risk from treatment complications. Known hypersensitivity to somatostatin analogs or any component of the pasireotide LAR or s.c. formulations. Abnormal coagulation (PT or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) elevated by 30% above normal limits). On continuous anticoagulation therapy. Patients who were on anticoagulant therapy must complete a washout period of at least 10 days and have confirmed normal coagulation parameters before study inclusion. History of syncope or family history of idiopathic sudden death. Sustained or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias. Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, cardiac failure, clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia, or highgrade atrioventricular (AV) block. Concomitant disease(s) that could prolong QT such as autonomic neuropathy (caused by diabetes, or Parkinson's disease), HIV, cirrhosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism or cardiac failure. Family history of long QT syndrome. Concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval. No major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 1 month. Patients should have recovered from the treatment and have a good clinical condition before entering the study. Known gallbladder or bile duct disease, symptomatic cholelithiasis, acute or chronic pancreatitis. Use of an investigational drug within 1 month prior to dosing History of noncompliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, or are of childbearing potential (defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant) and not practicing an effective method of contraception/birth control Known malabsorption syndrome, short bowel or chologenic diarrhea not controlled by specific therapeutic means. Not biochemically euthyroid. Patients with known history of hypothyroidism are eligible if they are on adequate and stable replacement thyroid hormone therapy for at least 3 months.
