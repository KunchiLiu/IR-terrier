	<brief_summary>A number of 1330 patients scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a native coronary stenosis suitable for DES implantation and IVUS imaging are openly randomized 1:1 to either IVUS guidance or angiographic guidance groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravascular Ultrasound Guided Drug Eluting Stent Implantation in "All-comers" Coronary Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is prospectively conducted at 6 high-volume PCI centers in China with IVUS expertise. Clinic follow-up are planned in all patients 12 months after implantation of drug eluting stents. Primary endpoint is composite of cardiac death and myocardial infraction. The study is powered for primary endpoint, which are likely to reach significance at the level P &lt; 0.05 even at a follow-up drop-out rate up to 10%.</detailed_description>
