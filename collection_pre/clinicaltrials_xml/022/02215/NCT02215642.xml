	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer incidence is increasing at an alarming rate in China. Recent reports concluded nutrition status and lifestyle factors were associated with colorectal cancer risk, however, the influence of nutrition and lifestyle factors on cancer outcome in colorectal cancer survivors is largely unknown.The investigators will explore the impact of nutrition status, life style, dietary pattern, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement on colorectal cancer outcome. The investigators will recruit approximately 50,000 patients as a prospective study cohort. During follow up, the investigators will explore the association of these factors with disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall survival of patients. The investigators believe that this project will facilitate the establishment of domestic nutrition and lifestyle data of colorectal cancer of China, and the improvement of the quality of clinical management of patients with colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutrition and Lifestyle Study Cohort of Colorectal Cancer in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Colorectal cancer incidence is increasing at an alarming rate in China. Recent studies reported that nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement were associated cancer risk. Yet, the influence of nutrition and lifestyle factors on colorectal cancer outcome (i.e. recurrence and survival) in colorectal cancer survivors is largely unknown. And there is currently no large cohort studies investigated the impact of these factors on colorectal cancer outcomes in China. Objectives - Our study aims to evaluate the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement on colorectal cancer outcome (disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall survival). Settings and methods - The study will recruit approximately 50,000 participants with colorectal cancer from 12 public hospitals in China after informed consent. Appropriate questionnaires will be utilized to evaluate nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement. The association of disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall survival with these factors will be evaluated. Impact - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large cohort, systematically investigation of the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors on colorectal cancer outcome. When complete, our investigation would supply a systematical and precise understanding of the impact nutrition status and lifestyle factors on cancer out come in China.</detailed_description>
