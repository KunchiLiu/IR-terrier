	<brief_summary>Cetuximab is an EGFR inhibitor that has shown efficacy alone or in combination in colorectal cancer or head and neck cancer in several phase II/III studies. Temsirolimus is a new mTOR inhibitor that has shown interesting results in several Phase I/II studies in advance kidney cancer of bad prognosis. Study hypothesis is that combination of those two compounds and the inhibition of two pathways at the same time will have more efficiency on tumoral growth than the inhibition of those pathways in isolation.</brief_summary>
