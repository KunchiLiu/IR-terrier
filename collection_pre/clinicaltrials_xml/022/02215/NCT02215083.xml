	<brief_title>L-glutamine Supplementation to Alleviate Symptoms of Taxane-Induced Neuropathy in Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>L-glutamine has previously been shown to help reduce the incidence of numbness and tingling in patients with breast cancer who are receiving taxane chemotherapies. However, no study to date looks at the effect of l-glutamine given after this numbness and tingling (called 'perihperhal neuropathy') has already occurred. We hypothesize that administration of this amino acid in l-glutamine naïve patients will result in a measureable reduction of their taxane-induced neuropathy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the breast Received at least one prior taxanecontaining chemotherapy regimen which resulted in persistent taxaneinduced peripheral neuropathy Anticipated survival of at least 6 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) = 0, 1, or 2 The patient must have screening laboratory: Transaminases&lt;2.5 x upper limit of normal; total bilirubin &lt;2.0; creatinine &lt;1.5 Neuropathy onset from taxane administration no more than 18 months from date enrolled in trial Willingness to adhere to supplemental regimen of lglutamine 10,000mg taken orally twice daily, with one potential dose escalation to 10,000mg taken orally three times daily. Grade IIII sensory peripheral neuropathy related to prior taxane use as assessed by their treating oncologist at Eastern Regional Medical Center Able to give informed consent for protocol participation Participants are not able to understand or provide written informed consent. The research team deems that the participant may not be able to follow the study protocol. Current diagnosis of bipolar disorder or other manic state Prior use of lglutamine for prevention or empirical treatment of taxaneinduced sensory peripheral neuropathy Prior treatment with a platinum chemotherapy Concurrent use of physical therapy interventions such as the 'Rebuilder', chiropractic care, acupuncture, or other modalities specifically targeting peripheral neuropathy Concomitant use of nutraceutical supplements which may mitigate symptoms of taxaneinduced peripheral neuropathy including BComplex vitamins, alphalipoic acid, vitamin E, acetyllcarnitine, intramuscular B12 injections, fish oil, etc… during study Renal insufficiency : serum creatinine of &gt;1.5 mg /dl Hepatic insufficiency: transaminases &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal due to isolated reports of possible hepatic encephalopathy New prescription or dose adjustment of current medication for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy such as gabapentin or Lyrica within the past 30 days. Preexisting sensory peripheral neuropathy from other comorbid conditions such as diabetes or alcoholism Current serious infection or other serious medical condition Currently active second malignancy other than nonmelanatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Pregnant or lactating female (premenopausal females will undergo pregnancy test prior to administration of protocol drugs throughout treatment cycles during this study) Acetaminophen use exceeding 2 g per day—includes use of acetaminophencontaining pain medications such as Percocet.</criteria>
