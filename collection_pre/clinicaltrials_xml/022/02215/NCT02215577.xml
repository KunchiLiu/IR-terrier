	<brief_summary>Study Title Comparison of two different models of liver growth stimulation in advanced colorectal liver metastatic disease, (LIGRO Trial) enabling liver resection Methodology Scandinavian Multiple Center Randomized Registry Based Clinical Trial Study duration The planned duration of study participation for an individual subject from inclusion to follow-up are 3 years Primary investigator: Per Sandstrom (Link√∂ping) Number of subjects 100 patients randomized in a 1:1 randomization Diagnosis and main inclusion criteria Patients with colorectal liver metastasis requiring liver resection, but are not resectable in one step because of a future liver remnant/standardized total liver volume of &lt; 30 % extrahepatic metastatic disease is not an exclusion criteria if they can be addressed surgically in the future Overall goal To evaluate if the ALPPS approach is superior to PVE in enabling patients, primarily unresectable due to inadequate FLR, to be resected and reach an R0 situation with an acceptable level of complications and perioperative mortality. To evaluate if the ALPPS approach increases the growth rate of the liver compared to portal embolization or portal ligation leading to a shorter treatment period. In addition the investigators aim to study if ALPPS may reach these goals without detectable or improved differences in tumor activity (PFS and OS), but with a shorter recovery and a higher proportion of patients reaching R0. Hypothesis A higher proportion of patients can be resected with ALPPS counted as rate resected compared to the previously established methods with portal ligation or embolization. This increased resection rate will not reduce the R0 rate, or increase the rate of Clavien grade 4 complication or higher (H0). The ALPPS approach will increase the growth rate compared to portal embolization/ligation measured one week after the primary intervention.</brief_summary>
