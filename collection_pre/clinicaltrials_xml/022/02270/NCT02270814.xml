	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at the effect of a treatment regimen called CACTUX on head and neck cancer. The CACTUX regimen is a combination of three drugs called cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and cetuximab (although carboplatin may be given in place of cisplatin if participants have previously had problems receiving cisplatin). The use of nab-paclitaxel in this combination is different from routine care, in which a drug called 5FU is often given instead, but the investigators group has conducted previous research where the investigators incorporated nab-paclitaxel into routine treatment with cisplatin, 5FU, and cetuximab. The investigators are looking at the incidence of side effects with the CACTUX regimen as well as response of the disease and health status.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed incurable HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, and/or Level 13 neck node with nonskin SCC and unknown primary. "Incurable" is defined as metastatic disease or a local or regional recurrence in a previously irradiated site that is unresectable (or patient declines resection). Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by chest xray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam per RECIST 1.1. At least 18 years of age. ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x IULN, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis Creatinine at or below IULN (males 0.71.30 mg/dl; females 0.61.10 mg/dl) OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal At least 4 months since completion of curative therapy, if given previously. Availability of diagnostic tumor tissue specimens for correlative studies. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completing treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Prior systemic therapy for incurable disease. Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy at screening. A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or synchronous H&amp;N primaries. Currently receiving any other investigational agents. Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cisplatin, nabpaclitaxel, or other agents used in the study. Previous grade 1 or 2 allergic reaction to cetuximab is permissible. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of start of study treatment. Known HIVpositivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study drugs. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.</criteria>
