	<brief_summary>The objective of this non-therapeutic experiment is to develop a method to isolate inflammatory cells from skin biopsies as well as a method to evaluate the expression of genes in those cells that are involved in inflammation. It could eventually be used to better understand the following conditions: atopic dermatitis, acne rosacea and acne vulgaris. It can also be used to better understand how various medications work in patients with atopic dermatitis, acne rosacea and acne vulgaris. Up to 15 healthy volunteers, 15 subjects with atopic dermatitis, 15 subjects with acne rosacea and up to 15 subjects with acne vulgaris will be selected. For healthy volunteers and subjects with atopic dermatitis, a maximum of four (4) skin biopsies (2-4 mm) per subject will be taken. For subjects with acne rosacea and acne vulgaris, a maximum of two (2) skin biopsies (3 mm) per subject will be collected. Biopsies will be performed on either the trunk or the limbs, excluding the hands and the feet. The biopsies will be used to develop a method to isolate inflammatory cells from the skin. Various protocols will be tested to find the best method. No medication will be given to you for this experiment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Innovaderm, in collaboration with "The Immunoregulation laboratories of CRCHUM" and "McGill University division of dermatology", recently developed a novel 6-hour method to study IL-17A (Interleukin) and IL-22 from fresh biopsies of psoriatic patients. This reproducible experimental approach combines enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation for skin cell isolation. This is followed by a multi-color flow cytometry analysis in the absence of in vitro expansion and re-stimulation. Using this method, we examined the cellular source of IL-17A and IL-22 on a small number (20x10Â³) of viable CD45+ (Cluster of Differentiation Antigen 45) cells that are freshly isolated from 4 mm punch skin biopsies (n=22 patients with psoriasis). The method was used for the study on "Persistence of IL-17A+ T lymphocytes and IL-17A expression in psoriatic plaques refractory to ustekinumab therapy" presented during the 72nd annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in Denver. A detailed presentation of this method will be done during the upcoming annual meeting of the Society for Investigative Dermatology in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We would like to investigate and adapt this method for other dermatological conditions such as Atopic Dermatitis, Acne Rosacea and Acne Vulgaris.</detailed_description>
