	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle weakness results with decreased exercise capacity, worse fatigue, dyspnea and quality of life in patients with sarcoidosis. However, no study investigated the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT), therefore effects of IMT on outcomes in patients with sarcoidosis were investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training in Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were diagnosed with sarcoidosis according to the criteria of the latest American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous (WASOG) Disorders statement on sarcoidosis. Primary outcome measurement was respiratory muscle strength, secondary outcomes were, exercise capacity quality of life, fatigue and depression.</detailed_description>
