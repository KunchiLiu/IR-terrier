	<brief_title>The Effect of Human Albumin on Coagulation Competence and Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>5% Human Albumin is used for fluid therapy during surgery. This study evaluate whether affected coagulation competence induced by Human Albumin leads to a significant perioperative blood loss when compared to administration of lactated Ringer´s solution. Data are gathered by the investigators, analysed by the sponsor, and remain confidential throughout the process. The investigators shall be involved in all stages of the study development and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data. No third part shall influence the protocol, trial conduct, data analysis, or reporting. The investigators will include 40 patients undergoing cystectomy. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output are measured after induction of anaesthesia and insertion of the arterial catheter (T0), after establishing normovolaemia but before surgery (T1), after resection of the urinary bladder (T2), at the end of the surgery (T3), and two hours thereafter in the recovery room (T4). Arterial blood is drawn for whole blood viscoelastic haemostatic assays to record clot initiation (R-Time), formation (Maximal Amplitude, MA), alpha angle(α) and lysis (Ly30) depicting haemostatic competence (thrombelastography). The investigators analyze blood for haemoglobin, creatinine, platelets, and fibrinogen. Furthermore, blood is drawn from the central venous catheter for lactate and blood gas variables (ABL 825, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). To avoid excessive administration of Human Albumin, patients receive lactated Ringer´s solution if considered needed after the infusion 25 mL/kg of the allocated fluid (non-study fluid). The fluid balance inclusive the blood loss was calculated after cystectomy, at the end of surgery, and two hours thereafter. The investigators register complications postoperatively inclusive hospital stay until discharge.</detailed_description>
