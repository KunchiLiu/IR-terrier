	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled parallel Group phase I study to investigate the safety and immunological/ therapeutic activity of two new vaccines, AFFITOPE® PD01A and AFFITOPE® PD03A, given to patients with early Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). In total 30 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study: 12 patients in each treatment arm who will receive either 75µg AFFITOPE® PD01A (with adjuvant) or 75µg AFFITOPE® PD03A (with adjuvant) and 6 patients in the control group who will receive the reference substance (Placebo). Over a study duration of 52 weeks, the study participants will receive 4 injections as basic immunization in a 4-weekly interval and 1 boost immunization 36 weeks after the first injection. Male and female patients aged 30 to 75 years can participate in the trial. 2 study sites in France (Bordeaux and Toulouse) will be involved. AFF009 is part of the project SYMPATH funded by the European Commission (FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1 project; N° HEALTH-F4-2013-602999).</brief_summary>

Emergency vaccinations are acceptable Use of any other investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine in addition to the study vaccine during the entire study period Subjects participating or have participated in another interventional clinical trial within 60 days prior to baseline Blood donation within 4 weeks prior to first vaccination. History of autoimmune diseases, severe hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis, allergic bronchial asthma and severe allergic rhinoconjunctivitis Known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency Administration of chronic (defined as more than 14 days) immunosuppressant or other immunemodifying drugs within six months before first vaccination and during the entire study period. For corticosteroids like prednisone or equivalent ≥ 0.05 mg/kg/day. Topical and inhaled steroids are allowed Intake of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol more than the basic medication for pain in the musculoskeletal system within three days prior to a vaccination with AFFITOPE® PD01A or AFFITOPE® PD03A or Placebo If a patient shows an acute febrile infection (≥ 37.8° Celsius) on the day of vaccination, administration of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) should be postponed until resolution of the infection Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, a negative test result within 30 days before screening is acceptable), Hepatitis B (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C Significant systemic illness (e.g. chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled congestive heart failure and/or other deficiencies), if considered relevant by the investigator Venous status rendering it impossible to place an i.v. access Contraindications for MRI and lumbar puncture Not able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions, protocolstated restrictions Unwilling to provide informed consent.
