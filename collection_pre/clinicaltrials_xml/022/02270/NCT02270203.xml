	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of SI joint fusion using the iFuse Implant System in patients with degenerative sacroiliitis (DS) and/or sacroiliac joint disruptions (SD). Study Design: This study is extended follow-up from two ongoing multicenter prospective US clinical trials. All participants have already undergone the surgical procedure of interest (SI joint fusion with iFuse Implant System). The two ongoing trials are: - SIFI:( Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with iFuse Implant System) a single-arm trial of patients with degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruption who underwent iFuse placement, and - INSITE(Investigation of Sacroiliac Fusion Treatment): a randomized clinical trial of the same patient population who underwent either non-surgical treatment or iFuse placement</brief_summary>
