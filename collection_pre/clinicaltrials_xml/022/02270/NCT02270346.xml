	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) causes various toxic effects in many body tissues, organs and systems such as immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine and musculoskeletal systems, liver, kidneys and skin.Available limited numbers of studies showed that inspiratory muscle weakness in allo-HSCT candidates and recipients. Although meta-analysis, systematic reviews and studies demonstrated beneficial effects of inspiratory muscle training on several outcomes in different disease groups; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and heart failure, no published paper reported the effects of IMT in allo-HSC recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-eight allo-HSCT recipients (˃100 days past post-transplant status) were included. Before and after 6-week IMT, maximal and submaximal exercise capacity, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary functions, dyspnea and fatigue perception, depression and quality of life were evaluated. Primary outcome measurement was respiratory muscle strength, secondary outcomes were exercise capacity, dyspnea, peripheral muscle strength, quality of life, fatigue and depression.</detailed_description>
