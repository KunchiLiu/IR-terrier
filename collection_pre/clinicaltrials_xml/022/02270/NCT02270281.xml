	<brief_summary>Although EGDT goals appeared to have been achieved, severe derangements of organ perfusion were detected by SDF technique.An abnormal microvascular flow index was present in 17% of patients in ICU . Microcirculatory alterations are stronger predictors of outcome than global hemodynamic variables.Improvement of microcirculatory dysfunction is a big challenge to clinician. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist for sedation of adult critically ill patients which exhibits sedative and analgesic effects. Recent studies suggest that dexmedetomidine to restore adrenergic vasoconstrictor responsiveness in septic shock, and prevents alterations of pain rat model intestinal microcirculation Induced by surgical stress，even it can reduce the mortality of endotoxemic rats and patients with severe sepsis. The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on microcirculatory dysfunction in early septic shock patients with relative stable hemodynamics. thirty patients with septic shock will be enrolled . After sufficient fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization for 24 hours, these patients who required sedation will receive continuous infusion of two dose of dexmedetomidine (infusion rate 0.3 and 0.6 mcg/kg/h) for 1 hours as needed. The sublingual microcirculation and serum level of catecholamine will be examined at preset time points. The vital signs, hemodynamic parameters will be recorded and analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Microcirculation in Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The enrolled thirty patients with septic shock will be treated according to the SSC guideline. After sufficient fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization for 24 hours, the initial sublingual microcirculation ,serum level of catecholamine and hemodynamic variables will be examined as beseline,then these patients will receive continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine (infusion rate 0.3 mcg/kg/h) for one hour, above parameters will be examined again. Dose escalation to 0.6 mcg/kg/h,above examination is repeated.At last,stop continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine for two hours, above parameters will be recorded again. Systemic or pulmonary hemodynamic variables, microcirculatory flow variables, blood gases, and vasoactive agent requirements were determined at baseline and after dexmedetomidine administration</detailed_description>
