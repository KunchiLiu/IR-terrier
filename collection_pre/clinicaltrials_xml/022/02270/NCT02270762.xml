	<brief_summary>In the critically patient bed rest and inmovilization are some of the responsable of the development of respiratory complications. Early physical exercise is a tool to prevent respiratory complications as lost of respiratory muscle strength, decrease in functional residual capacity and hypoxemia improving oxygenation. In some cases critically ill conditions implies use of pharmacological sedation. That condition limit the active physical exercise. However, some technicals aids as Tilt table allows execution of passive early movilization. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of early passive verticalization assisted by tilt table on alveolar recruitment and pulmonary ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, evaluated with electrical impedance tomography (EIT) ICU patients included at day of evaluation will be evaluated consecutively with EIT in three stages; 1) in the supine position (at 30° of inclination), 2) verticalized in tilt table (at 60º of inclination) 3) in the supine position (at 30° of inclination)</brief_summary>
