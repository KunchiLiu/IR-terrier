	<brief_summary>Background: Promotion of cognitive functions of middle aged and older adults and prevention of dementia are important issues in the aging society. In recent years, studies have shown that Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise can improve cognitive functions in healthy middle-aged and older adults, but not studies have investigated the neural mechanisms. Therefore, the purposes of this research project are: (1) to investigate the effects of TCC exercise intervention on improving cognitive functions and motor functions in healthy middle-aged and older adults; (2) to investigate the effects of TCC intervention on improving the integrity of frontostriatal fiber tracts, and areas and intensity of brain activation while performing a switching task in healthy middle-aged and older adults. Methods: This project used the assessor-blind and randomized control clinical trial design. A total of 60 healthy middle-aged and older adults will be recruited, randomly allocated to two groups: experimental and control groups. Experimental group will receive a 60-minute exercise program, three times per week for 12 weeks. Control group will receive a telephone consultation once every two weeks for 12 weeks. All participants will receive clinical neuropsychological tests, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery tests, motor function tests, diffusion spectrum MR imaging, and functional MRI experiments before intervention, and at the end of intervention to realize the changes of cognitive function, motor function, integrity of neural tracts, and intensity and regions of functional activation while doing switching task of executive function in order to understand the cognitive effects and the neural mechanisms of TCC.</brief_summary>
