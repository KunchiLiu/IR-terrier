Groups of individuals in selected NHs will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group. The subjects in the experimental group will received a 16 weeks PU prevention programme. It includes a training course tailor-made to health workers(HWs) and persona care works(PCWs) and a prevention protocol designed according to the roles and responsibilities of HWs and PCWs. The outcome measures are risk,prevalence and incidence rate of PUs as well as knowledge and skill level of care staff.Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze personal data of care staff, demographics and clinical characteristics of residents, PU knowledge and skills, and PU risk, prevalence and incidence rate.Chi-square test will be perform to compare the proportions of residents developing pressure ulcer between the two groups. Mixed between-within subjects analysis variance(ANOVA) or non-parametric tests will be performed to compare performance in knowledge and skills tests and PU risk between the two groups and over time and to examine the group by time interaction effect.</detailed_description>
