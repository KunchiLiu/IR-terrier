	<brief_summary>The safety and performance of dCELL速 Meniscus will be evaluated in 60 patients after partial replacement of the native medial or lateral meniscus with the investigational product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of dCELL速 Meniscus for Partial Replacement of the Meniscus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dCELL速 Meniscus is a novel decellularised porcine xenograft which is processed using a patented variation of Tissue Regenix's platform dCELL速 technology to render it biocompatible and free from cellular material, leaving behind an acellular biological scaffold that is safe for human implantation whilst preserving the biomechanical properties. It is indicated as a biological implant to replace parts of the native meniscus in the knee for patients who present with chronic pain following failed previous meniscus repair or partial meniscectomy.</detailed_description>
