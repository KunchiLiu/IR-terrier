	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of fluorouracil when given together with radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy before and after surgery in treating patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving additional combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy and fluorouracil followed by combination chemotherapy before and after surgery may be a better treatment for rectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy With 5-Fluorouracil for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil. CHEMORADIATION: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) over 5 days for a total of 5 fractions and concurrently receive fluorouracil intravenously (IV) continuously over 96 hours. PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 2 weeks of completing chemoradiation, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV as a push followed by IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SURGERY: Within 4-8 weeks of completing preoperative chemotherapy, patients undergo total mesorectal excision. POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year or until removal from the study or death, whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>
