	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate presence and quantity of nano-sized particles and interindividual differences in their distribution and elemental composition in human nasal mucosa obtained by mucotomy in patients diagnosed with chronic hypertrophic rhinosinusitis and to compare the obtained results with control specimen obtained from stillborn children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Samples of nasal mucosa are obtained by mucotomy in general anesthaesia from adult patients with chronic hypertrophic rhinosinusitis. Each tissue sample is divided into 4 parts based on the distance from the nostrils and is dehydrated, thinly sliced and mounted on glass slides. Then the tissue is analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman microspectroscopy (RMS) to detect solid particles and characterize the morphology and compositions of the detected particles. A novel method of quantification of distribution of the particles has been designed and used to evaluate interindividual differences in distribution of the particles. History of employment is obtained from the patients and the data are compared with the findings in the tissue samples. The data acquired from the group of adult patients are compared with the results obtained from a group of control specimen of nasal mucosa harvested from stillborn children. It is presumed that no nano particles will be present in the stillborn children specimen since the mucosa was not exposed to airborne particles.</detailed_description>
