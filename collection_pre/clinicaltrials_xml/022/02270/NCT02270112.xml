	<brief_summary>Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can only be diagnosed during episodes when the arrhythmia is present. The investigators hypothesize that the activation of the atrial myocardium resulting in the p-wave of the ecg should display abnormalities in diseased atria which are vulnerable for AF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Diagnostics for Early Detection of Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the first part of this trial different diagnostic techniques to detect arrythmogenic substrates of atrial fibrillation will be tested. If suitable parameters can be identified, a follow up trial to identify patients at risk for AF will be conducted before a stroke happens. Parameters tested are 1. Electrophysiological differences between patients with paroxysmal AF and no history of AF 2. "Vascular Stiffness" detected by an iPhone app All patients will undergo a cardiogoniometrie and a pulse wave analysis with an iPhone. Each exam takes 5 minutes.</detailed_description>
