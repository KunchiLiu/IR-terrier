	<brief_summary>Effect of biventricular upgrade on left ventricular reverse remodeling and clinical outcomes in patient in left ventricular dysfunction and intermittent or permanent apical/septal right ventricular pacing (Budapest CRT upgrade study)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Budapest Upgrade CRT Study (Version 009-4.1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of upgrade to a CRT-D device on clinical and echocardiographic response at 12-month in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF ≤35%), symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV-a), and intermittent or permanent right ventricular pacing with paced QRS complex ≥ 150 ms compared to continued therapy with a single or dual chamber pacemaker (PM) or ICD. Prospective, post-market, international multicenter randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients over the age of 18 (expected survival time: over 1 year) Patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy; Those implanted with a single or dual chamber ICD or implanted with a single or dual chamber pacemaker at least 6 months before inclusion; Elective generator replacement or upgrade from pacemakeronly to ICD therapy may be indicated at the time of enrollment, but are not required; Right ventricular pacing 20100% in at least the last 90 days before enrollment (with an optimal AV interval based on the physician's discretion to avoid unnecessary right ventricular stimulation); Symptomatic heart failure for at least 3 months before inclusion; NYHA functional class II or III, or IV a; Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by echocardiography ≤ 35%; Paced QRS complex ≥ 150 ms; Optimal heart failure medical therapy; Informed consent obtained. Intrinsic QRS with LBBB morphology (measured at VVI 40 bpm setting as per protocol); CABG or PCI in the past 3 months; Acute myocardial infarction in the past 3 months; Unstable angina; Planned coronary revascularization (PCI or CABG); Planned cardiac transplantation; Acute myocarditis; Infiltrative myocardial disease; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Severe primary mitral and aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation; Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or breastfeeding; Subjects who are unable or unwilling to cooperate with the study protocol; Tricuspid valve prosthesis; Any serious disease likely to interfere with the conduct of the study; Participation in other clinical trial; Patients geographically not stable or unavailable for followup; Chronic, severe renal dysfunction (creatinine value &gt; 200 μmol/l); Severe RV dilatation (RV basal diameter &gt;50mm); Severe tricuspid insufficiency.</criteria>
