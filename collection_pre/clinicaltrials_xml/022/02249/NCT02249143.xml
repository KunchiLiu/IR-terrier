	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to quantify and compare changes in lung volumes (as measured by functional residual capacity) in premature infants stable on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and then randomized to two additional weeks of CPAP and room air versus room air alone. We hypothesize that infants randomized to additional CPAP will demonstrate an increased functional residual capacity (at the end of the two week study period and prior to discharge) compared to those randomized to room air.</brief_summary>
