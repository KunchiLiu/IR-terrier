	<brief_title>A Treatment Regimen for Student Athletes With Mild to Moderate Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall purpose of this study was to demonstrate lesion count reduction from baseline, subject satisfaction, and compliance with a regimen of adapalene BPO used in conjunction with a foam wash and moisturizer with sunscreen in student athletes. The study hypothesis was that this regimen would reduce total lesion count (inflammatory and noninflammatory) relative to baseline. The objective of this study was to evaluate the change in lesion count (total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory) in subjects using the CoMMPlete regimen.</detailed_description>
