	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study to Compare the Differences in Nutritional Status Between Patients With Mild and Moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Cognitively Intact Healthy People in an Asian Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the current Asian nutritional status study is to get more insight into the nutritional status of AD patients in an Asian population in Asia. Plasma levels of several micronutrients and the fatty acid profile will be compared between patients with mild and moderate AD and cognitively intact healthy controls in an Asian population</detailed_description>
