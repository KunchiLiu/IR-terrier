	<criteria>A diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society criteria. Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤ 70 % of predicted value and FEV1/FVC ≤ 70 % at Screening Visit 1 Ability to produce an adequate induced sputum sample ad defined by: volume &gt; 1 ml: squamous cells less than 80% and the ability to tolerate the procedure for at least four minutes with no bronchoconstriction ( a fall in FEV1 ≥ 20%) Greater than 50% of neutrophils in inducedsputum cells at visit 1. This requirement refers to the neutrophils percentage excluding squamous cells Males or females aged 40 to 80 years inclusive. Female patients of childbearing potential cannot participate in this study. Female patients participating in this study must meet at least one of the following criteria: surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation postmenopausal for at least two years A smoking history of more than ten pack years. A packyear is defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior tho participation in the trial, i.e., prior to prestudy washout of their usual pulmonary medications Culturedocumented and/or radiographic evidence and/or antibiotic treatment of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the previous 4 weeks or during the baseline period of this study Significant diseases other than COPD will be exclude. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patients with inflammatory diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, and those with autoimmune diseases will be excluded Clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, liver function, blood chemistry or urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will be excluded. Laboratory parameters listed in the protocol must be within normal range, or if not, be documented by the investigator as not clinically relevant. The following tests may be outside the normal range to the extent indicated: Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Total Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphatase: 10% &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) White blood cell count &lt; 3.80 x 10**9/L, Neutrophils &lt; 2.00 x 10**9/L, Platelets &lt; 100 x 10**9/L, Hemoglobin &lt; 12 x g/dL Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine: 10% &gt; ULN A recent history (i.e. within six months) of myocardial infarction A recent history (i.e. within three months) of refractory heart failure or unstable arrhythmias requiring treatment Patients with known active tuberculosis A history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are allowed A history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis Previous thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a history of a thoracotomy without pulmonary resection should be evaluated as per exclusion criterion no. 2 The use of oral corticosteroids within 4 weeks, or theophyllines and oral or longacting inhaled beta2agonists within 2 weeks of visit 1 A change in pulmonary therapy within the 6 weeks prior to the screening visit 1 in order to control the patient's COPD A history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm**3 A history of and/or current alcohol abuse and/or drug abuse Use of an investigational drug within one month or six halflives (which ever is greater) of the screening visit 1</criteria>
