	<criteria>Male or female patient, age: over 40 years (lower age if genetic Dementia of Alzheimer Type (DAT) is documented. Patients over 85 years need to be in a clinically stable state (investigator's judgement) Patient's educational level is &gt; 4 years Patient is able to understand the patient information and give informed consent Patient has given written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and local legislation Patient has a nondemented relative or care giver who is willing to support the clinical trial; his/her written informed consent is optional Body weight: within +/ 30% of normal weight (Broca index) Diagnosis of DAT by the National Institute of Neurological and communicative DisordersAlzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association (NINCDSADRDA) criteria MMSscore 10 24 inclusive Rosen ischemia score is lower or equal to two Patient is able to complete the trial examinations, to hear, speak, read and write in a basic way and primary sensorial functions are intact Any dementia of vascular genesis (excluded by Rosen ischemia score &gt; 2) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Tomogram (CT) (more recent than 12 months; if a MRI of CT recording is performed more than 12 months before study entry, it must be repeated) findings make the diagnosis of DAT unlikely Any stroke history All secondary dementia (exclusion diagnosis defined by the NINCDSADRDA criteria) as a late complication of: Craniocerebral trauma Intoxication (incl. history of alcohol and drug abuse) Cerebral infections (e.g. neurosyphilis) Thyroid dysfunction Cerebral dysfunction due to metabolic disorders (e.g. unstable thyroid dysfunction, or unstable insulindependent diabetes mellitus with hypo/hyperglycemic episodes) Deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid as a reason of dementia Brain tumour (A patient with an incidental tumour found on CT not felt to be clinically relevant may be included, i.e.: meningioma) Down's syndrome, Parkinsonism, Huntington's chorea Multiple sclerosis Major depression defined by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) 17 item scale (≥ 16) Depressive pseudo dementia Mental retardation Hydrocephalus Epilepsy Endogenous psychoses (schizophrenia) Untreated or noncompensated hypertension (Blood Pressure systolic &gt; 180 and/or diastolic &gt; 110 mmHg) Hypertension being treated with reserpine, clonidine or βblockers (these cases have to be adjusted to therapy with e.g. calcium antagonists 4 weeks before start of treatment) Severe heart failure (NYHA: III and IV) Arrhythmias (Lown: IIIV, Electrocardiogram &gt; 30 ventricular extrasystoles/hour, multifocal or multiform and repetitive forms of ventricular extrasystoles) Bronchial asthma with phases of exacerbation or inducible by aspirin or other Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Severe diabetes mellitus: insulin dependent and not stabilised (patient with an HbA1c in normal range, clinically stable diabetes and any case of insulin dose ≤ 0.5 UI/kg/day may be included), or other metabolic diseases Renal insufficiency: calculated creatinine clearance is less than 60 ml/min Acute hepatic disorder (liver enzymes above 50 % upper normal limit) Chronic hepatitis within the last two years (positive hepatitis titer, Hepatitis A Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, cytomegalovirus, EpsteinBarr virus or abnormal immunological values (positive immunoglobulin M(IgM)/IgG) are allowed if all liver enzymes are within the normal range) Recent history of liver disease (2 years) including drug intoxication (e.g. narcotics, cytostatics etc.) Patients with obvious symptoms of dehydration History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence on other hepatotoxic agents (if a patient is permanently hospitalised and a drug screen performed at the beginning of hospitalisation, no additional drug screen is necessary) Neoplasm currently active or likely to recur (except basal cell carcinoma) Participation in another clinical trial within the last four weeks and reentering from this or a previous talsaclidine trial Pregnant and lactating woman, woman with childbearing potential not using an approved method of contraception Insufficient compliance: in the investigator's opinion the patient or family is unable to comply with the protocol requirements</criteria>
