	<brief_title>Double Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Collagenase Histolyticum in the Treatment of Lipoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug (XIAFLEX) in the treatment of lipoma (fatty tumors). The fat in the lipoma is like normal fat except that it is enclosed in a balloon-like structure which is made of collagen (fibrous tissue). Treatment of the lipoma with an injection of XIAFLEX (a protein that breaks down collagen fibers) may dissolve the collagen/fibrous strands thereby decreasing the size of the lipoma or removing it. Each subject must have two lipomas; one lipoma to be treated with placebo and one lipoma to be treated with study drug, both to be observed similarly throughout the trial.</detailed_description>
