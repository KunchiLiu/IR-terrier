	<criteria>1. â‰¥ 18 years of age 2. First single focal unilateral left hemisphere lesion with diagnosis verified by brain imaging (MRI or CT scans) that occurred at least 6 months prior 3. Premorbidly right handed 4. Premorbidly fluent English speaker 5. Cognitive function sufficient to understand the experiments and follow instructions (per interview with Speech Pathologist) 6.

Ongoing use of CNSactive medications 2. Ongoing use of psychoactive medications, such as stimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications 3. Presence of additional potential tDCS risk factors: Damaged skin at the site of stimulation (i.e., skin with ingrown hairs, acne, razor nicks, wounds that have not healed, recent scar tissue, broken skin, etc.) Presence of an electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implant (including cardiac pacemaker), an intracerebral vascular clip, or any other electrically sensitive support system Metal in any part of the body, including metal injury to the eye (jewelry must be removed during stimulation) A history of medicationresistant epilepsy in the family Past history of seizures or unexplained spells of loss of consciousness during the previous 36 months 4.
