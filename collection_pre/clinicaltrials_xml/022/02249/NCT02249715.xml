	<brief_summary>- To characterize physiological biomarkers of positive response to rDTMS using EEG and functional MRI (fMRI) in patients with PD. - To develop a set-up and algorithm for neurophysiological monitoring for PD patients using EEG and fMRI in patients treated by rDTMS. - To integrate rDTMS stimulation with monitoring techniques with the ultimate goal of providing closed-loop feedback where monitoring informs the stimulation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of a Monitoring Set-up and Algorithm Using Functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG for Prediction of Response to Repetitive Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rDTMS) for Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PD Patients aged 40 years or older, diagnosed as idiopathic PD according to the UK Brain Bank criteria will be treated by an established rDTMS protocol will be monitored before, during and after rDTMS using quantitative EEG and brain network analysis and fMRI while performing a series of cognitive and motor tasks.</detailed_description>
