	<brief_title>Application of MT in Subjects With Overweight/Metabolic Abnormality---RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RCT with a crossover design will present in this study and take place during a 6-month period. Participants will be randomly allocated to two groups applying a randomized block technique and matching with different age and sex. The subjects will be recruited from July 1, 2014 until the participants enough. Interviewing for research purpose explication and informed consent will be collected before the study is executed. Physical activity amount (including mild, moderate and vigorous physical activity), cardio-respiratory fitness (including three minutes of stair-climbing and a minute sit-up), physiological indicators (blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, and body composition), metabolic and biochemical indicators (including glucose level, lipid profile etc.), and the questionnaire of psychological health and quality of life will be recorded at the first visit. And then subjects will be followed after 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Additionally, diet record compliance will be recorded for 12 weeks. In the first 3 months, subjects of group A will use the mobile physical activity promotion tool (MT), receive professional personal counseling, and individualized reminding message (intervention) once a week. In the last 3 months, they will receive standard care (control) which is in support of behavioral and educational recommendations in diet control, increased physical activity, less smoking and drinking, deal with pressure, and regular health examination (based on the booklet of metabolic syndrome prevention which is edited by Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan). Subjects of group B will begin with an initial 3 months control period of standard care only, and the intervention program will be conducted for last 3 months.</detailed_description>
