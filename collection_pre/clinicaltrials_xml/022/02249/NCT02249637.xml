	<brief_summary>Given that both circumcision and orchidopexy are commonly done in a single setting, the investigators adopted the technique of orchidopexy via circumcision incision, particularly for palpable low inguinal cryptorchidism. In this paper, the investigators aim to present a novel technique and discuss our preliminary outcome of such procedure compared to the traditional inguinal-scrotal double incision technique. Specifically, the investigators aimed to determine the differences in operative time, testicular size changes, peri-operative complications, pain score and parent's satisfaction of both novel technique and conventional orchidopexy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Technique of Circumcision Incision Orchidopexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryptorchidism is the most common disorder of the male endocrine gland in children.. 1 According to the latest guideline by European Association of Urology in the Pediatric Urology for the treatment of cryptorchidism, both inguinal and scrotal approaches orchidopexy are accepted standard treatment options. 2 In the local setting, circumcision is another common surgical procedure among the children, particularly under the same instance of anesthesia for other procedure. Not only due to religious and sociocultural reasons, male circumcision has been recently considered having a protective effect against acquisition of various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 3 This benefit is one of many that have led to many affirmative evidence-based policy statements by medical bodies in support of the procedure. Given that both procedures are commonly done in a single setting, we adopted the technique of orchidopexy via circumcision incision, particularly for palpable low inguinal cryptorchidism. In this paper, we aim to present a novel technique and discuss our preliminary outcome of such procedure compared to the traditional inguinal-scrotal double incision technique. Specifically, we aimed to determine the differences in operative time, testicular size changes, peri-operative complications, pain score and parent's satisfaction of both novel technique and conventional orchidopexy.</detailed_description>
