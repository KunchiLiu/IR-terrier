	<brief_summary>This is a Prospective study with Randomized patients into either Ultrasound-guided Platelets-Rich-Plasma injection and Ultrasound guided Corticosteroid Injection, with 3 months and 6 months follow ups after aspiration at our institution. There will be 25 patients in each group, including any patient with symptomatic baker's cyst.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PRP vs Corticosteroid in Baker's Cyst</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of Baker's Cysts are based on its presentation, asymptomatic cysts are currently managed conservatively, symptomatic cysts are treated with joint aspiration and Corticosteroid injection, which have shown according to literature a decrease of the cyst size in approximately two-thirds of patients within 2-7 days but only complete disappearance in approximately 7 %. Ultrasound guided cyst aspiration and Corticosteroid injection are also used with reduction of cyst's size with recurrence in 6 months of 19%. Surgical options to remove the cyst include, Open Resection with a recurrence of 50%, 25% of patients have motion limitation recurrence, 37% have wound healing problems or tense swelling of the calf and 75% of patients have joint pain lasting more than 2 days. Arthroscopic resection, with no recurrence in ultrasound performed 6 and 12 months after procedure, pain lasting more than 3 days in 28% of patients, mild hematoma in 7% of patients and 7% where converted into an open procedure There is no study using ultrasound guided aspiration with platelet-rich-plasma injection (PRP). The rationale for the use of PRP is the belief that the additional platelets will exponentially increase the concentration and release of multiple growth and differentiation factors at the injury site to augment the natural healing process9. PRP does not have any described negative side effect due to the fact that is being prepared from subject's own blood, with no risk of allergy or cross infection, relatively easy for a practiced clinician, and reproducible.</detailed_description>
