	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a demyelinating and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system affecting vision and brain and spinal cord function which leads to accumulating disability with a 5 year-mortality of approximately 30%. Survivors are typically left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness, quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No agent has been found to be highly effective in halting disease activity.Based on recent outcomes of Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, and based on the mechanisms of neuromyelitis optica, the investigators anticipate that mesenchymal stem cells transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for neuromyelitis optica patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective was to assess feasibility and safety; the investigators compared adverse events from up to 3months before treatment until up to 12 months after the infusion. As a secondary objective, the investigators chose efficacy outcomes to assess the Expanded Disability Status (EDSS)„ÄÅannual relapse rate (ARR) and time to next relapse after transplant. Third objective anterior visual pathway and pyramidal tract as a model of wider disease. Masked endpoint analyses was used for electrophysiological and selected imaging outcomes.</detailed_description>
