	<brief_summary>There are no previous reports on the use of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) to treat men with scrotal pain that we found published. We proposed a pilot study using Botox to block the nerves on a small group of men with chronic scrotal pain (CSP) who have failed the standard medical therapy. The men must have had temporary relief from a testicular cord block using local anaesthetic drug. The encourage results of the pilot study has given us the background information to proceed with a formal randomised control trial of Botox vs placebo. We hypothesized that Botox injections to block the testicular nerve will be effective in providing long term pain relief for men with scrotal pain.</brief_summary>
