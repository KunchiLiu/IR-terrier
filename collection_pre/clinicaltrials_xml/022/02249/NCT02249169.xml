	<brief_summary>This longitudinal study is being done to understand mechanisms underlying development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the role of the gut bacteria in development of symptoms. This information will be used to determine whether temporal changes in gut microbial taxonomy and metabolism are associated with changes in symptom severity in IBS, and if targeted dietary interventions, including prebiotics, can reverse or moderate these changes.</brief_summary>
