	<brief_title>Propofol and Sevoflurane for Catheter-Related Bladder Discomfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism of catheter-related bladder discomfort is thought to be related to the muscarinic receptor. Propofol and desflurane are most widely used as an anesthetic agent. Propofol and desflurane are known to block the muscarinic receptor in different ways. The investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of the propofol and sevoflurane for the prevention of catheter-related bladder discomfort.</detailed_description>
