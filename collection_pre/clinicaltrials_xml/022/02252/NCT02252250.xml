	<brief_title>Transanal Minimal Invasive Surgery Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Surgery for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) give the opportunity to reduce surgical access trauma leading to a more painless surgery and enhancing a fast postoperative recovery. Experience with transanal minimal invasive surgery(TAMIS) for rectal cancer show that such NOTES procedures are feasible and safe. And also, lots of experimental studies and small case series reporting the feasibility of transanal anterior resection with single incision laparoscopic surgery(SILS) port or other devices. However any prospective feasibility study demonstrating the safety of the procedure and functional outcomes (sphincter function, sexual function, QOF) are missing. This study investigates the feasibility, practicability, safety and subjective as well as functional outcome of transanal minimal invasive total mesentery excision for rectal cancer.</detailed_description>
