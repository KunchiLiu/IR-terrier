	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of consumption of sugar sweetened and diet beverages on overall fat mass and the fat mass of various tissues implicated in the dysregulation of glucose metabolism. In addition, hypothalamic activity will also be investigated after acute exposure to sugar sweetened and diet beverages, and again after 6 months of daily consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Sugar Sweetened and Diet Beverages Consumed as Part of a Weight-Maintenance Diet on Fat Storage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excess fat deposition in skeletal muscle and the liver have both been implicated in the metabolic dysregulation that leads to type II diabetes. It has been shown that daily consumption of sugar sweetened beverages can lead to increases in the fat mass of these organs. However, little appreciation was given for the effect of overall changes in weight and fat mass or how applicable the doses provided may be for how sugar sweetened beverages are typically consumed. In addition, it has recently been shown that sugars can suppress hypothalamic activity and alter patterns of brain connectivity in regions known to be involved in homeostasis and reward aspects of food intake. However, these observations were made after large doses or sugars not commonly consumed in isolation from other sugars or other macronutrients. Foods containing non-caloric sweeteners have also been suggested to suppress hypothalamic activity due to the disconnect between perceived sweetness and calories consumed. AIM 1: To investigate the response to six months of daily consumption of sugar sweetened or diet beverages as part of a weight-stable structured diet on whole body fat content, but also specifically fat content of the liver, skeletal muscles the abdomen. AIM 2: To investigate hypothalamic activity after acute exposure to sugar sweetened and or diet beverages, and whether chronic exposure for 6 months induces any changes in hypothalamic activity.</detailed_description>
