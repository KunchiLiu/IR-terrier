	<brief_summary>To collect evidence of the safety of administering autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells (ATDC) preparations to living-donor renal transplant recipients in the context of an international European Union funded consortium aimed at evaluationg cellular immunotherapy in solid organ transplantation (The ONE Study). It is anticipated that immune regulation induced by ATDC therapy can evntually be used to reduce the need for conventional immunosuppression in transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ONE Study ATDC Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decades of immunosuppressive drug development have produced an array of powerful pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks associated with these treatments leaves considerable room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the human immune system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and induce a level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical testing in an early-stage trial. The ONE Study aims to answer the question as whether ATDC treatment, or immunoregulatory cell-based therapy in general, has any place in the clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients.</detailed_description>

Any uncontrolled medical condition or concurrent disease that could interfere with the study objectives 14. Any condition which, in the judgement of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk 15. Ongoing treatment with systemic immunosuppressive drugs at inclusion (despite corticoids lower than 10 mg) 16. Participation in another clinical trial during the study or within 28 days prior to planned study entry 17. Exposure to an investigational product during the study or within 28 days prior to planned study entry 18. Female patients of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at enrolment and F01 19. Female patients who are breastfeeding 20. All female patients of childbearing potential* UNLESS: 1. The patient is willing to maintain a highly effective method of birth control** for the duration of the study 2. The career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures that there is no risk of pregnancy for the duration of the study (at the discretion of the Investigator) 21. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup visit schedule 22. Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the Investigator and/or designated study personnel 23. Patients unable to freely give their informed consent (e.g. individuals under legal guardianship). Criteria specific to the infusion of the ATDC_Nantes: 24. Any procoagulant disposition, as evidenced by a past history of thromboembolic disease or abnormal laboratory coagulation parameters which, in the judgement of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk 25. Any condition resulting in a substantial reduction in the volume of the pulmonary vasculature or an increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance. Any disease or disease process leading to substantially elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (as evidenced by electrocardiography, echocardiography, radiology or cardiac catheterisation) or right heart hypertrophy or dysfunction 26. Known atrial or ventricular septal defects posing a risk of paradoxical embolism of infused cells or cell aggregates 27. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the cell product or components used in the manufacture of the cell product. DONOR 1. Eligible for live kidney donation 2.
