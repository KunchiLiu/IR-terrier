	<brief_title>Prevalence of Dry Eye Disease in Patients Diagnosed With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We investigated the prevalence of dry eye disease in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis by information sheets and direct recruitment of patients of potential study participants diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Subjective assessment for dry eye disease was performed using Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. The following objective tests of dry eye disease were employed: tear osmolarity (TO), tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining score and conjunctival lissamine green staining scores using the National Eye Institute-recommended grading system, and Schirmer without anesthetic. The Dry Eye Severity Grading Scheme highlighted by the Dry Eye WorkShop was adapted to quantify dry eye disease severity level.</detailed_description>
