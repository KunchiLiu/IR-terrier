	<brief_summary>Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and evolving bacterial resistance are major public health concerns that impact all areas of healthcare. Further work is needed to better understand these healthcare issues so that effective preventive measures can be developed. The investigators have developed and validated an experimental model for studying the risk factors for bacterial cross contamination in the surgical operating room. The investigators have confirmed in our previous work that intraoperative bacterial transmission events occur frequently both within and between surgical cases and that these transmission events are linked to 30-day postoperative HCAIs and increased patient mortality. In response, the investigators have implemented various strategies designed to bacterial transmission in the operating room, including anesthesia provider hand hygiene compliance. The investigators' recent work in the intensive care unit suggests that the hand hygiene system the investigators have previously studied could be further optimized. The investigators now propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal hand hygiene system enhanced with novel wireless technology designed to facilitate real-time group and individual performance feedback. The investigators hypothesize that the use of this system will increase hourly hand decontamination events of anesthesia and circulating nurse providers and reduce 30-day postoperative healthcare-associated infections HCAIs (primary outcome), reduce hospital stay duration, and hospital re-admission rates, and mortality(secondary outcomes).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and evolving bacterial resistance are major public health concerns that impact all healthcare arenas. Further work is indicated to better understand these healthcare issues in order that effective preventive measures can be developed. The investigators have developed and validated an experimental model for studying the mechanisms, risk factors for, and implications of bacterial cross contamination in the surgical operating room. The investigators have confirmed through use of this model that intraoperative bacterial transmission events occur frequently within and between operative cases and that these transmission events are linked to 30-day postoperative HCAIs and to increased patient mortality. In response, the investigators have implemented and evaluated various strategies designed to target risk factors for intraoperative bacterial transmission events including anesthesia provider hand hygiene compliance, improved handling and design of intravascular catheters, and improved environmental decontamination of high-risk objects. While these focused strategies have been successful in reducing transmission events and the incidence of 30-day postoperative infections, the investigators' recent work in the intensive care unit suggests that the hand hygiene system the investigators studied could be further optimized. The investigators now propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal hand hygiene system enhanced with novel wireless technology designed to facilitate real-time group and individual performance feedback, two evidence-based educational interventions, in reducing 30-day postoperative HCAIs (primary outcome) and intraoperative bacterial transmission events, hospital stay duration, and hospital re-admission rates (secondary outcomes).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Operating room environments involving adult patients undergoing general anesthesia, according to usual practice, for elective or urgent and emergent orthopedic, plastic, neurosurgical, cardiothoracic, urological, general abdominal, gynecological, vascular, or ear/nose/and throat surgical procedures 2. Requirement of a peripheral and/or central intravenous catheter Surgical inclusion procedures were selected because they captured the majority of 30day postoperative infections in a prior multicenter study that we conducted across three major academic medical centers [3]. The investigators will [randomize by the day in order to ensure that the treatment and control arms maintain their integrity and to facilitate an environment conducive to behavior change.] The investigators anticipate that the randomization strategy will allow equal distribution of urgent and emergent patients in the treatment and control groups. Patients with a prior infection and/or preexisting decolonization will be included and will be expected to be equally distributed between study groups given the randomized study design. For HCAI analysis, only new infection sites and/or a different organism of infection will be considered a new HCAI, per NHSN definitions (see below). The investigators realize that decolonization procedures have the capacity to reduce the effect size, and as such, we have appropriately adjusted the sample size (see statistical section). 1. Pediatric patients 2. Lack of an intravenous catheter 3. Pregnant 4. A surgical procedure outside of the classes listed above 5. Adjustments on the day of surgery given the following considerations: Provider allergy/intolerance to 64% alcohol: In the case where the primary anesthesia provider conveys a prior allergy to 64% alcohol and/or a history of significant contact dermatitis, the operating room will be excluded from enrollment. If a primary anesthesia provider develops an allergy and/or contact dermatitis during the study period, this will be documented, and operating rooms assigned to the primary anesthesia provider for future cases will be excluded. The expectation will be that all key providers working in operating rooms randomized to the intervention will participate in utilization of the device. If an operating room is randomized and a provider subsequently refuses to participate for any reason, the operating room will be excluded from the primary analysis but included in an intentiontotreat analysis. An additional operating room will be randomized for each such occurrence.</criteria>
