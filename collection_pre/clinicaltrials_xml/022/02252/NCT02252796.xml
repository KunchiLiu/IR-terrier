	<brief_title>Phase I Hypofractionated Stereotactic Boost (Radiotherapy) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are assigned to Sub-group 1 or 2 based on the primary lesion size and location. This protocol will utilize a standard 3 + 3 phase I design with three patients enrolled per cohort. Patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the blood specimen component of the study. Patients will be followed up to 2 years post radiation therapy. Sub-group 1 will receive HySBst for 1 week. Weeks 2-7 will be standard chemo-radiation therapy. Patients have the option of consolidative chemotherapy at week 12. Sub-group 2 will receive standard chemo-radiation therapy for weeks 1-6 then receive HySBst during week 7. Patients have the option of consolidative chemotherapy at week 12. HySBst dose escalation for each sub-group is listed below: Optional: 4 Gy x 4 daily fractions Level 1: 5 Gy x 4 daily fractions Level 2: 5.5 Gy x 4 daily fractions Level 3: 6 Gy x 4 daily fractions DLTs will be based on events occurring during the course of HySBst. Chemo-Radiation Therapy is defined as: Standard Carboplatin &amp; Paclitaxel Doublelet Regimen with weekly Carboplatin AUC 2/week and Paclitaxel 45 mg/ m2/ week during conventionally fractionated IMRT Image-guided IMRT to 60 Gy, 5 x per week for 6 weeks Consolidative chemotherapy is defined as Carboplatin AUC 6 and Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 every 21 days x 2 cycles will be given after ALL radiotherapy is delivered.</detailed_description>
