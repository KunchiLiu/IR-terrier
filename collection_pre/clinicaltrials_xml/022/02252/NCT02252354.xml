	<detailed_description>The study will consist of 2 parts involving up to 12 healthy male participants. In Part 1, up to 6 participants will receive a single 80 mg dose of [14C]-TAK-385 administered as an oral solution. In Part 2, up to 6 participants will receive a single oral 80 mg dose of TAK-385 administered as two 40 mg tablets and an 80 μg intravenous (into a vein) dose of [14C]-TAK-385 (containing not more than 37.0kBq [1000 nCi] 14C). This single centre study will take place in the United Kingdom.</detailed_description>
