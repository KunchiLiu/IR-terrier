	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether mass spectrometry analysis of stable (non-radioactive) calcium isotopes in plasma or urine samples can help in the diagnosis of bone and calcium disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Diagnostic Value of Stable Calcium Isotope Profiling in Bone and Calcium Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this pilot study is to explore the diagnostic value of MC-ICP-MS (multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) or TIMS (thermal ionization mass spectrometry) measurement of endogenous stable calcium isotopes in plasma and urine samples in patients seen during routine clinical care at the outpatient clinics (incl. Center for Metabolic Bone Diseases) of the University Hospitals Leuven.</detailed_description>
