	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone to that of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (a blood cancer of plasma cells) who are not candidates for high dose chemotherapy (treatment of disease, usually cancer, by chemical agents) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Participants With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment, participants are receiving), active-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a standard treatment or procedure), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time), and multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and who are not candidates for high dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). Daratumumab (16 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) will be administered weekly for first 8 weeks (Cycles 1 to 2) of treatment and then every other week for 16 weeks (Cycles 3 to 6), then every 4 weeks (from Cycle 7 and beyond) until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Lenalidomide will be administered at a dose of 25 mg orally on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle, and dexamethasone will be administered at a dose of 40 mg once a week for both treatment arms. Participants in the DRd arm will receive lenalidomide/dexamethasone for a maximum of 2 years (participants will continue to receive dexamethasone as a premedication for daratumumab administration even after the lenalidomide/dexamethasone treatment is discontinued); those in the Rd arm will continue lenalidomide/dexamethasone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose administration on Day 1), Treatment Phase (Day 1 up to discontinuation of all study treatment), and Follow-up Phase (from discontinuation of all study treatment up to death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first). The maximum duration of study will be 5 years after last participant is randomized. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by PFS. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

Sponsor review and approval of participants below 65 years of age is required before randomization Women of childbearing potential must commit to either abstain continuously from sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue for 3 months after the last dose of daratumumab Man, who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential potential must agree to use a latex or synthetic condom, even if he had a successful vasectomy, must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed appropriate by the Investigator, and must also agree to not donate sperm during the study and for 4 weeks after last dose of lenalidomide and 4 months after last dose of daratumumab Participant has a diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (presence of serum Mprotein &lt;3 g/dL; absence of lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency related to the Mprotein), or smoldering multiple myeloma (asymptomatic multiple myeloma with absence of related organ or tissue impairment end organ damage) Participant has a diagnosis of Waldenstr√∂m's disease, or other conditions in which IgM M protein is present in the absence of a clonal plasma cell infiltration with lytic bone lesions Participant has a history of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) within 5 years before the date of randomization (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the Investigator, with concurrence with the Sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 5 years) Participant has prior or current systemic therapy or SCT for multiple myeloma, with the exception of an emergency use of a short course (equivalent of dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days) of corticosteroids before treatment Participant has had radiation therapy within 14 days of randomization Participant has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] &lt;50% of predicted normal), persistent asthma, or a history of asthma within the last 2 years (controlled intermittent asthma or controlled mild persistent asthma is allowed) Participants with known or suspected COPD must have a FEV1 test during Screening Participant is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or antibodies to hepatitis B surface and core antigens [antiHBs and antiHBc, respectively]) or hepatitis C (antiHCV antibody positive or HCVribonucleic acid [RNA] quantitation positive)</criteria>
