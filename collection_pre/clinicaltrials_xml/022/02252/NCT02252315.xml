	<brief_summary>Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a common injury that involves loss of consciousness or alteration in mental status induced by an external mechanical force to the head. Education about symptoms and reassurance of a prompt recovery usually results in full recovery. However, a subgroup appears to have persistent symptoms and disability. This study will recruit MTBI patients from two Emergency Departments with the aim of identifying modifiable patient characteristics that can delay or prevent full recovery. A secondary aim is to determine if providing education in writing or in-person makes a difference.</brief_summary>
