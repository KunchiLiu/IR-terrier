	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine individual susceptibility factors (drug interactions, genetic factors such as enzyme polymorphism…) to explain wide interindividual variability towards corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone) in children, which could establish a base for therapeutic monitoring.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Prednisone, Prednisolone, Methylprednisolone in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids are widely used in children. A large interindividual variability exists concerning both efficacity and tolerance. Pharmacokinetic is poorly known. A knowledge of individual susceptibility factors would allow to better adapt therapy in each case. Drugs evaluated here are used in routine care in children and will be prescribed according to department practices concerning treated disease. Medical checks will be done during usual follow-up. Several features will be collected: reason of treatment, drug chosen and prescription modalities, observance, concomitant treatments, side effects, clinical examination, photography, score… Blood samples will be performed at different interval during usual biological follow-up. Three samples per patient will be required for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic. 115 children under prednisone/prednisolone and 85 under methylprednisolone will be recruited in three pediatric medical departments: immuno-hematology, nephrology and dermatology.</detailed_description>
