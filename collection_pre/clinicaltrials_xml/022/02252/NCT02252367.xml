	<brief_summary>At present time several preclinical and clinical study have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5)-inhibitors for LUTS/BPH (lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia) patients with or without erectile dysfunction. However, the link between clinical outcomes (symptoms scores), functional activity (urodynamic findings) and molecular pathways, in particular regarding inflammatory pattern (molecular analyses), has not been previously investigated. Aim of present study is to assess, for the first time in literature, changes in pressure flow study (PFS) and changes in molecular profile of prostatic tissue (inflammatory and tissue remodeling markers) in men treated for 12 weeks with tadalafil 5 mg compared with placebo and to correlate these data with changes in symptoms scores (IPSS, International Prostatic Symptoms Score) in men with LUTS secondary to BPH refractory to alpha blockers.</brief_summary>
