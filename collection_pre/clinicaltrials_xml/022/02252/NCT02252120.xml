	<brief_title>Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme Versus Laryngeal Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM (VBM-Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz a.N, Germany) is a well established reusable latex free, extraglottic airway device. A proximal (pharyngeal) and a distal (esophageal) cuff are inflated with a single cuff pilot line. In between lies the ventilation orifice. The LMA SupremeTM (Teleflex San Diego, CA, USA) is a single use well studied laryngeal mask airway. Both devices have a drain tube to allow access to the gastrointestinal tract. Actually there are no studies comparing Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM and LMA SupremeTM use in small children. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM compared to the LMA SupremeTM. The investigators hypothesized that design differences should lead to differences in efficacy of seal and anatomic position. In this randomized, crossover study, the investigators test the hypothesis that in non-paralyzed pediatric patients the oropharyngeal leak pressure and fiberoptic position differs between the size 2 Laryngeal Tube LTS IITM and the LMA SupremeTM.</detailed_description>
