	<brief_summary>BFPET will be evaluated as a diagnostic PET agent for assessing myocardial perfusion in subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to standard nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The safety of BFPET will be evaluated in known or suspected CAD subjects.</brief_summary>
