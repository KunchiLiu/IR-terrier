	<brief_summary>This pilot study will: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of delivering CHOICES-TEEN with master's level mental health professionals within a juvenile justice setting; 2) determine acceptance of CHOICES-TEEN as measured by client adherence, retention, and treatment satisfaction; and 3) assess client improvement at 3-month follow-up (e.g., reduction of risk of HIV, nicotine-exposed pregnancy, and alcohol-exposed pregnancy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choices-Teen: A Bundled Risk Reduction Intervention for Juvenile Justice Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and promise of an adapted CHOICES preconception intervention (CHOICES-TEEN) in reducing the risk of HIV, nicotine-exposed pregnancy (NEP), and alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in adolescent females on intensive community probation. The current study posits that a two-session CHOICES intervention adapted to target multiple bundled health risks—AEP, NEP, and HIV—will be feasible, acceptable, and promising in reducing these risks among females on community-based juvenile probation. This study will: Aim 1: Modify the efficacious CHOICES preconception intervention to target the prevention of HIV, AEP, and NEP. The result will be a two session individual intervention (CHOICES-TEEN) and accompanying therapy manual based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Motivational Interviewing. Aim 2: Conduct a one-arm feasibility trial with females in the juvenile justice system to assess the promise of CHOICES-TEEN. This pilot study will: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of delivering CHOICES-TEEN with master's level mental health professionals within a juvenile justice setting; 2) determine acceptance of CHOICES-TEEN as measured by client adherence, retention, and treatment satisfaction; and 3) assess client improvement at 3-month follow-up (e.g., reduction of risk of HIV, NEP, and AEP). This study will inform subsequent Stage II/III behavioral intervention studies and contribute to a missing, fundamental element in the knowledge base - further understanding of the feasibility of targeting bundled health risks in high-risk adolescents, and the potential promise of a gender-specific intervention for this population.</detailed_description>
