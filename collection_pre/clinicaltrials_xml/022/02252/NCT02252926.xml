	<brief_summary>Oral mucositis is a damage to the mucosa of the oral cavity and pharynx. It is a serious and painful adverse effect caused by the radio therapy and/or chemo therapy patients with head and neck cancer receive. The pain caused by oral mucositis can be difficult to treat as the current treatment with opioids is not sufficient and can cause adverse effects. Our hypothesis is that treatment with a local anesthetic lozenge with bupivacaine can reduce the oral pain caused by mucositis compared with the current standard treatment.</brief_summary>
