	<detailed_description>Project goals: Develop a point-of-service assay to assess eosinophilic airway inflammation Proposal Specific Aims: 1. To establish the infrastructure and test the feasibility of sputum collection in a clinical setting as a minimally invasive patient sampling process for biomarker testing 2. To transform the laboratory-based eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) ELISA detection assay into a clinic-friendly assessment that does not require sophisticated laboratory equipment</detailed_description>
