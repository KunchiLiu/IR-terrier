	<brief_summary>With better medical care, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disease, are enjoying longer lives. As the CF life expectancy increases, conditions such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD) become more prevalent. Nutrition plays a major role in maintaining optimal health in cystic fibrosis (CF). This project is designed to investigate nutrition-related factors, such as vitamin D status, on oxidative stress and fat oxidation which may influence long-term survival in CF and CFRD. Based on preliminary clinical and metabolomics research findings, the working hypotheses of this project are: 1) oxidative stress in CF contributes to impaired fat oxidation, and 2) vitamin D supplementation normalizes oxidative stress and, subsequently, fat oxidation. This study will combine state of the art methods with traditional clinical methods to assess fat oxidation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status in adults with cystic fibrosis. Research methods include blood draws for plasma markers of oxidative stress and metabolomics (the measurement of thousands of small chemicals in the blood), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, to assess energy capacity and thigh fat), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, to assess total and regional body fat and muscle), and indirect calorimetry (to assess resting energy expenditure and whole body fat oxidation). Clinically-relevant data, such as lung function, CF genotype, and diabetes status will be obtained from the electronic medical record and the CF Registry. This study consists of two sub-studies. The first is a cross-sectional study in 66 clinically-stable adults with CF and 44 healthy control participants. Testing in clinically-stable adults will occur in the Emory University Hospital (EUH) Clinical Research Network (CRN) outpatient unit (blood draws, indirect calorimetry, DEXA) and in the Emory University Biomedical Imaging Technology Center (BITC) for MRI imaging. The second study will be an ancillary longitudinal study to the ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized high-dose vitamin D trial (DISC Study, IRB00052829, PI: Tangpricha) in patients with CF who are hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbation. Blood draws and indirect calorimetry will be performed in patients within 72 hrs of hospital admission (before vitamin D dosing), and during 3 and 6 month outpatient follow-up visits. The data generated from this study will be used to inform future nutrition intervention studies in adults with CF and CFRD.</brief_summary>
