	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of T-cell immunotherapy (SB-728mR-T) following cyclophosphamide conditioning. CCR5 is a major co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells. Disruption of CCR5 by zinc finger nuclease (SB-728mR), blocks HIV entry into the T-cells, therefore, protects the T-cells from HIV infection. Safety (primary outcome) and anti-viral effect (secondary outcome) of zinc finger nuclease-mediated CCR5 disrupted autologous T-cells (SB-728mR-T) will be evaluated in the study.</brief_summary>
