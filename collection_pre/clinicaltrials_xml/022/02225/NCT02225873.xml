	<brief_summary>This study will verify whether the cranio-cervical flexion coordination (motor control) and muscle strength training protocol is more effective in improving muscle than the proprioception and muscle strength protocol in patients with chronic neck pain. Hypothesis: The craniocervical flexion (motor control) and muscle strength training protocol will improve muscle function more than the proprioception and muscle strength protocol in patients with chronic cervical pain. Objective: To find out if applying the strength therapeutic exercise protocol and the craniocervical flexion coordination (motor control) training is more effective than the strength and articular repositioning protocol when carrying out the craniocervical flexion test in patients with chronic cervical pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Exercises Protocol in Management of Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain is delimited by two horizontal lines, one through the lower portion of the occipital region and one through the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra. This pain is reproduced by neck movements or exploratory provocation tests. Scientific studies show that at least two out of three people will experience neck pain throughout life. Some of the causes are traumatism and whiplash although sometimes pain is idiopathic. This study will verify whether the cranio-cervical flexion coordination (motor control) and muscle strength training protocol is more effective in improving muscle than the proprioception and muscle strength protocol in patients with chronic neck pain. The project design will be a randomized controlled evaluator-blinded clinical trial with two intervention groups: Group 1 (experimental) will carry out motor control exercises through cranio-cervical flexion training and strength-endurance exercises. Group 2 (control) will carry out exercises to improve muscle strength-endurance and proprioception. Measurements will be done at the beginning of the study, pre and post-treatment, one month and two months after treatment and throughout the six month treatment. Each session will last 45 minutes and therapy will be performed without provoking the patient symptoms. Intervention Experimental group 1: will carry out intermuscular coordination exercises through cranio-cervical training, following Jull et al1, 2 and exercises to increase strength-endurance on the neck flexor muscles. Control group 2: will carry out proprioception exercises through articular repositioning training and exercises to increase strength-endurance on the neck flexor muscles. They will be performed in the same way as the experimental group protocol.</detailed_description>
