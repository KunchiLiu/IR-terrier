	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to compare "usual care" for chronic low back disorders in a rural setting (nurse practitioner/NP) to two different means of integrating Physical Therapy (PT) into a rural health care team: 1. in-person PT assessment, where the PT travels from an urban center 2. interprofessional Telehealth assessment where the local NP is joined by a PT via Telehealth. The project will evaluate health, systems and process outcomes, comparative effectiveness and costs of the three methods of assessment. The hypothesis is that an interprofessional Telehealth assessment with be as effective as an in-person PT assessment, but more effective than usual care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of a Physiotherapist and Nurse Practitioner Intervention for Chronic Low Back Disorders Delivered Through Telehealth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design will include two intervention groups and a control group with 20 participants in each group: 1. interprofessional videoconferencing intervention, 2. in-person PT and, 3. "usual-care" provided by a NP. Due to the interprofessional nature of the intervention, the NP involved in the telehealth-based intervention group may alter their "usual care" practice; therefore, the control group participants will be drawn from the practices of 2 NPs not involved in the Telehealth intervention providing services out of a different clinic. Each PT and the NP alone will complete a standardized online diagnostic classification tool.Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups.</detailed_description>
