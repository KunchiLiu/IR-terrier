	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of CyberKnife radiosurgery in patients with early stage prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy via the CyberKnife® can deliver tumor ablating doses of radiation to prostate tumors safely and effectively while sparing the adjacent tissues (rectum, bladder, ureters, urethra, penile bulb, and bowel) from receiving damaging doses of radiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of CyberKnife Stereotactic Radiosurgery to Prostate Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CyberKnife system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to precisely focus large doses of x-rays (radiation) on the tumor. The device is designed to concentrate large doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal tissue will be minimal.</detailed_description>
