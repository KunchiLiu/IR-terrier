	<brief_summary>Approximately 5% of asthma patients suffer from severe asthma that is characterized by frequent asthma exacerbations resulting in significant morbidity and excessive utilisation of health care resources. Therefore, there is a strong need for improved therapeutic strategies for these patients. Insight in the pathogenesis and molecular pathways active in severe asthma is crucial to reach this goal. Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) is a novel, innovative device-based treatment of severe asthma that is based on local, radiofrequent energy delivery in larger airways during bronchoscopy. Hypothesis: BT-induced clinical improvement in severe asthma is a consequence of reduction in airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and (contractile/immunomodulatory) function, inflammation, neural innervation and/or vascular integrity resulting in altered airway remodelling. BT target identification and severe asthma phenotyping are critical for improved patient selection for BT and fundamental to discover novel, specific signalling pathways active in severe asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unravelling Targets of Therapy in Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has a two-fold purpose: 1. to unravel the targets of BT in severe asthma (how does it work?) which is fundamental for better patient selection (who benefits most?) and further improvement of BT technology and novel asthma therapy development (how to treat better?). These objectives can only be achieved by linking patient-reported outcomes to airway structure/function, which is the principal aim of the study proposed. 2. to investigate clinical outcome analyses</detailed_description>
