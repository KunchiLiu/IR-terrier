	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to give nintedanib in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel before surgery to patients with NSCLC. Researchers also want to learn if the drug combination can help to control NSCLC before surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Study of Cisplatin, Docetaxel, and Nintedanib Stage IB-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be assigned to a study group based on when participant joined this study. Up to 2 groups of up to 6 participants will be enrolled in the Run-In Phase of the study, and up to 33 participants will be enrolled in the Expansion Phase. If participant is enrolled in the Run-In Phase, the dose of nintedanib participant receives will depend on when participant joined this study. The first group of participants will receive a dose level of nintedanib. If no intolerable side effects are seen, a second group will be enrolled at a higher dose level. If intolerable side effects are seen, a group will be enrolled at a lower dose level. If participant is enrolled in the Expansion Phase, participant will receive nintedanib at the highest dose that was tolerated in the Run-In Phase. All participants will receive the same dose level of cisplatin and docetaxel. Study Drug Administration: Run-In Phase: Participant will receive cisplatin over 2 hours and docetaxel over 1 hour by vein on Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle. Participant will take nintedanib by mouth every day from Day 2 of Cycle 1 through Day 7 of Cycle 3, except for the days that participant receives cisplatin and docetaxel. Expansion Phase: Participant will take capsules of nintedanib by mouth every day for a 28 day priming cycle (Cycle 0). Participant will then receive cisplatin over 2 hours and docetaxel over 1 hour by vein on Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle. Participant will take nintedanib by mouth every day from Day 2 of Cycle 1 through Day 7 of Cycle 3, except for the days that participant receives cisplatin and docetaxel. All Patients: Participant should take capsules of nintedanib with about a cup (8 ounces) of water. Participant should swallow the capsules whole and should not chew them. If participant takes nintedanib 2 times daily, participant should take the drug about 12 hours apart each time. If participant misses a dose, participant should wait and take the next scheduled dose when it is due. Participant will then have surgery at least 21 days after the last dose of nintedanib, unless the study doctor thinks it is not in participant's best interest. Study Visits: If participant is in the Expansion Phase, on Day 28 of Cycle 0: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing. - Participant will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. Within 7 days before Cycles 2 and 3: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing. About 14 days after participant's last cycle of chemotherapy: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing. - Participant will have a PET/CT and CT scan to check the status of the disease. Some blood draws and/or imaging scans may need to be performed more frequently if certain side effects (such as those affecting the liver) occur. Surgery: Between 3 and 5 weeks after participant stops taking the study drugs, participant will have surgery to remove the disease. Participant will sign a separate consent form that explains the procedure, as well as its risks and benefits. During surgery, tissue samples that are removed will be collected and stored in a research tissue bank at MD Anderson for use in future biomarker research and other research related to cancer. Length of Treatment: Participant may receive the study drugs for up to 3 cycles, followed by surgery. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Active participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 8 weeks after you have surgery, the following tests and procedures will be performed: Â°Participant will have a physical exam and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. Long-Term Follow-Up: After the end-of-treatment visit, participant's medical record will be reviewed or participant will be called, contacted in writing, or e-mailed to check on participant's health status. If participant is called, these calls should last about 5 minutes. Participant may also be asked these questions during regularly scheduled clinic visits. The follow-up period will last for as long as the study doctor thinks the information is needed. This is an investigational study. Docetaxel and cisplatin are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of NSCLC. Nintedanib is commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a type of lung disease). Its use in this study is investigational. Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 18 years and older 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer. Patients with a suspected lung cancer are eligible, but pathology must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment on study. Neuroendocrine carcinomas are not eligible. Carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation are eligible. 3. Stage IB (with a primary tumor &gt;/= 4cm), IIA, IIB, or IIIA (according to AJCC 7th edition). Patients with stage IIIA must not have more than one mediastinal lymph node station involved by tumor. 4. All patients must have lymph node evaluation of contralateral stations 2 and/or 4 to exclude N3 disease. 5. The patient must be a suitable candidate for surgery, in the opinion of the treating physician. 6. ECOG performance status score 01 7. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with ICHGCP guidelines and to the local legislation 1. Prior systemic therapy or radiation therapy for treatment of the current lung cancer 2. Known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or to their excipients 3. Centrally located tumors with radiographic evidence (CT or MRI) of local invasion of major blood vessels 4.
