	<brief_title>Effect of Paired Testing to Poorly Controlled Chinese Diabetes on Glycemic Control and Self Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in insulin treated type 1 and type 2 diabetics has consistently been demonstrated to confer benefits, and is considered an essential part in the management of diabetes. In China, utilization of SMBG among diabetes patients is low. Even among those who perform SMBG regularly, the daily testing frequency falls short of those recommended in international and national clinical guidelines. There is thus a need to create the awareness of the benefits of SMBG and at the same time establish a SMBG regimen that is deemed practically feasible and cost effective for diabetes patients. Paired testing entails the act of measuring glucose level before and after an event that may impact the glucose level in a patient, e.g. meals, exercise, medication adjustment, and thereafter responding to any abnormal glucose levels/patterns by modifying lifestyle and/or medication. This study aims is to evaluate the effect of introducing paired testing on actual testing frequency, glycemic control, psychosocial and behavioral aspects of poorly controlled diabetes patients in China.</detailed_description>
