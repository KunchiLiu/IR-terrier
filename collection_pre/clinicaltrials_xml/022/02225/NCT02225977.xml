	<brief_summary>In this study we wish to test the hypothesis that continuous Gilenya treatment alters immune homeostasis in favor of an anti-inflammatory type II monocyte and macrophage (M2) phenotype in the circulation of patients with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this study we will determine the change in ratio of M2 (type II, alternatively activated) versus M1 (type I, classically activated) monocytes and macrophages in a cohort of patients that have received continuous Gilenya treatment for 0, 1, 3, 6 or 12 months. We will also assess changes in cell surface expression of the M1 marker CCR7 and the M2 markers CD206 or CD301 by monocytes and macrophages using FACS analysis of whole blood, and assess the tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT-1 (pTyr-STAT1), which is critical for the activation of M1 myeloid cells. We will assess correlates with changes in M1 and M2 cytokine expression assessing possible mechanisms of action of Gilenya on myeloid lineage cells.</brief_summary>
