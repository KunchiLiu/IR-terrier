	<brief_summary>This study is to find out the imaging marker and the changing laws of the marker during the course of the disease. The final purpose is to provide scientific evidence for new prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-modality MRI Study on Differences in Conversion of aMCI Patients With APOEε4 to AD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is an urgent problem in the field of cognitive neuroscience to tell the conversion progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment(aMCI) patients with Apolipoproteinε4(APOEε4) to Alzheimer's Disease(AD). Based on our preliminary work, we will study the special group of aMCI patients with APOEε4 with multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state functional MRI, structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging) longitudinally. Besides, we will also detect the APOE genotype of each sample and enlarge the sample size. According to situation of the conversion or non-conversion and differences in the conversion progression, we will analyze the data between the inter-groups and intra-groups, compare the imaging data of baseline and follow-up, find the prediction imaging marker of AD and optimize the reliability and validity.</detailed_description>
