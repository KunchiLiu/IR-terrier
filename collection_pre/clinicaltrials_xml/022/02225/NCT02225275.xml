	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of lenalidomide and obinutuzumab can help to control CLL or SLL. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination of Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab (GA101) in Patients With Recurrent Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive obinutuzumab by vein over about 3-4 hours on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. Starting on Day 9 of Cycle 1, you will take lenalidomide capsules by mouth 1 time each day. You should swallow your dose of lenalidomide whole with a glass (about 8 ounces) of water, at about the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day only. Do not make up any doses of lenalidomide on the next day. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have to take lenalidomide more or less often and the dose you are taking may change. Your doctor will discuss this with you. Study Visits: Each study cycle is 28 days. Each week during Cycle 1 and during the first week of Cycle 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After Cycle 2, this blood draw will happen every 14 or 28 days, depending on what the doctor thinks is needed. If you are able to become pregnant, at the beginning of each week of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. After Cycle 1, you will have this pregnancy test every 14 or 28 days, depending on what the doctor thinks is needed. On Day 1 (+/-10 days) of Cycles 2-6: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to check your immune system. After Cycle 3, 6, 12, and every 6 cycles after that (Cycles 18, 24, 30, and so on), (+/-14 days from Day 1 of subsequent cycle): - You will have a physical exam - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to check your immune system. - You will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease, to check your immune system, for cytogenic testing, biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers), and flow cytometry testing. At any time during the study, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have radiographic testing to check the status of the disease. Length of Treatment: You may continue taking lenalidomide for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You may receive up to 6 cycles of obinutuzumab. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Lenalidomide is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) outside of controlled clinical trials. Obinutuzumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is investigational to give lenalidomide and obinutuzumab together to treat CLL or SLL. The study doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work. Up to 60 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 18 years or older at the time of signing informed consent. Able to understand and to provide voluntarily informed consent; 2. Have documented CLL/SLL according to NCI criteria; 3. Recurrent or refractory disease according to NCI criteria; 4. Patient are eligible if they have received one or more prior treatment; 5. ECOG performance status of 02 (Appendix 1); 6. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months; 7. Adequate renal function indicated by serum creatinine less or equal to 2 mg/dl; 8. Adequate hepatic function indicated as total bilirubin less or equal to 2 mg/dl and ALT/GPT less or equal to two times the upper normal limit; 9. Disease free of prior malignancies for 3 years with exception of currently treated basal cell squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "in situ" of the cervix or breast. Patients with malignancies with indolent behavior such as prostate cancer treated with radiation or surgery can be enrolled in the study as long as they have a reasonable expectation to have been cured with the treatment modality received 10. No prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome or other myeloid malignancy; 11. All participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the Revlimid REMS ®; 12. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum and/or urine pregnancy test with a sensitive of at least 50 mIU/mL within 1014 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribe lenalidomide for cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as required by Revlimid REMS®) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. 1. Known sensitivity to lenalidomide or other thalidomide derivatives or anti CD20; 2. Documented prolymphocytic leukemia (prolymphocytes more than 55% in the blood); 3. Known history of infection with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Human T Cell Leukemia Virus 1 (HTLV1); 4. Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C. Patients with hepatitis B (HBV) antibody positive but who have positivity for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or anti Hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc) and patients who are positive for antiHCV will need to have a negative PCR (viral HBV DNA or HCV RNA) result prior to enrollment. Those who are HBsAg positive or HBV DNA positive and those who are positive for HCV (RNA) will be excluded; 5. Pregnant or breast feeding females; 6. History of tuberculosis treated within the last five years or recent exposure to tuberculosis; 7. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that places the subject unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate to the study; 8. Patients with a recent history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, in the six months prior to enrollment are not eligible for this study.</criteria>
