	<brief_title>Metabolic Syndrome and Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In cases in which metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver are risk factors of obstetric complications, such as gestational diabetes (GDM) or preeclampsia (PE), we are able to offer systematic clinical results from determining the independent risk factor and developing a predictable model. Recently, obstetric complications, especially GDM and PE, have increased due to the growth of elder pregnancy. In addition, as liver dysfunction has been known to be an independent risk factor of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and renal dysfunction, its clinical importance has risen. Metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, hypertension, type II diabetes and abnormal lipid profile, have been known for its importance in development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Considering abnormal liver function being an independent risk factor of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and renal dysfunction in normal adult patients, we are able to predict that liver dysfunction might be a high risk factor of obstetric complications in pregnant women. In previous studies, the frequency of liver dysfunction in normal pregnant women was obtained. The purpose of this current study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, abnormal liver function and non-alcoholic fatty liver in early pregnancy and the related risks of obstetric complications.</detailed_description>
