	<brief_summary>Patients receive a standardized high-protein test meal at breakfast time. Insulin is given as bolus (normal or dual-wave (normal plus square) and basal rate using an insulin pump. The 3h post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by self-blood glucose measurements (SMBG) (every 1 hour) and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The intervention is taking part under in-patient clinical conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normal Versus Dual Wave Insulin Bolus for High-protein Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dual-wave bolus delivers an immediate normal pre-meal insulin bolus followed by square-wave bolus that is evenly delivered over several hours as programmed by the patient. The aim of this study is to compare post-prandial glycaemic excursions following a high-protein meal after administration of insulin by normal vs dual-wave bolus. During this prospective, cross-over, repeated measures study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, treated with insulin pump therapy will be evaluated using the self-blood glucose measurements following standardized high-protein meal and two types of boluses (normal or dual-wave). The required insulin dose will be calculated based on patient's insulin-exchange ratio. A high-protein meal will be given on two subsequent breakfasts and comparisons will be made between normal and dual-wave insulin bolus delivery. Prolonged post-prandial glycaemic excursions will be identified using the CGMS.</detailed_description>
