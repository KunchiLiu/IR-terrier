	<brief_title>Observational Trial of a Therapeutic Platelet Transfusion Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the participants a therapeutic regimen for platelet transfusions will be applied: for clinically stable patients platelet Transfusion will be given in case of bleeding WHO IIÂ° or higher, for clinically instable patients platelet transfusion will be given at the decretion of the attending physician. Patients with sepsis, septic shock or infections with Infiltration of organs (e.g. invasive aspergillosis), plasmatic coagulation disorders or sudden or increasing headache with or without neurologic symptoms should receive prophylactic platelet Transfusion, if their platelet Count is less then 10/nl. Otherwise no prophylactic platelet Transfusion will be given irrespective of the actual platelet Count. As Primary study endpoint The incidence of bleeding episodes WHO grade III an IV will be documented. The bleeding incidence will then be compared to a historic cohort.</detailed_description>
