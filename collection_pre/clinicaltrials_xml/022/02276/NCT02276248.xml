	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Combined With GDP Chemotherapy in Stage I/II Extranodal Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy has been recognized as the definitive treatment of choice for stages I and II extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. The progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate of radiotherapy plus anthracycline-containing chemotherapy were comparable to that of radiotherapy alone. Our previous studies demonstrated the high responsiveness and safety of GDP (gemcitabine, cisplatin, dexamethasone) regimen in patients with extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. Therefore, we design this study to evaluate the safety and benefit of radiotherapy plus GDP regimen in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
