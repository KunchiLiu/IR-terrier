	<brief_summary>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced in the brain that regulates food intake. However, the mechanisms for this effect in humans is not yet clear. In this study, the investigators will therefore examine the effect of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (compared to placebo) on levels of appetite-regulating hormones and functional magnetic resonance imaging activation of areas of the brain involved in food motivation.</brief_summary>
