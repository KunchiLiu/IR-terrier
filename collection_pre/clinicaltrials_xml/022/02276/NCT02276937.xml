	<brief_summary>DVC1-0101 is a gene therapy medicine to treat peripheral arterial disease (PAD) based on recombinant F-gene-deleted, non-transmissible Sendai virus (rSeV/dF) expressing human fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) gene. The previous Phase I/IIa study demonstrated no serious adverse event related to the administration, and suggested possible improvement of local blood flow and walking performance of PAD patients. The primary objective of the current Phase IIb study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of DVC1-0101 (1x10^9 ciu/leg, 5x10^9 ciu/leg) in patients with IC. We also aim to examine the dose-response relationship using the rate of improvement in walking function as an indicator.</brief_summary>
