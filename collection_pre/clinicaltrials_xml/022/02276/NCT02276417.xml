	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to define the natural history and causes of chronic critical illness (CCI) in surgical intensive care patients who have had sepsis. The investigator also wants to define the long-term physical and cognitive outcomes of this disease. The investigator will be looking at many clinical variables to try to define CCI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression and Catabolism Syndrome (PICS): A New Horizon for Surgical Critical Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational study aimed at identifying the frequency, natural history and long term outcomes of CCI and PICS in the survivors of surgical or trauma-associated sepsis. A major portion of the translational data to be obtained will be from urine and blood samples from septic patients identified in the surgery and trauma ICUs. The blood will be processed for genomic markers, inflammatory markers, immunosuppression markers, Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) functions, and angiogenic factors. The urine will be processed for messenger RNA (mRNA) isolation and protein biomarkers. Bioimpedance analysis will performed to assess body composition. In order to assess the long term outcomes, the following Quality-of-life, functional and cognitive tests will be performed. Health-related quality of life questionnaire, EuroQol-5D, Mini Nutritional Assessment Form, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Controlled Oral Word Association, Modified Mini-Mental Status Exam, Short PhysicalPerformance Battery, Hand Grip Strength Measurement and The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), World Health Organization (WHO), Zubrod Scale Healthy volunteer subjects will be identified from the general population. Healthy subjects will be screened via inclusion/exclusion criteria upon contact. If appropriate for participation, the subject will be consulted for consent.</detailed_description>
