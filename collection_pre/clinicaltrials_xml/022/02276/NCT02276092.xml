	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness of an antimicrobial stewardship program to reduce the length of stay of patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The antimicrobial stewardship program will be implemented in several hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The program will identify patients with pneumonia, review their charts and make recommendations to their attending physicians about antibiotic management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of a Regional Antimicrobial Stewardship on the Length of Stay of Patients Admitted to Hospital With Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial stewardship is defined as any activity that promotes the appropriate selection, dosing, route and duration of antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial stewardship programs usually include pharmacists and/or doctors with expertise in infection diseases management. Prospective chart review and physician feedback is a common intervention used by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve antibiotic utilization and patient outcomes. Pneumonia is the most common reason for antibiotic utilization in hospitals. Significant variation in antibiotic utilization for patients with pneumonia has been repeatedly demonstrated in published studies despite the existence of best-practice treatment guidelines. Treatment variation from these guidelines has been demonstrated to result in worse outcomes such as increased mortality. Antimicrobial stewardship programs can help reduce the treatment variation from guidelines. Despite improvements in certain outcomes, antimicrobial stewardship programs have not demonstrated any impact on the length of stay of patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia. Part of this absence of evidence may be due to poor study design and failure to recruit sufficient patients. This study will include the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program across many hospitals and the study design and analysis will account for the design problems of the previous studies.</detailed_description>
