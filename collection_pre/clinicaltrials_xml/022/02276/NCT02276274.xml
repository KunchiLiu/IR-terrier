	<criteria>1. In the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator, the subject is capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. 2. The subject signs and dates a written, informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 3. The subject is a Japanese healthy adult male. 4. The subject is aged 20 to 35 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent. 5. The subject has a body weight of 50 kg or more with a BMI of â‰¥18.5 kg/m2 and &lt;25.0 kg/m2 at screening. 1. The subject has received any investigational compound within 16 weeks (112 days) prior to the start of study drug administration in Period 1. 2. The subject has received SYR322 or metformin hydrochloride in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent. 3. The subject is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependant relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress. 4. The subject has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, or endocrine disease or other abnormality, which may impact the ability of the subject to participate or potentially confound the study results. 5. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to drugs. 6. The subject has a positive urine drug result for drugs of abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) at screening. 7. The subject has a history of drug abuse or history of alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to the screening visit or unwilling to agree to abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout the study. 8. Subject has taken any excluded medication, supplements, or food products during the time periods listed in the Excluded Medications and Dietary Products table. 9. Subject has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic disease, renal dysfunction, metabolic or endocrine dysfunction, serious allergy, asthma, hypoxemia, hypertension, seizures, or allergic skin rash. There is any finding in the subject's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking DPP4 inhibitors or biguanides, or a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, and cardiac arrhythmias. 10. The subject has current or recent [within 24 weeks (168 days) prior to the initiation of study treatment in Period 1] gastrointestinal disease that would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs (i.e., a history of malabsorption, esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, frequent [more than once per week] occurrence of heartburn, or any surgical intervention [e.g., cholecystectomy]). 11. The subject has a history of cancer. 12. The subject has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibody (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody/antigen, or serological reactions for syphilis at screening. 13. The subject has poor peripheral venous access. 14. The subject has undergone whole blood collection of at least 200 mL within 4 weeks (28 days) or at least 400 mL within 12 weeks (84 days) prior to the start of study medication administration Period 1. 15. The subject has undergone whole blood collection of at least 800 mL in total within 52 weeks (364 days) prior to the start of study medication administration in Period 1. 16. The subject has undergone blood component collection within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to the start of study medication administration in Period 1. 17. The subject has a screening or prior to the start of study medication administration on Day 1 in Period 1 hemoglobin level &lt;12.5 g/dL. 18. The subject has a screening or prior to the start of study medication administration on Day 1 in Period 1 abnormal (clinically significant) 12lead ECG. 19. Subject has abnormal screening or prior to the start of study medication administration on Day 1 in Period 1 laboratory values that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease or subject with the following lab abnormalities: ALT and/or AST &gt;1.5 the upper limits of normal. 20. Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.</criteria>
