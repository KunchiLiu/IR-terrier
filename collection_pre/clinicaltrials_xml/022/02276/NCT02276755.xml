	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the preventive role of vitamin D supplementation in school age children in a high transmission setting. The investigators hypothesis is that (1) vitamin D supplementation will reduce rate of acquisition of LTBI, (2) vitamin D supplementation will lead to greater reductions in active TB incidence, and (3) children with the lowest vitamin D status at baseline will gain most from the intervention.</brief_summary>
