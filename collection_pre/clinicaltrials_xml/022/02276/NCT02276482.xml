	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the safety of intravenous (IV) and/or oral 6-day 200 mg tedizolid phosphate with 10-day comparator in participants 12 to &lt;18 years with cSSTI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tedizolid Phosphate in Adolescents With Complicated Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (cSSTI) (MK-1986-012)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, single-blind, multicenter, Phase 3 study of IV and/or oral tedizolid phosphate 200 mg once per day for 6 days compared with IV and/or oral Comparator for 10 days for the treatment of cSSTI, also known as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, in participants 12 to &lt;18 years. cSSTI includes major cutaneous abscess, cellulitis/erysipelas, and wound infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females 12 years to &lt;18 years Adequate venous access for IV administration of study drug for at least 24 hours (for participants receiving IV medication) and collection of protocolspecified blood samples Local symptoms must have started within 7 days before Study Day 1 cSSTI meeting at least 1 of the clinical syndrome definitions. Suspected or documented Grampositive infection from baseline Gram stain or culture. Parent/legally authorized representative (LAR) able to give informed consent and willing and able to comply with all required study procedures. Assent is also required of children who in the Investigator's judgment are capable of understanding the nature of the study Uncomplicated minor skin and skin structure infections such as pustules, folliculitis, furuncles, minor abscesses (small volume of suppuration not surrounded by cellulitis/erysipelas), impetiginous lesions, superficial or limited cellulitis/erysipelas, and minor wound associated foreign body reactions (eg, stitch abscesses) Known bacteremia, severe sepsis or septic shock Recent history of opportunistic infections where the underlying cause of these infections is still active (eg, leukemia, transplant, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) Hypersensitivity to tedizolid phosphate or any component in the formulation Hypersensitivity to all of the comparator drugs; hypersensitivity to a comparator drug does not preclude participation if an alternative comparator can be used For participants with wound infections: history of hypersensitivity to ceftazidime, aztreonam, or any component of the aztreonam formulation, if aztreonam adjunctive therapy is required; history of hypersensitivity to metronidazole or any component of the formulation, if metronidazole adjunctive therapy is required Needs oral administration of methotrexate, topotecan, irinotecan or rosuvastatin, during administration of oral study drug.</criteria>
