	<brief_summary>Upper Urinary Tract Tumors have an incidence of 1 to 2 cases for 100 000 persons per year. The standard treatment for these tumors is the ablation of the kidney, ureter and a part of the bladder surrounding the ureteral orifice. The development of new diagnosis and treatment techniques through natural routes opens the possibility to use conservative treatments. The investigators hypothesis is that during a reno-ureteroscopy, laser confocal microscopy will allow the discrimination between normal and pathologic urothelium by microscopic analysis. This will prevent the systematic use of biopsies which are often difficult and iatrogenic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the present study is to assess contribution of laser confocal microscopy in diagnosing of upper urinary tract tumors during a reno-uteroscopy compared to analysing of architectural elements (vascular characteristics, organization) and cellular (morphology, cohesion, border).</detailed_description>
