Idiopathic or heritable PAH 2. Persistent PAH for at least one year following surgical repair of a congenital systemictopulmonary cardiac shunt, congenital heart disease, or other congenital heart lesions with no clinically significant residual defects and condition is stabilized hemodynamically 3. PAH in subjects with unrepaired restricted atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus; subject must have a resting post ductal oxygen saturation (off oxygen) of greater than 88% Cohort 1: The subject must have been receiving parenteral Remodulin for at least 90 days without dose change for at least 30 days prior to Baseline Cohort 2: The subject must have been receiving inhaled prostacyclin for at least 90 days and has been at the current stable dose without changes for at least 30 days prior to Baseline All Cohorts: The subject must have been receiving an approved oral endothelin receptor antagonist, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, and/or soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator for at least 90 days and has been at the current stable dose, other than weightbased adjustments for at least 30 days prior to first dose of study drug Willing and able to swallow intact tablets whole without chewing, breaking, or splitting Willing and able to comply with the dietary requirements associated with the oral treprostinil dosing regimen On stable doses of other medical therapy for 14 days prior to Baseline visit with no dose adjustments, additions, or discontinuations (exception diuretics and anticoagulants) Diagnosis of large unrestrictive ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus, Eisenmenger syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or a chronic lung disease, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or interstitial lung disease Current disease severity of Panama functional class IIIb or IV Previous exposure to oral treprostinil Current diagnosis of uncontrolled sleep apnea as defined by their physician Severe renal insufficiency as defined by an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min (Schwartz Formula) or the requirement for dialysis at Screening Moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction; defined as elevated liver function tests (AST or ALT) greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal at Screening, or Child Pugh class B or C hepatic disease Clinically significant anemia as defined by a hemoglobin and/or hematocrit level &lt;75% of the lower limit of normal ranges according to age and gender Down syndrome Uncontrolled systemic hypertension as evidenced by a systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender at Screening or Baseline Subject and/or legal guardian has/have an unstable psychiatric condition or is/are mentally incapable of understanding the objectives, nature, or consequences of the trial, or has any condition in which the Investigator's opinion would constitute an unacceptable risk to the subject's safety Active infection, or has any other cardiovascular, liver, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, immunologic, endocrine, metabolic, or central nervous system disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may adversely affect the safety of the subject or interfere with the interpretation of study assessments Actively listed for transplantation Receiving an investigational drug, has an investigational device in place or has participated in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug</criteria>
