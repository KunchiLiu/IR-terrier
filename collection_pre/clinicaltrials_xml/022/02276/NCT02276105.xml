	<brief_title>Investigation of Psychometric Properties of the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L in Patients With Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is one of the most indications in hand surgery. To rate surgery's outcome, hand-specific instruments like the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ) are used as well as questionnaires which refers to the quality of life (QOL). In clinical daily grind, the SF-12 or the EQ-5D are common instruments to gain information about the patient's QOL. At the time, there is no current evidence available while using standardized questionnaires like the EQ-5D to capture the change in QOL in patients with CTS undergoing surgery. It would be interesting to assert that the investigation offers results about the patient's QOL and its change. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the psychometric properties of the EQ-5D on patients with CTS undergoing surgery.</detailed_description>
