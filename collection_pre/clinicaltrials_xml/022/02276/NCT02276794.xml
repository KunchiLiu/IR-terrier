	<brief_title>Thrust Versus Non-thrust Manipulation in Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty individuals with chronic low back pain will be randomly assigned, by a researcher not involved in data collection, to two treatment groups: Thrust manipulation (side-lying rotational manipulation standardized to the L4-L5 level) or non-thrust manipulation (side-lying grade III rotational non-thrust manipulation). A single treatment session will be provided. Outcome measurement will be conducted immediately after the treatment session. Data will be collected by a blinded assessor. Between-group differences will be calculated by constructing mixed linear models following an intention-to-treat principle.</detailed_description>
