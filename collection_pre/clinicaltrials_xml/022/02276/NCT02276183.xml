	<brief_summary>Bone and muscle losses occur during ageing leading to increased risk of osteoporosis (there are more than 200 million people affected by osteoporosis worldwide), sarcopenia, loss of functionality and mobility. From around 45-50 years onwards, there is a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). This is partially due to an impairment of muscle protein synthesis in response to dietary proteins. Insufficient dietary protein may contribute to age-related loss of lean body mass (LBM) and strength which ultimately affects body movement. Key ingredients in selected investigational product are:Milk proteins, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Glucosamine Sulfate, Zinc. They have effects to improve physical mobility and functionality. The investigators expect improved effects of a nutritional intervention combined with a physical activity program on mobility in healthy aging subjects with joint discomfort.</brief_summary>
