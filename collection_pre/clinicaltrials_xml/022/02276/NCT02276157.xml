	<brief_title>Direct Peroral Cholangioscopy by Using an Ultra-slim Upper Endoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct peroral cholangioscopy (DPOC) by using an ultra-slim upper endoscope provides optical endoscopic images of bile duct and permits various diagnostic or therapeutic intraductal interventions. Usually assisting accessories such as balloon catheter is demanded for an endoscope to advance into the bile duct. Possible diagnostic applications of DPOC include evaluation of indeterminate bile duct strictures, precise mapping and delineation of intraductal tumor spread before resection, differentiation of benign versus malignant intraductal masses, evaluation of ductal ischemia after liver transplant and confirmation of bile duct clearance after endoscopic stone removal. And therapeutic applications of DPOC include intraductal lithotripsy, intraductal tumor ablation therapy by argon plasma coagulation, photodynamic therapy or radiofrequency ablation, direct stone or migrated stent removal, selective guidewire access, and biliary drainage. The investigators evaluated the success rate by useful accessories and various diagnostic and therapeutic intraductal procedures under DPOC.</detailed_description>
