	<brief_summary>In septic patients, Septiflux1 study identified immature granulocytes which may have a diagnostic and prognostic interest. However, with these preliminary results it is not possible to make a difference between what is linked to the infection and what is a consequence of the inflammation which goes along with the septic process. Using flow cytometry, the study of leukocytes in a pure inflammatory model such as cardiopulmonary bypass in heart surgery could make possible to test the diagnostic interest of the immature granulocytes but also to attribute a prognostic value for the occurrence of post-operative infections.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Expression of CD10, CD16, CD24, CD64 on granulocytes, of CD14 and CD16 on monocytes and of CD3 on T lymphocytes. Flow cytometers will all be calibrated the same way using common reagents (known fluorescent calibration beads). Moreover, CD45 and CD3 level of expression on lymphocytes will help to check that the collection of data is standardized between the different centers.</detailed_description>
