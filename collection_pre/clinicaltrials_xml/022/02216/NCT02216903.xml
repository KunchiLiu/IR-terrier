	<brief_summary>This is the evaluation which is associated with apnea symptom, one of the recurrence factors, after AF ablation to patients who diagnosed AF. This is the evaluation which is associated with excessive respiration exercise during AF ablation to patients who diagnosed AF. This is the evaluation which is associated with excessive respiration exercise to make a gap during AF ablation to patients who diagnosed AF.</brief_summary>
