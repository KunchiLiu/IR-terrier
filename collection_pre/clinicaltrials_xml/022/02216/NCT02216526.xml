	<brief_summary>Residents of institutional long-term care facilities are at high risk for developing skin and tissue diseases, e.g. xerosis cutis (including pruritus), infections (e.g., tinea pedis, candidiasis), chronic wounds or neoplastic changes (e.g. actinic keratosis, malignant melanoma) but there are few epidemiological figures about the actual frequencies of these conditions in nursing homes. Therefore, in the first part of this study we aim at measuring key dermatological conditions and associated health and functional status, and the skin care practice of aged nursing home residents ("prevalence study"). Basic skin care interventions are believed to reduce skin dryness and to enhance skin health. Thus, the second aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of two structured skin care regimens compared to the routine standard skin care on skin health in nursing home residents ("intervention study"). The study will be conducted in a random sample of seven out of approximately 300 institutional long term care facilities of the federal state of Berlin.</brief_summary>
