	<brief_summary>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a term describing any rhythm coming from the top half of the heart. Although atrial fibrillation is the commonest cardiac arrhythmia, regular SVT's are also common. The two commonest regular SVT's are atrioventricular (nodal) reentry tachycardias (AV(N)RT) and atrial flutter (AFL). Atrioventricular (nodal) reentry tachycardias (AV(N)RT) are common but benign forms of fast heart rhythm. Although AV(N)RT can cause unpleasant symptoms and are frightening it is not dangerous. If patients present with AV(N)RT the accepted and normal treatment for most is to have the fast heart rhythm stopped by either taking a deep breath and straining or by the use of drugs. Patients can then be discharged home and have further investigation and treatment as an outpatient. SVT can be frightening for the patient but is easy to diagnose and treat. There is high success rate post treatment for this benign condition. This is traditionally done in the local accident and emergency, although patients can sometimes be unnecessarily admitted to hospital overnight. We propose to investigate the safety and efficacy of training paramedics to treat safe forms of AV(N)RT at the scene and then giving the patient an information pack which includes a request for a GP referral to a heart rhythm specialist. Patients will be randomly allocated after consenting to take part in the study to either get paramedic or accident and emergency department treatment. We will compare these two approaches by telephone follow up of the patients. The costs of the different approaches will be compared by assessing the rate of appropriate investigation and the information given to patients and how they rated their experiences.</brief_summary>
