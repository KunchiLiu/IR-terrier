	<brief_title>Increasing Vegetable Intake in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of an innovative approach to increase the amount of vegetable's (V) intake consumed by preschool children who are predominately African-American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA).The primary endpoint will be changes in V consumption in high school children with the hypothesis that a puppet intervention will increase their V consumption by preschool children. To achieve the project goal, our specific aims (SA) are to: SA1: Successfully recruit 6 preschool (PS) centers and 168 AA and 168 HA children 3 to 5 y enrolled there. SA2: Conduct individual interviews for formative assessment of the PUPPET shows. SA3: Develop the manual of operation and intervention protocols SA4: Develop 4 videotaped theatre-based PUPPET shows that are developmentally and cognitively appropriate for use with 3- to 5-year-old AA and HA children SA5: Pilot-test the feasibility of the PUPPET intervention with 3 intervention and 3 control HS centers. SA6: Use the data collected in Aim 5 to estimate parameters required to conduct a group randomized trial for an evaluation of the efficacy of the intervention. The primary hypothesis (H1) to be tested is that children who receive the PUPPET intervention will demonstrate increased V consumption in HS compared to children in the control group.</detailed_description>
