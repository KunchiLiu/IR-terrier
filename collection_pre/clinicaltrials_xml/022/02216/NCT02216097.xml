	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate proof of mechanism of PF-04457845, using a well-established neuroimaging paradigm including behavioral tasks selected to activate neuro-circuitry relevant to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is hypothesized that PF-04457845 will modulate the Blood-oxygen-level dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging signal from the relevant neuro-circuits in patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study To Assess the Effects Of PF-04457845 On BOLD fMRI In Subjects With Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study in male and female subjects with moderate-to-severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder between the ages of 18 and 60 years old. During this study, a dose of 4 mg PF-04457845 will be administered in the morning on Days 1-7. On Each subject will undergo a resting state fMRI (pre and post and day 8), a fearful vs. neutral faces fMRI task and a fear extinction fMRI paradigm. The Emotional Faces Paradigm and resting state tasks will be performed on Day 1 (prior to drug or placebo) and on Day 8. Acquisition of fear conditioning will be performed during the first imaging session on Day 1. After the first imaging session on Day 1, subjects will complete behavioral rating scales and then be dosed. Approximately six hours after dosing subjects will re-enter the scanner and perform the fear extinction paradigm. On Day 2, subjects will perform the fear extinction memory retention task within the scanner. Further physiological monitoring, including skin conductance and heart rate, will take place during the fear extinction paradigm. One safety follow-up visit will occur between Days 11-18.</detailed_description>
