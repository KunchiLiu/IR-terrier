	<brief_summary>This study will include women who will undergo pelvic reconstructive surgery and/or anti-incontinence sling procedures. Patients will be randomized to the combination of L-methionine, Hibiscus Sabdariffa and Boswellia Leaf Extract in tablet or placebo twice a day during the seven days before and after surgery (total of 14 days). In this randomized, double-blind study, the investigators will assess treatment of clinically suspected or culture-proven urinary tract infections within 3 weeks of surgery (primary outcome), and risk factors for treatment for postoperative urinary tract infections (secondary outcomes) between the two study groups.</brief_summary>
