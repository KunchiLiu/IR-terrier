	<brief_summary>As an approach to improve efficacy and provide clinical benefit to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment regimens, Alchemia Oncology has developed a novel means for delivering anti-cancer agents to tumours. The drug delivery platform is based on the use of hyaluronic acid (HA), a novel excipient, in which, formulation with HA results in optimisation of cytotoxic drug uptake and retention within solid tumours. In the specific example of HA-Irinotecan, this new formulation of irinotecan has demonstrated enhanced efficacy in both nonclinical and early clinical studies. The current study is an investigation into the use of HA-Irinotecan in a Phase II single arm trial of FOLF(HA)iri plus cetuximab in irinotecan-naïve second line patients with KRAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer. The study objectives are to confirm the safety and efficacy of FOLF(HA)iri plus cetuximab as second-line therapy in irinotecan-naïve metastatic colorectal cancer patients. It is expected that the study recruit approximately 40-50 patients in 1 year with subsequent treatment and follow up; thus the trial will run for approximately 2-3 years.</brief_summary>

Exclusion criteria KRAS mutant. Prior irinotecan Prior antiEGFR History of other malignancies, except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for greater than 5 years.
