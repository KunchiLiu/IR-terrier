	<brief_summary>Background: In recent years, probiotics have shown promise in treating a variety of diseases. Previously, the investigators have reported on the clinical efficacy of bile salt hydrolase active Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242 in improving the lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic adults. Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of a delayed release or standard vegetarian capsule containing L. reuteri NCIMB 30242, taken in escalated dose over a 4 week period, on the plasma bile acid profile. Design: The study design is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study. The study will last a total of 6 weeks, including a 4-week intervention period and a 2-week washout period.</brief_summary>
