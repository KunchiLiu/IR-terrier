	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the significant risk factor of ischemic stroke with incidence about 20% of all ischemic strokes. The undiagnosed AF in cryptogenic stroke patients could be present but not revealed by rutinne ECG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Occult Paroxysmal AF in Cryptogenic Stroke or TIA Patients Using an Implantable Loop Recorder and Correlation With Genetic Markers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subcutaneous Insertable Cardiac Monitor - Reveal® XT ICM, which provides long-term monitoring ( for 3 years), in selected stroke and TIA population on the basis of age, stroke etiology, and prescreening for cardiac arrhythmias helps to increase a detection of AF to 16.7% (range, 14.3% to 20.0%) in compare to ambulatory ECG detection of AF 6.4% (range, 5.3% to 9.0%). The AF detection after stroke and TIA strategically changes the therapeutic approach. In correlation with mentioned above the incidence of both specific genetic markers of AF and occurance of AF in this population and healthy volunteers are interesting.</detailed_description>
