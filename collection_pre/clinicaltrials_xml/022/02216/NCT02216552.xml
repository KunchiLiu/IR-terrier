	<brief_title>Resveratrol for the Treatment of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Insulin Resistance in Overweight Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pilot study of 10 overweight or obese children with MRS determined fatty liver randomized to resveratrol or placebo. Primary outcome measures include change in liver triglyceride content as determined by MRS and improvement in insulin resistance as determined by the area under the curve of glucose excursion during a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test.</detailed_description>
