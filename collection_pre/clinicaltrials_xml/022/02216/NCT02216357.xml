	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of oral ifetroban compared to placebo as measured by a &gt; 20% decrease in FEV1 compared to baseline following a dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (Study Day 1 or 2) prior to initiation of the aspirin challenge.</brief_summary>

Have a history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleed, or current severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), defined as a patient currently requiring more than two total doses of medication per day to treat persistent symptoms: either more than two doses of any single medication type (antacid, proton pump inhibitor, or H2 receptor antagonist), or more than 2 types of medication per day to treat symptoms. 12. Have a history of tolerating a COX1 blocking drug after their history of a respiratory reaction to a similar drug. 13. Have a history of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial or ventricular rhythm disturbances, or angina, or a previous abnormal electrocardiogram. 14. Have a history of bleeding diathesis or use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs in the last two weeks. 15. Have a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to ifetroban. 16.
