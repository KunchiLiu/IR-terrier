	<brief_summary>Atelectasis is common during and after general anesthesia. Atelectasis develops early if preoxygenation with 100% oxygen is used and continuously used during induction until endotracheal intubation. The investigators hypothesize that a rapid anti-preoxygenation maneuver immediately after confirming a successful intubation, reduces the area of atelectasis as investigated by computed tomography compared to a standard procedure.</brief_summary>
