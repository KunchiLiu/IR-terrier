Active systemic infection with bacterial, viral, fungal, or mycobacterial or atypical mycobacterial infections (excluding fungal infections of nail beds). Any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to screening. Positive pregnancy test or breast feeding at time of study entry (urine pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential no later than 7 days prior to treatment) or patients unwilling to comply with contraceptive measures as outlined above. Patients receiving therapy with oral prednisone or glucocorticoid equivalent in the past 3 months. Patients who had received immunosuppressive therapy including cyclophosphamide, MMF, cyclosporine, tacrolimus or azathioprine in the last 6 months. Current or recent (within 30 days) exposure to any investigational drug. Patients having received a live vaccine within 28 days of study enrollment.

History of psychiatric disorder that would interfere with normal participation in this protocol. Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease (including obstructive pulmonary disease). Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complication.
