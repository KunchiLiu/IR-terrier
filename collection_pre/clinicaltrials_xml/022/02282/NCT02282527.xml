	<criteria>Be between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive Had a diagnosis of congenital AATD Had a documented total alpha₁PI level &lt; 11 µM. If the total alpha₁PI level had yet to be documented, a blood draw for total alpha₁PI level was obtained at the Screening Visit Had a postbronchodilator Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 30% and &lt; 80% of predicted and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70% If the subject had received alpha₁PI augmentation therapy of any kind, he/she must have been be willing to discontinue that treatment at the Week 1 (Baseline) Visit and remain off any kind of alpha₁PI treatment, other than the investigational products for this study, while participating in the study Subject had a moderate or severe pulmonary exacerbation during the 4 weeks before the Week 1 (Baseline) Visit History of lung or liver transplant Any lung surgery during the past 2 years (excluding lung biopsy) Liver cirrhosis confirmed by biopsy Elevated liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) equal to or greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal Severe concomitant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis, malignant disease [with the exception of skin cancers other than melanoma], history of acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis reaction, or current chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis) Females who were pregnant, breastfeeding or, if of childbearing potential, unwilling to practice a highly effective method of contraception (oral, injectable or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, male sterilization, or abstinence) throughout the study Known previous infection with or clinical signs and symptoms consistent with current hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Smoking during the past 6 months or a positive urine cotinine test at the Screening Visit that is due to smoking Participation in another investigational drug study within one month prior to the Week 1 (Baseline) Visit History of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to any plasmaderived alpha1PI preparation or other blood product(s) Use of systemic steroids above a stable dose equivalent to 5 mg/day prednisone (i.e.,10 mg every 2 days) within the 4 weeks prior to the Week 1 (Baseline) Visit inhaled steroids are not considered systemic steroids) Use of systemic or aerosolized antibiotics for an exacerbation within the 4 weeks prior to the Week 1 (Baseline) Visit Known selective or severe Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency</criteria>
