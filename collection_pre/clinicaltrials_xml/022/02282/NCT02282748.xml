	<brief_summary>The planned research project is a prospective population-based cohort study, similar to the well-known Framingham study in the United States. So far, there is no similar research project in Switzerland. It is planned to start with an initial cross-sectional examination of four Swiss municipalities (Buttisholz LU, Glarus Süd GL, Lostallo GR and Cama GR) in 2014. Cross-sectional follow-up examinations will be performed after 5 and 10 years and in 10-year intervals thereafter. The examinations embrace a broad spectrum of measurements (for details the investigators refer to the study protocol).</brief_summary>
