	<brief_summary>The proposed pilot study will provide needed data to establish the feasibility of a conducting a large randomized controlled trial as to the effectiveness of the use of oseltamivir early in the course of influenza in outpatients with chronic pulmonary disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An RCT of Oseltamivir in Outpatients With CPD: A Pilot Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot study will be a multi-centre, randomized, placebo controlled, pilot trial. If outpatients with chronic pulmonary disease at the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health in Hamilton and at the respirology clinics of the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary develop influenza-like illness when influenza is known to be continuously circulating, they will be assessed at the clinics and if they meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to oseltamivir or placebo and followed prospectively. We will test for influenza by RT-PCR however acute detection of influenza will not be a criterion for entry into the trial. The primary outcome for the eventual trial that we will also measure in this pilot is hospitalization Specifically, we will assess if ≥75% of participants can be randomized within 72 hours, if ≥ 90% of participants receive all doses of study medication, and if there is complete follow up in ≥95% of participants. If the pilot study meets our feasibility criteria, it will be deemed appropriate to plan for the larger trial, which we anticipate will require ~ 1,590 participants. If it appears that any of these will not met as we are conducting the trial, we will modify the protocol accordingly to ensure that they are.</detailed_description>
