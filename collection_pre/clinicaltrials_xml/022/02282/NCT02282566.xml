	<brief_title>Effect of Protein-nutrition Beverages on Muscle Protein Synthesis in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential participants will be screened, and if eligible, invited to participate. Body composition and physical activity level will be assessed during the initiation visit. During the trial visits, women receive a protein-nutrition beverage; muscle protein synthesis is assessed via blood analytes and muscle biopsies at rest and after exercise. Statistical analysis includes mixed model regression approach with change in muscle protein synthesis as the primary outcome.</detailed_description>
