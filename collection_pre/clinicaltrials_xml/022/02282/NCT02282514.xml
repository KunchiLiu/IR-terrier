	<brief_summary>Non-myeloablative regimens (as the investigators use herein) are designed to maximally suppress the immune system without destruction of the bone marrow stem cell compartment. When using a non-myeloablative regimen recovery occurs without infusion of stem cells and the stem cells are autologous. While not necessary for recovery, stem cell infusion may shorten the interval of neutropenia and attendant complications. Thus in reality there is no transplant only an autologous supportive blood product. Based on our encouraging results of non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for patients with multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, the investigators will investigate the role of non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with SPS who require assistance to ambulate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-study Testing 1. History and physical; 2. Electrocardiogram (EKG); 3. Dobutamine stress echocardiogram; 4. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest (HRCT); 5. Blood draw for laboratory tests- these tests will include a complete blood count, evaluating liver and kidney function, assessing immune system, tissue typing, and checking for certain germs that can cause infections, including a pregnancy test for females and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for male as well as testing for HIV; 6. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT); 7. Electromyography (EMG); 8. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Abdomen and Pelvis; 9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Spinal Cord; 10. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain with Gadolinium (only if PERM of cerebellar ataxia); 11. Colonoscopy; 12. Mammogram (if female; 13. Timed ambulation; 14. Quality of Life Questionnaires [ Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF36) and Barthel Index]; 15. Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ);16. Rankin Functional Scale; 17. Modified Ashworth Scale;18. PCA-1, PCA-2 antibody ( only if cerebellar ataxia); 19. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 genes (only if ataxia) Study Treatment Stem Cell Collection-Cyclophosphamide 2.0 gm/m2 will be given on day 0, G-CSF 5-10 mcg/kg/day SQwill start on day +5 and will continue until apheresis is discontinued. Apheresis will begin when the ANC &gt; 1.0 x 109/L and continue until &gt;2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg patient weight are cryopreserved. A 10-15 liter apheresis will be performed unless stopped earlier for clinical judgment of toxicity (e.g., numbness, tetany). A maximum of four apheresis will be performed. Conditioning regimen Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day will be given IV over 1 hour in 250 cc of normal saline on day -5, -4, -3, and -2. If actual weight is &lt; ideal weight, cyclophosphamide will be given based on actual weight. If actual weight is &gt; ideal weight, cyclophosphamide will be given as adjusted ideal weight. Adjusted ideal weight = ideal weight + 40% x actual weight minus ideal weight. Mesna 50mg/kg/day will be given IV over 24 hours in 250 cc of normal saline or D5W. Weight base is calculated same as cyclophosphamide as above. ATG (rabbit) 0.5 mg/kg on day -5; 1mg/kg on day -4 and -3; 1.5 mg/kg on day -2 and -1 (total 5.5mg/kg, no dose adjustment) will be given IV over 10 hours in 250 cc of normal saline beginning at least 1 hour after infusion of cyclophosphamide. Premedicate with acetaminophen 650 mg po and diphenhydramine 25 mg po/IV 30 minutes before the infusion. An in-line 0.22 µm filter should be used for ATG administration. Methylprednisolone A suggested dose of 250mg IV should be administered 30 minutes before each ATG infusion. Hydration A suggested rate of 125 cc/hr NS should be given starting 6 hours before cyclophosphamide and continue until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose.The rate of hydration will be aggressively adjusted in order to avoid fluid overload. BID weights will be obtained. Amount of fluid can be modified based on patient's fluid status. Minimum target urine output is 2 liters/m2/day G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day SQ will be continued until the absolute neutrophil counts reach at least 500/µl. Rituxan 500 mg will be given IV on the day before the first dose of ATG and the day after stem cell infusion.</detailed_description>
