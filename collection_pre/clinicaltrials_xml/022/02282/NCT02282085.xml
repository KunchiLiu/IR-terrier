	<brief_summary>This study compares aripiprazole once-monthly injection to standard of care oral antipsychotic medication in non-adherent outpatients with schizophrenia to see which treatment helps people take their medicine more regularly and have more positive outcomes. It is hypothesized that non-adherent schizophrenia outpatients receiving aripiprazole once-monthly will be more likely to respond and have lower symptom severity over 3 months of treatment than those receiving standard of care oral antipsychotics.</brief_summary>
