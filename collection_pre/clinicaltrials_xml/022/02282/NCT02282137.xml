	<brief_summary>Single center, Prospective, Phase II expanded access clinical studies of 68Ga-PSMA (ProstaMedix TM) used for diagnosis and management of patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-PSMA PET-CT Scan for Diagnosis and Management of Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this trial is to evaluate patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence and non-informative bone scintigraphy, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging may help identify potential sites of prostate cancer recurrence for subsequent histologic confirmation. Suspected prostate recurrence will be based upon elevated blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels following initial therapy.</detailed_description>
