	<brief_summary>There has been a dramatic rise in opioid overdose (OOD) deaths in recent years. Attempts to ameliorate the problem have largely focused on increasing the accessibility of naloxone, an opioid antagonist that is effective in OOD reversal. Individuals who have experienced a non-fatal OOD are at risk for additional overdoses and yet there are no interventions that specifically target this high-risk population. To address this gap, the investigators have developed the "Tailored Telephone Intervention delivered by Peers to Prevent Recurring Opioid Overdoses" (TTIP-PRO). The overall goal of the present study is to conduct a pilot evaluation of the TTIP-PRO. The research literature suggests the need for an intervention targeting patients experiencing a non-fatal OOD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phone Interview to Prevent Recurring Opioid Overdoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-group, unblinded pilot study of the TTIP-PRO, which will be completed with approximately 30 participants. Potential participants will be identified by querying the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC) Emergency Department (ED) Electronic Health Record (EHR) for patients treated for an OOD (e.g., opioid poisoning). Patients who have experienced an OOD in the past 8 months will be eligible to receive the TTIP-PRO. A letter about the study will be sent to those patients. Interested patients will call the UC Health staff working on this study. A UC Health staff member will inform potential participants about the study, confirm eligibility, collect enrollment measures, and schedule a time for the TTIP-PRO to be completed with the Peer Interventionist. The participant will be instructed to contact the Peer Interventionist at the scheduled time. After the peer-delivered TTIP-PRO intervention has been completed, a UC Health employee will contact the participant to administer the follow-up measures. The UC Health employee will then send a mailing to the participant that will include a copy of the participant's "Personal Risks for Overdose" report, general information about overdose prevention, and information about treatment for opioid use disorder (see section 2.6 for additional information). The mailing will also include a gift card (which is a standard part of the TTIP-PRO) and an additional gift card to compensate the participant for his/her time as a study participant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for participants (receiving the TTIPPRO intervention): have been treated for an OOD by the UCMC ED within the prior 8 months have used heroin and/or abused prescription opioids in the prior 12 months be 18 years of age or older at time of enrollment be able to provide verbal consent to participate in English Exclusion Criteria for participants (receiving the TTIPPRO intervention): demonstrate difficulty understanding the study as assessed with four truefalse questions (i.e., 1. This is a research study; 2. Your participation is entirely voluntary; 3. You will be asked questions about your risk of opioid overdose.; 4. Your participation will involve several phone calls). Inclusion Criteria for Peer Interventionists: be 18 years of age or older at time of enrollment be enrolled in a methadonemaintenance or buprenorphine maintenance treatment program for at least one year report being opioidabstinent for at least one year meet at least one of the following: has experienced/witnessed/lost a family member or friend to an overdose be able to provide informed consent in English Exclusion criteria for Peer Interventionists: have significant treatment/clinical concerns as determined by treatment program staff The primary pool of potential Peer Interventionists will be patients enrolled in the UC Health (University of Cincinnati Physicians Company) methadonemaintenance or buprenorphine maintenance treatment programs. Recruitment will be through clinic postings and word of mouth. It is estimated that 23 Peer Interventionists will be enrolled in the study.</criteria>
