	<brief_summary>The recent data suggest that cancer cells at the origin of prostate cancer metastases can be detected in an early stage. Available techniques allow phenotypic analysis of cancer cells in circulating blood (cellsearch) or in marrow hematopoietic (flow cytometry). Pilot study on 180 patients infected by prostate cancer at all stage of disease, show that c-met marker , integrin alpha 2 and 6 expressed in marrow and quantified by flow cytometry were predictor of metastatic progress. In this new study the investigators will analyze antibody panel by cellsearch and flow cytometry on marrow sample of castration-Resistant prostate cancer patients.</brief_summary>
