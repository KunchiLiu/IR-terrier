	<brief_summary>A 2 x 2 randomized study testing active versus passive drainage and regulated versus unregulated pleural pressure in patients undergoing anatomic lung resection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Postoperative Chest Tube Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center randomized clinical trial at 6 sites. Pre-operative evaluation and the decision for surgical intervention will proceed as currently performed at each center. That is, neither inclusion in nor exclusion from this study will affect the plan of care for patients other than the approach to chest tube management, which is determined by randomization among 4 methods that are in common clinical use. Each enrolled patient will be randomized to either regulated pleural pressure using the Thopaz+ digital chest drainage device or unregulated pleural pressure using a traditional system (multi-chambered system e.g. Pleur-Evac, Atrium-Maquet or similar device as is routine at each institution) and also randomized to either active suction (-20 cm H2O) or passive drainage.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Able and willing to read, understand, and provide written consent Age 1890 Undergoing a segmentectomy, lobectomy, or bilobectomy (including sleeve resection). Both open and minimally invasive (thoracoscopic or robotic) resections are acceptable Patients unstable enough to require ICU care for hemodynamic or respiratory problems during the first 7 days postoperatively. Patients admitted to the ICU for other reasons (e.g. bed availability, institutional norm, routine monitoring etc.) should NOT be excluded Patients undergoing nonanatomic lung resection only (i.e. wedge resection) Patients undergoing anatomic lung resection for bullous disease, lung abscess or bronchiectasis. Patients undergoing pneumonectomy or completion pneumonectomy</criteria>
