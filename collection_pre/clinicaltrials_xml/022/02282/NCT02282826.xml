	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of GZ402668 after ascending single intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses in men and women with progressive multiple sclerosis. Secondary Objectives: To assess the following in men and women with progressive multiple sclerosis: - The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of GZ402668 after ascending single IV doses. - The pharmacodynamics (PD) of GZ402668 after ascending single IV doses. - The PK parameters of GZ402668 after ascending single SC doses. - The PD of GZ402668 after ascending single SC doses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A First-in-human, Single Ascending Dose Study of GZ402668 in Patients With Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration from screening for a patient can be approximately up to 8 weeks. Upon completion of this trial, patients treated with GZ402668 will be required to enroll in a 4 year safety follow-up study for continued safety observation.</detailed_description>
