	<brief_summary>Obesity, increased abdominal fat, fat stored in the liver, and insulin resistance may all be associated with adverse maternal and fetal pregnancy outcomes. This study will examine how fat storage changes during pregnancy; and if how the body stores fat impacts one's ability to metabolize glucose (sugar) during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Liver and Visceral Fat in Glucose and Lipid Metabolism During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to serially evaluate liver and visceral fat stores during pregnancy and their relationship with glucose and lipid metabolism, placental function, and newborn size. To do this we will conduct both a prospective cohort study of pregnant women without pre-gestational or early gestational diabetes assessed at both 12-16 weeks gestation and at 32-36 weeks gestation and a case-control study of women with normal and impaired glucose tolerance in the early third trimester. Physical assessments will be performed by the Oregon Health and Science University bio-nutrition unit and will include the use of magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and blood draws.</detailed_description>
