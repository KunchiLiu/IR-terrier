	<brief_title>Gastric Capsule Examination for Iron Deficiency Anaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroscopy (OGD) is a useful test for investigating a variety of suspected upper GI disorders. But it is uncomfortable for patients and incurs the risk of intubation and sedation, plus a large proportion of procedures reveal insignificant or no pathology. Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the investigation of choice for diseases of the small bowel. It is safe, noninvasive and well tolerated. The use of CE is traditionally restricted to the small bowel, although newer capsules to image the oesophagus and colon are currently in use. Previous capsules have failed to adequately image the stomach due to its large volume and rugal folds. Recently a magnetic capsule and handheld magnet has been developed (Microcam Navi, Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea) to enable an element of manoeuvrability of the capsule. This is unnecessary in the small bowel where the capsule is propelled along its' tubular structure by peristalsis, but in the capacious stomach this may allow the capsule to be steered to examine all areas of the stomach. The investigators have already conducted two feasibility studies in porcine models with promising results and a trial is currently underway using this equipment to steer the small bowel capsule through the stomach into the duodenum. The next logical step is to compare this technique to the conventional standard of upper GI investigationÍ¾ OGD. Patients with recurrent or refractory iron deficiency anaemia require a combination of gastroscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy as part of their diagnostic investigations. The investigators wish to undertake a pilot prospective single blind controlled trial comparing magnetically steerable gastric capsule examination to conventional OGD in diagnosing upper gastrointestinal pathology in patients with recurrent/refractory iron deficiency anaemia.</detailed_description>
