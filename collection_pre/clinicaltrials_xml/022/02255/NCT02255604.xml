	<brief_summary>The investigators want to investigate whether specific immunotherapy can be delivered directly into a lymph node. The investigators think that a direct introduction of allergen to the antigen presenting cells in the lymph node a give a strong immune response and that this can change the number of injections needed in allergen immunotherapy. The investigators do measurements of clinical effect and a variety of paraclinical test to see if the investigators can find af biomarker of successful specific immune therapy of grass allergy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Intralymphatic Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are injected with 3 or 4 doses of alk 225 Phleum Pratense 1000 standard quantity units/ml in a lymph node in the groin. The investigators monitor clinical response and use of medication during the grass pollen season. SMS (Symptom and Medication Score) will be used. The investigators count the number of immunoglobulin E grass producing plasma cells in blood one week after each injection. The investigators also do basophil activation tests, nasal provocation tests and titrated skin prick test to monitor effect. Adverse events will be recorded.</detailed_description>
