	<brief_summary>Taste physiology describes five main taste qualities in humans: sweet, sour, salty, umami and bitter. The receptors found on the tongue are also found in the entire gut. The correlation of stimulation of these gut receptors and brain activity has not yet been examined. The objectives are to investigate the effect of different taste substances on i) regional brain activity and ii) satiation peptide release.</brief_summary>
