	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine effects (good and bad) of gamma knife radiosurgery for essential tremor. The gamma knife places a small lesion in the brain to suppress tremors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Treatment of Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research is being done because although multiple studies evaluating gamma knife for essential tremor show good results, few studies evaluating patients prospectively have been done. Prior studies have looked at patient outcomes following treatment - also known as retrospective studies. In this study, data collection will initiate before treatment, to obtain consistent baseline evaluations from all study participants undergoing the gamma knife treatment and at specific intervals following treatment.</detailed_description>
