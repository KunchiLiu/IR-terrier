	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of palbociclib isethionate in treating younger patients with central nervous system tumors that have grown, come back, or not responded to treatment. Palbociclib isethionate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palbociclib Isethionate in Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent, Progressive, or Refractory Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/phase II recommended dose and describe toxicities related to PD-0332991 (palbociclib isethionate) in children with retinoblastoma protein 1 (Rb1) positive recurrent, progressive or refractory primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. II. To determine plasma pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in children with Rb1positive recurrent, progressive or refractory primary CNS tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To record preliminary evidence of efficacy of PD-0332991 in children with recurrent CNS tumors. II. To evaluate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6, cyclin D1-3, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (Ink4a-ARF) copy-number variations in available tumor tissue by array comparative, genomic hybridization (aCGH). III. To explore the potential relationships between the pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 and pharmacodynamic response (e.g. percentage change in absolute neutrophil count [ANC], platelet counts). IV. To explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in PD-0332991 metabolizing enzymes and transporters and relate these polymorphisms to PD-0332991 pharmacokinetics. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive palbociclib isethionate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with retinoblastoma protein (Rb1) positive recurrent, progressive or refractory central nervous system (CNS) tumors Histologically confirmed Rb1 positive primary recurrent, progressive, or refractory central nervous system tumors; patients with low grade gliomas are excluded Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue (preferably from current recurrence) must be available to assess Rb1 protein status prior to enrollment; only patients with recurrent diffuse intrinsic brain stem glioma (DIPG) can be enrolled without the need for available tumor tissue for Rb1 protein status confirmation Patients must have measurable disease (in 2dimensions) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of brain and/or spine to assess preliminary evidence of response Body surface area (BSA): Patients enrolled on dose level 1 (50 mg/m^2) must have BSA &gt;= 1.20 m^2 Patients enrolled on dose level 2 (75 mg/m^2) must have BSA &gt;= 0.93 m^2 Patients enrolled on dose level 3 (95 mg/m^2) must have BSA &gt;= 0.70 m^2 Patients must have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and/or focal radiotherapy for their brain tumor and fully recovered from the acute treatment related toxicities of all prior therapies prior to entering this study; for those acute baseline adverse events attributable to prior therapy, patients must meet organ function criteria Chemotherapy: patients must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least three (3) weeks prior to study enrollment in the study or at least six (6) weeks for those receiving nitrosourea Biologic therapy: patients should have received their last dose of biologic agent &gt;= 7 days prior to enrollment; in the event the patient has received another biologic agent and has experienced &gt;= grade 2 myelosuppression, then at least three (3) weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment; if the investigational or biologic agent has a prolonged halflife then at least three (3) weeks interval is required Radiotherapy: patients must have had their last fraction of: * Focal irradiation &gt; 2 weeks prior to enrollment Corticosteroids: patients who are receiving dexamethasone or other corticosteroids must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to enrollment; it is recommended that patients be off all steroid therapy or receive the least dose that will control their neurologic symptoms Growth factors: all colony forming growth factor(s) have been discontinued for at least one week prior to enrollment (filgrastim, sargramostim, and erythropoietin); for patients on long acting growth factors, the interval should be two weeks Patients with neurological deficits that are stable for a minimum of one week prior to registration Patients must be able to swallow capsules Karnofsky performance scale (KPS for &gt;
