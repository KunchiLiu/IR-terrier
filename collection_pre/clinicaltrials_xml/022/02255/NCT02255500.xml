	<brief_title>EXPAREL Infiltration in Subjects Undergoing Femoral Nerve Block With Bupivacaine HCl for Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a single 20 mL dose of bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl) 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 within 2 hours prior to the surgical procedure as an ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block (FNB). EXPAREL 266 mg expanded to 60 mL with preservative-free sterile normal saline will be infiltrated into the surgical site prior to wound closure. There will be no local coadministration of the two drugs. Blood samples for bupivacaine pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be obtained from subjects at baseline (prior to bupivacaine HCl administration for nerve block), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the beginning of EXPAREL administration, and on Day 14.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males or females ≥18 years of age. 2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2, or 3. 3. Scheduled to undergo femoral nerve block in conjunction with unilateral TKA. 4. Female subjects must be surgically sterile, at least 2 years postmenopausal, or using a medically acceptable method of birth control. Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative blood or urine pregnancy test result within 24 hours before surgery. 5. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study schedule, and complete all study assessments. 1. History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to amidetype local anesthetics or opioids. 2. Contraindication to bupivacaine. 3. Received bupivacaine or any other local anesthetic within 7 days of EXPAREL administration. 4. Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within 1 month after EXPAREL administration. 5. Planned concurrent surgical procedure (e.g., bilateral TKA). 6. Body weight &lt;50 kg (110 pounds) or a body mass index ≥45 kg/m2. 7. Received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to EXPAREL administration, and/or has planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject's participation in this study. 8. Previous participation in an EXPAREL study. 9. Malignancy in the last 2 years, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 10. Current or historical evidence of any clinically significant disease or condition, especially cardiovascular or neurological conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may increase the risk of surgery or complicate the subject's postsurgical course. 11. Clinically significant medical or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would constitute a contraindication to participation in the study, or cause inability to comply with the study requirements. In addition, the subject will be ineligible to receive EXPAREL if he or she meets the following criteria during surgery: 12. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g., excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or complicate the subject's postsurgical course.</criteria>
