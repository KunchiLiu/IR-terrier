	<brief_summary>The administration of adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (aTIV) has come to result in a more immunogenic and effective response compared with conventional influenza vaccines in elderly and adults. The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Novartis aTIV in children 6 to &lt;72 months of age, Mexican population, in comparison to Fluzone, a non-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV).</brief_summary>
