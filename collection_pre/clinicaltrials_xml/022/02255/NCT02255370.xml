	<brief_title>Curcumin Associated With Thiopurin in the Prevention of Post-op Recurrence in Crohn Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>122 subjects, operated on for Crohn disease, will be included in the study. After ileo-colonic resection, subjects will be randomized into two arms; they will be given either placebo or curcumin 3g/d per os plus thiopurines during 6 months in a double-blind manner. Rutggerts endoscopic score at 6 months will be the main judgment criteria.</detailed_description>
