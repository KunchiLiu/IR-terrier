	<brief_summary>Despite the existence of an effective screening test (pap smear), cervical cancer is, every year in France, the cause of more than 3,000 new cases and 1,100 deaths. But, in France, 4 in 10 women are not screened or not often enough (nearly 7 millions women). It is therefore necessary to develop new strategies to reach these women. The etiological factor of this cancer is persistent infection with High-Risk Human PapillomaVirus oncogene (HR-HPV). Thereby, HPV-based tests could be alternative screening tests. Vaginal self-sampling with HR-HPV test is simpler and less intrusive than the pap smear. It has been shown that vaginal self-sampling with HPV test is a powerful means to increase the participation rate in cervical cancer screening.</brief_summary>
