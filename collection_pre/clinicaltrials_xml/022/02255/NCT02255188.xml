	<brief_title>Experimental Study of the Vascular Prosthesis Manufactured by Electrospinning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test the influence of the prostheses to hemostasis blood will be pumped through the vascular prosthesis or control silicone tube (both with identical inner diameter 1,7 mm) during 20 minutes at a linear velocity 10 cm/sec (corresponding to 18 ml/min). The tested prostheses (or control tubes) will be installed between two syringes with blood installed in the UTPS-1 instrument providing synchronical movement of pistons of both syringes. Installing UTPS-1 was designed and manufactured at the Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences consists of a mechanical pushers, equipped with clamps for syringes and pistons, stepper motor, electronic control unit and power supply. UTPS-1 and polypropylene non-pyrogenic syringes filled with blood without any bulbs of air provides absence of contacts with air, pyrogens and minimize lysis of blood cells. UTPS-1 has no analogues, and does not require licensure, metrological control or obtaining of any other permits. After pumping the blood will be separated into plasma and cell fraction according to standard laboratory methods. Primary blood (before any treatment), blood after pumping through silicon tube (control), and vascular prosthesis will be tested for hemostatic parameters. Notification of basic and additional parameters being studied, which will be evaluated in the study: 1. The initial parameters of blood hemostasis will be evaluated (Platelet count; Platelet aggregation; Prothrombin time, International Normalised Ratio [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin Quick, thrombin time, soluble fibrin monomer complexes (SFMC), free hemoglobin and P- selectin concentrations). 2. To evaluate the influence of the prosthesis to circulating blood the same hemostasis characteristics wiil be evaluated in blood after 20 min of circulation through prosthesis and silicon tube (Platelet count; Platelet aggregation; Prothrombin time, International Normalised Ratio [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin Quick, thrombin time, soluble fibrin monomer complexes (SFMC), the measurement of free hemoglobin, P- selectin). 3. Microscopy: a study of adhesion of blood cells on the surface of the prosthesis Description of Design of the Research: this will be prospective (are marked in section Detailed Description) Monocentred research Defined indicators for each prosthesis 1. hemostasis characteristics listed hereinabove for untreated blood (control) 2 hemostasis characteristics listed hereinabove in blood after 20 min circulation through silicone tube (control) 3 hemostasis characteristics listed hereinabove in blood after 20 min circulation through After the interaction with the experimental vascular prosthesis Will be studied 4 types of vascular prostheses made by electrospinning - polycaprolactone; - polycaprolactone / gelatin/poorly permeable layer; - polylactide-co-glycolide / polycaprolactone / gelatin/poorly permeable layer; - nylon 6</detailed_description>
