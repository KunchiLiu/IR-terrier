	<brief_title>Dose Response Effects of Quillivant XR in Children With ADHD and Autism: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of low to moderate dose effects of Quillivant XR (liquid methylphenidate) and to observe changes in ADHD symptoms and functional outcomes in children with ASD and ADHD. The investigators propose to investigate the low to moderate dose range of methylphenidate compared with a very low dose with a gradual dose escalation schedule because children with ASD have been found to be more sensitive to the adverse effects of methylphenidate (especially in medium to high doses) than children without ASD.</detailed_description>
