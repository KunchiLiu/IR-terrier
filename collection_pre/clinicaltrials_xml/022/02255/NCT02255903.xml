	<brief_title>Middle Cerebral To Umbilical Artery Doppler Ratio And Amniotic Fluid Volume Measurement In Post-date Pregnancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Will be a case-control study that will be conducted at Banha University Hospital after the approval of Institutional ethical committee. One hundred pregnant women will be recruited from antenatal clinic. Starting from November 2013. An informed consent will be obtained from the patients . The patients will be subdivided into two groups: Group 1(Control Group):consist of fifty pregnant females with gestational age 37-40 weeks. Group 2 (post date Group):consist of fifty pregnant females with gestational age 41 weeks or more. Inclusion criteria: 1. Singleton, viable fetus in the vertex presentation. 2. History of regular menstrual cycles. 3. Gestational age calculated from the first day of last menstryal period or by first-trimester or second-trimester (before 20 weeks) ultrasound examination. 4. No obstetric or medical complications of pregnancy apart from post-date pregnancy All patients will be subjected to: 1. Detailed history: including, personal history, menstural history, obstetric history, present history and past history. 2. Physical examination: general, abdominal and pelvic examination. 3. Investigations: including, A- Ultrasound examintion for amniotic fluid index (AFI) measurement. B- Doppler studies: i - Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA -PT) and resistace index(MCA-RI). ii - Umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI) and resistance index (UA-RT). iii - Cerebro-Placental ratio (CPR).</detailed_description>
