	<brief_summary>Athletes using inhaled β2-adrenoreceptor agonists (IBAs) win a disproportionate number of medals. However, most previous research has shown that β2 agonists do not improve exercise performance in either asthmatic or non-asthmatic athletes. Although the majority of these studies do not show an ergogenic effect, the small number of studies with extended exercise bouts (~60 minutes) do show an advantage. The investigators believe that a controlled yet sport-specific exercise protocol will elucidate this ergogenic effect. Because IBAs may have different effects on these two groups of athletes, the investigators will measure exercise performance in both female and male elite cyclists. The investigators hypothesize that athletes will perform better during a combination steady-state/sprint exercise task following salbutamol administration.</brief_summary>
