	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Neiguan (P6 Point) Acupressure in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, there is an increasing trend in the number of patients with GERD. GERD mainly related to the reflux of stomach content induced by the dysfunction of lower esophageal sphincter. The common symptoms of GERD are heartburn, acid regurgitation, and chest pain. The methods to treat GERD are changes of lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, antireflux surgery and endoscopy. However, the poor response to medicine was still noticed in patients with non-erosive reflux disease. And long-term use of medicine will result in many side effects including infectious, abdominal pain, diarrhea and osteoporosis. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture Neiguan (P6 point) could improve the uncomfortable symptoms of the chest and upper abdomen. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of Neiguan (P6 point) acupressure in patients with GERD. 64 patients with GERD were randomly divided into two groupsï¼šthe acupressure and control. In the acupressure group, in addition to receiving standard treatment, patients will band a hand ring over Neiguan (P6 point) and acupressure for seven days. In the control group, in addition to receiving standard treatment, patients will band a hand ring but no acupressure for seven days. Data was collected by self-recorded symptoms before and after the intervention, according to the Reflux disease questionnaire(RDQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Taiwan condensed version. Data was analyzed by Student's t-tests, Paired Student's t-test, Chi-square, and Fisher exact tests for quantitative and qualitative variables. We anticipate the treatment of Neiguan (P6 point) acupressure will reduce the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and improve the quality of life.</detailed_description>
