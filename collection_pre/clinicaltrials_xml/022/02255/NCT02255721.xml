	<brief_summary>The SHIP study is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention for preschool children with sleep problems, in which we aim to give parents the knowledge, motivation, and skills necessary to set goals, problem-solve, and improve their child's sleep. In collecting three years of follow-up data, we will be able to determine the impact of the SHIP intervention on childhood sleep problems, obesity, academic achievement, and emotional and behavioral problems, as well as parental stress and daytime tiredness. This study has the dual potential to expand treatment resources for young children with behavioral sleep problems and to increase our scientific understanding of the long-term consequences of early childhood sleep problems.</brief_summary>
