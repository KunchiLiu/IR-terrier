	<brief_summary>This project will compare BodyGuardian (BG) device measurements of breathing and activity levels to the gold standard measurement techniques of gas exchange using a mouthpiece connected to flow and gas analyzers measures for breathing and metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry) for activity, We are hopeful these comparisons will help us improve upon the measurements being made in the current version of the BG device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BodyGuardian Respiration and Activity Validation Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BodyGuardian remote monitoring system is an FDA 510 cleared device used to perform remote monitoring of cardiac patients. BodyGuardian (BG) is a novel remote care platform. It incorporates an adhesive strip sensor with in-built electrodes attached to a rechargeable module that can determine an ECG signal and bio impedance. The module also has a 3-way accelerometer. ECG, physical activity and respiration can be assessed using these sensors. Although ECG data is reliable, there are doubts regarding the clinical meaning and validity of the activity and respiration data. The BG reports respiration rate and activity level (on a scale of 0 to 100). This data is being used as input into other clinical algorithms including onboard ECG arrhythmia detection as well as clinical care algorithms for heart failure decompensation prediction. Respiration data is not uniformly reported and there is still doubt regarding its validity. BG breathing measurements will be compared to gold standard measurement techniques of gas exchange using a mouthpiece connected to flow and gas analyzer. Activity data is reported but the investigators do not know how the value translates into clinically used objective parameters of activity e.g. METS. BG activity measurements will be compared to the gold standard activity measurements using metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry)</detailed_description>
