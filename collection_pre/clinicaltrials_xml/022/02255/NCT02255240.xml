	<brief_title>LEVEL UP: Video Games for Activity in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project includes qualitative and quantitative formative research leading to a randomized controlled feasibility trial of a video game-based physical activity intervention. First, we will investigate exercise protocols implemented over 6 weeks in 20 breast cancer survivors. We will choose a console and six games for inclusion in the trial, based on measured energy expenditure and enjoyment. We will create refined exercise protocols using these games and insights from participants. Second, we will test an intervention that uses active video games for implementation of motivating exercise and provision of behavioral tools (e.g., tracking of progress towards goals). Participants in a pre-pilot trial (N = 10) will receive weekly brief telephone counseling over 6 weeks. Feasibility measurement will include attrition, self-reported acceptability, and objective measures of video game play taken from game console data.</detailed_description>
