	<brief_summary>This research study is studying a targeted therapy (ML0N128) as a possible treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer. This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved MLN0128 as a treatment for any disease. MLN0128 prevents tumor cells from dividing and growing by selectively and potently inhibiting a chemical, mTOR kinase, which regulates cell growth and survival. Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer have been observed to sometimes carry genetic alterations in their tumor cells which may make the cancer more sensitive to inhibition by MLN0128. In this research study,the investigators are investigating usefulness of MLN0128 in metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer cases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of MLN0128 in Metastatic Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive ML0N128. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each treatment cycle. After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study. - MLN0128 - Fixed doses daily per treatment cycle The treatment cycles will continue until the participants disease gets worse or is taken off treatment for any other reason.Once treatment has been discontinued the investigators will check on the participants health status by phone for the rest of their life.</detailed_description>
