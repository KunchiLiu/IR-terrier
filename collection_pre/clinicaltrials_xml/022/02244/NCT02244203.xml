	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy males according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests Age ≥ 18 and Age ≤ 45 years BMI ≥ 18.5 and BMI ≤ 29.9 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in accordance with good clinical practice and the local legislation Any finding of the medical examination deviating from normal and of clinical relevance. Repeated measurement of a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts Chronic or relevant acute infections History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its excipients) Intake of drugs within one month or less than 10 halflives of the respective drug prior to first study drug administration except if a relevant interaction can be ruled out Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to first study drug administration Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day) Alcohol abuse (average consumption of more than 30 g / day) Drug abuse Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to the start of study) Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms) A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalaemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) Anaemia at screening Subjects who in the investigator's judgement are perceived as having an increased risk of bleeding, for example because of: Hemorrhagic disorders or bleeding diathesis Occult blood in faeces or haematuria Trauma or surgery within the last month or as long as an excessive risk of bleeding persists after these events, or planned surgery during trial participation History of arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm History of gastroduodenal ulcer disease or gastrointestinal haemorrhage History of intracranial, intraocular, spinal, retroperitoneal, or atraumatic intraarticular bleeding Use of drugs that may interfere with haemostasis during trial conduct (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100/nL)</criteria>
