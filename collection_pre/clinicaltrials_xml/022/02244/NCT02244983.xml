	<brief_summary>It is the investigators goal to identify the prevalence of underlying diseases, make disposition more rational, and establish risk stratification tools in elderly patients presenting with falls. Additionally, the outcome of standard care (clinical assessment only for disposition) will be compared with a new approach combining the standard of care with biomarker assisted disposition of elderly patients presenting with falls. Therefore the investigators are looking at the following points. Emergency department work-up 1. Prevalence of underlying disease 2. Developing algorithms for initial assessment Disposition a. Establishing biomarker enhanced disposition planning by using risk-stratification tools b. Comparing geriatric emergency assessment to standardized disposition planning</brief_summary>
