	<brief_summary>High ucOC may favor insulin release in lean hyperandrogenic women to compensate for impaired insulin sensitivity. Meformin is an insulin sensitizing agent will be given for these women trying to interfere with the pathophysiology of PCOS in these women as followed up by serum UC-OC levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Metformin Therapy on Serum Under-carboxylated Osteocalcin Levels in Hyperandrogenic Lean Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Under-carboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC), the precursor substrate of bone biomarker OC is a potent regulator of energy metabolism by promoting insulin production and adiponectin synthesis and decreasing fat stores.UcOC has a potential role in the physiopathology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common disorder defined by the constellation of anovulation, insulinresistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity and androgen excess.Circulating ucOC concentration is related to key endocrine PCOS characteristics in a weight-dependent manner. Within the bone-pancreas loop, high ucOC may favor insulin release in lean hyperandrogenic women to compensate for impaired insulin sensitivity.We will investigate serum uc-OC responses to insulin sensitizing therapies in lean hyperandrogenic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</detailed_description>
