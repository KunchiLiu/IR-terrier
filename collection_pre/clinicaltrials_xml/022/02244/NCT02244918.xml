	<brief_title>Informing Tobacco Treatment Guidelines for African American Non-Daily Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-daily smokers represent a growing number of racial/ethnic minority smokers. 1 out of 4 African Americans are non-daily smokers. African Americans seem to have a harder time quitting and have greater medical problems related to smoking even at lighter usage rates compared to Whites. Current tobacco treatment guidelines target daily smokers. There are no guidelines for non-daily smokers. This study will allow the researchers to explore treatment options for African American non-daily smokers and find out if some treatments work better than others. Participation in this study will last about 6 months. Over this course of time, participants will be asked to visit the study location 3 times and will talk with a member of the study team on the phone 4 times.</detailed_description>
