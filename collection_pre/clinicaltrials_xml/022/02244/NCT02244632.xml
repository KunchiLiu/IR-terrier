	<brief_summary>The purpose is to characterise the tolerability of Modufolin in combination with 5-FU alone, in combination with 5-FU and Oxaliplatin, in combination with 5-FU and Irinotecan and in combination with 5-FU, Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab. Another purpose is to investigate 4 doses of Modufolin to identify the best dose for further assessment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ModufolinÂ® in Combination With 5-Fluorouracil Alone or Together With Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan in Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will investigate the tolerability of Modufolin at four (4) dose levels (30, 60, 120 and 240 mg/m2) in two (2) treatment combinations of the chemotherapeutic agents 5-FU and Oxaliplatin during eight (8) weeks of treatment. The tolerability of the two (2) lower doses of Modufolin (30 and 60 mg/m2) will also be investigated in one treatment combination with the chemotherapeutic agent Irinotecan. The tolerability of the Modufolin dose that is assessed as having the most favourable profile will then be investigated in a treatment combination of the 5-FU, Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab during eight (8) weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
