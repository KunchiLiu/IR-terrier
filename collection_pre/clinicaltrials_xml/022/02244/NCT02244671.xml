	<brief_title>Botulinum-assisted Orbital Fat Augmentation With PRP (Platelet-rich-plasma)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immobilization of tissue (graft, graft bed) is a prerequisite for tissue integration. Since yoked extra-ocular muscles continue to be stimulated by movements of the seeing eye after fat injection into the anophthalmic orbit, the use of botulinum toxin(s) can be used to prevent movement of the orbital tissue bed(s) and improve anchoring of injected fat. Platelet rich plasma may also improve fat cell anchoring by the action of fibrin on the adhesion process. This innovation builds on the results of IRB protocols 10.27 and 12.01 as registered with Clinical Trials.gov</detailed_description>
