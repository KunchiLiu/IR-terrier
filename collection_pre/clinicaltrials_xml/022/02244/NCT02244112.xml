	<criteria>Key 1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced malignancy. 2. Relapsed after standard therapy for their malignancy, or if no standard therapy is defined, relapsed after investigational therapy and considered by the treating physician to be an appropriate candidate for a Phase 1 clinical study 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 02 4. Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the absence of Gilbert's disease or hemolysis, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 times ULN. 5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3. Screening ANC must be independent of myeloid growth factor support for at least 1 week, or pegylated growth factors for 2 weeks. 6. Hemoglobin &gt; 7g/dL. Patients may receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions or erythropoietin or darbepoetin in accordance with institutional guidelines up to 1 week before screening. 7. Platelet count &gt; 30,000 mm3. Patients will not have received platelet transfusions for at least 1 week before screening. 8. Uric acid, if elevated, must be lowered to less than the ULN. 9. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault [(140 age) × mass (kg) / (72 × serum creatinine mg/dL)]. Multiply result by 0.85 if female. Key 1. Recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 toxicity or patient's baseline status) from the reversible nonhematologic effects of prior anticancer therapy, excluding alopecia. 2. Systemic chemotherapy with approved or investigational anticancer therapeutics, including steroid therapy intended to treat underlying malignancy, within 3 weeks before the first oprozomib dose; for antibody therapy, a minimum of 3 halflives must elapse before the first oprozomib dose. 3. Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before first oprozomib dose. Radioimmunotherapy within 8 weeks before first oprozomib dose. 4. Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within 8 weeks and allogeneic SCT within 16 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Patients with prior allogeneic SCT must not have evidence of moderatetosevere graftversushost disease (as defined in Filipovich 2005). 5. Unresolved toxicity (NCICTCAE version 4.03) ≥ Grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy, except alopecia. 6. Major surgery within 3 weeks before first oprozomib dose. 7. Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III to IV) 8. Symptomatic cardiac ischemia. 9. Conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional intervention, including but not limited to persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation. 10. History of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. 11. History of torsade de pointe. 12. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before first dose. 13. Abnormal measurements on 12lead ECG. 14. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or hypertension 15. Dysphagia or inability to swallow tablets. 16. Insufficiency of the exocrine pancreas, steatorrhea, or other disorders of the digestive system that impair absorption. 17. Resection of any portion of the stomach or intestines, with the exception of appendectomy. 18. History of bariatric surgery, except in cases where no bowel was resected and all devices have been removed. 19. Active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before first dose, unless cultures or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been negative for 14 days. 20. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or suspected hepatitis C infection. 21. Primary malignancy of the central nervous system. 22. Patient has symptomatic brain metastasis. Patients with brain metastases must have stable neurologic status following surgery or radiation for at least 2 weeks after completion of the definitive therapy, AND be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. 23. Significant peripheral neuropathy (Grade 2 with pain or ≥ Grade 3). 24. Systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of Pglycoprotein ([Pgp]; i.e., itraconazole, ketoconazole) within 14 days before the first dose of oprozomib. 25. Patients must not have used any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ketoconazole) within 7 days prior to enrollment, or any potent CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., rifampin) within 14 days prior to enrollment.</criteria>
