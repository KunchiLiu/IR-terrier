	<brief_title>A Pilot Phase II Study With BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN as Pre-ASCT Induction Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients Non Responding to IGEV Salvage Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brentuximab vedotin emerged as active single-agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL. Some patients don't reach a complete response after salvage treatment with IGEV (ifosfamide, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) and remain PET positive so the idea is to treat this subset of patients with brentuximab vedotin with the aim of achieving a complete remission before transplant.</detailed_description>

Females of childbearing potential must have a negative βHCG pregnancy test result (pregnancy test should be performed at screening an on day 1 of cycle 1 prior to brentuximab vedotin treatment). 12. Female patient is either postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit or surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 6 months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 13. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e., status post vasectomy) agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study period and through 6 months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 14. Required baseline laboratory data: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/µl, Platelet count ≥ 75.000/ µl, Haemoglobin must be ≥ 8 g/dL, Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 times ULN 1. Peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 2. Histologic diagnosis different from Hodgkin Lymphoma 3. First line treatment with BEACOPP 4. Compressive symptoms caused by the presence of Lymphoma 5. Patients treated previously with any antiCD30 antibody. 6. Known hypersensitivity to any recombinant proteins, murine proteins, or excipients contained in the brentuximab vedotin formulation. 7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive 8. Known hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection 9. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection. 10. Patients with known history of any of the following cardiovascular conditions:Myocardial infarction within 2 years of randomization, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities, Recent evidence (within 6 months before first dose of study drug) of a leftventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% 11. Patients with known active viral, bacterial, or fungal infection requiring treatment with antimicrobial therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of brentuximab vedotin. 12. Patients with known active Grade 3 or higher viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of brentuximab vedotin. 13. Patients with known cerebral/meningeal disease (HL or any other etiology), including signs or symptoms of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 14. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to protocol. 15. Symptomatic neurologic disease compromising normal activities of daily living or requiring medications. 16. Patients who are pregnant, or lactating and breastfeeding. 17. Patients that have not completed any prior treatment chemotherapy and/or other investigational agents within at least 5 halflives of last dose of that prior treatment.</criteria>
