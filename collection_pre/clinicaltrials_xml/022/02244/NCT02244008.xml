	<brief_title>Accumulative Effects of Talus Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to verify the acute effect (one session) and chronic (six sessions) and follow-up of the anteroposterior talus mobilization Maitland's grade III on range of motion, pain, and functional capacity in participants with sub-acute and chronic ankle injuries. Thirty eight volunteers subjects (male and female) participated of this study with minimum 18 and maximum 59 years old. The volunteers were allocated in two groups: experimental and control. The variables related to range of motion, pain and functional capacity were measured by biplane goniometer, Visual Analog Scale and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure respectively in four moments: 1- baseline; 2- after the first intervention; 3- after the sixth intervention (two weeks); 4- follow-up (one month). The experimental group received anteroposterior articular mobilization of the talus and the control group received manual contact.</detailed_description>
