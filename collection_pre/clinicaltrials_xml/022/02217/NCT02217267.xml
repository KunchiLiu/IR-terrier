	<brief_title>Long Term Outcome After Serial Lidocaine Infusion in Peripheral Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral nerve injury may give rise to severe and long-lasting types of pains which are often resistant to treatment such as opioid, tricyclic antidepressant or anticonvulsant. Lidocaine infusion has been the one of intractable neuropathic pain treatment . My hypothesis the serial lidocaine infusion can adequate pain control and can prevent chronic pain (central sensitisation). Therefore, we designed this prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of serial lidocaine infusion in peripheral neuropathic pain compared with placebo in long term outcome (at 3 month).</detailed_description>
