	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this observational cohort study is to examine the role of "food reward" in maternal diet and weight change during pregnancy and postpartum. The study will further examine the importance of food reward in the context of behavioral control and other related aspects of eating behavior, as well as weight-related biomedical, psychosocial and behavioral factors including genetics, physical activity, stress, sleep and depression. Four hundred and fifty women of varying baseline weight status will be enrolled early in pregnancy (before 12 weeks postpartum) and followed until 1 year postpartum. Assessments will occur at baseline (&lt;12 weeks postpartum), during pregnancy at 13-18 weeks gestation, 16-22 weeks, and 28-32 weeks, and postpartum at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. Measures will include assessments of food reward and related constructs, dietary intake, other health behaviors, and anthropometrics. Clinical data and biological specimens will be obtained. Infant anthropometrics and feeding practices will also be assessed. Primary exposures include aspects of food reward and behavioral control, which will be assessed in multiple ways to maximize information and utility. Primary outcomes include gestational weight gain, postpartum weight retention and dietary quality.</brief_summary>
