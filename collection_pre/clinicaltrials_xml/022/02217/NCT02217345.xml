	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), fatty infiltration of the liver in the absence of alcohol use, is an increasingly recognized complication of obesity, with prevalence estimates of about 30% of individuals in the United States. A subset of these will develop progressive disease in the form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. NAFLD is expected to be the most common indication for liver transplantation by the year 2020. We hypothesize that growth hormone (GH) replacement will decrease intrahepatic lipid accumulation as quantified by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).</brief_summary>
