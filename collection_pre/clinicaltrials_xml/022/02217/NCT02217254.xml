	<brief_summary>It is an unproven assumption that at least 2 cryoablations is necessary in each pulmonary vein for successful ablation of atrial fibrillation. The investigators hypothesize that a single cryoablation in each pulmonary vein that achieves isolation may leads to equivalent efficacy with decreased risk. The One Freeze Study evaluates this hypothesis. This study compares one 3-minute cryoablation per pulmonary vein versus two 3-minute cryoablations per pulmonary vein during atrial fibrillation ablation procedures.</brief_summary>
