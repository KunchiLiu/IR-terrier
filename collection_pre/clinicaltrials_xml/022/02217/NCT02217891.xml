	<brief_title>IFACT: Incidental Findings in Advanced Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1, the investigators will recruit 40 participants from those already enrolled in existing MSK IRB protocol #12-245 (PI: David Hyman, MD) including male and female patients who have been diagnosed with late-stage breast, colorectal, bladder, and lung cancer (some of the most common cancers in this study population). Part 2, the investigators will recruit 20 participants from those who have actually received incidental germline findings from MSK IRB protocol #12-245 Consent Part C in order to cognitively test novel survey items about their knowledge and perceived utility of their incidental findings (note that the content of these items will be derived from the data collected in Part 1)</detailed_description>
