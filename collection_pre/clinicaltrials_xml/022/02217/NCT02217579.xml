	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is rising worldwide as a consequence of the continued obesity epidemic. The current obesogenic environment makes the regulation of energy intake difficult and impedes the maintenance of weight loss. Dietary patterns and/or ingredients that curb hunger and reduce energy intake are critically needed. We hypothesize that inclusion of protein and prebiotic fiber in the diet will reduce adiposity in overweight and obesity adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Protein and Prebiotic Fiber Intake on Adiposity in Overweight and Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of our study is to assess the effects of protein and prebiotic fiber intake on changes in adiposity in an overweight and obese adult population. Primary objective - To determine the effect of 12 week protein (10 g/day) or prebiotic fiber (16 g/day) intake on changes in body composition, chiefly body fat. Secondary objective - To measure changes in appetite following 12 weeks of protein (10 g/day) or prebiotic fiber (16 g/day) intake. Other outcomes includes changes in quality of life ratings and gut microbiota.</detailed_description>
