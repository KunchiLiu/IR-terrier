	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the effect of the different continuous s.c. infusion treatments on the human growth hormone (hGH) levels in untreated acromegalic patients in comparison to a standard dose of octreotide. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile and the safety and tolerability of DG3173 after continuous s.c. infusion will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
