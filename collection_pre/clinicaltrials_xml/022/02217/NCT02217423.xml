	<brief_title>Abdominal Circumference and Cardiorespiratory Repercussions in Patients Submitted to Physical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physiotherapist assessment will consist of anthropometry (body mass index, abdominal circumference, adipometer); chest inspection and palpation, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory frequence, oxymetry), dyspnea index and capillar blood glucose; and later with pulmonary tests (thoracoabdominal perimetry, respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary volume and capacity). This will be a quasi-experimental study. Patients will be divided into four groups according to waist circumference (increased or not, with respect to cardiovascular risk) and respiratory disorders (obstructive and restrictive). After this assessment, chest physical therapy will begin according to the protocol for obstructive and restrictive respiratory disorders. The treatment will have an average duration of 30 minutes. At the end of treatment (single session) the patient will be assessed again after five and thirty minutes.</detailed_description>
