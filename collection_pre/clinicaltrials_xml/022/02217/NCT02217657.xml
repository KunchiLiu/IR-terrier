	<brief_title>SmartTouch Catheter for Left Anterior Line - SmarT Line Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation has emerged as a realistic therapeutic option for symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). The three main techniques described for ablation of persistent AF include pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, ablation based on electrogram analysis, and left atrial (LA) linear lesions. The ideal endpoint of linear lesions should be complete electrical block; however, this is technically challenging, time consuming, and potentially hazardous. The ST catheter combined with 3D mapping and navigation software, gives physicians a real-time, objective measure of tip-to-tissue contact force during the catheter ablation procedure and will allow physicians to more safely and effectively treat atrial fibrillation.</detailed_description>
