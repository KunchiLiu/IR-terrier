	<brief_summary>HCIP has shown efficacy in treatment of peritoneal carcinosis from colorectal background. Few studies have been published on the use of HCIP in peritoneal carcinosis from ovarian background but most of them were non-randomized phase II studies on a small population using different type of drugs and dosage. before this heterogeneity it seems necessary to standardize the utilization modalities of HCIP in peritoneal carcinosis from ovarian background</brief_summary>
