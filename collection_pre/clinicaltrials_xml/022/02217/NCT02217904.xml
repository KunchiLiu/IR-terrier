	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) activity of MK-8591 monotherapy in ART-naive, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected participants. The primary hypothesis is that at a safe and tolerable dose of MK-8591, the true mean difference in the plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) reduction from baseline between MK-8591 and placebo is at least 0.5 log (base10) copies/mL.</brief_summary>
