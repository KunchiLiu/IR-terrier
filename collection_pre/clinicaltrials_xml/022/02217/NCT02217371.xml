	<brief_summary>In a previous protocol, we highlighted an excessive daytime sleepiness at the Maintenance of Wakefulness Tests (MWT) in 36% of adult Attention Deficit Disorder with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD) patients. In 40% of cases this sleepiness was associated with a sleep disorder objectified by polysomnography (PSG): apnea hypopnea syndrome (AHI) ≥ 10/h and / or Periodicals Movements of Lower Limb (PLMI) ≥ 15/h. However, among patients with no sleep disorder PSG, we can question the central origin of the Excessive Daytime Sleepiness. Thus, we wish to determine potential changes in the regulation of sleep / wake cycle through a protocol of extended wake. The principal objective is to compare the objective sleepiness in sleepy patients with ADHD and healthy subjects during a protocol of extended wake. It's an observational study of interventional type realized in patient with ADHD syndrome deprived of psychostimulant treatment (for 72 hours) and healthy subject, investigating the implication of the homeostatic and circadian systems in the preservation of awakening.</brief_summary>
