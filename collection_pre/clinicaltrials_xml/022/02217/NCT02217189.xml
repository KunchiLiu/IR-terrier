	<brief_summary>Although several studies have considered the relationship between infertility and semen super oxide radical scavengers levels, no study on the effects of asthenospermia treatments such as oral zinc supplementation on superoxide radical scavengers activity which are important in fertility of the individual has been reported.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Oral Zinc Supplementation on Superoxide Radical Scavengers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study was conducted to study the effect of zinc supplementation on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of semen along with superoxide radical scavengers activity in the seminal plasma of asthenospermic patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>the presence of asthenozoospermia in the semen sample. the absence of endocrinopathy, varicocele, and female factor infertility. Smokers and alcoholic men were excluded from the study because of their recognized high seminal ROS levels and decreased antioxidant levels.</criteria>
