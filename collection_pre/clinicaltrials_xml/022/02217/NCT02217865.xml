	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this research is to develop new tools to guide patients, caregivers, and clinicians in making individualized decisions regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance. As part of a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded contract, principal investigator will analyze surveillance data to determine the effectiveness of CRC surveillance and recurrence risk taking into account different patient and tumor characteristics; identify key issues about CRC surveillance important to patients, caregivers, and clinicians; and integrate the recurrence risk and patient priorities into a patient-centered, risk stratified surveillance strategy by creating an interactive decision aid for use by patients and clinicians. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1 - Determine the effectiveness of surveillance of colorectal cancer patients following curative resection and the factors associated with recurrence treatment eligibility. Aim 2 - Identify key priorities for surveillance that are important to patients and clinicians through stakeholder engagement. Aim 3 - Develop a patient-centered risk-stratified surveillance strategy utilizing a novel, interactive, decision aid to facilitate shared decision making. This protocol addresses a formative step in the creation of the interactive decision aid where patients' information needs and preferences are assessed regarding decisions about surveillance. The specific aims of this protocol are: Phase 1 - To interview patients and their caregivers to determine their concerns, preferences and key priorities regarding surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer, and Phase 2 - To refine the key priorities identified in phase 1 through focus groups and surveys with patients and caregivers.</brief_summary>
