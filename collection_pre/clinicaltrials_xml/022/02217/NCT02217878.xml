	<brief_summary>The purpose of the IMPRESSION study is to determine whether intravenous administration of morphine prior to ticagrelor administration in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients and in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients alters the plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabolite and whether it is associated with any negative impact on the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Morphine on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Ticagrelor in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines recommend use of morphine as a treatment of choice for pain relief in STEMI patients. However, this recommendation, although strong, is only based on expert consensus (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). Morphine, apart from its analgesic effects, also alleviates the work of breathing and reduces anxiety. On the other hand, despite its favorable analgesic and sedative actions, morphine also exerts adverse effects, which include hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, vomiting and reduction of gastrointestinal motility. Some of the previously listed morphine's side effects could affect the intestinal absorption and thus pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered drugs which are concomitantly used with morphine. At present, no pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data regarding the concurrent use of morphine and P2Y12 blockers in the STEMI or NSTEMI setting are available. Therefore, evidence-based verification of morphine's influence on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) could provide a valuable insight in the knowledge regarding modern acute myocardial infarction management. Predefined subanalysis: aimed to investigate which one of platelet reactivity assessment methods utilized in the study (VASP assay, MEA, LTA, VerifyNow) best reflects concentration of ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX). Since there is no reference study examining pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor in STEMI or NSTEMI patients, we decided to perform an internal pilot study of approximately 30 patients (15 patients for each arm) for estimating the final sample size.</detailed_description>
