	<brief_summary>Internal jugular venous catheterization is a challenging procedure in pediatric patients due to small size. Overlapping of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and common carotid artery (CCA) may jeopardize the success and increase the complication rate.However, the use of ultrasound as an assistance tool might be helpful to identify the relationship between the IJV and the CCA. Endotracheal intubation and insertion of laryngeal mask are the common options for the airway management during general anesthesia for central venous catheterization. In this observational study, the investigators aimed to investigate the impact of the laryngeal mask insertion or endotracheal intubation and the role of head rotation on the overlap of the IJV and CCA evaluated with ultrasound in pediatric patients undergoing any kind of surgical procedure.</brief_summary>
