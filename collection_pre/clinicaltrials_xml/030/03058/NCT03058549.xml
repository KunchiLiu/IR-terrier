	<brief_title>Impact Evaluation of Family Expectations: A Program to Strengthen the Relationships of Disadvantaged Expectant Couples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The birth of a child can trigger relationship distress and dissolution. Family Expectations (FE) targets the transition to parenthood as a critical time to help couples focus on family success. Regardless of whether couples are married or unmarried, the goal of FE is to strengthen relationships and advance the well-being of economically disadvantaged couples who are expecting a baby or who are new parents, and to improve the lives of their children. The FE program, including the Becoming Parents (BP) curriculum and supplemental services, is designed to address specific risk factors that affect individual family members and the relationships among them, and to build protective factors that help families avoid, minimize, or manage risks (e.g., individual maladaptation [mother, father, child], couple relationship difficulties, parenting difficulties, and economic insufficiency). A total of 1,355 couples will be randomly assigned to either Family Expectations (n = 813; 60%) or an untreated control group (n = 542; 40%). Once assigned, participants in the study will complete baseline questions by survey. Those assigned to the FE track will be scheduled for services with the FE intervention team and the control group will not receive the FE intervention. Members of the intervention and control groups will be surveyed both before they are randomly assigned and 12 months later. The study will examine if the Family Expectations program is associated with improved outcomes on relationship quality, stability, parenting quality, father involvement, child wellbeing, and hopefulness about employment.</detailed_description>
