	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 240 males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two priming doses of M-001 followed by boosting with two doses of MF59-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A/H7N9 IIV. The monovalent influenza A/H7N9 IIV was derived from the HA of the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus. Primary objectives: To assess the safety and reactogenicity of M-001 vaccine following receipt of two doses; To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (A/H7N9 IIV; two doses) administered with or without MF59 adjuvant following immunization with two doses of M-001 vaccine or placebo, and to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to the A/H7N9 IIV virus after receipt of the first and second dose of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV when administered to adults following receipt of placebo or two doses of M-001 vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 240 males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two priming doses of M-001 followed by boosting with two doses of MF59-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A/H7N9 IIV. The monovalent influenza A/H7N9 IIV was derived from the HA of the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus. The duration of this trial for each subject will be approximately 15 months. Primary objectives: To assess the safety and reactogenicity of M-001 vaccine following receipt of two doses; To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (A/H7N9 IIV; two doses) administered with or without MF59 adjuvant following immunization with two doses of M-001 vaccine or placebo, and to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to the A/H7N9 IIV virus after receipt of the first and second dose of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV when administered to adults following receipt of placebo or two doses of M-001 vaccine. Secondary Objectives: To assess unsolicited AEs following receipt of two doses of M-001 or placebo followed by receipt of two doses of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV; To assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) following receipt of two doses of M-001 or placebo followed by receipt of two doses of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV, and to assess the serum neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses to the influenza A/H7N9 vaccine virus after receipt of the first and second dose of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV when administered to adults following receipt of placebo or two doses of M-001 vaccine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. 2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. 3. Are males or nonpregnant females, 18 to 45 years old, inclusive. 4. Are in good health, as determined by vital signs%, medical history, and targeted physical examination to ensure any existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those exclusionary) are stable. Vital signs include oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Stable chronic medical condition no change in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3 months (defined as 90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months (defined as 180 days). Any change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.2)), vitamins, and contraceptives are permitted. 5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0°F. 6. Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive. 7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive. 8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive. 9. Women of childbearing potential‡ must use an acceptable method of contraception§ from 30 days prior to vaccination until 60 days after the last study vaccination. Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or successful Essure® placement (permanent, nonsurgical, nonhormonal sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal).
