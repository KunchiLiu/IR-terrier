	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized clinical trial measuring outcomes up to 6-months post-intervention. The objective of this study is to evaluate outcomes of two different group interventions for Veterans with Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI). The interventions to be compared are Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and an adapted version of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (aCDSMP) for Veterans experiencing symptoms of Chronic Multi-Symptom Illness (CMI) - musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and cognitive failures - especially those who were deployed to Gulf War I. Hypothesis One (re: Outcomes): Participants randomized to the adapted Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (aCDSMP) will derive benefit for the primary outcomes, but with smaller effects than the participants randomized to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). The investigators hypothesize that Veterans randomized to MBSR will report greater reductions in each of the three primary outcome measures (pain, fatigue, and cognitive failures) at 6-month follow-up as compared to aCDSMP. Hypothesis Two (re: Acceptability): MBSR will be an acceptable and satisfactory program for Veterans with CMI, as measured by attendance rates, a self-report measure of satisfaction, and qualitative interviews. The investigators hypothesize that Veterans with CMI randomized to MBSR will report greater satisfaction with care than their peers randomized to aCDSMP.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will enroll 308 participants. Half of these will be Gulf War Veterans who meet criteria for CMI, and the other half will be Veterans from other periods of service who also meet criteria for CMI. Each participant will be randomized to either participate in MBSR or aCDSMP (stratified by Gulf War deployment status so there are ~7-8 Gulf War Veterans in each group for every cohort). Measures to collect primary outcome data (pain, fatigue, cognitive failures, patient satisfaction), secondary outcomes, and potential mediators will be administered at four assessments: (1) Baseline; (2) Post-Intervention; (3) at 3-months after the group ended; and (4) at 6-months after the group ended. Sample demographic data (age, gender, race, income, education, etc.) will be collected at baseline only. All study procedures will take place at VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle, WA.</detailed_description>
