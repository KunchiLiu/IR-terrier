	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to analyze how using the teach-back communication technique can improve patient:provider communication surrounding the discussion of knee replacement options, specifically Total Knee Arthroplasty(TKA) or a Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty(UKA). Orthopedic residents, fellows, physician assistants, and attendings that agree to participate will be consented and patients that have a clinical indication for a TKA and a UKA will be recruited from participating providers clinical schedules. Patient:provider interactions will be recorded and then the providers will attend a 1 hour education lecture about how to use teach-back. After attending the lecture, additional patient:provider interactions will be recorded and analyzed via a qualitative approach. Additionally, providers will participate in a semi-structured interview to capture their perceptions of teach-back and what challenges and benefits they may derive from using it.</brief_summary>
