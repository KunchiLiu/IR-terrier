	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to apply best-practice stated-preference methods to quantify patient preferences for benefit-risk tradeoffs associated with arthroplasty treatment options for end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. Duke will develop and administer stated-preference surveys to adult patients (Ages 40-80) with knee pain to collect preference data, estimate the relative importance of treatment features and outcomes, and estimate maximum acceptable risks for given benefits and minimum acceptable benefits for given harms. This study proposal describes plans for the patient stated-preference survey.</brief_summary>
