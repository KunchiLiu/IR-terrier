	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to look for predisposing mutations in patients and relatives affected by AML and MDS with familial history of myeloid or, less frequently, lymphoid malignancies. Taking advantage of a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, screening for known and unknown mutations potentially associated with the disease will be done. The screening will be performed on affected and unaffected family members, in order to outline new pedigrees that either validate previous findings or constitute novel discoveries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with a diagnosis of AML or MDS with at least one relative affected by AL/MDS or, secondly, lymphoproliferative disorders, will be enrolled into the study, and will be referred to as the index case. The analysis will be performed both retrospectively and prospectively. A gene panel deep sequencing (GPDS) of the tumor DNA from peripheral blood of the index case at diagnosis will be performed in order to identify mutations in a number of genes known to be associated to myeloid malignancies, mainly: ASXL1, BCOR, NRAS, TP53, RUNX1, CEBPA, FLT3, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2, CBL, KRAS, ETV6, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, GATA2, TERT, TERC, SRP72, and ANKRD26. In case none of the known mutations is found by the GPDS, whole exome sequencing (WES) will be performed as second step on the tumor cells of the index case. When one or multiple somatic mutations are found, a Sanger Sequencing (SS) on germline DNA from epithelial buccal cells of the index cases and affected relatives will be performed for the screening of the same somatic leukemic mutations on germline DNA. If the index case and affected relatives share the same mutations on the germline, the same germline mutations will be checked by SS in the unaffected family members.</detailed_description>
