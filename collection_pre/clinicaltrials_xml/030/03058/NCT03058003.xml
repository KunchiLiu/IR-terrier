	<brief_summary>To investigate the use of balance as a screening tool for Central Sensitization, a condition of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic pain. This is done by comparing the scores of a gold standard screening tool (the Central Sensitization Inventory) with balance data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Central Sensitization Inventory and Posturographic Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First, subjects will be asked to answer a brief medical questionnaire pertaining their general health status: since some of the subjects will be self-assessed to be "healthy" (no medical examination will be conducted to determine if this is indeed the case), the questionnaire will be used to determine if there are any possible known causes of poor balance performance. The questionnaire will not constitute an inclusion/exclusion criterion, it just has a classification purpose. Subjects will then be asked to fill in the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI), scoring each of the 25 items on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Then, subjects will stand for 2 minutes on a compliant surface (a 4" tall foam cushion of known mechanical properties) to "learn" how to stand on it. Afterward, they will undergo posturography testing using the extended modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (ext_mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be required to stand on a hard or compliant surface in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, arms to the side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing normally, with head straight, turned right or left, flexed or extended.</detailed_description>
