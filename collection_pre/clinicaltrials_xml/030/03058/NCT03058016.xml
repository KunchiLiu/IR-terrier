	<brief_summary>This clinical study is designed to evaluate the providing of a computational prediction engine for optimization of personalized nutrition Personalized recommendations for effective diet, lifestyle and activities based on the patient's parameters measurements and reactions will be provided on a bi-weekly basis, all Lab tests and dietician control will be performed twice a month.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Nutrition Prediction for Metabolic Syndrome Patients, an Open Single-center Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-diabetic and pre-metabolic syndrome patients will be recruited to the study for a period of one year. After measurement of individual's parameters changes as blood tests, gut microbiome, urine tests, blood pressure, heart performance, body circumferences, mood and mental status as well as monitoring each individual's food intake - a model to predict individual's body reaction according to lifestyle, eating and activity habits will be built. Personalized recommendations for effective diet, lifestyle and activities based on the patient's parameters measurements and reactions will be provided on a bi-weekly basis, all Lab tests and dietician control will be performed twice a month.</detailed_description>
