	<brief_summary>Cancer is a worldwide spread disease with high prevalence and incidence, often of poor prognosis because it is typically diagnosed in an advanced stage. Another reason for this prognosis is the presence of malnutrition, on the one hand because of a diminished intake (due to anorexia), and on the other hand because of tumor-induced hypercatabolism. The result is a pathological state of the body called "cachexia", generally defined as a weight loss &gt; 5% during the last 6 months before diagnosis. It had already been demonstrated that correct nutrition in such patients can limit morbidity, while promoting progression-free survival as well as well-being. The pilot study, previously performed by the investigators, was the first to suggest that Nutrition Therapy, based on the ESPEN guidelines and resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry, can promote overall survival. The aim of this project is to validate these preliminary results in a larger RCT (randomized controlled double-blind trial), to promote Nutrition Therapy as a novel modality in its own right in the treatment of cancer, rather than being merely supportive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tight Caloric Control in the Cachectic Oncologic Patient (TiCaCONCO or CaCoS or CoCoN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the investigators' pilot trial, 20 patients were randomized, 10 receiving regular counseling by regular oncodietitians, while the 10 others received nutrition therapy. In the latter group, an assessment of biophysical parameters was made (including the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis or BIA for body composition), and the patients' Energy Expenditure was assessed using indirect calorimetry. Afterwards, the patients received nutrition therapy according to the ESPEN (European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition) guidelines. Supplementary interventions were made to match caloric intake to energy expenditure (the 'Tight Caloric' approach), using enteral and parenteral nutrition if indicated, by an intensive coaching and follow-up to continue this nutrition strategy (with dieticians even being "on call" after hours). While the study follow-up lasted 2 years, nutrition therapy was only performed during the first 3 months. The results were striking: apart from keeping their body weight in balance, the patients of the nutrition therapy group counted much less unexpected hospitalisation days and they clearly lived much longer . This project targets the validation of these results on a large scale. For this study, patients with either colorectal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, due to their high incidence as well as the high prevalence of cachexia in these patients will be included. Patients will be randomized, and the study is intended to be be double-blinded, although this will be difficult to maintain in practice due to the nature of the treatment. The recruitment phase will last 2 years, keeping refusals and dropouts in mind. Follow-up will last 1 year after inclusion, although the actual nutrition therapy will again last only 3 months: the period of active oncological treatment. An intermediate analysis is already made after 6 months of follow-up. In case survival is already statistically significant, the trial will be stopped for ethical reasons. In case of a positive result, the investigators want to implement nutrition therapy as a standard treatment in cachectic cancer patients in Belgium. In case of a positive outcome (i.e. mere confirmation of our published results), the major advantage of nutrition therapy will be its relatively low cost while still affecting morbidity and mortality significantly. This can be practically achieved by redefining the dietician's task. The patient's own active participation in the decision making process is an important surplus in well-being and overall treatment. In combination with decreased morbidity and mortality the benefit of the patient can be found on every level.</detailed_description>
