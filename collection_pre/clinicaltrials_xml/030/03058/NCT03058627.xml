	<criteria>1. Age â‰¥ 18 years 2. Severe aortic valve stenosis* and selected for TAVI by a multidisciplinary Heart Team 3. Concomitant CAD (at least one stenosis with FFR &lt; 0.80 or diameter stenosis &gt; 90%) And one of the following: 1. Symptomatic (dyspnea corresponding to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or higher, angina pectoris, or cardiac syncope) or 2. Asymptomatic but have a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), new onset of atrial fibrillation, or LV septal hypertrophy 1. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to other severe noncardiac disease 2. Severe renal failure with estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 20 ml/min 3. No PCIeligible coronary artery stenosis, but rotablation is allowed 4. Admitted with a new acute coronary syndrome (STelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or nonSTEMI) within 14 days 5. Significant stenosis in left main stenosis, left main equivalent (proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) + proximal left circumflex artery (LCx)) or proximal LAD + proximal right coronary artery (RCA) 6. Only stenoses with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grad &lt; 3 7. Potential pregnancy 8. Known allergy towards P2Y12 receptor antagonists, heparin or contrast medium 9. More than one chronic total occlusion (CTO)</criteria>
