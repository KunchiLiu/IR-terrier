	<brief_title>A Study Comparing AC0010 and Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced NSCLC Who Have Progressed Following Prior EGFR TKI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase III, open label, randomized study assessing AC0010 (300 mg, BID) versus pemetrexed/cisplatin (4-6 cycles) in patients with advanced NSCLC, who have progressed following prior therapy with EGFR-TKI. Patients must provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation positive. Eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into AC0010 group or pemetrexed/cisplatin group. Patients in chemotherapy group can cross-over to AC0010 treatment when patients experience disease progression or intolerability of chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study is to compare the PFS of AC0010 and pemetrexed/cisplatin.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, aged between 1875 years old. 2. Histological or cytological confirmed diagnosis of locally or metastatic NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV). 3. Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy. 4. Radiological proven disease progression while on first generation EGFR TKIs. 5. At least one measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. 6. Confirmation of tumor EGFR sensitive mutation positive in previous tumor samples, including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q. 7. Confirmation of tumor harboring of T790M mutation by central lab with a biopsy sample taken after failure of first generation EGFR TKIs. 8. Adequate organ function: Bone marrow reserve: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 ´ 109/L,. Platelet count ≥100´ 109/L , Hemoglobin≥9 g/dL Liver function: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;5 times ULN in the presence of liver metastases; Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN Kidney function: Creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN 9. Anticancer treatment prior to EGFR TKIs including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other anticancer drugs for advanced stage is not allowed. 10. Resolved toxicities from prior therapy less than CTCAE grade 1 (except alopecia) and minimum 7 days of washout period from previous erlotinib, gefitinib or icotinib. 11. ECOG performance status 0 to1. 12. Life expectancy more than 3 months. 13. Patients without CNS metastases or asymptomatic patients with brain metastases. End of local therapy for brain metastases, including radiotherapy and surgery is required ≥28 days prior to beginning of screening. 14. Provision of signed informed consent. 1. Active HCV, HBV infection. 2. HIV infection, or other immunodeficiency disease，or history of transplantation. 3. Large field radiation or radiation field covered more than 30% bone marrow within 4 weeks of enrollment. 4. In the investigator opinion, any severe or uncontrolled disease, such as unstable or uncontrolled respiratory, cardiovascular, liver or kidney diseases. 5. Patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow medication, malabsorption syndrome or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of AC0010. 6. Uncontrolled pleural and pericardial effusion. 7. Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association cardiac disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 6 months, heart block with second degree or greater, QTcB &gt; 430ms（male）or &gt; 450ms（female）. 8. Patients receiving medication known to prolong QT interval and potent inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 within 4 weeks of fist dose of AC0010. 9. Previous treatment with osimertinib. 10. Pregnant and lactating women. 11. Malignancies other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception of those with a curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer).</criteria>
