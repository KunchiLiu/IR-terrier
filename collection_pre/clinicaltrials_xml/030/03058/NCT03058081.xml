	<brief_summary>Early pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended after an episode of severe exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, its implementation is challenging particularly as regard exercise training. High flow ventilation in reducing work of breathing and dyspnea may improve exercise tolerance. The aim of this study is to carry out the acute effect of high flow nasal cannula on exercise endurance in post-exacerbation copd patients</brief_summary>
