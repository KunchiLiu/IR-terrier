	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of two different treatments for inhibitory control improvement (measured by the modified Stop signal task): a behavioral treatment based on Retrieval-Extinction Learning, through the AAT (Alcohol Approach Avoiding Task) and a treatment based on the neuromodulation of prefrontal cortex through the rTMS (repetitive transcraneal magnetic stimulation) technique. To carry out this study, 105 alcoholic patients will be compared for clinical variables (abstinence/relapses), self-informed (UPPS) and behvavioral impulsivity (Stop signal task), along with biological measures for polymorphism determinations. Alcohol-dependent individuals will be divided into 4 groups of study (1:1 proportion for Retrieval-Extinction Learning with AAT and 2:1 (double for the effective technique comparing to placebo/control) for rTMS): Group 1 (N=30): exposure to an alcohol-related video followed by AAT; Group 2 (N=30): neutral-content video followed by AAT; Group 4 (30): active stimulation rTMS (10 Hz) ; Group 4 (N=15): placebo stimulation SAM.</detailed_description>
