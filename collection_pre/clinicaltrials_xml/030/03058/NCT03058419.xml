	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential inhibitory/inducing effects of JNJ-54175446 after single and repeated dosing on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of a cocktail, containing selective probes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4/A5, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19) in healthy adult subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), inclusive (BMI = weight/height^2) Subject must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and triplicate 12lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), including QTc according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 450 milliseconds (ms) for males and &lt;/= 470 ms for females, performed at screening and first admission to the study site Subject must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening and Day 1. If the results of the hematology, serology, serum chemistry (excluding liver function tests, which must be in normal range of 1.25 * upper limit of normal laboratory range), and coagulation panel, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically significant During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug, a male subject: Who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository). In addition, their female partner should also use a highly effective method of birth control (example, hormonal contraception) for at least the same duration. Who is sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a condom and Must agree not to donate sperm A female subject must be of nonchildbearing potential at screening Subject has a history of or current liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 60 milliliter per minute (mL/min), significant skin disease such as, but not limited to, dermatitis, eczema, StevensJohnson Syndrome, drug rash, psoriasis or urticaria, significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic (including coagulation disorders), rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances, any inflammatory illness or any other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the subject Subject has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (antiHCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or antiHCV at screening Subject has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for HIV at screening Subject has a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that, in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence) Subject has a history of drug or alcohol use disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMV) criteria within 6 months before screening</criteria>
