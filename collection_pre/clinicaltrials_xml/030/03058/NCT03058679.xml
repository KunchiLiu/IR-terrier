	<brief_summary>This protocol is designed to compare the effectiveness of two dietary interventions for patients with Crohn's disease (CD): the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) and a Mediterranean style diet (MSD) that has been demonstrated to have numerous other health benefits. The two diets will be compared in terms of their ability to resolve both the symptoms and bowel inflammation that characterize this debilitating disease.</brief_summary>
