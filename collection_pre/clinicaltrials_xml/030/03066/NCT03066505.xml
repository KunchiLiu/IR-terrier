	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-blind, Sham-controlled Pilot Study to Evaluate the Treatment Efficacy of Magnetic EEG/ECG-Guided Resonance Therapy (MeRT) in College Students With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy of Magnetic EEG/ECG-Guided Resonance Therapy (MeRT) in college students with ADHD. A total of 40 subjects will be treated. Twenty (20) subjects will receive active treatment with MeRT and the other 20 with sham. Subjects in each study group will be treated 30 min a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. This is known as Phase 1. During this study period, subjects and clinicians will be blind to treatment condition. Subjects will be recruited from a flyer describing the study. The flyer will be posted at the Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity, the McKay Center, and through Student Counseling Services in the Engemann Student Health Center. In addition, students who have been diagnosed with ADHD and have been seen at one of these facilities for ADHD may be provided contact information for the study.</detailed_description>
