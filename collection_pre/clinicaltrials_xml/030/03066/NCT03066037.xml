	<brief_summary>There is a significant debate whether local infiltration techniques may be a method to treat complicated chronic pain syndromes, e.g. refractory headache. Until now there is a lack of evidence regarding efficacy of this treatment especially in long term follow up. Similarly, indication and management are under debate. Aim of this trial is to analyse pain scores during first treatment with anaesthesiological infiltration series.</brief_summary>
