	<brief_summary>The therapeutic scenario of metastatic renal cancer is undergoing a new revolution with the appearance of a novel therapeutic strategy after the antiangiogenic treatments, that is the immunotherapy, in addition to the approval of new active drugs in the following lines of treatment. There are currently two phase III trials in the first line of treatment in metastatic renal cancer that include different combinations of treatment based on immunotherapy. If results of these studies were positive, the therapeutic algorithm would be modified so that the remaining drugs would have to be repositioned within the therapeutic decision scheme. Sunitinib has previously demonstrated its benefit in patients who had failed to prior treatment with cytokines, so it is likely to continue to be effective in patients who have become resistant to treatment with new drugs based on immune checkpoint blockade. This phase II study is developed to evaluate the activity of sunitinib after treatment with immunotherapy-based regimens that are currently being developed within phase III clinical trials.</brief_summary>

Uncontrolled brain metastases, spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease. 10. Any gastrointestinal malabsorption disorder or any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the absorption of sunitinib or increase the risk of bleeding or perforation. 11.
