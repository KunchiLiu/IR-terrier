	<brief_summary>Objectives: To investigate whether respiratory variations of inferior vena cava diameters (cIVC) predict fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients with septic acute circulatory failure and irregular heartbeats. Design: Prospective, bicentric study, intensive care units. Patients and measures: Spontaneously breathing patients with sepsis and clinical signs of acute circulatory failure are included. A positive response to fluid loading (FL) is defined as an increase of the stroke volume (SV) &gt;10%. The investigators measured the minimum inspiratory and maximum expiratory diameters of the IVC (idIVC and edIVC) during standardized (st) and unstandardized (ns) breathing. The investigators calculated cIVCst and cIVCns before a 500ml-colloid FL.</brief_summary>
