	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of scapular muscle fatigue on scapular joint position sense and neuromuscular performance (scapular muscle strength, the kinematics data and muscle activity of shoulder during scaption (arm elevation in the scapular plane)). The investigators hypothesize that scapular muscle fatigue would increase scapular reposition error and affect neuromuscular performance of the scapular during scaption.</brief_summary>
