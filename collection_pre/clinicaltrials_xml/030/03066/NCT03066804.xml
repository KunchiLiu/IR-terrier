	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of LCZ696 over individualized medical therapy for comorbidities in reducing N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and improving HF symptoms and functional capacity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥45% by echo within 6 months prior to study entry or during the screening epoch Symptom(s) of heart failure (HF) requiring treatment with diuretics (including loop, or thiazide diuretics, or mineralocorticoid antagonist [MRAs]) for at least 30 days prior to study entry NYHA class IIIV Structural heart disease (left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy) documented by echocardiogram. NTproBNP &gt; 220 pg/mL for patients with no atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF) or &gt;600 pg/mL for patients with AF KCCQ clinical summary score &lt; 75 Patients on ACEi or ARB therapy must have a history of HTN Any prior measurement of LVEF &lt; 40% Acute coronary syndrome (including MI), cardiac surgery, other major CV surgery within 3 months , or urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 3 months or an elective PCI within 30 days prior to study entry Any clinical event within the 6 months prior to Visit 1 that could have reduced the LVEF (eg MI, coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]), unless an echo measurement was performed after the event confirming the LVEF to be ≥ 40% and EF ≥ 45% by the time of screening Current acute decompensated HF requiring therapy. Current use of renin inhibitor(s) History of hypersensitivity to LCZ696 or its components Patients with a known history of angioedema Walking distance primarily limited by noncardiac comorbid conditions Alternative reason for shortness of breath such as: significant pulmonary disease or severe COPD, hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;10 g/dL males and &lt; 9.5 g/dL females, or body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m^2. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mmHg at study entry, or SBP &gt;150 mmHg and &lt;180 mmHg at study entry unless the patient is receiving 3 or more antihypertensive drugs, or SBP &lt; 110 mmHg at study entry. Patients with HbA1c &gt; 7.5% not treated for diabetes Patients with prior major organ transplant or intent to transplant (ie on transplant list) eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m^2 as measured by MDRD at screening Serum potassium &gt; 5.2 mmol /L at study entry History or presence of any other disease with a life expectancy of &lt; 3 years Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
