	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open label study of BriaVax™, a targeted immunotherapy for breast cancer. Eligible patients will have histological confirmation of breast cancer with recurrent and/or metastatic lesions. The treatment regimen includes a pre-treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide 2-3 days before the vaccination; inoculation of the vaccine in 4 sites on the thighs and upper back; and post-treatment inoculation of Interferon-alpha-2b into the sites of vaccination ~2 and 4 days after the vaccination. These is repeated every 2 weeks for one month (3 treatments), then monthly for up to one year. Standard tumor assessments are performed at baseline and then every 3 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BriaVax™ in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, open label study of BriaVax™ in recurrent and/or metastatic breast cancer. The detailed treatment regimen follows: Pre-Vaccine Regimen: Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 300 mg/m2 I.V., 1x only, will be given 48-72 hours before each vaccine, with an antiemetic of the provider's choice (steroids prohibited). Vaccine Day Standard Operating Procedures: 1. Inquire regarding events of past weeks, change in medications, pain scale, ECOG scale, and review of systems. 2. Check vaccine injection sites. 3. Perform DTH skin test intra-dermally with the BriaVax™ parent cell line (~1e6 irradiated tumor cells). Observe about 20 minutes for acute hypersensitivity. Grade III or higher acute hypersensitivity will abort therapy. 4. Inject vaccine 0.5 ml intra-dermally into thighs and upper back. Monitor patients for 60 minutes. Vital signs will be assessed and medical attention will be warranted if unstable. Vaccine Preparation &amp; Inoculation Regimen: Each vaccine inoculation will be administered via intra-dermal injection at the investigational sites. Subjects will receive 15-25 x 106 viable, irradiated transfected breast tumor cells in a total volume of 2.0 ml Ringer's lactate. Tumor vaccine cells will be irradiated to ensure cell replication incompetency. Vaccine will be divided into four aliquots of 0.5 ml each and prepared with coded study labels "Investigational Use Only", and hand-delivered by qualified sponsor's staff to the principal investigator's office on the day of the scheduled inoculation, where it will be injected intra-dermally; one each into the anterior skin of the subject's right and left thighs and over the right and left upper back . Application of anesthetic lidocaine crème may be used if necessary for control of local pain before inoculation. Subjects will be monitored for 60 minutes. After at least 9 subjects have been treated safely with this regimen, the dose of BriaVax™ may be escalated or decreased in subsequent patients based on the emerging data. Post-Inoculation Regimen: 48 hours (±24 hours) after vaccine, and again 96 hours (±24 hours) later after vaccine, the patient will return to the principal investigator's office to receive Interferon-alpha-2b (Merck) in 0.1 ml saline, prepared as follows: These will also be provided by the sponsor in individual syringes with coded labels, and injected intra-dermally to each vaccine site, beneath the thickest area. Again, subjects will be observed about 20 minutes. The DTH response will also be recorded in the EDC at the 48 hour (±24 hours) visit. This vaccine cycle will be performed every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment (3 vaccinations), and then every month for up to one year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have histological confirmation of breast cancer with recurrent and/or metastatic lesions via investigational site. Patients with new or progressive breast cancer metastatic to brain will be eligible provided: 1. There is no need for steroids and patients have not had steroids at least 2 weeks 2. No individual tumor size is &gt;50 mm3 3. ECOG status &lt;3 4. Tumor is not impinging on Middle Cerebral Artery/speechmotor strip 5. If surgically debulked, must be healed from surgery and at least 3 weeks have elapsed since general anesthesia 6. Patients consent to MRI studies at 34 week intervals until evidence of tumor regression on at least 2 imaging studies. In no case, will the interval between MRI studies be longer than 3 months. MRI study may be introduced at any time should the patients develop new or clearly worsening symptoms and/or introduction of steroids 2. Have evidence of persistent, recurrent, or progressive disease for which there is no known or established treatment available with curative intent, after failing at least one course of community standard systemic treatment with chemotherapy (and endocrine therapy if appropriate) 3. Be 18 years of age or older and female 4. Have expected survival of at least 4 months 5. Have adequate performance status (ECOG 02) 6. Patients may be maintained on hormonal therapy provided there is clear evidence of tumor progression 7. Have provided written informed consent. 1. Concurrent or recent chemotherapy (within 3 weeks), XRT within 3 weeks, may have had immunotherapy in the past (off within 3 weeks), or general anesthesia/major surgery (within 3 weeks). Patients must have recovered from all known or expected toxicities from previous treatment and passed a treatmentfree "washout" period of 3 weeks before starting this program (8 weeks for persons receiving nitrosourea or mitomycin). 2. History of clinical hypersensitivity to GMCSF, Interferonalpha2b (Merck), yeast, beef, or to any components used in the preparation of the experimental vaccine. 3. BUN &gt;30 and a creatinine &gt;2. 4. Absolute granulocyte count &lt; 1000; platelets &lt;100,000. 5. Bilirubin &gt;2.0; alkaline phosphatase &gt;5x upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT/AST &gt;2x ULN. 6. Proteinuria &gt;1+ on urinalysis or &gt;1 gm/24hr. 7. Any woman of childbearing potential, unless she: 1. Agrees to take measures to avoid becoming pregnant during the study and 2. Has a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment. 8. Women who are pregnant or nursing. 9. Patients with concurrent second malignancy. Persons with previous malignancies effectively treated and not requiring treatment for &gt;24 months are eligible, provided there is unambiguous documentation that current local recurrence or metastatic site represents recurrence of the primary breast malignancy. 10. Patients who are HIV positive (by selfreport) or have clinical or laboratory features indicative of AIDS. 11. Patients who require anticoagulation, systemic steroids, statin therapy or betablocker therapy. The betablocker might compromise use of epinephrine for the rare possibility of anaphylaxis. Hypertension controlled by other agents does not disqualify, provided other criteria are met. 12. Patients who are on treatment for rheumatological or autoimmune disease. 13. Patients with severe psychiatric (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar, or borderline personality disorder) or other clinically progressive major medical problems, unless approved by the PI. 14. Male breast cancer patients. 15. Patients may not be on a concurrent clinical trial, unless approved by PI.</criteria>
