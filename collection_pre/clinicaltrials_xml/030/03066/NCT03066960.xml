	<brief_summary>The researchers are planning a two-center double blind, sham-controlled randomized trial (N: 44) to assess the long term efficacy of RF neurotomy of cervical medial branches. Patients with chronic neck pain who are found eligible and achieve &gt;75% pain relief to predictive test blocks, can be included. Demographic and clinical data will be recorded at baseline while primary and secondary outcome measurements are recollected after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Primary outcome measurements include self reported neck function (NDI) and pain relief. Regression analyses will be used to identify how &gt;75% pain relief of a two blocks predicts response to RF neurotomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Neurotomy for Chronic Facet Joint Related Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic neck pain represents a common health problem. The mechanisms appear to be multifactorial. Researchers have suggested a disturbed interplay between the neck muscles and the facet joints. In Europe and the US radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN) has become a common treatment. The evidence base, however, is still insufficient. Thus, a double blind, sham-controlled, randomized, two-center trial will be carried out including 44 participants. To simplify the data collection a digital internet based program will be used. Patients with chronic neck pain, referred to Oslo University Hospital or St Olavs University Hospital and not responding to non-interventional treatment, will be screened. Those who are found eligible and achieve &gt;75% pain relief to predictive test blocks, can be included. Demographic and clinical data will be recorded at baseline and the primary and secondary outcome measurements are recollected after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Primary outcome measurements include self reported neck function (NDI) and pain relief. Regression analyses will be used to identify how 75% pain relief of two test blocks and pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale = PCS) predict response to RF neurotomy . If RF neurotomy is found superior to sham treatment, this may be implemented in the national treatment program for selected patients with chronic neck pain.</detailed_description>
