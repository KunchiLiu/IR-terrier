	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo on Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction at Week 26 in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who have inadequate glycemic control with a sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin. Secondary Objectives: - To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo based on: - Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). - Change from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for patients with baseline SBP ≥130 mm Hg. - Change from baseline in SBP for all patients. - Change from baseline in body weight. - Proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt;6.5% and &lt;7.0%. - To evaluate the safety of sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo throughout the 79-week trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration per patient is up to 85 weeks, including a Screening Period consisting of a Screening phase of up to 2 weeks and a 2-week single-blind Run-in phase, a 26-week double blind Core Treatment Period, a 53 week double blind Extension, and a 2-week post treatment Follow-up period to collect safety information.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Patients with T2D treated with a sulfonylurea (≥half the maximum recommended dose as per local label or maximum tolerated dose [documented]) as monotherapy or in combination with metformin (≥1500 mg per day or maximum tolerated dose [documented]) each at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks without a dose adjustment before screening. Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: At the time of screening, age &lt;18 years or &lt; legal age of majority, whichever is greater. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤20 or &gt;45 kg/m² at Screening Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &lt;7% or HbA1c &gt;10% via central lab test at screening. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt;15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) measured by the central laboratory at screening (Visit 1), and confirmed (&gt;15 mmol/L [270 mg/dL]) by a repeat test before randomization. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method. Treated with an antidiabetic pharmacological regimen other than a sulfonylurea at a stable dose with or without metformin within 12 weeks preceding the screening visit. Previous insulin use &gt;1 month (at any time, aside from treatment of gestational diabetes). History of prior gastric surgical procedure including gastric banding or inflammatory bowel disease within 3 years before the Screening Visit. History of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. History of severe hypoglycemia within 6 months prior to the Screening visit. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;100 mmHg or history of hypertensive emergency. Aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase: &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (ULN). Total bilirubin: &gt;1.5 times ULN (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome). Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical or ophthalmic, application or inhaled forms) for more than 10 consecutive days within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit. Pregnancy, breastfeeding. Patient is unwilling to perform selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and complete the patient's diary as required per protocol. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
