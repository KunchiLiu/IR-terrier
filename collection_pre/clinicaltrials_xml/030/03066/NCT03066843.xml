	<brief_summary>This is a randomized clinical trial evaluating blue light 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy with different incubation times for the treatment of actinic keratosis. Subjects who are interested in participating, currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area, and meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized to either 1) zero time ALA incubation or 2) 1 hour ALA incubation. Demographic and health data will be collected prior to treatment initiation.
