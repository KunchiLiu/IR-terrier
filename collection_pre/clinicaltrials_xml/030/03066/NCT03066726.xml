	<brief_summary>Ultrasound Doppler studies are used during pregnancy to help manage pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction. The cerebroplacental ratio may predict adverse outcomes in low risk pregnancies. In a prospective study, the investigators will examine whether fetuses with an abnormal CPR at or near term are at increased risk for being delivered by cesarean,</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does the Cerebroplacental Ratio (CPR) Predict Adverse Outcomes in Low Risk Pregnancies?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter prospective study of low-risk nulliparous women who will be recruited if they are having an ultrasound at 36 weeks of estimated gestational age or greater. As part of the study, women will have umbilical and middle cerebral artery Doppler studies and the CPR will be calculated by dividing the middle cerebral artery PI by the umbilical artery PI. Providers caring for study subjects will be blinded to this result. Pregnancy outcomes in women with CPR values less than the 10th percentile for gestational age will be compared to those with CPR values above the 10th percentile. A secondary aim of the study is to analyze CPR as a continuous variable.</detailed_description>
