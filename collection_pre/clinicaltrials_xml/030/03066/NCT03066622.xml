	<brief_title>Olanzapine for Acute Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Question: Does oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine provide efficacious analgesia in patients with acute headache of non-organic origin (primary headache) who come to the ED for abortive therapy when compared to current standard of care? Secondary Aim: Additionally, the study will aim to see if oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine decreases 1) duration of ED length of stay and 2) need for IV access when compared to the current standard of care. This is a prospective, randomized, convenience sample, feasibility trial to test for non-inferiority of oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine versus current emergency department standard of care in providing symptomatic relief to patients presenting with primary headache.</detailed_description>
