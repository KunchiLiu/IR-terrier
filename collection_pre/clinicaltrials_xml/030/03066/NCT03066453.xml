	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy with any antibiotic (IV) and IV (Nebcin®) tobramycin for 5 days followed by Solution for nebuliser inhalation (Tobi®) for 9 days and antibiotic cures using 14 days of tobramycin IV. In the case of positive results, the reduction of the duration of IV treatment of tobramycin from 14 days to 5 days would limit the risk of toxicity.</brief_summary>
