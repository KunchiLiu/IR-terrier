	<brief_summary>Introduction: Graves disease (GD) is characterized by thyrotoxicosis and goiter, arising through circulating autoantibodies that bind to and stimulate the thyroid hormone receptor (TSHR). Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is characterized by inflammation, expansion of the extraocular muscles and an increase in retroorbital fat. There are currently three forms of therapies offered: anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) (thionamides), radioactive iodine (RAI) and total thyroidectomy (Tx). There is currently no consensus on the treatment of Grave's disease and GO. Objective: To examine the difference in the outcome of GO in patients with moderate-to-severe GO, who receive Tx versus further ATD after suffering their first relapse of GO or in which GO stays the same following the initial decrease in ATD therapy after 6 months. Methods: This prospective randomized clinical trial with observer blinded analysis will analyze 60 patients with moderate-to-severe GO who receive Tx versus ATD without surgery. Main outcome variables include: muscle index measurements via ultrasound and thyroid antibody levels. Additional outcome variables include: CAScore/NOSPECS score, superonasal index measurements via ultrasound and quality of life score.</brief_summary>
