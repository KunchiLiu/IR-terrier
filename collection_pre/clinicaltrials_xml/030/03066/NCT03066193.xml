	<brief_summary>This is an investigator-initiated proof of concept study with the purpose to examine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of Dronabinol (synthetic Î”9-THC) and PEA for the treatment of adults with Tourette syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Therapeutic Combination of Dronabinol and PEA for Tourette Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a 12-week, investigator-initiated, open-label trial of a therapeutic combination of Dronabinol and PEA in 18 adults with Tourette syndrome. Participants will receive Dronabinol and PEA in combination for the duration of the trial. The goal for this pilot study is to (1) provide initial safety, feasibility and tolerability data on both Dronabinol and PEA in a TS population and (2) provide data in order to make a more informed decision regarding the appropriate sample size and design of a larger clinical trial to prove efficacy (i.e. sample size and trial duration in large efficacy trial of the Dronabinol/PEA combination in TS).</detailed_description>
