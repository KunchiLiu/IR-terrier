	<brief_summary>This study is designed as a randomized, single blind (data evaluation), placebo controlled, full cross-over study and conducted in 166 (including 10% drop out) males and females, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 and waist circumference of &gt;80 cm for women and &gt;94 cm for men (indicating increased risk of metabolic complications (WHO)) and having a sedentary lifestyle. Subjects will receive rice with a tea extract and rice without a tea extract. There will be three visits to the test facility: one screening visit and two intervention visits. During the intervention visits venous blood samples will be collected for the analysis of plasma glucose (t = -30m, -5m, 15m, 30m, 45m, 1h, 1h 30m, 2h and 3h, relative to the start of rice consumption ) and serum insulin (t = -5m, 30m, 1h, 2h and 3h). Between the two intervention visits subjects have an interval of one week. This interval is required to minimize subject discomfort from repeated blood sampling.</brief_summary>
