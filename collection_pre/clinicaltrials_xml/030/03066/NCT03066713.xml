	<brief_title>Post-prandial Glucose Response From Phytochemical Rich Potato Products</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary results from anthocyanin rich potato products suggest that a reduced postprandial glycemic response might be expected from certain types of potato products and that phenolic antioxidants may play a critical role in predicting the physiological response from potato products. Further, if consumed early in the day, such as at breakfast, a reduced glycemic response may serve to mitigate appetite and food consumption later in the day. Investigators aim to better understand how characteristics of commercial potato products (i.e. frozen potato products) with different phenolic profiles and content, may alter postprandial glycemic response and subsequent appetitive behavior. Specifically, investigators will assess the glycemic response from a serving of potato products in the morning using continuous glucose monitoring. Further, appetite and subsequent food consumption later in the day will be assessed through appetite logs and continuous glucose monitoring.</detailed_description>
