	<brief_summary>This project evaluates Real Relationships, a program provided by the Children's Aid Society (CAS) in Clearfield County, and funded through the DHHS Healthy Marriage (and Responsible Fatherhood) program. Research questions focus on recruitment and retention of participants, and short- and long-term participant outcomes associated with different formats for offering the program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Evaluation of Real Relationships</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only adult participants living in the community are included in the local evaluation. Three research questions are examined in detail by the local evaluation. First, what recruitment strategies are most effective in the rural service area of Real Relationships? The answers to this research question will increase the CAS's and the funder's understanding of recruitment in rural areas. Secondly, what are barriers to Real Relationships class/workshop attendance for adults who enrolled but did not participate in any workshops? Again, answers to this research question will increase CAS's and the funder's understanding of barriers to retention (from the point of entry into the program to when participation begins), particularly in rural areas. A better understanding of barriers at this point of the enrollment process can be used to develop programming that helps to avoid these barriers, and the development of programming aimed at reaching populations that have been missed due to specific barriers. Third, how do short- and long-term outcomes for participants who complete their Real Relationships class/workshop differ by the format of the class/workshop format (i.e., weekend workshop, multi-week classes)? The answers to this research question will increase CAS's and the funder's understanding of programming in this field by adding to the knowledge base regarding the most effective formats for achieving the outcomes relevant to the goals of Real Relationships. Results will also speak to the importance of other activities, such as case management and parenting classes, for achieving desired outcomes.</detailed_description>
