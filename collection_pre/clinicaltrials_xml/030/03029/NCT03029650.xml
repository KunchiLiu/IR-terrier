	<brief_title>Scopolamine Patch Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) available in the form of patches are convenient, attractive, and easy to use systems. Scopolamine patches are very popular TDDS available on the United States market today. Accurate determination of the rate and extent of drug release and absorption is crucial to ensure the safety of individuals using these and other types of patches. Delivery rate can be determined early in the development process by using in vitro skin flux permeation studies, and later in humans by accurately quantifying residual drug from patches post-wear and in pharmacokinetic studies. In this proposal, the investigators will employ two types of evaluation to determine the rate and extent of drug release and absorption from RLD (reference listed drug) Transderm Scop® TDDS (transdermal drug delivery system), namely residual drug analysis post-wear and pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy adult volunteers. In addition, the investigators will compare the plasma drug concentrations following patch and intravenous administration of Scopolamine, in order to determine the absolute bioavailability of these patches. The investigators will conduct residual drug analysis of TDDS following in vivo wear using highly sensitive validated quantification methods. Positive outcomes of this project will identify appropriate methods to determine the rate and extent of drug release and absorption from TDDS, and will help regulatory agencies in the development of Guidances for Industry regarding the characterization of drug release and absorption kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals utilizing these types of products</detailed_description>
