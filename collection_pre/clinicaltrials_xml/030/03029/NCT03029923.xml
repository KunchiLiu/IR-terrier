	<brief_summary>Quitting smoking following acute coronary syndrome can reduce mortality up to 50%. However, depression and smoking are highly co-morbid and depressed mood may interfere with cessation and independently predicts mortality. Thus, a single, integrated treatment for both smoking and depression could be highly effective in reducing post-acute coronary syndrome mortality. Behavioral Activation (BA) is a well established treatment for depression and has recently shown promise as a treatment for smoking cessation. The investigators systematically developed an intervention integrating gold standard smoking cessation counseling with existing BA based mood management techniques for post-ACS smokers; Behavioral Activation Treatment for Cardiac Smokers (BAT-CS). Objective: For this R56 the investigators will conduct a vanguard trial to pilot all methods, materials, and systems for the later fully powered BAT-CS vs. attention control trial. The investigators will enroll up to 36 smokers with ACS and randomize them to 12 weeks of BAT-CS or an attention control (Health and Wellness Education). Both groups will be offered the nicotine patch if medically safe.</brief_summary>
