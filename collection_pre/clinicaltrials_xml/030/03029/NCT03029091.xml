	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial of Losartan Potassium in Participants With Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of Losartan potassium to see what effects (good and bad) it has on participants and their Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). If a subject has Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) the researchers want to see what effects (good or bad) Losartan has on EoE. EoE is an inflammatory disease in the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach) that is typically triggered by exposure to certain things in food. Connective Tissue Disorders (CTDs) are disorders that affect the connective tissues in the body, such as fat, bone, and cartilage. Eosinophils release a protein called TGF-beta. Losartan may decrease the amount of the protein and therefore help EoE and CTD. Losartan is a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults and children over 6 years of age who have high blood pressure. This medication has not been studied in people with EoE.</detailed_description>

Intolerance to losartan A mean blood pressure measurement (both systolic and diastolic) at screening that is below the 2nd percentile for his/her age Renal dysfunction Another disorder that causes esophageal eosinophilia (e.g., hypereosinophilic syndrome, Churg Strauss vasculitis, eosinophilic granuloma, or a parasitic infection). A diagnosis of hepatic insufficiency. A history of abnormal gastric or duodenal biopsy or documented gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Celiac Disease, Crohn's disease or Helicobacter pylori infection), not including chronic gastritis, chronic duodenitis, mucosal eosinophilia or other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs). Use of antiIgE monoclonal antibody (mAb), antitumor necrosis factor [TNF] mAb, antiIL5 agents, or antiIL13 within 6 months prior to study entry Use of methotrexate, cyclosporine, interferon α, or other systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents within 3 months prior to the screening visit. A stricture during endoscopy procedure that prevents passage of the endoscope Taking or is planning to take an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), beta blocker (BB), or calciumchannel blocker therapy at the screening visit or at any time during the study or has been taking any of these medications for 3 months prior to the screening visit. Taking or planning to take hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine, phenobarbital, rifampin, or fluconazole. taking or planning to take potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium. A female participant who is pregnant or nursing or, if of childbearing potential, is not using a medically accepted, effective method of birth control (e.g., condom, oral/injectable/subcutaneous contraceptive, intrauterine device, or sexual abstinence). Participated/participating in any investigative drug or device study within 30 days prior to study entry. Participated/participating in any investigative biologics study within 3 months prior to study entry. Unable to be confirmed, active EoE (at Screening or within 12 weeks prior to enrollment)</criteria>
