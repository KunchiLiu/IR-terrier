	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the utility of hypoxic exercise training to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health among obese breast cancer survivors. While participants exercise, a lower fraction of inspired oxygen will be used to simulate a higher altitude. This approach removes the mechanical strain needed to sustain moderate-to-vigorous exercise intensity which is believed to support exercise tolerance. Participants are randomized to either the treatment (walking+simulated-altitude) or control (walking under normoxic conditions).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulated-altitude to Optimize Aerobic Exercise Among Breast Cancer Survivors With Limited Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer survivors have a two-fold greater risk of having one or more functional limitations compared to those without a history of cancer. Though exercise interventions in breast cancer survivors exist, a large portion of women (61%) exhibit some form of lower-body dysfunction that severely restricts participation in physical activity and exercise. Both physical and emotional well-being are negatively affected by the combination of increased adiposity, orthopedic problems and muscle weakness, thus reinforcing a cycle of physical inactivity. For these reasons, obese breast cancer survivors with walking limitations are faced with a barrier that greatly increases the difficulty of meeting prescribed exercise guidelines (≥150 weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise). Though previous investigations have demonstrated the safety and benefits of exercise+simulated altitude to improve body fat, physical endurance and insulin sensitivity, results have been limited to non-cancer participants only. Given the comorbidities common to breast cancer survivors, specifically, heart disease risk, lower body joint problems, low aerobic capacity, and fatigue, further research is needed.</detailed_description>
