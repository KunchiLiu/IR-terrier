	<criteria>Multiple myeloma Subjects must have measurable disease, defined as one or more of the following: Serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours In subjects without detectable serum or urine Mprotein, SFLC &gt; 100 mg/L (involved light chain) and an abnormal κ/λ ratio Subjects must have been responsive (ie, achieved a minimal response [MR] or better) to at least one of their prior treatment regimens Refractory to the most recently received therapy. Refractory disease defined as ≤ 25% response to, or progressing during therapy or within 60 days after completion of therapy Subjects must have received ≥ 2 prior regimens. Induction therapy and stem cell transplant (± maintenance) will be considered as 1 regimen Subjects must have received prior treatment with bortezomib and an IMiD Subjects must have received an alkylating agent or anthracycline alone or in combination with other myeloma treatments (this may include high dose melphalan as part of the conditioning regimen prior to a stem cell transplant) Males and females ≥ 18 years of age Life expectancy of more than 3 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 02 Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin &lt; 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3.0 times the ULN Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 Subjects should not have received platelet transfusions for at least 1 week prior to obtaining the screening platelet count Screening ANC should be independent of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) support for ≥ 1 week and pegylated GCSF for ≥ 2 weeks Use of erythropoietic stimulating factors and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions per institutional guidelines is allowed; however, most recent RBC transfusion may not have been done within 7 days prior to obtaining screening hemoglobin Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 30 mL/min. Calculated CrCl should be performed by using a widely accepted equation (eg, the Cockcroft and Gault equation): ([140 Age] × Mass [kg] / [72 × Creatinine mg/dL]). Multiply the result by 0.85 if the subject is female. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%; 2dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) is the preferred method of evaluation; multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) is acceptable if ECHO is not available Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 21 days prior to enrollment and agree to use an effective method of contraception during and for 30 days following last dose of carfilzomib. This protocol defines a FCBP as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) Male subjects must use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of carfilzomib if sexually active with a FCBP. Male subjects must not donate sperm during treatment and for an additional 90 days after last dose of carfilzomib. Male subjects with pregnant partners must practice sexual abstinence or use a condom during vaginal sex Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or immunoglobulin M (IgM) multiple myeloma Subjects who failed to achieve at least a confirmed MR on any of their prior regimens Subjects with nonsecretory multiple myeloma, defined as &lt; 1 g/dL Mprotein in serum and &lt; 200 mg/24 hour M protein in urine and SFLC ≤ 100 mg/L (involved light chain) Glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone &gt; 10 mg/day or equivalent) within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) Plasma cell leukemia (&gt; 2.0 × 109/L circulating plasma cells by standard differential) Chemotherapy with approved or investigative anticancer therapeutics including steroid therapy within the 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Radiation therapy or immunotherapy in the 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; localized radiation therapy within 1 week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Participation in an investigational therapeutic study within 3 weeks or within 5 drug halflives (T½) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, whichever time is greater Prior treatment with carfilzomib Major surgery within 3 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 Congestive heart failure ([CHF] New York Heart Association Class III to IV), symptomatic ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional intervention, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Uncontrolled hypertension (a sustained systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg) Acute active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Known HIV seropositive, hepatitis C infection, and/or hepatitis B (except for patients with hepatitis B surface antigen or core antibody receiving and responding to antiviral therapy directed at hepatitis B: these patients are allowed) Nonhematologic malignancy within the past 3 years except: Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, Carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or Prostate cancer &lt; Gleason Score 6 with stable prostatespecific antigen Subjects with treatmentrelated myelodysplastic syndrome Significant neuropathy (Grade 3, 4, or Grade 2 with pain) at the time of baseline evaluation Subjects in whom the required program of PO or IV fluid hydration is contraindicated, eg, due to preexisting pulmonary, cardiac, or renal impairment Subjects with known or suspected amyloidosis Subjects with pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis Subjects with ascites requiring paracentesis Any clinically significant medical disease or condition, that in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed consent Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or planning to become pregnant during treatment and for an additional 30 days after discontinuing carfilzomib. Serious psychiatric or medical conditions that could interfere with treatment</criteria>
