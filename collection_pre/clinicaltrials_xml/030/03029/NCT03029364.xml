	<brief_summary>The ability to upregulate fat oxidation at appropriate times such as during fasting, low to moderate intensity exercise and after a high fat meal, is an important marker of health and a determinant of optimal endurance performance. Maximal fat oxidation reportedly occurs at an exercise intensity between 45 - 65% of maximal oxygen capacity with large between-subject variability apparent. Numerous factors have been associated with maximal fat oxidation, but a large amount of variance remains unexplained. Additionally, the within-subject variability of maximal fat oxidation has not been systematically evaluated, but may partially account for the reported between-subject variability and thus, only once measured can determinants of maximal fat oxidation be more precisely determined. The investigators want to further explore determinants of and investigate the within-subject variability of fat oxidation during exercise in a wide range of 'healthy' and 'at risk of metabolic disease' adults. By investigating these processes this work will explore how nutrition and exercise can be optimised to improve health and weight loss.</brief_summary>
