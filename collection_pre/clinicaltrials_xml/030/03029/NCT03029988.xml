	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the use of Tc 99m tilmanocept as an imaging agent in subjects with known active liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma by comparing previously acquired (within 30 days of tilmanocept injection) FDG PET images .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Tilmanocept by IV Injection and SC Injection vs PET Imaging in Subjects With Liver Metastases.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Tc 99m tilmanocept administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. SPECT/CT imaging of the subject's abdominal cavity will be reviewed to establish concordance with images previously acquired with FDG PET imaging. This study is designed to evaluate the use of Tc 99m tilmanocept as an imaging agent in subjects with known active liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma by comparing previously acquired (within 30 days of tilmanocept injection) FDG PET images .</detailed_description>
