	<brief_summary>Hypertension is the most common risk factor for development of stroke, congestive heart failure chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease in Sub Saharan Africa. The prevalence of hypertension will increase by 2025 in most parts of the world including Ethiopia according to World Health Organization. Physical inactivity has been identified as a stronger predictor of chronic diseases such as hypertension. Exercise as a lifestyle modification is beneficial to a wide variety of health conditions, specific to hypertension; the benefits of exercise have been promoted by a number of organizations and agencies including World Health Organization. According to the knowledge of the investigator there are no research works in relation to aerobic and resistance exercise effects among hypertensive patients generally in Ethiopia, and particularly in the area selected for the present research. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess the effect of aerobic and resistance exercises on selected anthropometric, biochemical and physiological variables among hypertensive patients in Hawassa University Referral Hospital.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For eligible participants the requirements of the study will be explained and agree voluntarily to undergo the training and testing program. During orientation for each participant the risks, purpose, procedures and confidentiality of the requirement of the experiment testing as well as training protocol will be explained thoroughly prior to their written informed consent in their local language, and they have a full right to refuse from participating in this research or they have also the full right to withdraw from this study at any time they wish. After acquisition of informed consent and exclusion criteria eligible participants will be randomized to one of four groups. Sequence allocation will be done by an individual who do not know and have no contact with the study participants . Statistical analyses will be done using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS Version 20). One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess differences between initial values of the four groups on all the variables measured. In addition, the effect of the experimental treatments on the anthropometric, biochemical and physiological variables will be examined by using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</detailed_description>
