	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the effect of tension neural mobilization versus sliding neural mobilization of the peroneal nerve on the heat and cold threshold, on pressure pain threshold and on flexibility both in the dominant lower limb (subjected to mobilization) and the non-dominant lower limb (not subjected to mobilization) in healthy young participants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty young and healthy participants will be randomly allocated to receive tension neural mobilization (n=30) or sliding neural mobilization (n=30). Data on heat threshold, cold threshold, pressure pain threshold and lower limb flexibility will be collected before the intervention, immediately after the intervention and at least 24h after the intervention.</detailed_description>
