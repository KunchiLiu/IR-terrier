	<brief_title>iQuit Mindfully: Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a pilot investigation of mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment incorporating between-session text messaging ("iQuit Mindfully"). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Mindfulness-based Addiction Treatment (MBAT) or iQuit Mindfully (MBAT with the addition of between-session text messages). All participants will receive in-person group treatment based on the 8-week MBAT protocol in addition to nicotine patch therapy and self-help materials. Participants assigned to iQuit Mindfully will receive additional support via text messaging. Assessments will occur at baseline, at each of the weekly in-person visits, at end of treatment, and at 1-month follow-up. Feasibility, smoking abstinence, mindfulness practice, and indicators of tobacco dependence and psychological well-being will be assessed.</detailed_description>
