	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate NanoPac administered intraperitoneally (IP) immediately post-second cytoreductive surgery, followed by standard of care (SOC) intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, in women with with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. The study will compare four concentrations of IP NanoPac (plus IV chemotherapy) with SOC IV chemotherapy alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Intraperitoneal NanoPac in Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Stage III Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard of care for women experiencing a recurrence of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer is cytoreductive surgery followed by intravenous (IV) chemotherapy with a platinum agent (e.g., carboplatin) and a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel). Research has shown that the administration of chemotherapy directly into the peritoneal cavity (intraperitoneal [IP] chemotherapy) may provide a significant survival benefit to women with ovarian cancer when combined with cytoreductive surgery and IV chemotherapy. This study will include a dose-finding phase and an efficacy phase to evaluate IP NanoPac administered immediately post-second cytoreductive surgery in women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In the dose-finding phase, subjects will be enrolled in dose-escalated cohorts of three subjects and receive IP NanoPac at 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/m2 plus standard of care (SOC) IV chemotherapy. Subjects will be followed for disease status for 12 months. The two best doses from the dose-finding phase will be determined. In the efficacy phase, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the two best doses plus SOC IV chemotherapy or SOC alone.</detailed_description>
