	<brief_summary>Obesity and asthma share changes that may begin in the fetal development phase. The endophenotype obesity-asthma presents as main characteristic a pattern of inflammatory response different from the habitual Th2 profile of cytokines. In these obese patients, possible changes in the diaphragm muscle can directly influence the dynamics of pulmonary ventilation significantly. Due to the importance of the diaphragm in pulmonary ventilation, this study will be performed to verify possible alteration in the excursion and diaphragmatic thickness of adolescents with endophenotype obesity-asthma. In parallel, the possible underlying etiopathogenic substrate of this endophenotype will be explored through the dosing of muscle enzymes and inflammatory cytokines and obesity hormones.</brief_summary>
