	<brief_summary>Arrhythmias accompany septic shock in increased rates than in other ICU cohorts and their presence and management are related to patientÂ´s prognosis. 1c class antiarrhythmics are seldom administered in intensive care due to a dose dependent toxicity published in case reports and unfavourable outcome reported in a few prospective trials done on cardiology patients. The papers on 1c class antiarrhythmics do not take into consideration a complex haemodynamic assessment using echocardiography. The authors have recently presented a retrospective study on SV arrhythmias in septic shock patients demonstrating favourable effect and safety of propafenone which showed higher antiarrhythmic efficacy than amiodarone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propafenone Versus Amiodarone in Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aim is to verify the conclusions of the retrospective study, i.e. efficacy and safety of propafenone, in a prospective blinded randomized trial performed in two large intensive care units. Secondary aims are to monitor the electromechanics of left atrium in patients with SV arrhythmias in septic shock.</detailed_description>
