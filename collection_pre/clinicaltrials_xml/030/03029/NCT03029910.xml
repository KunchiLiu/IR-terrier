	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of eccentric exercise combined with vibration or cryotherapy in Achilles tendon pathology. The investigators hypothesis is that the combined eccentric exercise is better than the results presented by the exclusive eccentric exercise. This intervention differs from the classic studies in that we maintain the intensity throughout the treatment.</brief_summary>
