	<brief_title>Propranolol for Treating Fibromyalgia Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is to collect pilot feasibility study data for the use of low dose propranolol for helping treat fibromyalgia. The investigators plan to compare 20mg twice a day dosage of propranolol and 10mg twice a day dosage of propranolol to placebo. The design is a 3 arm, double blind randomized control trial. The investigators will also test ECG and respiratory assessment as a part of the safety screening and the feasible assessment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Propranolol is not indicated to treat pain. However, the previous studies showed that low dose propranolol can re-regulate the adrenergic dysfunction and reduce pain in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, the investigators are not aiming to develop a new indication of the drug.</detailed_description>
