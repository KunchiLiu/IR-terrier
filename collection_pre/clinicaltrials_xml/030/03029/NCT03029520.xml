	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare postoperative pain and overextension of root canal filling after root canal treatment using a carrier-based obturation system and two different sealers. In this prospective randomized clinical trial, 160 mandibular premolars and molars in 160 patients were treated. Patients with vital and devital teeth were assigned to four groups using a randomized block design with block sizes of 10 patients each. The groups were composed of devital teeth with periapical lesions treated with iRoot SP sealer, vital teeth treated with iRoot SP sealer, devital teeth with periapical lesions treated with AH Plus sealer, and vital teeth treated with AH Plus sealer. In single visits, a single operator prepared root canals and filled them with sealer using the carrier-based obturation technique. Radiographs were taken and obturation length was recorded. Patients recorded pain scores use of Visual Analogue Scale and frequency of analgesic intake at baseline and 0-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 24-72 h..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomized controlled clinical study was conducted to compare the incidence and intensity of post-obturation pain, evaluate the overextension of filling material radiographically, and assess the relationship between pain and analgesic intake in patients with vital and devital teeth undergoing carrier-based obturation with two different sealers (iRoot SP, AH Plus)</detailed_description>
