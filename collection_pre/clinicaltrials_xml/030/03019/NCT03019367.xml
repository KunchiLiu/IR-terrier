	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out whether umbilical cord milking (UCM) is at least as good as or better than delayed cord clamping (DCC) to reduce bleeding in the brain or prevent death in premature newborns. The investigators will study short and long term outcomes of infants delivered before 32 weeks gestation that receive either UCM or DCC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Premature Infants Receiving Milking or Delayed Cord Clamping: PREMOD2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1. Compare the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and/or death in premature newborns &lt;32 weeks gestational age (GA) delivered by C/S receiving UCM to those receiving DCC. Hypothesis1: First demonstrate infants in the UCM group are not inferior to the DCC group (reject H10). Hypothesis2: If H1 is true, demonstrate lower incidence of severe IVH and/or death in UCM infants compared to DCC. Aim 2. Compare the safety and efficacy profiles of premature newborns &lt;32 weeks GA delivered by C/S receiving UCM vs. DCC during their hospitalization and at 24 months corrected age. Hypothesis3: UCM group will have a decreased need for resuscitation interventions and in the sub-study, improved early cardiac and cerebral hemodynamics in the first 24 hours with no differences in bilirubin or polycythemia compared to DCC. Hypothesis4: Infants in the UCM group will have improved long term outcomes such as less neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) at 24 months corrected age compared to DCC. Aim 3 (exploratory). To compare the outcomes of premature newborns &lt;32 weeks GA delivered by C/S (Cesarean section) (from Aims 1 and 2) with those born by V/D (vaginal delivery) receiving UCM or DCC.</detailed_description>
