	<brief_title>Exercise Training Effects on Metabolic Syndrome: Interactions With Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The purpose is to study in a group of adults with metabolic syndrome and obesity, the effects of different modalities of exercise training on cardiorespiratory and metabolic fitness. The main objective is to weight the effects of exercise training separately and in conjunction with their habitual pharmacological treatment to identify the best combination of drug and exercise. Methods and design: Randomized, pretest-posttest control group experimental design. Project developed in a single center with the collaboration of the regional public health system. Subjects: Will be referred by their primary care physicians to our study unit. Up to 160 subjects all of them with metabolic syndrome will be recruited (20% women). Measurements: 1. Specifically we will study cardiovascular adaptations that increase, i) maximal aerobic capacity measured by VO2max, ii) anaerobic and respiratory compensation point ventilatory thresholds, iii) cardiac function measured by assessing cardiac output and stroke volume using the re-breathing technique, iv) arterial stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity and augmentation index using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor System), v) central and peripheral blood pressure, and vi) biological markers of endothelial dysfunction using reactive hyperemia with a laser Doppler fluxmeter in central and peripheral blood vessels. 2. The metabolic adaptations under study will include, i) insulin resistance measured by IVGTT, ii) fat oxidation by indirect calorimetry, iii) intramuscular proteins involved in energetics by percutaneous muscle biopsy and western blots, iv) mitochondria biogenesis by activity of citrate synthase and v) stable-isotopic study of glucose and free fatty acids kinetics in blood (using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis).</detailed_description>
