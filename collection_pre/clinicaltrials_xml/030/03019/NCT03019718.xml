	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to implement the internet-based aftercare program 'GSA-Online plus' in several rehabilitation clinics with patients of different indications (psychosomatic, orthopedic and cardiovascular diseases). 'GSA-Online plus' is an internet-based aftercare program for patients with work-related problems or anxieties facing return to work after longterm sickness absence and inpatient rehabilitation. The patients have access to various exploratory and motivational videos on the study website until their inpatient rehabilitation ends. Afterwards, they start a 12-week writing intervention based on a psychotherapeutic concept, the psychodynamic 'Core Conflictual Relationship Theme Method (CCRT)'. Patients write weekly online diary entries which are answered by anonymous online therapists usually within 24 hours. In a previous randomised controlled trial the efficacy of the intervention was determined, whereas the current study focuses on the implementation and realization in a naturalistic setting (effectiveness).</brief_summary>
