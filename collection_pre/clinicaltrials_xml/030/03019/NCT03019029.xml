	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study will be to examine the diagnostic utility of 18-F Florbetapir PET/MR (Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance) in imaging patients with pathologically-confirmed systemic amyloidosis involving the peripheral nerves and compare these results to non-amyloid diseased controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Utility of F-18 Florbetapir PET/MR in Peripheral Nerve Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with pathologically proven amyloidosis involving the peripheral nervous system will undergo 18-F Florbetapir PET/MR on a GE (General Electric Healthcare) SIGNA PET/MR scanner. A control arm comprised of patients with pathologically-confirmed non-amyloid causes of peripheral neuropathy will also undergo 18-F Florbetapir PET/MR scanning. all images will be reviewed for peripheral nerve uptake.</detailed_description>
