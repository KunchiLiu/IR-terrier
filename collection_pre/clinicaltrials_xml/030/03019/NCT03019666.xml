	<brief_summary>This is a phase I trial with pilot expansion of HLA-haploidentical or HLA-mismatched related donor nicotinamide expanded-natural killer (NAM-NK) cell based therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) or relapsed/refractory CD20-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NAM-NK cells while maintaining safety.</brief_summary>
