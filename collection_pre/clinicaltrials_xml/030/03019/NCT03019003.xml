	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase Ib/II study to assess the safety and efficacy of azacitidine, durvalumab (MEDI4736), and tremelimumab combination therapy in the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who have progressed during or after treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease. The clinical trial is studying drugs that can boost the participant's immune system against the cancer cells as a possible treatment for head and neck cancer. The study interventions involved in this study are: - Azacitidine (Vidaza) - Durvalumab (MEDI4736) - Tremelimumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IB/II Study With Azacitidine, Durvalumab, and Tremelimumab in Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drugs are still being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab (MEDI4736) or tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved azacitidine for the participant's specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. This is a first in human study evaluating the safety of combining these three different drugs. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab are part of a family of proteins that make up the immune system. The body generates these proteins, or antibodies, in response to foreign substances (particles not typically found in the body such as bacteria and viruses) and these antibodies can protect against infection. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab are antibodies that are being studied in several other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to recognize and eliminate abnormal cells in the body. Investigators hope that azacitidine may increase the chance of the immune system to recognize the cancer cells. Azacitidine has been tested in other research studies for similar reasons. In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest effective dose of azacitidine in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab to improve the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target head and neck cancer cells.</detailed_description>

Tumor progression or recurrence during or after treatment with antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCTLA4, or other immune checkpoint inhibitor where the most recent dose was given within 3 months prior to study registration. Must give valid written consent to provide archival FFPE and/or newly acquired tumor tissue for the purpose of establishing baseline PDL1 status as well as consent to provide on and/or posttreatment tumor biopsy sample. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrollment Life expectancy of &gt; 6 months At least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured at baseline as &gt; 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have a short axis &gt;15 mm) with CT or MRI and that is suitable for accurate repeated measurements as per RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below (within 28 days prior to study registration): Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (&gt; 1500 per mm3) Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L (&gt;100,000 per mm3) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5x ULN Serum creatinine level &lt;1.5 x ULN and CL&gt;40 mL/min by the CockcroftGault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by 24hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance: Males: Creatinine CL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 Age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Females: Creatinine CL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 Age) x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) Female subjects must either be of nonreproductive potential (ie, postmenopausal by history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause; OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.
