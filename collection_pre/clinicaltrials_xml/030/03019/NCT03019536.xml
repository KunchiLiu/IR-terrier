	<brief_summary>The study involves repeated doses of LY3303560 given by injection over 48 weeks. The study will examine how safe repeated doses of LY3303560 are, whether they cause side effects in participants with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease, and how LY3303560 is handled by the body and acts in the body. This study will last about 64 weeks, not including screening. Screening is required within 70 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
