	<detailed_description>The intranasal challenge study will be performed over 8 weeks outside of the birch pollen season (November to January) as a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study. During a screening visit, 15 individuals will be recruited according to eligibility criteria. They will be randomized into 3 groups (i.n. administration of anti-IgE antibodies, Bet v 1 or placebo). Intranasal administration will take place on three consecutive days and serum samples will be taken 3, 5, and 8 weeks (+/- 4 days) after the treatment for analysis of total and specific IgE levels</detailed_description>
