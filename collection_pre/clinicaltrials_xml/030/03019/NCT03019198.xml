	<brief_title>TRANEXAMIC ACID IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY IN A BRAZILIAN REFERENCE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a prospective, experimental, randomized, controlled study of 308 consecutive patients who underwent primary THA from December 2013 to March 2014. 256 volunteers remained in the study, 128 were treated 15 mg/kg intravenous bolus of TXA and 128 did not receive the medication. Participants were followed up at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then annually after surgery. The use of TXA resulted in lesser reduction in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, reduced blood loss, blood transfusion rate, volume of blood products, and stay length even in risk factor patients. TXA protects risk factor patients against intra and postoperative bleeding and reduces transfusion rates.</detailed_description>
