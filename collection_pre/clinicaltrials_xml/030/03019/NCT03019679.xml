	<brief_title>Serum Endocan Levels in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome is a disorder which is associated with insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction, which is known to be an early marker of atherosclerosis, has also been shown to have an association with poycystic ovary syndrome. In this study the investigators aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between polycystic ovary syndrome and serum endocan levels. For this purpose the investigators designed a prospective study including two groups. The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome was made in the presence of ;oligo- and/or anovulation,clinical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. Clinical hyperandrogenism was defined by the presence of hirsutism , acne, or the presence of androgenic alopecia, body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The two groups are compared considering their serum endocan levels,follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), Dihydroepiandesterone sulphate (DHEAS), total testesterone (TT), estradiol (E2) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.</detailed_description>
