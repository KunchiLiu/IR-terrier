	<detailed_description>Oxycodone is one of the most widely used opioids for pain treatment. There have been several studies on the efficacy and side effects of oxycodone. Oxycodone has been known to have the same potency with morphine. Many studies demonstrated good efficacy of oxycodone on postoperative pain. In this study, we designed a prospective, randomized, and double-blind study to assess the efficacy and side effects of bolus intravenous of oxycodone injection compared to those of fentanyl in patients who underwent the total hip replacement surgery.</detailed_description>
