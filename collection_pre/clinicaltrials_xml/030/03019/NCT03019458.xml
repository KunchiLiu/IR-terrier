	<brief_title>MINGO Supplemental Trial in X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP, formerly known as DYT3) occurs primarily in Filipino males and is characterized by neurodegenerative dystonia and parkinsonism. It is currently recognized to have wide phenotypic variability relating to age of onset, location of disease onset and rate of severity/disease progression. Most patients begin with focal dystonia that generalizes with the development of parkinsonism later in disease course. XDP patients suffer from severe nutritional loss due to symptoms such as dysphagia, loss of appetite, and consistently high metabolic requirements brought about by their movement disorder. Approximately 79% of patients with XDP have experienced rapid weight loss since the onset of their disease. It is the aim of the researchers to assess the clinical usefulness of adding a nutritional supplement to the daily dietary needs of these patients. MINGO is a supplement consisting of local ingredients such as moringa, rice and mung beans, which can be added to any type of edible paste, food, and liquid. Mingo has gained popularity as an emergency food in disaster relief operations due to the ease of its preparation, its high nutritional value and relatively low price. For the last two years, it has also been used as an agent for nutritional build up in malnourished populations of children. This study will provide valuable information on whether patients with XDP can increase their weight by consuming MINGO, which will lead to improvements in the patients' medical care and wellbeing.</detailed_description>
