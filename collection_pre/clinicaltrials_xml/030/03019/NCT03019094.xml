	<brief_title>Overactive Bladder Posterior Tibial Implantable MIcro STimulator - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generally, subjects will be followed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12-months after activation with the RENOVA System. The study will be conducted according the following phases: - Recruitment, baseline assessment and compatibility test: Subjects fulfilling all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the trial. Study candidates will sign an informed consent form, complete a standard 3-Day voiding diary, a quality of life questionnaire and global response assessment. Beck Depression Inventory II and General quality of life questionnaires will be completed in selected geographies. Study eligible subjects that have not experienced Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation treatment in the past will undergo a compatibility test to assure proper nerve conductivity. Data collected will serve as baseline. - Implantation: Patients with positive response to the compatibility test (or that received Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation treatment in the past) will undergo unilateral implantation 4±1 weeks following recruitment with the BlueWind RENOVA System. Intra-operative sensory/motor response will be tested to confirm accurate location of the implant. - Sensation assessment and activation: After a recovery period of approximately 30±7 days, subjects will complete a Brief 3-Day voiding diary and a quality of life questionnaire and a sensation assessment will be conducted: subjects will undergo an acute stimulation session of the tibial nerve to evaluate their sensory reaction to stimulation and parameters setting will be performed according to their individual sensations. Eventually, patients will be trained for system home use treatment. Therapy will be delivered daily for a minimum of 30 minutes once a day and maximum of 1 hour per day (in 2 sessions of 30 minutes), per physician discretion. Following activation of the device, patient will complete Brief 3-day voiding diaries once a week until the 1 month follow-up visit. - Follow-ups (1-, 2-, and 3-months post-device activation): A 3-Day voiding diary and QoL questionnaire will be collected (brief 3-Day diaries on 1-, and 2-months follow up visits; and a 3-Day standard voiding diary on the 3-month follow up). Global Response Assessment and Beck Depression Inventory II will be collected on the 3-month follow-up visit (Beck Depression Inventory in selected geographies). Stimulation parameters will be checked and adjusted as needed by: (a) changing current amplitude; and/or (b) changing stimulation frequency; and/or changing pulse width; and/or (c) changing the number of daily treatment sessions. Location of paresthesia will be recorded in each of the clinic visits. The visit at 2 months will be performed by phone call to assess the patient status. Clinic visit may be followed at the discretion of the clinical team. - Continued follow-ups: All subjects in the trial will undergo 4 additional visits (at 4-, 6- ,9- and 12-months post-device activation) until the end of the study at the 12-month visit. Similar to the visit at 2 months, the visit at 4 months will be performed by phone call to assess the patient status. Clinic visit may be followed at the discretion of the clinical team. Three-Day voiding diary, Quality of Life questionnaire, Global Response Assessment and Beck Depression Inventory II and General quality of life questionnaires (at selected geographies) will be collected at each of those visits (except for the 4- and 9-months visit in which only a 3-Day Brief voiding diary will be collected). General quality of life questionnaire will be completed at the 12-month visit in selected geographies. Stimulation parameters will be checked and adjusted as needed. Location of paresthesia will be recorded in each of the clinic visits</detailed_description>
