	<brief_summary>Introduction: The pain sensitivity associated with whitening is the main problem reported by patients during dental whitening, and the use of desensitizing dentifrices is an alternative for the treatment of sensitivity. Objective: To evaluate clinically the influence of desensitizing dentifrices applied through a plastic tray, reducing the pain sensitivity and color variation caused by the technique of in-office dental whitening, through a controlled double-blind clinical study. Methods: A longitudinal prospective study was conducted with 48 individuals, 18 years and 30 years of age, without gender distinction, who underwent in-office dental whitening using 35% hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP, FGM, Joinville , SC, Brazil) in three clinical sessions with a one-week interval between them. The volunteers used in the night for each bleaching session a plastic tray for 4 hours containing one of the dentifrices related to the experimental groups: Group 1 (Control) - Sucralose (S) (Biotype - Manipulation pharmacy); Group 2 (Active control) - Sodium fluoride (FS) with 1450ppm of fluorine (Close up triple, Unilever); Group 3 - Arginine, calcium carbonate (ACC) and sodium monofluorophosphate with 1450 ppm fluorine (Colgate sensitive pro-relief, Colgate-Palmolive); Group 4 - 5% potassium nitrate (NP) and sodium fluoride with 1450 ppm fluorine (Sensodyne pro-enamel, GlaxoSmithKline). The evaluation of the sensitivity associated with the times of use of the plastic tray in the first session (S1: sensitivity before the tray, S2: sensitivity after the tray), in the second session (S3: sensitivity before the tray, S4: in the third session (S5: sensitivity before the tray, S6: sensitivity after the tray) used the analog numerical scale with scores from 0 to 10 and for the color evaluation the spectrophotometer (Easyshade, Vident, Brea, CA, Obtaining the data that were used in the CIELab system. The data were submitted to the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated measurements and Lambda Wilks test with a 5% probability level to differentiate the groups. In addition, the factorial variance analysis (ANOVA) in one criterion was applied. Values of p &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</brief_summary>
