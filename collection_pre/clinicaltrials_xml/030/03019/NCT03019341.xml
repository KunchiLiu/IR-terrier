	<brief_summary>The prevalence of nausea and vomiting after the administration of non-ionic contrast media has rarely been assessed. Thus, the aim of our study is to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of nausea and vomiting after the exposure to the non-ionic contrast media for computed tomography examinations in adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Nausea and Vomiting After the Administration of Non-ionic Contrast Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no robust evidence or guideline for fasting prior to contrast-enhanced CT scan in patients. Substantial heterogeneity exists on fasting prior to contrast-enhanced CT worldwide. Through dedicated questionnaires, the investigators plan to prospectively assess the prevalence and the risk factors for nausea and vomiting after the exposure to the non-ionic contrast media agent in adult patients undergoing computed tomography examinations.</detailed_description>
