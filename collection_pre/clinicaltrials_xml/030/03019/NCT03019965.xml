	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the administration of betalactam antibiotics in prolonged infusion compared to intermittent infusion in children with sepsis. Half of participants will receive piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem or meropenem in continuous or extended infusion, while the other half will receive piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem or meropenem in intermittent infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Betalactam Antibiotics in Prolonged Infusion Compared to Intermittent in Pediatric Patients With Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients globally. Betalactams are time-dependent antibiotics, and so, the duration of time for which the free drug plasma concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT &gt; MIC) is the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index associated with bacterial killing and clinical improvement. Numerous studies have demonstrated that continuous infusion (infusion in 24 hours) and extended infusion (through prolonging the infusion time to greater than 3 hours) allows the maintenance of concentrations above the MIC for a longer period of time within the dosing interval (30 minute or 1 hour), and so, capitalises on the pharmacodynamic properties of betalactams and maximises bacterial killing, therefore potentially improving clinical outcomes. In adult patients, the several studies suggest that prolonged infusion may offer clinical benefits and significant reduction in mortality without increasing the risk of toxicity, however, there is limited information about these dosing strategies in pediatric patients.</detailed_description>
