	<brief_title>Effect of Red Meat Intake on Occurrence of Serum Non-transferrin Bound Iron (NTBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During Visit 1, blood samples will be collected to assess iron status. During Visit 2, after an overnight fast, participant will be given a standardized meal (rice and potatoes) with a portion of cooked beef (200 g). Blood samples will be collected right before and 2 hour after the meal for NTBI analysis. NTBI concentration before and after meal consumption will be compared.</detailed_description>
