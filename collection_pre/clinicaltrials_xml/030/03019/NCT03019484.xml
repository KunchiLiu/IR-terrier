	<detailed_description>Breastfeeding is the optimal choice for feeding infants in order to ensure a healthy growth and development. Although breastfeeding has many benefits for the infant and the mother, breastfeeding rates drop drastically during the first three months after birth. There is a number of factors that influence the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. One of the key factors is maternal self-efficacy in relation to breastfeeding. The aim of the study was the development and evaluation of an intervention to enhance maternal perceived self-efficacy in order to contribute positively to the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. This was done by using a complex intervention approach (MRC framework) to design and assess a multi-center controlled trial, involving midwives and nurses working at the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN) of the Servicio Navarro de Salud and at the Cl√≠nica Universidad de Navarra (CUN). These health professionals were trained to deliver the intervention. The intervention was focused on self-efficacy related aspects and took place at three instances with every mother: in the final stage of pregnancy, during the maternal hospital stay after giving birth, and in the first days after discharge. The participants in the control group received the standard care as provided in each health institution.</detailed_description>
