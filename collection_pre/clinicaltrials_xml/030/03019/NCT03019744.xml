	<brief_summary>Goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Myoelectrically-controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (MeCFES) for the rehabilitation of upper limb in post-stroke patients. MeCFES-assisted rehabilitation will be compared with usual care rehabilitation of upper limb. It is hypothesized that that applying MeCFES in rehabilitation to assist normal arm movements during rehabilitation of the upper limb in persons with stroke will improve the movement quality and success and thus induce recovery at the body functions level (impairment) and the activity level (disability) of the International Classification of Function (ICF) superior to that induced by usual care rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
