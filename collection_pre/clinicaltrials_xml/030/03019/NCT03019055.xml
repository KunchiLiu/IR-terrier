	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1, interventional single arm, open label, treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to contain an anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 scFv coupled to CD3ζ and 4-1BB signaling domains in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD19 or CD20 positive B cell malignancies</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients With Relapsed Refractory B Cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, single arm, open label phase I study to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing CAR-T cells expressing tandem receptors against both CD20 and CD19 (CAR-20/19-T) in a completely closed system using the CliniMACS Prodigy device and then determine the safety of this dual targeted CAR in a first-in-human study of patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. Secondary outcomes will include response rates, and observed toxicities of the treatment, specifically the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory storm that has been seen with previous CAR-T therapies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Patients aged ≥1 years and ≤65 years with CD19 or CD20 positive B cell malignancies such as CLL/SLL, other B cell NHL, ALL with active disease and no available curative options that meet clinical criteria to initiate treatment. 2. Patients with NHL, CLL/SLL, and ALL must have CD19 or CD20 positive disease on most recent biopsy performed 3. Absolute CD3+ T cell count ≥100/mm3 a. Patients who receive chemotherapy and/or steroids after CD3+ Tcell count, but before apheresis, will require this test to be repeated. 4. Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis by cytology and flow cytometry in all patients with ALL and in patients with prior history of CNS disease. For patients with NHL or CLL without a history of CNS positive disease, a negative MRI of the brain will suffice. 5. MRI brain without evidence of CNS involvement 6. Measurable disease must have been documented within 4 weeks of the time of consent defined as the following by disease specific subtype: 1. NHL: Patients with active disease defined as nodal lesions greater than 20 mm in the long axis or extranodal lesions &gt;10 mm in long and short axis or bone marrow involvement that is biopsy proven 2. ALL: At minimum patients need minimal residual disease detectable by flow cytometry on bone marrow or peripheral blood. 3. CLL: Active disease by either bone marrow, peripheral flow cytometry, or CT and/or PET imaging with nodal disease 7. Patients should have failed at least one line of a standard treatment and meet disease specific criteria detailed below: 1. CLL: measurable disease by peripheral flow cytometry, bone marrow biopsy, or CT imaging that has relapsed after at least one line of chemo immunotherapy and progressed after ibrutinib monotherapy 2. B cell ALL: must have received at least one induction regimen and have active disease. 3. B cell NHL (CD19 or CD20) positive B cell NHL including but not limited to Follicular lymphoma, Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (de novo or transformed), Mantle cell lymphoma, Marginal zone lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, Prolymphocytic lymphoma: Must have progressed after Rituximab or another CD20 antibody and a chemotherapy regimen appropriate for their disease. 8. Karnofsky performance score ≥70 for pts age≥16 and Lansky score ≥70 in pts age &lt;16 9. Adequate hepatic function, defined as AST and ALT &lt;3 x upper limit of normal (ULN); serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase &lt;2 x ULN, or considered not clinically significant (e.g Gilbert's or indirect hyperbilirubinemia) or felt to be due to underlying disease. 10. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine &lt;2 x ULN. 11. Able to provide written informed consent, and agree to practice birth control during the study. 12. Adequate cardiac function as indicated by New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification I or II AND left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40% (by cardiac ECHO or MUGA) and adequate pulmonary function as indicated by room air oxygen saturation of ≥92%. 13. Expected survival &gt;12 weeks 14. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test in females of child bearing potential at study entry and again within 48 hours' prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 15. Patients with prior blinatumomab treatment require repeat biopsy postblinatumomab treatment that demonstrates CD19 or CD20 positive disease. 16. Meet criteria for regarding fertility and contraception detailed in Special Criteria for regarding Fertility and Contraception (below). Exclusion Criteria A potential subject who meets any of the following exclusion criteria is ineligible to participate in the study. 1. Positive betaHCG in female of childbearing potential. 2. Patients with known systemic allergy to bovine or murine products. 3. Known prior positive serology for human antimouse antibody (HAMA). 4. Confirmed active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C infection. 5. History of significant autoimmune disease OR active, uncontrolled autoimmune phenomenon: such as systemic lupus erythematous, wegner's glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (AIHA, ITP) requiring steroid therapy defined as &gt;20 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily in adults or &gt;0.25 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent daily in children (except patients on physiologic doses of replacement steroids) 6. Presence of ≥grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity as per CTCAE version 4.03 from any previous treatment unless it is felt to be due to underlying disease. 7. Concurrent use of investigational therapeutic agents or enrollment on another therapeutic clinical trial at any institution 8. Refusal to participate in the longterm followup protocol 9. Patients with active CNS involvement by malignancy on MRI or by lumbar puncture (CNS2 and CNS3 disease) a. Patients with prior CNS disease that has been effectively treated will be eligible providing treatment was &gt;4 weeks before enrollment and a remission documented within 6 weeks of planned CART cell infusion 10. Previous recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) are excluded if they are &lt;100 days' posttransplant, have evidence of active graftversushostdisease (GVHD) of any grade, or are currently on immunosuppression. 11. Previous CART cell therapy directed at either CD19 or CD20 12. AntiCD20 antibody treatment within 4 weeks of cell infusion 13. AntiCD19 antibody treatment within 4 weeks of cell infusion 14. Chemotherapy other than lymphodepletion within 2 weeks of infusion 15. Cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment within 21 days or steroid treatment (other than replacement dose steroids) within 7 days prior to apheresis collection for CART cells 16. Patients post solid organ transplant who develop high grade lymphomas or leukemias 17. Concurrent active malignancy (exceptions: treated solid malignancy in &gt;5 years' remission, treated basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) Special Criteria for regarding Fertility and Contraception Female subjects of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche or women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone a sterilization procedure [hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy]) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed as part of eligibility criteria and again within 48 hours of initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Due to the highrisk level of this study, while enrolled, all subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). Additionally, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study subject must agree to use reliable and double barrier methods of contraception during the followup period of the protocol. Acceptable birth control includes a combination of two of the following methods: Condoms* (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide Intrauterine device (IUD) Hormonalbased contraception Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who are premenarche or have been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy tubal ligation, salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy or men who have documented azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception. Acceptable documentation of sterilization, azoospermia, and menopause is specified below: Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of one of the following: Physician report/letter Operative report or other source documentation in the subject record of successful vasectomy Discharge summary Laboratory report of azoospermia Follicle stimulating hormone measurement elevated into the menopausal range</criteria>
