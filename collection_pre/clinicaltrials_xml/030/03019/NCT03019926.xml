	<brief_summary>A poor therapeutic observance is described between 3 and 76% cases in systemic lupus. It is associated with an increased risk of relapses, hospitalizations, morbidity and poor renal prognosis. New treatment protocols exist and are indicated in second intention in case of good compliance. An assessment of therapeutic adherence is therefore essential. Patients with systemic lupus diagnosed for at least 6 months, or skin lupus, who have been prescribed with Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), will be included in the study. The study primary objective is to determine risk factors for non-observance The secondary objectives are to: - Measure the observance rate of patients with systemic lupus in Martinique. - Describe the parameters that influence observance: evaluation of the disease and associated comorbidities, psychosocial assessment, assessment of the doctor-patient relationship, evaluation of the disease representations.</brief_summary>
