	<brief_summary>AML/MDS and their treatment may weaken participant's immune system and may make participant more likely to develop invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if isavuconazole can help prevent invasive aspergillosis (IA) and other IFIs in patients with AML/MDS. The safety of this drug will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Isavuconazole Prophylaxis in Adults With Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic Syndrome (AML/MDS) and Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will take isavuconazole by mouth every 8 hours for the first 6 doses (48 hours) and then 1 time each day after that. The capsules should be swallowed whole. Participants should not chew, crush, dissolve, or open the capsules. If at the start of the study participant is unable to take participant's dose by mouth, participant will receive the study drug by vein over about 1 hour every 8 hours for the first 6 doses and then 1 time each day after that for up to 4 days. If there is a brief period where participant is unable to take the dose by mouth, participant will receive isavuconazole by vein over about 1 hour. Participant will switch back to taking the dose by mouth again as soon as participant is able to do so. Participant will be given a study drug diary to keep track of each dose of study drug that participant has taken, the time the dose was taken, and any missed or vomited doses. Participant should bring the study drug diary with participant to every visit. Length of Study: Participant may continue to take the study drug for up to 12 weeks. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if participant has a complete remission of the disease (if the disease goes away), if a breakthrough fungal infection occurs, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation in the study will be over after the End-of-Study Visit. Study Visits: Every week: - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1-2 times each week. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn twice a week to check for a fungal infection. During Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, participant will have a physical exam. On Days 8 and 15, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. On Day 10, participant will have an EKG. During Week 2 and then every other week after that (Weeks 4, 6, 8, and so on), blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure the iron stores in participant's body. If at any time the doctors think it is needed: - Participant will have a chest x-ray or CT scan to check for fungal infections in participant's lungs. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for fungal infections. - If participant has a bone marrow test done to check the status of the leukemia as part of participant's standard of care, it will be checked for iron content. End of Study: About 30 days after the last dose of the study drug: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This is an investigational study. Isavuconazole is FDA and commercially available for the treatment of IA and mucormycosis. It is considered investigational to use isavuconazole for the prevention of IFIs. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with either newly diagnosed AML or MDS who have either begun (within 4 days of starting study drug) or are planned to begin specific treatment for their AML/MDS. Patients who are participating in other therapeutic clinical trials for their AML/MDS may participate in this trial. 2. Patients must have or be anticipated to have neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 x 109/L) (75) for &gt;/= 7 days as a result of treatment of their AML/MDS. 3. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2. 5. Patients must have reasonable liver function, i.e., total bilirubin &lt;/= 3 x ULN AND AST/ALT &lt;/= 5 x ULN. 6. Patients must be able to take oral medications, although a brief period of IV therapy (&lt;4 days) is permitted at trial entry. 7. Patients must be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial. 8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must practice 2 effective methods of birth control during the course of the study. Male patients who are partners of WOCBP should also practice an effective method of contraception. Effective methods of birth control include diaphragm or condoms with spermicidal foam or jelly, birth control pills (BCPs), injections or patches, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and surgical sterilization. 9. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for =/&gt;12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. 10. Women and men must continue birth control for the duration of the trial and =/&gt;3 months after the last dose of study drug. 11. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving study medication. 1. Proven, probable or possible IFI within the previous 30 days. 2. Use of any systemic antifungal therapy for &gt; 72 hours during the 1week screening period. 3. History of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to azoles. 4. Patients with familial short QT syndrome or with QTc interval &lt;/= 300 ms. 5. Patients on strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors that cannot be discontinued. 6. Women who are pregnant or nursing, or intend to be/do so during the course of the study. 7. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh class C). 8. Patients with known or suspected Gilbert's syndrome at the time of study enrollment. 9. Patients with known gastrointestinal conditions that could potentially interfere with absorption of orally administered medications. 10. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the objectives of the study, e.g., any condition requiring the use of prohibited drugs or unstable medical conditions other than AML/MDS, such as a cardiac or neurologic disorder expected to be unstable or progressive during the course of the study (e.g., seizures or demyelinating syndromes, acute myocardial infarction within 3 months of study entry, myocardial ischemia or unstable congestive heart failure, unstable arrhythmias).</criteria>
