	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety profile of neoGAA in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. Secondary Objective: To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of neoGAA and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of neoGAA in comparison to alglucosidase alfa.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of NeoGAA Administered Every Other Week in Pediatric Patients With Infantile-onset Pompe Disease Previously Treated With Alglucosidase Alfa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study per patient will be up to 3 years that will consist of a 14-day screening period, a 25-week treatment period, a 120-week extension period, and a 4-week post-treatment observation period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : The patient has confirmed GAA enzyme deficiency from any tissue source. The patient who has reached legal age of majority as defined by local regulation, or the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide signed informed consent prior to performing any studyrelated procedures. If the patient is legally minor per local regulations, assent shall be obtained from patients, if applicable. The patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is legally minor as defined by local regulation) must have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol. The patient is &lt;18 years old. The patient, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum pregnancy test (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin) and must not be breastfeeding at screening/baseline. The patient has cardiomyopathy at the time of diagnosis: ie, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) equivalent to mean age specific LVMI plus 2 standard deviations. The patient has been receiving a stable dose of alglucosidase alfa regularly for a minimum of 6 months immediately prior to study entry. For participants in Stage 1: The patient has documented evidence of clinical decline in at least 1 of the following parameters related to Pompe Disease and NOT related to intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: respiratory function, motor skills, and/or cardiac parameters. For participants in Stage 2: The patient has documented evidence of suboptimal clinical response in at least 1 of the following parameters related to Pompe Disease and NOT related to intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: respiratory function, motor skills, and/or new onset of ptosis. Exclusion criteria: The patient has high antibody titer to alglucosidase alfa. The patient has a high risk for a severe allergic reaction to neoGAA. The patient requires any prohibited concomitant medications (e.g., immune modulatory treatment or betablockers) for the duration of the study. The patient has previously participated in any ACT14132 study cohort. Female patient of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective contraceptive method of birth control and/or who is unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
