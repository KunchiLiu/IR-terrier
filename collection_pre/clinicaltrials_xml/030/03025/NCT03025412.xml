	<brief_summary>Exercise is a preferred treatment modality for mid-portion achilles tendinopathy. Despite this, as many as 44 % of achilles tendinopathy patients do not respond to exercise treatment. Surgery for midportion achilles tendinopathy has for many years been done as an open procedure. New knowledge resulted in a variety of minimally invasive procedures and the development of endoscopic surgery. In this study, the effect of non-open surgery and conservative treatment (physiotherapy and exercises) will be compared.</brief_summary>
