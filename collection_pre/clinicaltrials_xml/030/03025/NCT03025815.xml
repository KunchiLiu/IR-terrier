	<brief_title>Effects of the Oral Stimulation Program in Extreme Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies have suggested that an oral stimulation program applied to preterm infants facilitates their oral feeding progress, improve breastfeeding rates in preterm infants and decreases the length of hospital stay. The objective of this study will evaluate the effect an oral stimulation program on the performance feeding, the length of the transition oral feeding, length of hospital stay and breastfeeding rates upon discharge. Primarily, will be evaluated the effect an oral stimulation program on the performance feeding. All infants will be assessed by a speech pathologist blinded as to the group randomization. Secondarily, will be observed the length of the transition oral feeding of the preterm infants, conducted by medical team and will be observed length of hospital stay. Both groups will be monitored from when they were assigned to participate in the study until hospital discharge. All statistical will be conducted using Statistical Package for Social SciencesÂ® version 18.0. The data will be analyzed for treatment group differences with chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for the categorical variables and with non-parametric tests for the continuous variables.</detailed_description>
