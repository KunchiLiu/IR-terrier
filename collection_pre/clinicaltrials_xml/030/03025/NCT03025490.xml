	<brief_title>The Use of Capnography and Integrated Pulmonary Index in the Electrophysiology Laboratory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the electrophysiology lab, the use of procedural sedation, often by nurses is considered routine and safe.Standard monitoring during these procedures includes continuous Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Heart Rate and rhythm and interval Respiratory rate and blood pressure. Capnography allows for continuous monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide, it is an important tool during anesthesia, providing valuable information on the patient's respiratory status and is standard equipment in most operating rooms. Its use in procedural sedation has increased over the past years as the body of evidence supporting this practice has been growing. It has been previously shown, use of capnography may allow for earlier detection of respiratory adverse events in various types of procedural sedation. The fall of oxygen saturation can occur very late during an adverse respiratory event, especially if supplemental oxygen is given. Today's procedural sedation in the electrophysiology catheterization lab are more complex, patients are of increasingly older age, have more comorbidities, procedures are lengthier and often require deeper sedation (i.e. during complex ablation procedures). The use of capnography in the electrophysiology lab has not been addressed thoroughly in the literature. A recent multidisciplinary review of anesthesia in the electrophysiology lab states: "In the obstructive sleep apnea or non-obstructive sleep apnea patient, capnography should ideally be employed throughout the sedation period."â€¦"Capnography appears to be underutilized in the electrophysiology lab, given its omission from electrophysiology literature documenting safety of sedation by non-anesthesiologists" We hypothesize that the routine use of capnography during nurse administered procedural sedations in the electrophysiology lab could aid in detection of early signs of adverse respiratory events, thus allowing early intervention and reduction of these events.</detailed_description>
