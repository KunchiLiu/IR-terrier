	<brief_summary>"Within-day and Between-day Repeatability of the Breath Pattern in Healthy Children and in Children With Moderate or Severe Asthma" is an observational prospective study in outpatient clinic of Pediatric Allergology &amp; Pulmonology (PAP) within the Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immunology (IBIM) of the National Research Council (CNR) of Palermo (IBIM CNR), Italy. The electronic nose (E-nose) has been proposed as a novel, non-invasive tool to evaluate the level of airway inflammation for different respiratory diseases, especially in children. To date, there are no data on the within-day and the between-day repeatability of the breath pattern in healthy children and in children with moderate or severe asthma. The breath pattern will be analyzed by collecting, for each child, three samples of the breath through the E-nose. Within-day repeatability will be assessed using two consecutive measurements (the second one after 30 minutes). Between-day repeatability will be assessed using a third measurement repeated after 7 days. The study is expected to provide information about the accuracy of E-nose measurements for a child population.</brief_summary>
