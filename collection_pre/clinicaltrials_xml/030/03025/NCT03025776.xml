	<brief_summary>To further develop interventions, the investigators need a better understanding of which task requirements (i.e. size or weight of object, location in workspace, etc.) drive a person after stroke to use 2 hands (as opposed to 1), and how the severity of their injury impacts this relationship. A better understanding of this relationship will promote more informed development of rehabilitative interventions. This study proposes to explore in people after stroke: i.) how specific functional tasks requirements relate to 1 vs. 2 handed use, and ii.) how stroke severity impacts this arm use. We are proposing to study 15 individuals more than 6 months after stroke in the CSU Motor Behavior Lab for a two x 3 hour session of task-related reaching in sitting . The investigators will systematically vary task requirements (i.e. object size or weight, location in workspace, etc.), and record use of 1 versus 2 hands using videotaping as well as recording of quality of arm movement (kinematics) and muscle activity (EMG) in both arms.</brief_summary>
