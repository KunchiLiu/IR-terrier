	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether hydroxychloroquine decreases the relative leakage of the brain barrier after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine and Cognitive Function After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxychloroquine will be administered preoperatively to 30 patients undergoing cardiac or noncardiac surgery. All patients will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium in the post-operative period before hospital discharge in order to assess blood brain barrier permeability.</detailed_description>
