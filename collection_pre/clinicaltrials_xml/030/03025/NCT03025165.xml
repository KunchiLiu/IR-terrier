	<brief_title>A Comparison of Different Community Models of ART Delivery Amongst Stable HIV+ Patients in Two Urban Settings in Zambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The outcomes of this study will be measured in a prospective cohort of adult patients enrolled into ART care in two urban communities participating in the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial. The two community models are: 1) adherence clubs, groups of 20-25 stable patients who receive ART care in the community every 3 months, and 2) home-based ART delivery in which a community health worker delivers ART care to an individual at home every 3 months. The standard of care is delivery of ART care at the local clinic.</detailed_description>
