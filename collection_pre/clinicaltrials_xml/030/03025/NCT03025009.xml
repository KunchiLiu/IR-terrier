	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the side effects related to LY3192767 when given as an injection under the skin to healthy participants. Blood tests will be done to check how much LY3192767 is absorbed into the bloodstream, how long it takes for the body to get rid of it, and how it affects blood sugar levels. The study has two parts: Part A and Part B. Each participant will enroll in one part. For each participant, Part A will last up to about 32 days after last dose and Part B will last up to about 49 days after last dose. Screening must be completed prior to study start.</brief_summary>
