	<brief_summary>The FAPIC project will develop a diagnostic system that will identify pathogens and charachterize virulence and resistance. A prospective study will be performed in which blood samples will be collected of patients with suspected sepsis in order to evaluate the diagnostic system. In routine care, blood is drawn of these patients for culture in order to identify the causative pathogen. This process takes 3-5 days. During the study, one extra blood sample will be collected with the same venipuncture, with each blood culture. Afterwards, routine diagnosis by blood culture is followed. Blood samples will be send to the research laboratories for determination of sensitivity and specificity. The system will not be used in the clinic.</brief_summary>
