	<brief_title>Dietary Intake of Alpha-linolenic Acid in Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is growing evidence that diets high in long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decrease the risk of fatal ischemic heart disease.Both epidemiologic studies and clinical trials demonstrate substantial cardioprotective effects of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) from vegetable oils.However, little is known about the relation of the dietary intake of ALA with ischemic heart disease among older adults.In this study, elderly volunteers will be asked to ingest a supplement of a vegetable oil providing 1g of ALA, or an equivalent amount of linoleic acid as sunflower oil, for a diet period of 6 weeks.Serum samples will be collected before the dietary intervention and 6 weeks later.Plasma biomarkers of inflammatory, lipid cardiovascular risk factors and serum and red cell membrane fatty acid composition will be determined on all samples.</detailed_description>
