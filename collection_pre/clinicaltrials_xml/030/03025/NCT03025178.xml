	<brief_summary>We previously performed a study to create formula for the optimal insertion depth of left internal jugular vein catheter in infant, which was registered at cris.nih.go.kr. We found that two calculation methods using height and the distance between landmarks (0.11 × height (cm) + 0.19 and 1.02 × I-A-B (cm) + 1.55, where I was insertion point of needle, A was the most prominent point of the sternal head of the left clavicle, and B was the midpoint of the perpendicular line drawn between the sternal head of the right clavicle and an imaginary line between the nipples) were clinically feasible to determine the insertion depth of left internal jugular vein catheter. In this study, we will compare the actual insertion depth with the insertion depth determined from above two calculation methods in other 46 infants.</brief_summary>
