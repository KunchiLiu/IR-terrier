	<brief_summary>Guideline directed use of pharmacologic Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis emphasizes mobility evaluation. Mobility is a key component of risk stratification. Poor mobility evaluation by providers may be a significant barrier to appropriate use of VTE prophylaxis. The investigators aim is to propose to determine whether level of mobility during hospitalization is being used to influence use and duration of VTE prophylaxis among medically ill hospitalized elders. To achieve this aim, the investigator will collect prospective observational data to objectively measure inpatient mobility using patient mounted accelerometers during patient hospital stays. The investigator's goal is to improve the appropriateness of use of VTE prophylaxis among those in which the risks of harm may outweigh the benefit. Results from this study will provide important insights about use of risk assessment, and the relationship between patient mobility and VTE prophylaxis. These results are critical to understanding how to take the next steps toward improving the appropriate use and safety of anticoagulants in hospitalized older adults. Information from this study could be used in future proposals to study interventions to ultimately improve hospital practice in the care of older adults.</brief_summary>
