	<brief_summary>An observational study will be conducted in the ICU (Intensive care unit) including patients with heart surgery (&lt; 5 days) and prolonged ICU stay (&gt; 5 days). Patients will receive 5 min Virtual reality stimulation per day. A modified version of the Oculus Rift VR glasses (Facebook inc., USA) with stereoscopic vision and stereo sound will be used to present the virtual world to patients. An integrated eye tracker will measure oculomotor responses that will be synchronized with the physiological data recording. All participants will undergo neuropsychological testing after ICU stay, and after a three-months follow-up. Quality of life prior to the ICU stay will be enquired from relatives. Main outcome variable is the explorative behaviour (attention). Secondary outcomes are the quality of life and cognitive functioning.</brief_summary>
