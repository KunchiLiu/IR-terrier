	<brief_summary>This will be a prospective, multicentre study conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two TB breath-based technologies independently of the manufacturers. Assay error and failure rates and device operational characteristics will also be assessed during this study. Participants will be enrolled in this study in line with FIND sample banking activities. Results from index tests will not be used to make clinical decisions. Participation in this study will not alter the standard of care.</brief_summary>
