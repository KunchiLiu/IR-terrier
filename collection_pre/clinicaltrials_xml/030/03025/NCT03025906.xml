	<brief_summary>Although generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a life-threatening emergency, evidence-based data to guide initial drug treatment choices are lacking in the Chinese population. The investigators conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) phenobarbital (PB) and valproate (VPA) in patients with GCSE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenobarbital Versus Valproate for Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After the failure of first-line diazepam treatment, patients with GCSE were randomized to receive either IV PB (standard doses, low rate) or VPA (standard). Successful treatment was considered when clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased. Adverse events following treatment and the neurological outcomes at discharge and 3 months later were also evaluated.</detailed_description>
