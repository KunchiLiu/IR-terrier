Has undergone the diagnosis of at least one interventional cardiologist and two cardiac surgeons: the patients are contraindicated for traditional open heart valve replacement surgery (defined as 30 days postop mortality risk &gt;50%, irreversible complications, or other influential postoperative factors [such as severe calcification in the ascending aorta and aortic valve, weak physical condition, chest deformities, severe liver diseases, severe lung diseases, etc.] or high risk for surgery (LogEuroSCORE≥20% and or STS≥8) 5. Has a diagnosis from at least one interventional cardiologist and two cardiac surgeons that the patient may benefit from a valve implantation 6.

Patients with infection or who have any sign of infection 2. Previous history of endocarditis or patients with active endocarditis 3. Incidence of acute myocardial infarction within the past 30 days (Qwave MI, or non Qwave MI with creatine kinase, an increase in troponin T) 4. Any cardiac mass discovered during echocardiography, left ventricular or atrial thrombosis 5. Suffering from uncontrollable atrial fibrillation 6. Hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7. Mitral or tricuspid valve insufficiency (Class Ⅱ regurgitation or greater) 8. Has previously undergone aortic valve implantation (mechanical valve or biological valve frame) 9. Is known to be allergic to contrast agents, aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine medications, nitinol or porcine products 10. Is known to be contraindicated for or is allergic to all anticoagulants or is unable to use anticoagulants during the study 11. Is known to have one of the following conditions (according to evaluations beginning from screening through the day of the procedure): Other diseases that may reduce the life expectancy to less than 12 months (such as clinically recurrent or metastatic cancer, congestive heart failure, etc.) Currently has drug abuse problems (such as alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) Plans to undergo surgery that may result in noncompliance with the study protocol or that may cause confusion in data interpretation. 12.
