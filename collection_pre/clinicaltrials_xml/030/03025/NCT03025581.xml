	<brief_summary>Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM) is defined as the rupture of membranes before the onset of regular uterine contractions. PROM occurs in approximately 10% of all pregnancies (ranging from 2.7% to 17%), with 60% to 80% of cases occurring at term. Approximately 90% of patients' experience PROM enter spontaneous labor within 24 hours, but disagreement exists among health care providers on the optimal management of women with PROM, particularly the need for and timing of inductions. Nipple stimulation is a non-medical natural method for induction of labor. Previous studies demonstrated its effectiveness for initiating labor within 72 hours in women with favorable cervices. The actual mechanism by which such a technique results in cervical ripening is not well understood. In this study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of nipple stimulation in gravid women with term PROM choosing expectant management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Nipple Stimulation Shorten Time to Vaginal Birth in Women With Term PROM?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participants in the study will be randomized into two groups of expectant management (patients desire an active approach will be excluded). All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either intervention or control group. They will be followed from the time of presentation with rupture of membranes at the ER and until the time of delivery. Prophylactic antibiotics will be administered after 18 hours from rupture of membranes as per departmental policy. On admission, and after validating inclusion criteria, women will be offered to join the study. For the intervention group women will be instructed to gently massage alternate breasts, especially around the nipples for 15 minutes every 6 hours until the appearance of regular contractions but not more than 24 hours. Moist cloth or lubricating or moisturizing cream will be offered to facilitate the procedure according to individual preferences. In the control group all participants will be asked to avoid any breast stimulation during the study period. For both groups maternal surveillance will include obstetrician assessment every 6 hours or per maternal request if painful contractions. Every assessment will include documenting maternal vital signs, sense of contraction, fetal cardiotocographic assessment and vaginal examination if painful contractions. After delivery,all participants will be requested to fill a satisfaction questionnaire.</detailed_description>
