	<brief_summary>Congenital or acquired neurological disorders could lead to consistent motor and cognitive disabilities. The continuity and persistency of a tailored home rehabilitation protocol after recovery is crucial to prevent disease aggravation or relapses. The integration of a web-based new technology in home rehabilitation programme can constitute a functional low cost resource by offering patients off-line (and on-line) monitoring and by proposing new motivating ways of rehabilitation through high tech tools such as serious games.</brief_summary>
