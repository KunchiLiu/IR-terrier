This pilot aims to assess the impact of a nutrition intervention that combines several methods to help people change their lifestyle. The pilot project combines individual interviews and personal lifestyle goals (diet) with group classes for people with long-standing spinal cord injury. In addition to nutrition theory and practical exercises for diet-planning, motivational interviewing and mindfullness are incorporated into the course. The course is interdisciplinary, but is led primarily by a dietitian. Data is collected before the course starts and right after the 9-week course ends. The measurements involves self-perceived quality of life, food diary, weight, waist circumference and body composition (measured by BIA and DXA).</brief_summary>
