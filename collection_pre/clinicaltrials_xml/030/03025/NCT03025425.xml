	<brief_summary>An uncontrolled feasibility study on using mouth piece ventilation in palliation of dyspnea in subjects with acute exacerbation of COPD without acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Subjects are recruited from the local respiratory ward. The main outcomes are the compliance of the subjects with the treatment and alleviation of dyspnea during the treatment period.</brief_summary>
