	<brief_title>Prospective Study for Prognostic Biomarkers of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Primary: Evaluation of failure-free survival after three years of patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Secondary: Evaluation of overall survival after three years of patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Outline: This is a multicenter observational study. Tumor tissue specimens are obtained from the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University. The samples are analyzed for biomarkers. The biomarkers are correlated with clinical outcomes (failure-free survival, overall survival, tumor response to treatment, distant metastasis, recurrence and death). The aim of the analysis is to explore potential biomarkers and validate the predictive and prognostic value of molecular signature in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This will lead to the definition of risk groups and stratification of patients and will help to precision medicine of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</detailed_description>
