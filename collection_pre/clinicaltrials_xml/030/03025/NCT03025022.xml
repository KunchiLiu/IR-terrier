	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of 14C-JNJ-42847922 in healthy subjects after a single oral dose of 40 milligram (mg) 14C-JNJ-42847922 containing maximally 100 MicroCurie. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Signed an informed consent document indicating they (healthy participants) understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study Willing to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the protocol Women may be eligible to participate if they are of non childbearing potential, which is defined as (a) Postmenopausal: A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (more than [&gt;] 40 International Units Per Litre [IU/L] or milliInternational Units per milliliter [mIU/mL]) in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy, however in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient; OR (b) Permanently Sterile: Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectomy Body mass index (BMI; weight kilogram [kg]/height^2 (meter [m]^2)) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50 kg (kilogram) Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of Merury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic at screening and on Day 1 A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function, including: Sinus rhythm, Pulse rate between 45 and 90 beats per minute (bpm), corrected QT (QTc) interval less than and equal to (&lt;=) 450 millisecond (msec), QRS interval of &lt;110 msec, PR interval less than (&lt;) 200 msec. Morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function. During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug, in addition to the user independent highly effective method of contraception, a man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (example [e.g.], condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) or must agree not to donate sperm, who is pregnant must use a condom.
