	<brief_summary>Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is widely used for the treatment of urinary tract calculi; however, the vast majority of patients do not tolerate the procedure without analgesia and sedation. Lots of methods have been tried to control this pain (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, alpha 2 agonists, transversus abdominis plane block with long-acting local anesthetics, paravertebral block, local anesthetics infiltration, lidocaine/prilocaine cream). The quadratus lumborum block was first described by Blanco. QL block is performed as one of the perioperative pain management procedures for abdominal surgery. QL block provides anesthesia and analgesia on the anterior and lateral wall of the abdomen.</brief_summary>
