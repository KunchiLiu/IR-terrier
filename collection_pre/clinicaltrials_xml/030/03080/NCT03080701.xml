	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to build on the success of the Systems of Support to Increase Colorectal Cancer trial (SOS, R01CA121125, Green) and focus on disparity groups who are less likely to be current for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We will test whether financial incentives increases screening uptake and decreases screening disparities. The investigators hypothesize that CRC screening rates will be higher in patients offered mailed fecal kits and financial incentives than those offered mailed fecal kits alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Financial Incentives to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening in Priority Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study staff will send invitation letters and a questionnaire to 5,000 patients aged 50-75 not current for CRC screening, two-thirds who are identified in the electronic data as being from a non-White race, ethnicity, or who have Medicaid coverage. Those returning the survey and remaining eligible (estimated N = 1150) will be randomized to either (1) Mailed fecal kit only, or mailed fecal kit plus one of 2 types of financial incentives for completing testing: (2) a guaranteed Monetary incentive or (3) a probabilistic Lottery incentive.</detailed_description>
