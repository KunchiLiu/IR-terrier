	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study designed to assess the extended long-term safety of evolocumab in subjects who have completed the FOURIER trial (Study 20110118). FOURIER is a randomized placebo-controlled study of evolocumab, in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic CVD on stable effective statin therapy. Subjects at sites participating in FOURIER OLE (Study 20160250) who are eligible and have signed the FOURIER OLE informed consent will be enrolled after completion of FOURIER. The FOURIER OLE study requires laboratory assessments at day 1, week 12, and thereafter approximately every 6 months from day 1; the corresponding blood samples will be processed using a central laboratory. Upon enrollment in FOURIER OLE study, subjects will receive evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 420 mg monthly (QM) according to their preference. Frequency and corresponding dose of administration can be changed at any scheduled time point where evolocumab is supplied to the subject, provided the appropriate supply is available. It is recommended that subjects continue the same background lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), including statin, as taken during FOURIER. This study will continue for 260 weeks (approximately 5 years). Subjects ending administration of evolocumab should continue study assessments until the end of study. All subjects will be followed and complete procedures/assessments from enrollment through the date of study termination unless the subject has withdrawn consent, irrespective of whether the subject is continuing to receive treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any studyspecific activities/procedures. Subject had completed FOURIER (Study 20110118) while still receiving assigned Investigational Product. Permanent discontinuation of Investigational Product during FOURIER for any reason including an adverse event or serious adverse event. Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less than 4 weeks since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug study(ies). Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are excluded. Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocolrequired study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures to the best of the subject and investigator's knowledge. History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion. Subject has known sensitivity to any of the active substances or excipients (eg, carboxymethylcellulose) to be administered during dosing. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during treatment with evolocumab and for an additional 15 weeks after treatment with evolocumab discontinues. Female subjects of childbearing potential unwilling to use an acceptable method of effective contraception during treatment and for an additional 15 weeks after the last dose of protocolrequired therapies.</criteria>
