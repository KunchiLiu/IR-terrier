	<brief_title>Sublingual Versus Endovenous Fentanyl for the Prehospital Analgesia in Patients With Limb Trauma on the Slope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fentanyl endovenous (ev) is an excellent analgesic drug for pain relief in acute traumatic pain. Fentanyl sublingual (Abstral Â®) is an excellent analgesic drug in the breakthrough cancer pain relief in oncologic patients. The immediate (less than 10 minutes) effect and the ease of administration of sublingual fentanyl is a feasible drug administration for immediate analgesia in remote areas such as mountain rescue missions eg. the slope. Patients will be recruited according to a randomized list to fentanyl ev or fentanyl sublingual versus placebo oral or placebo ev. Safety issues like control of vital signs will be warranted.</detailed_description>
