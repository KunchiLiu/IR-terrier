	<brief_summary>The investigators are doing this study to improve our ability to identify which people with many moles on their skin are most likely to develop skin melanoma. The investigators hope to identify features of moles that are associated with melanoma risk. The investigators hope to use this information to customize and tailor melanoma screening to the individual patient based on a better estimate of their individual risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Stratification Among Individuals Who Have Many Moles on Their Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 years of age Highrisk nevus phenotype (≥ 50 nevi and ≥ 1 atypical nevus) First presented to MSKCC for cutaneous melanomarelated care within the past 12 months Cases: recent diagnosis (≤ 12 months) of unequivocal invasive cutaneous melanomas (AJCC Stages IIV) confirmed by MSKCC pathology Cases: completion of surgical treatment of primary melanoma Ability to sign informed consent Known germline highpenetrance melanoma predisposition mutation (that is, CDKN2A and CDK4) Cases: history of invasive cutaneous melanoma (AJCC Stages IIV) not confirmed by MSKCC pathology, history of acrolentiginous type of cutaneous melanoma Cases: history of systemic adjuvant therapy or treatment of metastatic melanoma, including: MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib, etc.), BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, etc.), and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, ipilimumab, etc.). Controls: history of Stage 0IV melanoma confirmed by MSKCC pathology History of limb amputation or other condition (e.g., tattoos, burns) per investigator discretion that would modify nevus phenotype Physical inability to undergo total body photography or reflectance confocal microscopy imaging (that is, remain relatively still for durations of 35 minutes) Known hypersensitivity to adhesive rings used for reflectance confocal microscopy Inability to give informed consent Have skin afflicted with anther skin condition (for example, psoriasis) that would affect ability to characterize nevus phenotype (per investigator discretion) Familial cutaneous melanoma history (families with at least one invasive melanoma and two or more other diagnoses of invasive melanoma or pancreatic cancer among first or seconddegree relatives on the same side of the family). We will confirm melanoma family history via medical record documentation, whenever possible, as recommended by previous studies that disproved about half of the reported family histories of melanoma among firstdegree relatives in casecontrol studies.</criteria>
