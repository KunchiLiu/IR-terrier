	<brief_summary>A multicenter prospective registry planned to recruit more than 5 000 patients with renal artery stenosis was carried out in China. This primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of renal artery revascularization in the real world. The secondary purpose was to investigate the etiologic distribution of renal artery stenosis and optimize the indications for renal artery revascularization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endovascular Therapy for Renal Artery Stenosis in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently,the endovascular therapy of renal artery stenosis (especially atherosclerotic) remains in dispute. Some randomized control trials published in recent years (including ASTRAL and CORAL trials) showed the lack of additional benefit for renal artery revascularization compared with sole medical therapy. However,these randomized control trials presented a number of limitations including low numbers of patients and non-stringent inclusion criteria. Given clinical medical practice entering the era of big data, the large-sample real-word studies would be more objective to answer some pending issues of randomized controlled trial.Therefore,a multicenter prospective registry planned to recruit more than 5 000 patients with renal artery stenosis was carried out. This primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of renal artery revascularization in the real world. The secondary purpose was to investigate the etiologic distribution of renal artery stenosis and optimize the indications for renal artery revascularization.</detailed_description>
