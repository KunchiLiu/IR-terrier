	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if 5 consecutive sessions of PathMaker DoubleStim treatment, which combines non-invasive stimulation of the spinal cord (tsDCS- trans-spinal direct current stimulation) and of the median nerve at the peripheral wrist (pDCS-- peripheral direct current stimulation), can significantly reduce spasticity of the wrist and hand after stroke.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. First single focal unilateral hemisphere lesion with diagnosis verified by brain imaging (MRI or CT scans) that occurred at least 6 months prior 2. Cognitive function sufficient to understand the experiments and follow instructions 3. A Modified Ashworth score between 13 points for wrist flexors and extensor muscles 4. A minimum of 15 degrees wrist passive ROM for wrist flexion and extension from wrist neutral position 1. Focal brainstem or thalamic infarcts 2. Prior surgical treatments for spasticity of the upper limb 3. Ongoing use of CNSactive medications 4. Ongoing use of psychoactive medications, such as stimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications 5. Botox or phenal alcohol treatment within 12 weeks of enrollment 6. Pregnancy in women, as determined by selfreport 7. History of spinal cord injury or weakness 8. Chronic pain 9. Peripheral neuropathy including insulin dependent diabetes as determined by case history 10. Presence of additional potential tsDCS risk factors: Damaged skin at the site of stimulation (i.e., skin with ingrown hairs, acne, razor nicks, wounds that have not healed recent scar tissue, broken skin, etc.) Presence of an electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implant (including cardiac pacemaker), an intracerebral vascular clip, or any other electrically sensitive support system Highly conductive metal in any part of the body, including metal injury to the eye (jewelry must be removed during stimulation) Past history of seizures or unexplained spells of loss of consciousness during the previous 36 months</criteria>
