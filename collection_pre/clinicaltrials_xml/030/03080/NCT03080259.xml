	<brief_title>Primary Care Prevention of Stimulant Diversion by High School Students With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study addresses the increase in diversion (selling, sharing, loaning, or trading) of prescription stimulant medications by adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In the absence of any standardized, empirically evaluated clinical strategies or interventions to prevent or decrease stimulant diversion, this project will test the effect of a brief provider-led intervention for stimulant diversion prevention among adolescents being prescribed stimulant medication in pediatric care. The investigators hypothesize that adolescents treated in pediatric practices randomized to the intervention will report decreased diversion, increased perceived risk of harm, and decreased intentions to divert compared to adolescents treated in pediatric practices randomized to treatment-as-usual. Secondary analyses will examine the effect of the intervention on additional contributing variables (e.g., patient, parent, and provider attitude and behavior change).</detailed_description>
