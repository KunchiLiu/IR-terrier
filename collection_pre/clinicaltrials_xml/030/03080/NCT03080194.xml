	<brief_summary>This is a 12-month single-arm study, including a 6-month follow-up period and a 6-month interim analysis period. Patients with schizophrenia and violence risk under the government supervision will be enrolled in the study. A community-based long-acting antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied to the studying subjects, which means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance to primary-level mental health workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia treatment. Every studying subject will be equipped with an intelligent robot capable at push-to-talk and push-to-view, allowing the patients and caregivers to contact doctors for assistance at any time. The studying subjects will be injected with 150mg eq and 100mg eq paliperidone palmitate in the deltoid at the 1st and 8th day, and afterwards a flexible dose of paliperidone palmitate from 75 to 150mg eq will be administrated monthly according to clinical judgement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a 12-month single-arm study, including a 6-month follow-up period and a 6-month interim analysis period. Patients with schizophrenia and violence risk under the government supervision will be enrolled in the study. A community-based long-acting antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied to the studying subjects, which means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance to primary-level mental health workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia treatment. Studying subject will be equipped with an intelligent robot capable at push-to-talk and push-to-view, allowing the patients and caregivers to contact doctors for assistance at any time, if they are able to use smart phones. The studying subjects will be injected with 150mg eq and 100mg eq paliperidone palmitate in the deltoid at the 1st and 8th day, and afterwards a flexible dose of paliperidone palmitate from 75 to 150mg eq will be administrated monthly according to clinical judgement. Previous oral antipsychotics could be continued or withdrawn in 2-4 weeks after first paliperidone palmitate administration according to doctors' clinical judgement. Doctors have rights to decide whether a patient needs in-hospital treatment or extramural hospital treatment. The study protocol does not limit other medication or treatment measures except the injectable paliperidone palmitate. Other medication or treatment measures should be decided according to doctors' clinical judgement and negotiation with patients and guardians.</detailed_description>
