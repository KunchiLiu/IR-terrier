	<brief_summary>The functional assessment of the hip joint is complex and challenging. Reproducible measures are necessary to identify changes in the structures and functionality of the hip joint over time and to evaluate the outcomes of treatments. A systematic evaluation process is critical to evidence-based practice. However, there are few studies investigating the reproducibility of these measures such as muscle strength, range of motion (ROM) and hip functionality in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
