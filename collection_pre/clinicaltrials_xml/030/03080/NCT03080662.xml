	<brief_summary>The impact of the reduction of daily physical activity (DPA) in patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a highly studied area, due to its impact on the quality of life and the clinical evolution of the disease . This fact has multifactorial components: its function is naturally diminished with time, and its effects on the loss of physical condition (decondition). However, dynamic hyperinflation and respiratory muscular dysfunction, especially in patients with more symptomatology, have been identified as those that have the most relevant factors that impact on daily physical activity Due to the detrimental effects of the pulmonary hyperinflation, the diaphragm is flatter and shorter, being in a position of mechanical disadvantage. This contributes to a reduced effort capacity and increase in the dyspnea of patients during daily activities. Resistance training improves their exercise capacity and reduces dyspnea, however it does not improve inspiratory muscle strength. It is for this reason, that specific training of the inspiratory muscles, offers special interest in patients with decreased inspiratory muscle strength and pulmonary hyperinflation.</brief_summary>
