	<brief_summary>Cesarean delivery is a common obstetrical procedure and is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality. Pain and limited mobilization are major contributing factors that result in delayed functional recovery and complications. Elastic abdominal binder, a wide elastic belt that is wore around the patient's abdomen to support surgical incision after surgery, has been employed by clinicians for pain relief, wound complications prevention, improved pulmonary function, and stabilization. Benefits of the abdominal binder use have not been properly examined. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of postcesarean elastic abdominal binder use on recovery by comparing pain scores and mobility function (through the 6-minute walk test [6MWT]) in postcesarean mothers who use versus do not use the elastic abdominal binder to support incisional site.</brief_summary>
