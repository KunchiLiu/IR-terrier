	<brief_title>Efficacy of Over-glasses Patch Treatment for Amblyopia in Children : OPTA Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized multi-center controlled clinical trial, children younger than 7 years with moderate amblyopia (visual acuity in the range of 20/40 to 20/100) would be included to receive treatment with either a conventional patch or an over-glasses patch. The patients will be prescribed 2 hours of patching per day for the sound eye. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and stereopsis will be investigated and ATI questionnaires be collected from parents at 5 weeks and 17 weeks after the initiation of treatment.</detailed_description>
