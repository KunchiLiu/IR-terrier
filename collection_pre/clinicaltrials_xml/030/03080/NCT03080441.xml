	<brief_title>Minimization of Intradialytic Hypotension Using Cardiography-Guided Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) events, reported to occur in 15% to 50% of hemodialysis (HD) treatments, is still high despite major technical advances in HD technology. By definition, excessive reduction in intravascular volume by ultrafiltration and limited vascular refilling from tissues into the vascular space is the cause of IDH. Chronic HD patients exhibit a high prevalence of peripheral vascular and cardiac abnormalities. Specifically, hemodynamic instability during HD can occur due to insufficient reduction in venous unstressed volume, poor diastolic filling under reduced atrial pressures associated with diastolic dysfunction, altered cardiac contractility, and impaired vascular reactivity. An IDH event can lead to myocardial cerebral and other organ ischemia. Long- and short-term adverse outcomes have been associated with IDH, a common HD complication and significant cause of morbidity. Recent pilot studies suggest that in IDH-prone subjects, measurements of hemodynamic variables during HD can be used to categorize the hemodynamic response into three subgroups: cardiac power index (CPI) reduction with stable total peripheral resistance (TPR), TPR reduction with stable CPI, and reduction in TPR and CPI groups. It is hypothesized that targeted intervention for each subgroup can reduce IDH.</detailed_description>
