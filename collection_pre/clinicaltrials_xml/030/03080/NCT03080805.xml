	<brief_summary>Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. This study is a randomized,open-label,multi-center,active-controlled, parallel design study of the combination of pyrotinib and capecitabine versus Lapatinib plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients, who have prior received taxane and trastuzumab.Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms.Arm A: pyrotinib (400 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily),Arm B: Lapatinib (1250 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily).Patients will receive either arm of therapy until the occurrence of death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawalof consent.</brief_summary>
