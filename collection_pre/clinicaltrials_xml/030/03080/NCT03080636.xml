All subjects did 3 sessions: aerobic exercise on a treadmill, resistance exercise at the gym and a seated control session.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sex and Exercise-mode Differences in Post Exercise Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Variability Responses During Workday</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resting blood pressure and heart rate variability are simple and non-invasive methods to evaluate cardiovascular risk after different exercise sessions. Thus, exercise can reduce these risk factors in the short and long term, but these responses can be different between sex in different exercise sessions.</detailed_description>
