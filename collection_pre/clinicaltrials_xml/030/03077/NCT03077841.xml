	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the side effects that may occur after radiation is given to breast cancer patients for 2 to 2½ weeks at the part of the breast where the disease first started. Researchers also want to learn if this treatment can help to control the disease and prevent the cancer from coming back in the breast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Preventative Adjuvant Linac-Based Radiation: the OPAL Trial - Study of Hypofractionated Partial Breast Irradiation in Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, one (1) time before you begin radiation treatment: - You will complete 1 questionnaire about how your breast currently looks and feels. It should take about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaires. - The study team will take pictures of your breast to compare the way it looks before and after you begin receiving radiation. Your face will be covered (as much as possible) and will not be included in the pictures. Length of Study: You will receive radiation for 2 to 2½ weeks. You will no longer be able to receive radiation if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation will be over after the 5-year follow-up visit. Study Treatment Administration: If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive about 2 weeks of radiation (10 treatments) to the part of the breast where the disease first started. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have 3 additional radiation treatments as a "boost." The boost will be delivered to and focus more closely on the part of the breast where the disease first started. Follow-Up Visits: 3 weeks after you have finished receiving radiation, you will have a physical exam. You will return for additional follow-up visits 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after you have finished receiving radiation. At each visit: - You will complete the study questionnaire - The study team will take pictures of both of your breasts. - You will have a physical exam. This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy will be delivered using FDA approved and commercially available methods. The shorter radiation treatment period is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain how radiation is designed to work. Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 50 or older. 2. Female sex. 3. Diagnosis of pathologicallyconfirmed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. 4. Pathologic T stage of Tis, T1, or T2 with total size of tumor &lt; /= 3 cm (this size criteria applies to both pure DCIS and invasive tumors). 5. For patients with invasive breast cancer, pathologic N stage of N0, N0 (i), or N0 (i+). Pathologic staging of the axilla is not required for patients with pure DCIS. 6. Treatment with breast conserving surgery. 7. Unifocal primary tumor based on imaging and clinical assessment. Microscopic multifocality is allowed. 8. Final surgical margins negative defined as no tumor on ink. Lobular carcinoma in situ involving the final surgical margin will be disregarded. 9. For invasive cancers, the tumor must be estrogen receptor positive (defined as 10% or greater expression of estrogen receptor) 10. If the patient has a history of a prior nonbreast cancer, all treatment for this cancer must have been completed at least one month prior to study registration and the patient must have no evidence of disease for this prior nonbreast cancer. 11. Patients must be enrolled on the trial within 12 weeks of the later of two dates: the final breast conserving surgical procedure or administration of the last cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy. 12. Final criteria for eligibility established after simulation: The tumor bed can be readily visualized on simulation CT and is localized to one quadrant or region of the breast that is amenable to partial breast irradiation. 1. Tumor invasion of the skin including dermis, chest wall, or pectoralis musculature. 2. Any evidence of nodal positivity beyond pathologic stage of pN0(i+). 3. Systemic chemotherapy prior to final breast conserving surgery. 4. Patient is pregnant or nursing. 5. History of therapeutic irradiation to the breast, lower neck, mediastinum or other area in which there could potentially be overlap with the affected breast. 6. History of prior invasive or in situ cancer in either breast. 7. Current diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer. 8. History of lupus or scleroderma.</criteria>
