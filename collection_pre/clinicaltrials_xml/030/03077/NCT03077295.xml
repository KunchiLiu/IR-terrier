	<brief_summary>This weight loss study will investigate the impact of diet composition and meal size (large breakfast meals and smaller evening meals) on body weight, energy balance and eating behaviour, by altering calorie (meal) distribution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Big Breakfast Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to further strengthen our understanding of the role of dietary components (in particular fibre and protein) in a healthy diet. The information gained from this research will lead to better policy advice, particularly in relation to healthy weight management, metabolic control, mental health and intestinal health. It will also lay the foundations to produce healthier primary products and aid the food industry in developing new and healthier products (e.g. products that aid hunger control and satiety). This will be addressed through four interlinked objectives: O1: Healthy weight management and improved metabolic and mental health O2: Identification of gut bacteria and compounds of relevance to vascular and gut health O3: Linking fibre consumption to intestinal microbial communities and health O4: Mathematical modelling of interactions between diet and gut microbial communities</detailed_description>
