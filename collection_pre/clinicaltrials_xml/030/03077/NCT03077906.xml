	<brief_summary>Obesity surgery has become commonplace nowadays. This type of surgery is in full swing and although it is mostly beneficial for the health of the patient (reduction of cardiovascular risks, improvement of self image, reduction of osteo-articular risks, etc...) it is however associated with risks. There are several short and long term complications, excluding the ones related to the anesthesia and the post-op recovery: fistulas, abcesses, infections, dysphagia, risks of endobrachyoesophagus, etc... The gastroœsophageal reflux remains by far the most common post-op complaint within patients. Patients can experience symptoms as far as 3 years after the surgery. Medical treatment alone can in most cases lighten the symptoms. However, in some cases, this treatment fails and another type of surgery (bypass) must be undertaken, which is psychologically traumatic for the patient. This retrospective study will analyze a cohort of patients who underwent bariatric surgery (mainly sleeve gastrectomy), in order to identify those at risk of developping gastroœsophageal reflux and how this complication can be avoided in pre-op. The study will also identify cases of invalidating gastroœsophageal reflux that can be solved by obesity surgery.</brief_summary>
