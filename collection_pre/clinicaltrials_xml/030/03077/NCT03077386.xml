	<brief_summary>In Canada, the prevalence of chronic disease is increasing and patients presenting with multiple conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) are becoming the norm in primary care. Complex treatment regimens such as administration of medications (including insulin), clinical monitoring and screening for complications, adherence to dietary and lifestyle changes, and decisions about when to seek medical care are challenging. To help people with complex health conditions optimize their care and outcomes, community health worker programs have begun to be used across the United States and Canada. Existing community health worker programs share a common goal of helping patients to overcome modifiable barriers to care to achieve optimal outcomes. While community health workers may work within a primary health care team, the primary role of the community health worker is not clinically oriented, and may be fulfilled by laypersons. Depending on the targeted barriers, specific tasks may include one or more of: disease education, health system education, assistance with insurance coverage, aid in care coordination, and referral to community resources, among others. Herein, the investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a community health worker intervention on improving acute care utilization among patients with complex chronic disease seen in primary care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Health Worker Intervention for Patients With Complex Chronic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic diseases are long--term conditions that progress in severity over time and are generally not curable. Results from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) indicate that approximately 21% of adults over 20 years had at least one major chronic disease. Among these, approximately 10% had diabetes, 6% had cardiovascular disease, 4% had heart failure, and 10% had asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, reported by the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System. In 2012-13, over 735,000 Albertans had at least one major chronic disease, and publicly funded health services for these patients cost the Alberta government approximately $4.5 billion dollars in that year. In Canada, the prevalence of chronic disease is increasing and patients presenting with multiple conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) are becoming the norm in primary care. Multimorbidity is associated with poor quality of life, decline in functional status, and a high burden on the healthcare system. Safe, efficacious and cost--effective interventions for chronic diseases are available, however these treatments are under-utilized. Individuals with chronic diseases may have difficulty achieving care goals due to a combination of patient, provider and system level barriers. Complex treatment regimens such as administration of medications (including insulin), clinical monitoring and screening for complications, adherence to dietary and lifestyle changes, and decisions about when to seek medical care are challenging. The ability to comply with these recommendations is dependent on a number of factors, including health and financial status, access to care and care experience, and personal circumstance. To help people with complex health conditions optimize their care and outcomes, community health worker programs have begun to be used across the United States and Canada. Existing community health worker programs share a common goal of helping patients to overcome modifiable barriers to care to achieve optimal outcomes, and are a possible solution to overcoming barriers to accessing health care in patients with complex chronic disease. While community health workers may work within a primary health care team, the primary role of the community health worker is not clinically oriented, and may be fulfilled by laypersons. Depending on the targeted barriers, specific tasks may include one or more of: disease education, health system education, assistance with insurance coverage, aid in care coordination, and referral to community resources, among others. Herein, the investigators propose a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a community health worker intervention on improving acute care utilization among patients with complex chronic disease seen in primary care.</detailed_description>
