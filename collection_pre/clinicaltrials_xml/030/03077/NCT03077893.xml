	<brief_summary>A study to demonstrate the effectiveness of PEMF treatment compared to sham treatment in changing Vibration Perception Threshold (VPT) and Thermal Sensory (QST) in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) when treatment is administered twice daily through 120-day period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of PEMF to Evaluate VPT and Thermal Sensory in Subjects With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center, sham-controlled, double-blind, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal clinical trial conducted on subjects with bilateral symmetrical diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of age with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in both feet despite treatment. Eligible subjects will receive two active treatment devices (one for each foot, to allow simultaneous treatment) and treat at home, twice daily for 60 days after which they will return to the clinic at Day 61 for a response assessment. Subjects that are determined to be responders at Day 61 (subjects that achieve a 1-point decrease in the average pain score over the last 24 hours using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)) will be randomized 1:1 to either active treatment or inactive sham devices and will continue treating through Day 120. Subjects that are determined to be non-responders at Day 61 will continue treating with the active devices given at enrollment and will return to the clinic at Day 75 and Day 91 for a response assessment. If a subject is determined to be a responder at Day 75, they will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment or inactive sham and will continue treating through Day 120. If a subject is determined to be a responder at Day 91, they will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment or sham and will continue to treat through Day 120. If a subject continues to be a non-responder at Day 91 they will be terminated from the study.</detailed_description>
