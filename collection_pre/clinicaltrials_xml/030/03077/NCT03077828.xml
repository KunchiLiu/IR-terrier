	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new drug Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, for Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. The chemotherapy regimen is called "ICE" and includes three drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. Pembrolizumab is currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of some patients with melanoma, lung cancer and head and neck cancer, but has not yet been approved for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. The 'ICE' regimen of chemotherapy is currently FDA approved for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma, but has not yet been investigated in combination with pembrolizumab for this disease. For patients who have a relapse of their Hodgkin's lymphoma, retreatment with chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant is recommended. We know that obtaining a complete remission (not able to detect any disease on scans) is very important prior to proceeding to the stem cell transplant. Patients with negative scans have a lower chance of the disease coming back and a higher chance of achieving a long-term cure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the complete response rate by fludeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) with the combination of pembrolizumab and ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (ICE) salvage chemotherapy for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with salvage high-dose chemotherapy according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.03. II. To estimate the event free survival (EFS) at 2 years from start of treatment. III. To estimate the overall survival (OS) at 2 years from start of treatment. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize PD-1 pathway specific expression and correlate with response. II. To characterize serum biomarkers of immune and inflammatory response during treatment. III. To characterize levels of soluble PD-L1 related to treatment with pembrolizumab. IV. To characterize T-lymphocyte subset changes to treatment with pembrolizumab. V. To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlation of chromosome 9p24.1 mutations for this population. VI. To evaluate the effect on stem cell harvest following treatment with pembrolizumab. OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3 of courses 1-2, carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 2 of courses 1-2, and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 2 of courses 1-2. Pembrolizumab in combination with ICE chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for 2 courses, patients will then receive pembrolizumab as monotherapy on course 3. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma including nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyticrich, and lymphocyte depleted subtypes by the 4th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues published in 2008 Patients must have disease with FDGPET/CT avidity Patients must have relapsed/refractory disease, with at least one line of prior chemotherapy, but =&lt; 2 prior lines of treatment, for Hodgkin lymphoma; NOTE: Patients must not have had prior immune checkpoint inhibitors; however, there are no other limitations to prior agent or regimen types Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 Patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function within 10 days of registration, as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mcL (in the absence of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) for &gt;= 14 days) Platelets &gt;= 75,000/mcl (in the absence of platelet transfusion for &gt;= 14 days) Hemoglobin &gt;= 7g/dL (transfusion permitted) Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); if total bilirubin is &gt; 2 x ULN, the direct bilirubin must be normal Aspartate aminotransferases (AST) (serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SPGT]) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN Creatinine =&lt; 2 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 30 ml/min Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to registration; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication; NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for &gt; 12 months) NOTE: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to registration on study Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, monoclonal antibody (mAb), or targeted small molecule therapy within 4 weeks of study registration are not eligible;
