	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether genomic based risk-stratification can be used in deciding whether to de-intensify in patients with Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) with &gt; 10 pack years smoking history. Hypothesis: Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, &gt; 10 pack years smoking history, and non-mutated p53 will have similar 2 year progression-free survival (PFS) as patients with &lt; 10 pack years smoking history.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a follow-up study to LCCC 1120 and 1413. The investigators have shown that de-intensification is efficacious in these two phase II studies. A major question is whether the investigators can de-intensify in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer who have smoking histories. The investigators' hypothesis is that genomic profiling of patients' tumors (specifically for p53 mutations) will help in triaging patients to de-intensification versus standard of care. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC will be enrolled regardless of smoking history and p53 mutational status will be assessed in patients with a smoking history. The investigators will use the same de-intensification chemoradiotherapy regimen already evaluated in LCCC 1120 and 1413 in patients with HPV-associated OPSCC who have a minimal smoking history and in patients with a smoking history but with wild-type p53. Patients with a smoking history who have mutated p53 will not receive de-intensified chemoradiotherapy, but instead will receive standard doses. The hypothesis is that by using genomics in the patients with a significant smoking history, the investigators will better select those who can be safely de-intensified. Circulating free HPV DNA (cf-HPV-DNA) will also be prospectively assessed from blood samples.</detailed_description>
