	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 study, which will assess the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally-administered AMXT 1501 dicaprate in normal healthy male volunteers. The study is comprised of a total of 8 cohorts; 4 single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts, 1 Food Effect (FE) Crossover cohort, and 3 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Tablets will be administered after an overnight fast (10 hours) with at least 250 mL water. No food will be administered (exception for "fed" subjects, see below) for one hour thereafter. Each cohort will have a total 6 subjects: SAD and MAD (2 subjects receiving placebo and 4 subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate); and FE crossover (6 subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 study, which will assess the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally-administered AMXT 1501 dicaprate in normal healthy male volunteers. The study is comprised of a total of 8 cohorts; 4 single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts, 1 Food Effect (FE) Crossover cohort, and 3 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Tablets will be administered after an overnight fast (10 hours) with at least 250 mL water. No food will be administered (exception for "fed" subjects, see below) for one hour thereafter. Each cohort will have a total 6 subjects: SAD and MAD (2 subjects receiving placebo and 4 subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate); and FE crossover (6 subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate). SAD cohorts are defined as follows: - Cohort 1: One placebo and one AMXT 1501 dicaprate subject will be treated as sentinel subjects receiving one tablet each of their assigned treatment. Assuming no intolerance is noted after at least 3 days, the remaining cohort subjects (placebo, 1 subject and AMXT 1501 dicaprate, 3 subjects) will be treated. - Cohort 2: 2 subjects 2 placebo each and 4 subjects 2 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each - Cohort 3: 2 subjects 4 placebos each and 4 subjects 4 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each - Cohort 4: 2 subjects 8 placebos each and 4 subjects 8 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each FE Crossover: • Cohort 5: 6 new subjects will be randomized to a fed (n=3 standard meal) or fasted (n=3) group and administered the highest dose of AMXT 1501 dicaprate tolerated by previous cohorts. First dose and accompanying assessments will be referred to as Period 1. Subjects will then crossover to the opposite diet plan (fed or fasted) and receive a second administration of study treatment at the same dose level. The second dose and assessments are referred to as Period 2. There will be a 7-day washout between doses administered in Periods 1 and 2. MAD cohorts will receive dosing once daily for 14 consecutive days. Dosing will be contingent on adequate tolerance in Cohorts 1-5. - Cohort 6: 2 subjects 2 placebos each; 4 subjects 2 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each - Cohort 7: 2 subjects 4 placebos each; 4 subjects 4 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each - Cohort 8: 2 subjects 8 placebos each; 4 subjects 8 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each</detailed_description>

Subjects who are able and willing to give written informed consent. 1. History of any important clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 2.
