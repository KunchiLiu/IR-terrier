	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy and feasibility (possibility) of Aixplorer® ShearWave Elastography (SWE™) Ultrasound System (made by SuperSonic Imagine, Inc.) for detecting prostate cancer in men undergoing radical prostatectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Ultrasound Elastography Detecting Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The point estimate and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the exact binominal method. Identification of suspicious cancer tissue in a 12 prostate zone schema: Participants will undergo USE: Aixplorer® ShearWave Elastography (SWE™), (SuperSonic Imagine). Areas of the prostate with high suspicion for harboring cancer will be recorded in a 12 zone prostate schema. For study purposes the prostate will be divided into Zone 1(Left Lateral Base), Zone 2 (Left Base), Zone 3 (Right Base), Zone 4 (Right Lateral Base), Zone 5 (Left Lateral Mid), Zone 6 (Left Mid), Zone 7 (Right Mide), Zone 8 (Right Lateral Mid), Zone 9 (Left Lateral Apex), Zone 10 (Left Apex), Zone 11 (Right Apex), Zone 12 (Right Lateral Apex).</detailed_description>
