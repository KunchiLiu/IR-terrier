	<brief_title>Trial of NanoPac in Subjects With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this open-label, dose-escalating, Phase IIa trial, subjects with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma located in the tail or body of the pancreas will receive intratumoral (ITU) NanoPac (Sterile Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel) via endoscopic ultrasound-guided direct injection. Subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of NanoPac at escalating doses, at a volume based on up to 20% of calculated tumor volume (with a maximum injection volume of 5 mL per subject). Each cohort will have three subjects, with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration. Following DSMB review of the cohort data, the next cohort may begin enrolling, an additional three subjects at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the first dose does not provide adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted. The dose determined to be most suitable for further evaluation, defined as the highest dose with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile as determined by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), will enroll additional subjects to provide a cohort of up to 12 subjects at that dose level. Plasma samples will be taken at various time points on the day of NanoPac injection as well as once at each of the study visits, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of intratumoral NanoPac. Subjects will be followed for three months after NanoPac injection for safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), CA-19-9 levels, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, reduction in pain, and tumor response to therapy (as shown by imaging). A follow-up visit may be conducted at six months, as applicable.</detailed_description>
