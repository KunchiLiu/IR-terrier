	<brief_summary>Healthful eating is a core component of a healthy lifestyle that is associated with lower risk of obesity and chronic disease. Although adolescent health promotion programs have been extensively evaluated and applied in English-speaking Western developed nations, there is very little published literature in the Russian context. Our study seeks to determine the relative effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle intervention consisting of nutrition education at a Russian camp. Investigators will determine the impact of behaviorally focused nutrition education on nutrition knowledge, food choice, attitude, and self-efficacy for healthful eating, compared to standard nutrition education.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behaviorally Oriented Nutrition Education at a Russian Summer Camp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project consists of the evaluation of two evidence-based nutrition education programs. Setting and participants: A random selection of all youth with parental consent for the program will comprise the sample of 40 boys and girls, ages 8-12y. Children with food allergies (to fruits, vegetables, nuts, crackers, corn pops, cookies) will be ineligible for participation. Participants will be randomly assigned to either behaviorally oriented nutrition education or standard nutrition education group (comparison group). Measures: Questionnaires will be completed by each participant at the baseline (the first day) and post-intervention (the last session day). The questionnaire addresses nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy and enjoyment of fruit and vegetable consumption. Controlled observation of healthy/unhealthy snack selection: at the baseline and post-intervention, kids will select snacks first from a menu (individual measure) and then a buffet (group measure) with 3 healthy (fruits and vegetables, nuts) and 3 unhealthy (crackers, corn pops, cookies) snack options. Measurements of height, weight, and waist circumference will be taken prior to the first nutrition education session. Demographics: Investigators will obtain information on age, gender, ethnicity, family socioeconomic status, and parental education level via questionnaire. Procedures: Parents will be informed about potential for child to be involved in healthful nutrition and physical activity at camper check-in. After an informed consent is signed, parents/caregivers and the participant will fill out baseline questionnaires. The parent survey will ask about their child's ethnicity, parental education level, and family socioeconomic status. Each participant will privately have their height, weight, and waist circumference measured prior to start of study. Participants will attend 45 minute sessions from Monday to Friday throughout 3 weeks at the camp. Each session will be held using different modules from the evidence-based HOP'N After School program. The difference in sessions between the intervention and comparison group will be that the intervention group will get both nutrition education and skill-training component during the session (for example, creating a healthy snack, playing games focusing on enjoyment of fruit and vegetable consumption); the control group will not receive the skill-training component, but will get the same nutrition knowledge as the intervention group. Controlled observation snack tests will take place at the beginning and at the end of the program (baseline and post-intervention).</detailed_description>
