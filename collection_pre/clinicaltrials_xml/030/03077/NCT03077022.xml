	<brief_summary>The treatment of femoroacetabular impingement has evolved over the last several years. As the number of arthroscopic hip operations has risen over the last few years, so has the level controversy in regards to the appropriate initial management. There have been many recent advances in clinical diagnosis, advanced imaging techniques, improved indications for surgery and improved arthroscopic techniques which have led to improved clinical outcomes, but the effectiveness of physical therapy remains unknown.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment of femoroacetabular impingement has evolved over the last several years. As the number of arthroscopic hip operations has risen over the last few years, so has the level controversy in regards to the appropriate initial management. There have been many recent advances in clinical diagnosis, advanced imaging techniques, improved indications for surgery and improved arthroscopic techniques which have led to improved clinical outcomes, but the effectiveness of physical therapy remains unknown. A paucity of evidence exists in regards to the non-operative treatment of FAI. Several insurance companies are now requiring three to six months of physical therapy prior to approval for surgery. There is not a single study that has objectively evaluated the effectiveness of physical therapy in the avoidance of surgical intervention. The investigators plan to evaluate this using an electronic outcomes data collection system. The hypothesis is that the majority of patients will not see a significant enough improvement with physical therapy to avoid surgery, especially in a subset of patients such as those with sub spine impingement. The investigators plan to prospectively collect data for three years and monitor the outcome of each hip patient, especially those treated with physical therapy as an initial treatment and there potential avoidance of surgery.</detailed_description>
