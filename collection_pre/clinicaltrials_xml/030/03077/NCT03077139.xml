	<detailed_description>This study aims to determine whether stimulating earlier activation of the failing right ventricle in pulmonary hypertension reduces the effects of interventricular dependence in human subjects, thereby improving overall cardiac function and symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle failure with NYHA Class 3-4 symptoms.</detailed_description>
