	<detailed_description>the effect size is the diameter of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients with treatments or not is the key to smoothly. Arm vein intermittently gripping arm movements, can promote the increased diameter of arteriovenous fistula, which enhance the maturity of fistula, the effect of lack of empirical research. Objective: this study, randomized controlled study, investigate systematic random arm vein pressure and arm movements to arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients improve the maturity rate and effectiveness of the diameter. Methods: a prospective comparative study randomly assigned. This study plan for each patient has received a wrist artery and vein access tracks before and after 3 months of operation, according to randomly divided into three groups, the first group of patients after accepted guidance for systematic and intermittent arm movements; the second group of patients receiving the guidance system of intermittent arm vein compression and arm movements; a third group as a control group. Discussion: the plan is expected to include 150 patients, receive instruction after the randomly with/without systemic venous pressure, with/without systemic movement. The plan design under the patient safety assessment of the effectiveness of these two activities the primary end point and secondary end points. This study offers clinicians advise patients, how to effectively improve the patients ' arteriovenous access matured speed and diameter.
