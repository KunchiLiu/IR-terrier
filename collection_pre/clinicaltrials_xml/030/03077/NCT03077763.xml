	<brief_summary>The study is a pharmacodynamic random order cross-over trial investigating the physiological effects of intra-arterial infusion of nitrite following a haemolysed autologous blood transfusion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a healthy volunteer study. Following entry into this cross-over trial, participants will be randomized to undergo experiments under either normoxic followed by hypoxic conditions, or hypoxic followed by normoxic conditions. Subjects will donate whole blood as an autologous unit at a preselected NHSBT donation site. The unit will transported back to the NNUH blood bank after a minimum of 30 days (maximum 35 days) after donation. Volunteers will be tested for baseline bloods. Volunteers will be randomised to normoxia or hypoxia. The will then undergo a nitrite infusion, followed by an autologous whole blood transfusion and a second nitrite infusion (which will co-infuse at the end of the transfusion). During the protocol, the participants will undergo repeated FBFR measurements using strain-gauge plethysmography. After a minimum of 12 weeks rest period after their initial donation, participants will cross-over to the opposite oxygen condition (as per initial randomization) and the above protocol will be repeated. All interventions will be performed by fully trained and competent medical staff.</detailed_description>

This would include any known clotting disorders. 2. Known allergy or intolerance to Nitrites 3. Known glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency 4. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential, defined as follows: postmenopausal females who have had at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with serum FSH&gt;40mIU/ml or females who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 weeks prior to enrolment 5. Receipt of an investigational drug or biological agent within the 4 weeks prior to study entry or 5 times the drug halflife, whichever is the longer 6. Predisposed to acute on chronic limb ischemia evident from a history of claudication or known peripheral arterial disease. 7. No past history of significant adverse events post blood donation</criteria>
