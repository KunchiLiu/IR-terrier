	<brief_summary>A prospective randomized control trial that will compare cervical cerclage plus vaginal progesterone to vaginal progesterone along in twin pregnancies complicate by a short cervix (&lt;/= 15.0mm) between 16w0d to 25w6d.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective Randomized Trial that will test whether treatment with cervical cerclage plus vaginal progesterone improves pregnancy outcomes among women with twin pregnancy at 16 0/7 to 25 6/7 weeks of gestation who have a cervical length (CL) of 0.1 to 15.0 mm on transvaginal ultrasound exam, the rate of preterm birth at less than 32 weeks of gestation (PTB&lt;32 wks.) and the rate of adverse perinatal outcome will be lower in those treated with cervical cerclage plus vaginal progesterone than in those treated with vaginal progesterone alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Twin pregnancy (see Exclusion Criterion (a) below re: monochorionic twins) Gestational age 16 0/7 to 25 6/7 weeks at time of enrollment by bestestimated age. Cervical length 0.1 to 15.0 mm on transvaginal ultrasound examination. (Cervical length is taken to mean the length of the closed portion of the cervical canal. Maternal age less than 18 years Monochorionic twins (such as monochorionicdiamniotic, monochorionicmonoamniotic, or conjoined twins) Rupture of membranes, either twin One or both twins has no cardiac activity One or both twins has known or suspected major malformation, aneuploidy, or polyhydramnios Maternal congenital uterine anomaly (such as bicornuate uterus, unicornuate uterus) Pregnancy started as triplets or higherorder multifetal gestation and then reduced to twins, either spontaneously or via procedure Symptomatic uterine contractions, 6 or more per hour Ongoing bleeding from uterus Patient declines to consider cerclage Patient declines treatment with vaginal progesterone Allergy to progesterone or peanuts (because the vaginal progesterone formulation used will be a capsule of micronized progesterone in peanut oil.) Cerclage is already in place Cerclage placement is judged to be technically impossible Patient has a history of poor followup or poor adherence to physician recommendations Patient is planning to relocate outside the local area before the end of pregnancy such that delivery records will be unavailable Patient does not give consent to participate in this trial.</criteria>
