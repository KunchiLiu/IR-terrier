	<brief_title>Post-Market, Long-Term Follow Up of Mobi-C® Cervical Disc for One and Two Level Treatment of Cervical Disc Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, consecutive cohort study. Subjects invited to participate in this study will have completed the Mobi-C IDE study (G050212). In this study, five hundred and seventy-five subjects were randomized to either the Mobi-C prosthesis or the control treatment - conventional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with anterior cervical plating. The study was randomized in a 2 to 1 ratio (two Mobi-C subjects for every one subject receiving ACDF with anterior cervical plate). The subject retention rate for Mobi-C subjects was 80.1% (1 level)-84.4% (2 level) at 7 years. As non-inferiority (1-level) and superiority (2-level) have been well established through 7 years, the design of this study will focus on the long-term outcomes of a cohort of the Mobi-C arm of the study and evaluate the durability of outcomes at 10 years. Study sites invited to participate will be those that enrolled at least 10 subjects, and also had the highest retention rates at 7 years (≥70%). All subjects at these sites will be contacted to participate in an additional 10 year follow up visit. It is estimated that up to 250 subjects will be enrolled at 9-12 study sites.</detailed_description>
