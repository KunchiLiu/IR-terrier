	<brief_summary>To prospectively assess the functional aspects of the the esophageal squamous epithelial barrier and correlate this with tissue inflammation and intercellular space dilation in patients who have successfully completed endoscopic therapy for Barrett's Esophagus related metaplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization of the Neo-squamous Epithelial Barrier</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will measure and correlate mucosal impedance (measured using a novel endoscopic mucosal impedance catheter), intercellular space as measured with transmission electron microscopy and tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 in patients undergoing surveillance following successful endoscopic therapy (defined as two negative endoscopic surveillance histology for intestinal metaplasia). Mucosal impedance will be measured by an endoscopic probe 1 cm above the gastroesophageal junction, 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and in the proximal esophagus in an area not exposed to the index therapeutic radiofrequency ablation. Research biopsies will also be obtained at these levels for measurement of tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 and intracellular space with transmission electron microscopy.</detailed_description>
