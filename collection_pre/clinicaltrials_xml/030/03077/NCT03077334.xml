	<brief_summary>The 18F-FDG-PET scan is currently being used for cancer diagnosis, staging, identifying hidden metastasis, and assessment of treatment responses in clinical oncology. Although there are important studies suggesting potential associations between PET-based parameters and oncologic outcomes, the calculation and official documentation of individual PET-based parameters might not be routine in clinical practice because these processes usually require time- and labor-consuming processes for the radiologists. In this study, the investigators prospectively determined clinical 18F-FDG-PET type according to degree of FDG-uptake in pancreatic cancer and compare oncologic outcomes between the types.</brief_summary>
