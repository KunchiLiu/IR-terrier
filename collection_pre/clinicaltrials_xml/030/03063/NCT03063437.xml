	<criteria>Adults 18 years or older at the time of enrollment. Able to provide signed and dated informed consent. Identified as VREpositive by a stool culture within last 7 days. Women of childbearing potential in sexual relationships with men must use an acceptable method of contraceptionÂ§ from 30 days prior to enrollment until 4 weeks after completing study treatment. Males must agree to avoid impregnation of women during and for four weeks after completing study treatment. Includes, but is not limited to, barrier with additional spermicidal foam or jelly, intrauterine device, hormonal contraception (started at least 30 days prior to study enrollment), intercourse with men who underwent vasectomy. Female patient who are pregnant, lactating or planning on becoming pregnant during study. Female patients of childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test, and be excluded from the study if positive. Inability (e.g. dysphagia) to or unwilling to swallow capsules. Active ARB or gastrointestinal infection at time of enrollment. Patient received antibiotics in the last 48 hours. Patients will be eligible to enroll if antibiotic therapy is discontinued for at minimum 48 hours prior to randomization. Requires continued antibiotic use or anticipates antibiotic use in the upcoming 4 weeks. Known or suspected toxic megacolon and/or known small bowel ileus. Major gastrointestinal surgery (e.g. significant bowel resection) within 3 months before enrollment. This does not include appendectomy or cholecystectomy. History of total colectomy or bariatric surgery. Admitted to or expected to an intensive care unit for medical reasons (not just boarding). Patients residing in a nursing home, longterm care facility or rehabilitation center may be enrolled. Concurrent intensive induction chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biological treatment for active malignancy. Patients on maintenance chemotherapy may be enrolled only after consultation with medical monitor. Unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements. Expected life expectancy &lt; 6 months Previous FMT or microbiomebased products at any time excluding this study. Patients with a history of severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid food allergy. Solid organ transplant recipients 90 days posttransplant or on active treatment for rejection. Neutropenia (500 neutrophils/mL) or other severe immunosuppression. AntiTNF will be permitted. Patients on monoclonal antibodies to B and T cells. glucocorticoids, antimetabolites (azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine, methotrexate), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) and mycophenolate mofetil may be enrolled only after consultation with the medical monitor. If at risk for CMV/EBV associated disease (at investigator's discretion, e.g. immunocompromised), negative IgG testing for cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). A condition that would jeopardize the safety or rights of the subject, would make it unlikely for the subject to complete the study, or would confound the results of the study.</criteria>
