	<brief_title>Comparison of the Effectiveness of Preemptive Paracetamol and Ibuprofen in Acute Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a type of surgery that causes moderate postoperative pain. Paracetamol and non-steroid anti-inflammatory analgesics plus opioids are the mainstay treatment options of the moderate postoperative pain. These drugs are the most common used analgesics to ameliorate this type of pain and to reduce the consumption of opioids and their side effects. Ibuprofen is a well-known anti-inflammatory drug and has been used as an oral formula for a long time. Few studies using its new intravenous formula had been conducted to evaluate its effectiveness for mixed type of surgeries . However, its intravenous formula has not been studied for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, this study will compare the effects of postoperative analgesic potencies of preemptive intravenous paracetamol and ibuprofen in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
