	<brief_summary>The investigator will examine the effect of a single dose of pyridostigmine, AchE inhibitor on insulin secretion in healthy subjects. Each subject will undergo an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) where IV glucose will be administered and the glucose excursion and insulin secretion response will be evaluated by measuring insulin and glucose at different time points. The test will be carried out twice, once without and once with the administration of a single dose of Pyridostigmine on two separate days. The investigator hypothesizes that inhibiting AChE will potentiate insulin secretion.</brief_summary>
