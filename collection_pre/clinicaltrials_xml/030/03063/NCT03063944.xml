	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 when given together with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that does not respond to treatment or is newly diagnosed and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 and decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STAT Inhibitor OPB-111077 and Decitabine in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia That Is Refractory or Newly Diagnosed and Ineligible for Intensive Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 (OPB-111077) in combination with decitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe any preliminary efficacy of OPB-111077 in combination with decitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). II. To measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and perform metabolomics in patients with AML who are receiving OPB-111077 and decitabine. III. To assess apoptosis and proliferation assays in patients with AML who are receiving OPB-111077 and decitabine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologic evidence of high risk acute myeloid leukemia defined as one of the following: Primary refractory nonM3 AML ** Evidence of leukemia after any therapy which, in the opinion of the investigator, would be appropriate for therapy with OPB111077 and decitabine Newly diagnosed nonM3 AML not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less Subjects must have a life expectancy of at least 4 weeks Subjects must be able to consume oral medication Subjects must have recovered from the toxic effects of any prior chemotherapy to &lt; grade 1 (except alopecia) Creatinine =&lt; 2.0mg/dL Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2 x ULN Negative pregnancy test for women with childbearing potential Patients must be able to sign consent and be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and laboratory testing Subjects with FAB M3 (t(15;17)(q22;q21)[PMLRARalpha]) are not eligible Subjects must not be receiving any chemotherapy agents (except hydroxyurea); intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine are permissible Subjects must not be receiving growth factors, except for erythropoietin Subjects with a "currently active" second malignancy, other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, resected incidental prostate cancer (staged pT2 with Gleason score =&lt; 6 and postoperative prostatespecific antigen [PSA] &lt; 0.5 ng/mL), or other adequately treated carcinomainsitu are ineligible; patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed therapy and are free of disease for &gt;= 1 year Subjects with uncontrolled high blood pressure, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 3), myocardial infarction within the past 6 months or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia are not eligible Subjects with other severe concurrent disease which in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study are ineligible Subjects must not have evidence of active leukemia in the central nervous system (CNS) Subjects must not have received any investigational agents within 30 days of study entry Subjects must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnancy tests must be obtained for all females of childbearing potential; pregnant or lactating patients are ineligible for this study; males or women of childbearing potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method (defined as hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, surgical contraceptives, or condoms) Subjects who have uncontrolled infection are not eligible; patients must have any active infections under control; fungal disease must be stable for at least 2 weeks before study entry Subjects with bacteremia must have documented negative blood cultures prior to study entry</criteria>
