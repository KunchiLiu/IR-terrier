	<brief_summary>Currently there are no existing data to determine why some achalasia patients lose weight while others do not. The purpose of this study is to gather data from patients diagnosed with achalasia to determine if differences may be identified between those who lose weight and those who do not that would help us better understand the mechanism of weight loss in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Weight Loss in Patients Diagnosed With Achalasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients either diagnosed with or being evaluated for achalasia and scheduled for standard clinic visits with the principal investigator as part of their routine care will be considered for participation in this study. Blood work, vital signs, and 24-hour dietary recall will be collected over a period of one year. These data will lay the foundation for future scientific endeavors to : a) assess requirements for dietary and/or nutritional supplements; b) formulate an achalasia diet; c) develop clinical practice standards; and d) design an intervention study.</detailed_description>
