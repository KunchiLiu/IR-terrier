	<brief_title>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion in PEEK Oblique Cages With and Without Titanium Coating</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cages made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials reliably produce successful fusion rates and good clinical outcomes. However, there is a paucity of studies that have assessed the optimal material of cage systems. The primary objective of this study was to compare the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) after instrumented transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) using either titanium-coated polyetheretherketone (TiPEEK) or common PEEK cages. Secondary objectives were to assess differences in fusion rates and differences in pain and in quality of life between these groups.</detailed_description>
