	<brief_summary>Recently,surprisingly and unexpectedly increased aggressiveness and high rates of HCC recurrence (28%(16/58) and 29%(17/59), respectively) have been reported in patients who cleared HCV with DAAs after achieving a complete response to resection or local ablation within only 6 months of therapy. The authors hypothesized that the rapid eradication of HCV and control of liver inflammation would impact anti-tumoral immune control, which in turn might contribute to the neoplastic cells proliferation. Conversely, three independent prospective French cohorts failed to reveal an increased risk of HCC recurrence after DAAs treatment in CHC patients after receiving curative cancer treatments.Although the impact of DAAs treatment on the rate of HCC occurrence or recurrence still remain unclear, it would be more important to pay attention to the immunological changes of CHC patients treated with DAAs.Up to now, little was known about the immunological changes of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), here we try to explore the effect of antiviral treatment of CHC patients with DAAs on the frequency of monocytes, NK cells and cytokines that promote their activation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Changes of Monocytes and NK Cells of CHC Patient Treated by DAAs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>15 treatment-naive CHC patients and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Patients were examined before DAAs therapy (0w) and at weeks 4 (4w) and weeks 12 (12w) of the therapy. The percentage of monocytes,NK cells of the peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum cytokines IL-12, IL-18, CXCL10, CXCL11, sCD14 and sCD163 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.</detailed_description>
