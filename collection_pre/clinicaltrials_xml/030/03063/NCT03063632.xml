	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b work in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and sezary syndrome that has come back or has not responded to previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Interferon gamma-1b may boost the immune system activity. Giving pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b together may work better in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and sezary syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Interferon Gamma-1b in Treating Patients With Stage IB-IVB Relapsed or Refractory Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and interferon gamma-1b (IFN-G) (Actimmune) combination immunotherapy in subjects with previously treated mycosis fungoides (MF) or sezary syndrome (SS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to safety and tolerability. II. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to time to response (TTR). III. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to duration of response (DOR). IV. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to progression-free survival (PFS). V. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to event-free survival (EFS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the relationship between the following putative biomarkers for combination immunotherapy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-gamma (Actimmune) and clinical outcomes (as measured by safety/tolerability and ORR, DOR, PFS, EFS) in subjects with previously treated MF/SS, including tumor/microenvironment (PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 expression, cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL]s, regulatory T cell [Treg]s, macrophages, dendritic cell [DC]s; nanostring gene expression profile), systemic immune response (flow cytometry, mass cytometry [CyTOF], Luminex multiplexed cytokine profile), and molecular/genomic immune correlates (exome sequencing, high throughput sequencing [HTS] for T cell receptor [TCR]). OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. Patients also receive interferon gamma-1b subcutaneously (SC) 3 times per week for 12 weeks, and then follow 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off schedule for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are follow up for 30 days and then every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
