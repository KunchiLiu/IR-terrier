	<brief_summary>A 3-period randomized cross-over, controlled feeding study will be conducted to determine the effect of chronic spice consumption on postprandial vascular function. Participants will consume three test diets containing different amounts of spice. Each treatment period will last for 4 weeks. After each diet period a meal test will be conducted. Participants will consume a meal with a spice content corresponding to the diet period they have just completed. Endothelial function will be measured at 2 and 4 hours after meal consumption. Blood samples will also be taken during the 4 hours after meal consumption for measurement of lipids, immune and inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A 3-period randomized cross-over, controlled feeding study will be conducted to determine the effect of chronic spice consumption on postprandial vascular function, lipid levels, immune and inflammatory markers. Participants will consume three test diets containing different amounts of spice. Each treatment period will last for 4 weeks. At baseline and after each diet period a postprandial test will be conducted. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) will conducted in the fasting state and a catheter will be inserted for blood sampling. Participants will consume a control test meal containing low spice at baseline and after each diet period the test meal will contain a level of spice that corresponds to the amount of spice consumed during the diet period. Blood samples will be taken at 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after meal consumption, and FMD will be performed at 120 and 240 minutes.</detailed_description>
