	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a frequent procedure in the patients with advanced liver disease. It requires variable degree of sedation ranging from minimal sedation to general anesthesia aiming for relieving pain, anxiety, and bad memories of the procedure. In conscious sedation, patients are able to make purposeful responses to auditory and tactile clues, with maintenance of ventilatory and circulatory stability. while, in deep sedation, patients respond only to painful stimuli, and airway support is frequently required. At the level of general anesthesia, patients are unresponsive, and airway support is mandatory.</brief_summary>
