	<brief_summary>It is planned to evaluate if a porcine collagen matrix (Mucograft Seal) is offering comparable results to free gingival grafts (FGG) in post-extraction tissue preservation. If so, this would provide a substantial benefit to the patient as the second intervention on the palate and the subsequent morbidity of the donor site is omitted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof of Concept: Socket Seal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a proof of concept 5 groups are compared in preserving soft- and hard tissue after tooth extraction in the esthetic zone: 1. Mucograft® Seal + Bio-Oss® 2. Free Gingival Graft (FGG) + Bio-Oss® 3. Free Gingival Graft + Gelatine sponge (Spongostan®) 4. Spongostan®+ Mucograft® Seal 5. Spongostan® Volumetric changes of hard and soft tissues are recorded , 2/4/8 weeks and 3/6/12 months after extraction.</detailed_description>
