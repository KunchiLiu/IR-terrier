	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sotagliflozin and its metabolite in healthy male and female subjects. Secondary Objectives: - To assess total 24-hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after a dose of sotagliflozin 400 mg, alone and with rifampicin, in healthy male and female subjects. - To assess the safety and tolerability of single dose sotagliflozin with and without rifampicin in healthy male and female subjects.</brief_summary>
