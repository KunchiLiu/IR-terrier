	<brief_summary>Overtraining is a real problem for (semi-)professional athletes. Overtraining is often caused by the bodies' lack of ability to recover between training. In addition, during high intensity training reactive oxygen species are formed up to 20 fold compared to resting values. This causes increased muscle tissue damage after intense exercise, which slows down recovery. Improving recovery may increase an athlete's ability to reach higher training volumes resulting in establishing a higher performance plateau. It is known that hydrolyzed proteins have a positive effect on muscle protein synthesis due to its faster absorption rate. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a known protein hydrolysate may have positive effects on strength recovery.</brief_summary>
