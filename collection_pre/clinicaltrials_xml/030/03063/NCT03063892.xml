	<brief_summary>Tranexamic Acid (TXA) is an antifibrolytic medication used in total hip and knee arthroplasty to reduce the need for intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusions. Limited research is available on its use in hip fracture patients. We hypothesize that the use of TXA preoperatively, perioperatively, and postoperatively will decrease blood loss and need for blood transfusion postoperatively.</brief_summary>
