	<brief_title>ReNu™ Injection to Treat Hip Osteoarthritis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-randomized pilot study evaluating the efficacy of ReNu™ hip injection on patients with moderate osteoarthritis.

	<criteria>Patients with moderate hip osteoarthritis determined by a combination of clinical and radiographic findings Radiographic findings consistent with osteoarthritis as documented by Tonnis radiographic classification (Grade 1 or 2) Grade 1 Tonnis changes are defined as mild and include increased sclerosis, slight narrowing of the joint space, no or slight loss of head sphericity Grade 2 Tonnis changes are defined as moderate and include small cysts, moderate narrowing of the joint space, moderate loss of head sphericity Patients with bilateral grade 1or 2 Tonnis hip osteoarthritis who have bilateral symptoms may have their more symptomatic hip injected. If equivalent symptoms are reported by the patient, then the patient will choose which hip is to be injected. The other Hip can be treated with all standard local interventions that will not have a prolonged systemic effect that could affect the study hip (for example steroid injection, cold therapy, soft braces). Between the Ages 18 to 70 with minimum activity level of 2 on the Tegner scale. BMI less than 40 Female patients must be actively practicing a contraception method, abstinence, be surgically sterilized, or be postmenopausal Pain medication (including NSAIDs) less than 15 days before injection (may take acetaminophen) Receiving pain medication other than acetaminophen for conditions unrelated to osteoarthritis of the index hip Regular use of anticoagulants, such as Coumadin, dabigatran or rivaroxaban; use of antiplatelet medications are not a reason for exclusion History of substance abuse. Failure to agree NOT to take additional hip symptom modifying drugs, other than acetaminophen, during the course of the study without reporting to the study team Pregnancy or desire to become pregnant during study duration Corticosteroid injection into the index hip within 6 months Viscosupplement injection into the index hip within 6 months Previous open or arthroscopic hip surgery of the involved index hip within the previous 6 months Open or arthroscopic surgery of the contralateral hip within the last 6 months Worker compensation Acute index hip injury (injury within 3 months) History of Diabetes mellitus History of solid organ or hematologic transplantation History of rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorder Diagnosis of a nonbasal cell malignancy within the preceding 5 years Infection requiring antibiotic treatment within the preceding 3 months Current therapy with any immunosuppressive medication, including corticosteroids at a dose &gt; 5 mg per day</criteria>
