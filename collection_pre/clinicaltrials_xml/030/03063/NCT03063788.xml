	<brief_title>Imaging the HIV Reservoir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to develop a method to accurately image the size and location of HIV persistence in HIV-infected individuals. The project aims to combine the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibody 3BNC117 with a Copper-64 radio isotope for use in a clinical trial. The clinical trial has three different stages. The first stage is to recruit two HIV uninfected individuals and determine the safety of 3 mg/kg of 3BNC117 combined with Copper-64 and MRI/PET scanning at 1, 24 and 48 hours post infusion. The second stage is to examine the distribution on MRI/PET of the 3BNC117-Copper-64 combination in four HIV-infected individuals with viremia who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy. The final stage is to perform the same intervention in aviremic people with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy.</detailed_description>
