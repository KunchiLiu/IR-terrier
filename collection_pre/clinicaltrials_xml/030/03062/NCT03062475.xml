	<brief_summary>Gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM) is a commom complication during pregnancy and associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and her offspring. Imoportantly, with the gradual opening of a two-child policy, more and more Chinese women of reproductive age enter pregnancy have a history of GDM. Our previous study showed that regular exercise commenced in early pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk of developing GDM in Chinese overweight and obese pregant women. Thus, in this study, we want to evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention with detailed information on how to eat and how to diet in preventing the recurrence of GDM.</brief_summary>

GDM history is one of the risk factors. Imoportantly, with the gradual opening of a two-child policy, more and more Chinese women of reproductive age enter pregnancy have a history of GDM. Our previous study showed that regular exercise commenced in early pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk of developing GDM in Chinese overweight and obese pregant women.
