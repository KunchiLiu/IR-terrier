	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and multifactorial autoimmune disease. The biological treatments that are currently available for the treatment of RA are the TNF-alpha inhibitors. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. The anti-TNFs were the first to enter the market, and they revolutionised the prognoses of patients with RA. They remain the most common first-line biotherapy and are the most used at this time. The French Society of Rheumatologists intends to coordinate a prospective national registry study for this follow-up. This registry will include 1500 RA patients from the start of treatment with anti-TNF-Î± and then followed for 5 years, regardless of the therapeutic modifications occurring thereafter. This registry is an observational, multicentre, longitudinal, prospective registry study The objectives of this registry is to contribute 1) to evaluate the therapeutic management of patients; and 2) to improve this therapeutic management.</brief_summary>
