	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of a yeast-selenium supplement (AT-001) is safe in elderly subjects who do not have dementia, and further, to see if the supplement improves tests that are related to brain health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Double blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study. Approximately 40 healthy volunteers will be randomized to the study drug and 20 healthy volunteers randomized to the placebo, for a total of 60 enrolled participants. All participants will be treated with the study drug or placebo for 12 months. Subjects will be seen in the clinic for the following visits: Screening (Day -14), Baseline (Day 0), Month 6, and End-of-Study (Month 12) while on study drug. An additional safety visit at Month 13 (four weeks after study drug discontinuation) will be required of all participants. Participants will undergo vital signs assessment, medical history review, medication list review, and review of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) at each visit. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing and routine physical examinations at the screening, baseline, and end-of-study visits. Participants will undergo blood draws, urine collection, MRI to assess lumbar puncture safety, and lumbar puncture at the baseline and end-of-study visits.</detailed_description>

Stable medical condition for 3 months prior to screening visit in the opinion of the study physician. Nondiabetic, confirmed by fasting serum glucose &lt;120 mg/dL and on no oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin treatment. No other clinically significant abnormalities on labs (CBC, chemistry panel, PT/INR, aPTT, urinalysis). Stable medications for 4 weeks prior to screening. Able to ingest oral medications.

Contraindications to lumbar puncture (bleeding disorder, platelet count &lt;100,000, anticoagulant treatment, major structural abnormality or sepsis in the area of the lumbosacral spine, or previous lower back surgery that would make LP technically difficult in the opinion of the study physician, hypersensitivity to lidocaine).
