	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term visual outcome of the cataract surgery using a large-scale and comprehensive database of high myopic cataract and age-related cataract patients. The investigators will further investigate into the various genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of high myopic cataract.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High myopic cataract (HMC) has become a major high-risky type of cataract in China, which accounts for nearly 30% of cataract in recent years. Compared to age-related cataract, HMC is characterized with earlier onset, severer lens opacities, higher incidence of vitreoretinopathy and postoperative complications compared to age-related cataract(ARC). The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term visual outcome of the cataract surgery using a large-scale and comprehensive database of high myopic cataract, when compared to those age-matched ARC patients. On the other hand, due to the lack of research in the pathogenesis of HMC, it is difficult for the investigators to precisely evaluate its risk and prognosis, and to improve its prevention and treatment. The previous study of investigators majored in a large-sample analysis on the clinical features and related genes of HMC. After preliminary screening, eight genes were selected for further investigation: 1) genes related to pathogenesis of HMC: CRYAA/ GSTP1/ TXNRD2;2) genes related to vitreoretinopathy: MCP1/ VEGFA/ CFH; 3) genes related to postoperative complications: TGFB2/ CERS2. In the present study, in order to establish a risk model of HMC from the aspect of precision medicine, the investigators are preparing to set up a comprehensive clinical database for further sequencing of selected genes (including exons, promoters, 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences) on a large scale, to intensively investigate into the sites and functions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) correlated with clinical features of HMC. The research aim to evaluate the long-term visual outcome of the cataract surgery using a large-scale and comprehensive database of high myopic cataract, to thoroughly illustrate the influence of HMC-related genes to its prognosis and to elucidate the pathogenesis of HMC, for further promotion in the disease prevention and prognosis as well.</detailed_description>
