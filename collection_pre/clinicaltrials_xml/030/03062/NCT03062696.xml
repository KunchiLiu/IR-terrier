	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Rumination Disorder (CBT-RD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rumination disorder (RD; also known as "rumination syndrome") is characterized by the repeated regurgitation of food during or soon after eating, which typically occurs at least a few times per week, frequently daily, with subsequent re-chewing, re-swallowing, or spitting out of the regurgitated material. Diaphragmatic breathing is a widely used technique for rumination as a competing response to the abdominal wall contraction hypothesized to trigger regurgitation. However, the efficacy of diaphragmatic breathing remains unknown and has mainly been delivered simply through a one-session instruction with an occasional follow-up. In the absence of evidence-based treatments for RD, Dr. Jennifer Thomas has contributed to the creation of a manualized treatment, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Rumination Disorder (CBT-RD) informed by published case reports and currently in use at the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program (EDCRP) at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Psychological Services Center at Drexel University. CBT-RD targets the habitual contraction of the abdominal wall and preceding events through the use of habit reversal, using primarily diaphragmatic breathing as a competing response. This study involves a phone screen to determine eligibility, followed by 5-8 sessions of CBT-RD (approximately 50 minutes each). A battery of questionnaires will be administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up intervals.</detailed_description>
