	<brief_summary>This protocol describes a perspective,multicenter study intended to test the hypothesis that patients with STEMI caused by plaque rupture or plaque erosion without obstructive stenosis (diameter stenosis &lt;70%) can be stabilized by effective antithrombotic treatment without stent implantation, thereby avoiding both early and late complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with STEMI within 12 hours will be included for screening. Thrombus aspiration will be performed in patients with large thrombus burden and TIMI flow grade less than 2 to restore blood flow. OCT will be used to assess the underlying mechanism including plaque rupture, erosion, calcified nodule, and other uncommon reasons.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men or nonpregnant women &gt;18 years of age and &lt; 75 years of age Patients undergo cardiac catheterization for STEMI. STEMI will be defined as continuous chest pain for &gt;30 minutes, arrival at the hospital within 12 hours from chest pain onset, STsegment elevation &gt;0.1 mV in at least two contiguous leads, or new left bundlebranch block on the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and elevated cardiac markers (troponin T/I or creatine kinaseMB). Culprit lesion located in a native coronary artery TIMI flow grade 3 and diameter stenosis &lt; 70% on angiogram and MLA＞1.9mm2； Definite erosion and rupture defined by OCT Patients able to provide written informed consent Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30%. Lesions on LM, ostial LAD. Long lesions, circuity lesion and angulation lesions more than 2 severe lesions Massive residual thrombosis after the thrombus aspiration. With the history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), acute pulmonary edema and cardiac shock on the attacks. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year. Contraindication to the contrast media. Creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or endstage kidney disease. Serious liver dysfunction. Patients with hemodynamic or electrical instability (including shock). Any contraindication against the use of ticagrelor. Investigator considers the patient is not suitable.</criteria>
