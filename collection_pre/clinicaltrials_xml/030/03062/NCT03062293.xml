	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate if six-weeks of exercise intervention, 3 times per week on the Functional Re-adaptive Exercise Device (FRED) reduces non-specific mechanical low back pain in adults ages 18-60.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Newcastle Low Back Pain Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to investigate whether an six-week FRED exercise intervention reduces low back pain (LBP) and improves a range of related outcomes. The objectives of this study are to examine 1. whether FRED exercise reduces mechanical LBP ( low back pain); 2. whether FRED exercise improves functional and static balance in people with LBP; 3. whether FRED exercise has an effect on cross-sectional area (CSA) of relevant lumbo-pelvic muscles; 4. whether FRED exercise has an effect on TrA (Transversus Abdominis), LM ( Lumbar Multifidus), lumbar Erector Spinae, External and Internal Oblique muscle activity and function in individuals with LBP; 5. whether FRED exercise has an effect on TrA and internal oblique muscle thickness; 6. the rate of muscle physiology change in response to FRED exercise in people with LBP; 7. whether FRED exercise affects the analgesic intake, need for intervention and physical activity level of individuals with LBP; 8. whether FRED exercise affects wellbeing and every-day function in people with LBP; 9. the rate of change of level of pain, wellbeing and of function (incl. balance) in response to FRED exercise in people with LBP.</detailed_description>
