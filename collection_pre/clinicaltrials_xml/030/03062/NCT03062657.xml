	<brief_summary>This clinical study will assess the metal concentrations present in the blood serum of patients who receive surgical treatment with the PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc at two contiguous cervical levels from C3-C7. The information obtained from this clinical investigation will be used to support the post market surveillance for a PMA supplement for the PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc implanted at two contiguous levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study: 1. Has cervical degenerative disc disease at two (2) contiguous cervical levels (from C3 to C7) requiring surgical treatment and involving intractable radiculopathy, myelopathy or both; 2. Has a herniated disc and/or osteophyte formation at each level to be treated that is producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord compression. The condition is documented by patient history (e.g., neck and/or arm pain, functional deficit and /or neurological deficit), and the requirement for surgical treatment is evidenced by radiographic studies (e.g., CT, MRI, xrays, etc.); 3. Has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment for at least six weeks or has the presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord compression in the face of continued nonoperative therapy; 4. Has no previous surgical intervention at the involved levels or any other planned/staged surgical procedure at the involved levels or contiguous levels; 5. Has preoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI) score ≥ 30; 6. Has preoperative neck pain score ≥ 8 based on the preoperative Neck and Arm Pain Questionnaire; 7. Must be at least 18 years of age and be skeletally mature at the time of surgery; 8. If a female of childbearing potential, patient is nonpregnant, nonnursing, and agrees not to become pregnant during the study period; 9. Is willing to comply with the study plan and sign the Patient Informed Consent Form. A patient will be excluded from participating in this study for any of the following reasons: 1. Has a cervical spine condition other than symptomatic cervical degenerative disease requiring surgical treatment at the involved levels; 2. Has documented or diagnosed cervical instability relative to contiguous segments at either level, defined by dynamic (flexion/extension) radiographs showing: 1. Sagittal plane translation &gt; 3.5 mm, or 2. Sagittal plane angulation &gt; 20° 3. Has more than two cervical levels requiring surgical treatment; 4. Has a fused level contiguous to the levels to be treated; 5. Has severe pathology of the facet joints of the involved vertebral bodies; 6. Has had previous surgical intervention at either one or both of the involved levels or adjacent levels; 7. Has been previously diagnosed with osteopenia or osteomalacia; 8. Has any of the following that may be associated with a diagnosis of osteoporosis (If "Yes" to any of the below risk factors, a DEXA Scan will be required to determine eligibility.): 1. . Postmenopausal nonBlack female over 60 years of age who weighs less than 140 pounds. 2. Postmenopausal female who has sustained a nontraumatic hip, spine or wrist fracture. 3. Male over the age of 70. 4. Male over the age of 60 who has sustained a nontraumatic hip or spine fracture. If the level of BMD is a T score of 3.5 or lower (i.e., 3.6, 3.7, etc.) or a T score of 2.5 or lower (i.e., 2.6, 2.7 etc.) with vertebral crush fracture, then the patient is excluded from the study 9. Has presence of spinal metastases; 10. Has overt or active bacterial infection, either local or systemic; 11. Has insulin dependent diabetes; 12. Is a tobacco user who does not agree to suspend smoking prior to surgery; 13. Has chronic or acute renal failure or prior history of renal disease; 14. Has a documented allergy or intolerance to titanium, or a titanium alloy; 15. Is mentally incompetent. (If questionable, obtain psychiatric consult); 16. Is a prisoner; 17. Is pregnant; 18. Is an alcohol and/or drug abuser as defined by currently undergoing treatment for alcohol and /or drug abuse; 19. Is involved with current or pending litigation regarding a spinal condition; 20. Has received drugs that may interfere with bone metabolism within two weeks prior to the planned date of spinal surgery (e.g., steroids or methotrexate), excluding routine perioperative antiinflammatory drugs; 21. Has history of an endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g., Paget's Disease, renal osteodystrophy, EhlersDanlos Syndrome, or osteogenesis imperfecta); 22. Has a condition that requires postoperative medications that interfere with the stability of the implant, such as steroids. (This does not include lowdose aspirin for prophylactic anticoagulation and routine perioperative antiinflammatory drugs.); 23. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following implantation. 24. Has had a procedure requiring the use of permanent metal implants [i.e., stents, joint replacement, and/or dental implants (does not include fillings, crowns, or braces)]; 25. Is currently taking or has had chronic usage of certain prescription medications (e.g., Cloxacillin, an antibiotic used for prophylaxis against surgical infections, and/or Clotrimazole). 26. Is currently working in a profession with increased exposure to metal particles (i.e., jewelry making, construction, iron working, metal grinding, welding, mining etc.). 27. Is currently receiving B12 injections and/or taking nutritional supplements and/or vitamins containing titanium, vanadium, and aluminum based ingredients.</criteria>
