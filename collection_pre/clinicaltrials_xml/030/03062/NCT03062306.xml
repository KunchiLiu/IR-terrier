	<brief_summary>In recent years, monitorizations during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) are inadequate to show the sufficiency of cerebral oxygenation. During CPR, insufficient chest compressions have critical importance for neurological results and life quality after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chest Compression and Cerebral Oxygenation During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), which is used in measuring the cerebral tissue oxygenation is one of the latest technologies that allow the measurement of brain oxygen saturation. With this study, the issue of whether sufficient cerebral oxygenation is provided during CPR applied to patients that have Cardiac Arrest (CA) will be investigated, and the effect of CPR on the patient prognosis after ROSC will be examined. In this study, the aim is to investigate whether sufficient oxygenation is provided in synchronization with chest compressions during CPR; and to test the regional brain tissue saturation with rSO2 measurement, and the prognosis with Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) Score in patients with ROSC.</detailed_description>
