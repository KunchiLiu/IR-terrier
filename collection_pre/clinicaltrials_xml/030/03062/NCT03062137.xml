	<brief_title>Finding the Optimal Location for Saturation Measurement During Flexible Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study group will include 100 patients undergoing flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). The patients will receive sedation with Midazolam, Fentanyl and Propofol. All patients will receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (2-4 L/min) before the beginning of the procedure. In all cases, patients will be monitored using continuous electrocardiography, pulse oximetry (on patients finger), and transcutaneous carbon dioxide and saturation (on patients earlobe), and automated noninvasive blood pressure recordings every 5 minutes. All parameters will be recorded from accepting patient to bed of procedure until 10 minutes after removal of FFB from nasopharynx. The saturation will be measured in 3 different locations (one pulse is added in other earlobe). additionally, A blood gas sample will be taken during discrepancy between different measurements. Immediately after the end of procedure, the measurements from 3 different monitors will be printed, and the blood sample be taken to a gas sample machine by the investigator. Desaturation value and time will be compared between the different locations. The blood arterial saturation will be compared to other measurements taken at the same time.</detailed_description>
