	<brief_title>Effect of Glycemic Index on Physical Capacity in Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of glycemic index of pre-exercise meal on endurance capacity and performance has been widely investigated. However, little is known about the adaptations to longer dietary interventions with different glycemic index and their influence on aerobic capacity and body composition in runners. Therefore, the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of low GI vs moderate GI of a 3-week diet on aerobic capacity, endurance performance and body mass and composition in endurance-trained athletes in a randomised, controlled crossover trial.</detailed_description>
