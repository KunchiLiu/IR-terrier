	<brief_summary>This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tacrolimus combined with entecavir antiviral therapy for HBV-associated glomerulonephritis in china. Tacrolimus combined with entecavir rapidly and effectively induced remission of HBV-GN in Chinese adults. Meanwhile, Tacrolimus may have a synergistic antiviral effect with entecavir. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by Guangdong General Hospital's Ethic Committee, and all participants provided written informed consents. The study will be a prospective, randomized,controlled,single-blind, multi-centre, withdrawal study conducted by Guangdong general hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences.there will be two phases, phase 1, Screening and enrolling 112 HBV-GN patients about one year,and phase 2, ongoing follow-up for 24 weeks.The data of all patients will be recorded in the HBV-GN electronic database.Before the randomisation, All patients will receive entecavir routine antiviral therapy for two weeks.And then they will be randomized to two different group,the treatment group: Tacrolimus combined with entecavir antiviral therapy,the control group: The Tacrolimus placebo and entecavir antiviral therapy. The Tacrolimus target trough concentration was 5-10 ng/mL during the therapy. The primary outcome variables were the number of patients who reached complete or partial remission (CR or PR) after the 25 week-treatment. CR was deﬁned as &lt;0.3 g/24 h proteinuria (UPCR&lt;300mg/g.cr) or lower plus stable renal function (eGFR&gt;50 ml/min/1.73 m2) and PR as proteinuria 0.3-3.0 g/24 h (UPCR 300-3000mg/g.cr) and 50% lower than baseline proteinuria plus stable renal function. Secondary outcome variables: 1) The number of patients who reached complete or partial remission (CR or PR) after the 13 week-treatment. 2) Serum creatinine (SCr) increased 2 times the baseline levels or 50% lower than the baseline eGFR(according to chronic kidney disease-EPI (CKD-EPI) )after the 25 week-treatment. 3)Serum HBV DNA was undetectable(HBV DNA&lt;500copies/ml) at the end of 25 week-treatment. 4) The number of patients who present acute kidney injury at the end of 25 week-treatment.</brief_summary>
