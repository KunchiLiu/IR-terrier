	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, acute and long term effectiveness, during standard RF ablation procedures while using Ablation Index and VISITAG™ software in combination with a Thermocool SmartTouch® (ST) or SmartTouch Surroundflow® (STSF) catheter. Furthermore, the role of Ablation Index and VISITAG™ workflow in creating contiguous ablation lines is assessed. The study is a prospective, non-randomized, post-market clinical evaluation. Up to 330 patients will be included in this study. All patients who qualify based on the study specific requirements will be invited to participate. The total duration of the study is estimated to be about 24 months (12 months enrollment period and 12 months of follow up). The clinical investigation population include subjects undergoing RF ablation for treatment of drug resistant symptomatic paroxysmal AF. Prior to enrollment in the clinical investigation, all subjects must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are suitable candidates for enrollment in a clinical investigation in the opinion of the investigator. Subjects must have failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) (Type I or III, including β-blocker) as evidenced by recurrent or are intolerant of the AAD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Symptomatic paroxysmal AF who had at least one AF episode electrocardiographically documented within one (1) year prior to enrollment. Documentation may include electrocardiogram (ECG); Transtelephonic monitoring (TTM), holter monitor or telemetry strip 2. Failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) (Type I or III, including βblocker) as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic AF, or intolerance to the AAD 3. Age 18 years or older 4. Signed Patient Informed Consent Form (ICF) 5. Able and willing to comply with all pre, post, and followup testing and requirements 1. Atrial fibrillation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or reversible or noncardiac cause. 2. Previous LA ablation or surgery 3. Anticipated to receive ablation outside the PV ostia and CTI region 4. Previously diagnosed with persistent AF (&gt; 7 days in duration) 5. LA size &gt;50 mm 6. LA thrombus 7. LVEF &lt; 40% 8. Uncontrolled heart failure or NYHA Class III or IV 9. History of blood clotting, bleeding abnormalities or contraindication to anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin, or dabigatran) 10. History of a documented thromboembolic event (including TIA) within the past 6 months 11. Previous PCI/MI within the past 3 months 12. Previous cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG) within the past 6 months 13. Previous valvular cardiac surgical/percutaneous procedure (e.g. ventriculotomy, atriomy, valve repair or replacement, presence of a prosthetic valve) 14. Unstable angina pectoris 15. Awaiting cardiac transplantation, cardiac surgery or other major surgery within the next 12 months. 16. Significant pulmonary disease (e.g., restrictive pulmonary disease, constrictive or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or any other disease or malfunction of the lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms 17. Acute illness, active systemic infection or sepsis 18. Presence of intracardiac thrombus, myxoma, tumor, interatrial baffle or patch or other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation. 19. Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access 20. Significant congenital anomaly or a medical problem that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude enrollment in this trial 21. Current enrollment in an investigational study evaluating another device or drug. 22. Women who are pregnant (as evidenced by pregnancy test if premenopausal) 23. Life expectancy less than 12 months 24. Presenting contraindications for the devices used in the study, as indicated in the respective Instructions For Use</criteria>
